Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : LOVE 'S REPLY . from Poems ( 1846 ) I 'll tell you something chanced to me , ( A quaint and simple story , ) Before I cross 'd , with dreaming heart Old ocean 's gloom and glory . Around me came three graceful girls , Their farewell whisper breathing ,  --  Julie ,  --  with light and lovely curls , Her snowy shoulders wreathing ; And proud Georgine ,  --  with stately mien , And glance of calm hauteur , Who moves  --  a Grace ,  --  and looks  --  a queen , All passionless and pure ; And Kate , whose low , melodious tone Is tuned by Truth and Feeling , Whose shy yet wistful eyes talk on , When fear her lips is sealing . " From what far country shall I write ? " I ask 'd , with pride elated , " From what rare monument of art Shall be my letters dated ? " Julie toss 'd back her locks of light , With girlish grace and glee ,  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea ! " " And thou , Georgine ? " Her dark eyes flash 'd ,  --  " Ah ! date to me your lines From some proud palace , where the pomp Of olden Honor shines ! " But Kate ,  --  the darling of my soul , My bright , yet bashful flower , In whose dear heart some new , pure leaf , Seems to unfold each hour ,  --  Kate turn 'd her shy , sweet looks from mine , Lest I her blush should see , And said  --  so only Love could hear  --  " Write from your heart to me !

I hear no voice come o'er the tide ; I see no form the helm beside ; And it might seem a moment 's toy , But that they wear no smile of joy , And fondly watch its snowy wing , As if it were a holy thing :  --  Why send they forth their boat to be A plaything for the reckless sea ? " " Oh , stranger ! calm or wild the tide , Their light canoe will safely glide , And all unscathed by tempest-shock , By coral-reef or roughest rock , Ere morn , its white sail will be furl 'd Forever in the spirit-world . A viewless hand that bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing so holy and so fair , Serene and safe , is smiling there , That fiercest winds before it falter , And into harmless zephyrs alter . Ah ! well may they the wanderer mark ; For know ,  --  within that blessed bark , The spirit of a little child Is playing on the waters wild ! Behold our chieftain 's burial-ground ! We raised to-day another mound . Behold its lone and hallow 'd tree ! So graceful and so fair was she . But look !  --  the boat is seen no more ; The mourning train have left the shore ; And , hark ! those accents sad and wild ! Our island chief laments his child .

A SCOTCH SONG . from Poems ( 1846 ) A gowden cage Earl Albert had , A peerless bird he kept within it ; A bird o ' beauty rare and glad , But ' t was na robin , finch , or linnet . Earl Albert hung his cage wi ' flowers , Wi ' gems and silken gauds he deck 'd it , And siller locks upon the doors  --  " ' T would fly , " said he , " I maun protect it !

FROM THE SPANISH . from Poems ( 1846 ) A lady in a light caique , Abdallah 's youngest daughter , With Love 's blush-rose upon her cheek , Look 'd o'er the moonlit water .

Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : HAPPINESS LOST AND FOUND . from Poems ( 1846 ) Our cot was in a forest glade , Where sunbeams stole to mock the shade , And wild-flowers round the lattice play 'd , By beam and breeze caress 'd : And in our Mary 's form and face Was all the blossom 's glowing grace ; A lovely human flower was she ; Nay , more a bird in tireless glee , The darling of the nest ! She came an orphan to our wild ; But fondly on her kinsman 's child My mother her true welcome smiled , And so our home was blest . Yet I , alas ! unconscious then How rich within our woodland glen Were we , afar from world-worn men , For gaudier pleasures pined : For I had seen , in dreams at night , A being lovely as the light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair that gleams of gold stole through , And lips in dimples shrined . Her name was Happiness , she said ; And soon by blind Ambition led , I left our lowly love-warm 'd shed , To seek this maiden kind . I sought her far  --  I sought her wide  --  I sought her in the halls of pride ; Her angel smile was still denied , Where gems less lovely shone . I ask 'd of Fame her fairest crown :  --  With mocking laugh she cast it down . No spell was in the wreath , tho ' fair , To win the maid with golden hair ; And I was all alone . I ask 'd of Wealth his coffers ' key : He smiled , and flung them wide to me , The glittering treasure , far and free , I lavish'd.  --  Soon ' t was flown . It bought me rank ;  --  it bought me power ;  --  It bought me Pleasure 's fleeting flower , And many a plaything of an hour : Ah , me ! ' t was little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The vision with the shining hair ; No ! far from me her low sweet lay Young Joy was warbling all the day , While I o'er half the earth Went wandering for her looks of light . At length I wearied of the sight Of palace-halls . I dream 'd one night Of her who gave me birth . And coldly on the morrow-morn , With sorrow in my soul and scorn , I sought the glen where I was born ,  --  How holy seem 'd the air ! The wild-flower with its early glow Still lightly laced the lattice low ; Still sang the rill ;  --  the forest trees Bent as of old beneath the breeze , And all was free and fair . The Zephyr with its breath of balm , The sunshine smiling soft and calm , Wrought in my very heart a charm , And made it Summer there . Some dreamy moments pass 'd before My trembling hand unlatch 'd the door , And I beneath that roof once more Stood silent with delight . My mother welcomed back her boy ; My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart the prize That now seem 'd dearest in mine eyes , And loveliest and most bright , I saw again the vision fair , The maiden with the radiant hair ; For Joy and I had parted there , As there we met that night ! Ah ! many a youth will search like me , Will roam the land and cross the sea In quest of Happiness , while she Sits all the while unseen Beside the very hearth he leaves , And there her golden web she weaves , Perchance array 'd in lowly guise , But still with heaven-illumined eyes , And frank and smiling mien . We fondest prize the gem we miss ; We pine for absent friendship 's kiss ; We know not , till we lose , the bliss That dwells at home serene . Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : THE BIRTH OF THE CALLITRICHE ; OR , WATER-STAR. from Poems ( 1846 ) " Nothing in them , that doth range , But must suffer a sea-change Into something new and strange .

Now , voice by voice they are dying away , Till all save one are still , And that sings on with a cadence glad , Like the gush of a rippling rill . It comes from one of the beauteous seven , The Pleiades pure and bright , Who keep more fondly than all in heaven , Unstain 'd their urns of light . She sings , as she bends o'er her burning vase , And she sees in the wave below Her beaming smile , and her form of grace , And her soft hair 's golden flow . But hark ! a voice from the waters clear , And the Pleiad leans to listen , With a glowing cheek and a charmd ear , And eyes that tenderly glisten .

" Wild and sweet was the lay of love , Upborne on the balmy air , And the Pleiad stole from her bower above , To gaze in the waters fair .

Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : THE SUITOR 'S REPLY TO THE MAIDEN WHO WISHED TO RETURN HIS GIFT . from Poems ( 1846 ) Yes !
