TO Dr. ROBERT MONTGOMERY BIRD , ( AUTHOR OF THE GLADIATOR , ) THE TRAGEDY OF " DE LARA , " IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED . NOTE BY THE PUBLISHERS . Several years ago Mr. Pelby , of Boston , offered five hundred dollars for the best original Tragedy ; which was awarded to Mrs. Caroline Lee Hentz , then of Covington , Ky. , now a resident of Tuscaloosa , Ala . Owing to pecuniary embarrassment , he felt unable to pay the whole amount of the award , and honourably returned to her the copyright . It was performed in the eastern cities at the time , on several successive nights , with very great applause , as the annexed extracts , taken promiscuously from several of the most respectable papers , abundantly show . For the better comprehension of portions of the play , we mention , that Osman is a captive Moor , residing in the Castle of the " De Laras , " having been taken prisoner by the father of Fernando , and treated by him with the greatest kindness . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the son is aware of the fact , though his revenge is stayed by the love that he bears to Osman 's daughter , who has become a Christian in sincerity , as her father has in profession , in order the better to subserve his hatred toward Fernando . Dr. Bird , the author of the " Gladiator , " " Oralloossa , " &c.,; whose praise or censure will always be respected by the literary public , writes the publishers as follows : " You do me justice in referring to the high opinion I have always expressed of " De Lara ; " and it gratifies me to learn that Mrs. Hentz is about to present it to the public in a form which , I doubt not , will procure it a still greater number of ardent admirers than it possessed when confined to the narrow precincts of the stage . " A dramatic production , possessing equal merits as an acting play and a poem , and coming from the fair hands of a woman , can not but be received with universal favour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , offered by Mr. Pelby for the best original Tragedy , has been awarded to Mrs. Caroline Lee Hontz . " We have had an opportunity of reading the piece , which is written in blank verse . It possesses extraordinary poetical merit ; and in this respect we know no drama , produced within the last few years , that will stand comparison with it . If published , it will acquire and preserve a high rank in dramatic literature . "  --  National Gazette . " Those who have read De Lara , pronounce it superior in construction of plot , dramatic spirit , and rich poetic language , to any native production which has been brought upon the stage . "  --  Saturday Courier . " At the Arch-street Theatre , last evening , the new prize Tragedy , De Lara , met a reception which should satisfy the most sanguine expectations of its accomplished authoress . The performance was witnessed by several of our friends , on whose judgment experience has taught us to rely . They unite in the opinion which we had derived from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combines more poetic beauty and dramatic excellence than any that has been given to the English stage since Douglas . "  --  National Gazette . " We have already recorded our sentiments in favour of De Lara , and we now repeat , that , in chaste and imaginative poetry , refined diction , and happy sentiment , it is unequalled by any other American drama . " " Mrs. Hentz , the author of De Lara , is entitled to high praise for the beauty of her style , which , compared with the prosaic diction of many of the most successful modern English tragedies , may be considered of the highest order of dramatic writing . She seems to have taken the most regular tragedies of the British stage as her model . There is nothing introduced but what is necessary to bring about the catastrophe ; and the interest of the piece gradually increases to the last scene , which is not inferior to any in the whole range of the English drama .

This creation of female genius would be honourable to the literature of any country ; and it will be a disgrace to Americans if the authoress is not well rewarded . " DRAMATIS PERSON .

PROLOGUE TO THE TRAGEDY OF " DE LARA . " ' Ere yet the curtain lifts its veiling fold , Now o'er the scenes of tragic art unroll 'd , The eye of hope this brilliant ring surveys , And draws prophetic radiance from the gaze . The third sad sister of the seraph choir , Who wake the music of the deep-toned lyre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searched the hoarded treasures of an age . Rich in the dearest memories of earth  --  In chivalry , devotion , valour , worth  --  She comes , with thorns upon her pallid brow , Though thorns and sorrow lurk beneath their glow . The passions follow darkly in her train , Wild as the billows of the storm-swept main ; But reason , nature vindicate their cause , And conscience writhes o'er its insulted laws . Who has not felt , when reeling o'er the verge Of crime to which temptation madly urge , An antepast of that undying sting  --  That quenchless fire , prepared for guilt 's dread king ; And shrunk , as if the Lord 's avenging wrath Had placed upbraiding phantom 's in their path ? To paint these agonies , to show the wreck Of Mind 's proud sovereignty when on the neck Of unthroned reason Passion victor stands , While pale Remorse in stealth its victim brands ! This is the empire of the heaven-born maid  --  May no polluting steps her realms invade . Never may that celestial fire , which erst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Descend to gild that scene where vice maintains Its sorcery o'er the slave within its chains  --  Where genius forms unholy league with fame , And makes itself immortal by its shame . Ye sons of Erudition ! classic band ! Rulers of taste ! in this unshackled land  --  All that ye can , in candour , truth accord , To this new candidate of fame award . Man 's own justice may relax its frown , When woman aims to win the laurel crown . Till now , the smiles of partial friends have warm 'd The germs of fancy , their fond love disarm 'd Relenting anticism  --  veil 'd in mist Each venial error . In the crowded list Of Bards , adventurous champion now she waits , As stood the fabled Sylph at Eden 's gates , Trembling to know if hers were that bright gift Of power the everlasting bars to lift . Daughters of loveliness ! we turn to you  --  Stars of the arch , fair bending on the view ; ' T is yours to kindle that propitious beam Whose visioned radiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the bard , appeals For all that woman most devoutly feels , Most dearly prizes  --  pure , spontaneous praise . Oh ! when some unseen hand these folds shall raise , May some kind genius o'er the walls preside , And more than welcome great De Lara 's bride . Main text ACT I. SCENE I. Abdel Osman and Hassan . ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman Thou too released from bondage ? come to share With me the fellowship of misery ? HASSAN . Hassan Is freedom , then , no blessing ? I rejoice To breathe the chainless air , and feel the light Flow in upon my soul ! And then the hope Of vengeance , dearer than the sun or air ! That hope with freedom dawns ! ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman Deeds for the bold  --  The dreamer slumbers in the arms of hope . How didst thou pass the sentry , and secure An entrance to these guarded walls ? HASSAN . Hassan The friend Of Abdel Osman , the illustrious Moor Now listed ' neath the banner of the cross , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ True ! canst thou trace , Hassan , on these worn features  --  marred by care  --  By suffering and passion 's hidden struggles  --  The fire and energy of other years ? I know thee not . HASSAN . Hassan Though thou art changed , yet still Thy form recalls the memory of those days When thou wert gilded by a pomp that shamed The pageantry of Spain . ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman Thou sayest truth , Son of the faithful ! Spain can never match The glory that Grenada once has known . Nor can Grenada tell of nobler blood Than that the Abencerrages can boast ! I , of that royal , now degraded , line  --  Second alone to kingly majesty  --  I , who in halls of marble grandeur dwelt , Enriched by all the treasures of the earth  --  I am the fallen thing thou seest me now ! HASSAN . Hassan But thou hast clasped in peace the hand that smote ! Thou art a Nazarene ; thy Christian creed Bids thee embrace  --  ay , even bless , thy foe ! ABDEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the prophet true , Slave of the Christian 's God  --  or false to both ? HASSAN . Hassan I will not throw thee back the name of traitor ; But if thou fearest my faith , guard well thy own ! The fountain sends not forth in the same gush Medicinal and poisonous streams . Behold ! These scars are witnesses which can not lie , That Hassan is not traitor to his country ! If thou hast only owned the Christian creed , But in thy secret heart art Moslem still , My hand and sword are thine ; and I am armed With power as well as will to aid thy cause . ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman Vicissitudes change not the inner man . The soul of Abdel Osman is the same ! Is the keen , polished cimeter transformed Because , perchance , a foreign sheath conceals it ? What power hast thou to serve me ? HASSAN . Hassan Come more near . A band of warlike Moors are now encamped In the dense umbrage of the eastern forest : Give but the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abdel Osman Ah ! these are glorious tidings ! ( checking himself . ) Have a care ! What if I should betray thee to the Spaniard ! HASSAN . Hassan Treacherous to me , thou wouldst betray thyself . I read too clear the language of thine eye , Fierce with the joy of vengeance , as I speak , To fear the threat implied . ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman Now , by the prophet 's tomb ! thou art well skilled In spelling out my thoughts ! Where hast thou learned An art so deep ? HASSAN . Hassan Where but in suffering 's school ? The iron discipline of that dread master Thou knowest , and bitter lessons have been thine . ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman Most bitter ! see this shrunk and powerless arm  --  Stretching out his left arm . A useless branch , upon the green tree withered ! HASSAN . Hassan The arm that grasps the cimeter is good : How came its fellow thus ? ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman Alhama 's towers The tale might tell . ' T is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish dogs were raging  --  Rivers of slaughter flowing in their track ; When the fierce infidel had reached the heart Of that proud citadel , the golden key Of all Grenada 's treasures  --  gracious Allah ! What desperation fired thy votaries then ! I saw the flowers of chivalry mowed down  --  The young , the brave , the noble of the land , Thrown in one heaving , reeking pile around The holy standard that they died defending ! Still o'er the walls the silver crescent beamed Above the sea of battle ! O'er its stormy waves , With one strong arm , that banner I upheld , And with the other dealt out wounds and death ! While from the right I swept the assailants back , Upon the left destroying Lara came  --  Gashed the strained sinews of this once firm arm , And followed up the blow by thousand more ! The silver crescent bowed ! I saw the cross Float o'er the vanquished walls ! Why tell the rest ? From transient death I woke a captive  --  slave ! The energies of slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; And while my body languished in its chains , My spirit gathered might . HASSAN . Hassan But how didst thou Transform at last thy foe into thy friend ? ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman My friend ! A Christian love his enemy ! I owned his creed : it was enough . He gave Freedom unprized to the apostate Moor . HASSAN . Hassan But now thy conqueror 's slain  --  ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman What ! slain sayst thou ? Who told thee he was slain ? HASSAN . Hassan The winds of Heaven Are busy with the rumour . It is said  --  ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman What is said ? HASSAN . Hassan That he untimely perished . That in a dark wood , by an unknown hand , Pierced with inglorious wounds , proud Lara fell  --  The lion in the field , and in the camp The serpent for his wisdom . Some , too , say That young Fernando 's wits are crazed by grief , Or that his grief at times partakes of madness . If so , this castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fallen , and weak Its next support , thus shaken by the crash . ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman ' T is true , the sorrow of the son assumes A wild and fearful form ; but love divides The empire of despair . Subdued by both , The warrior 's courage and ambition sleep . Who is the leader of this band of Moors ? HASSAN . Hassan Aben Abdallah . ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman What ! the princely youth Abdallah ! He to whom I had betrothed My daughter , now the haughty Spaniards ' prize ! He comes to ransom her  --  avenge my wrongs ! By Allah , this is well ! let him but rush In thunder ' gainst these battlements , and win From the young infidel this precious gem , I 'd welcome then a grave beneath the wreck Of these accursed walls ! For her alone I bend my spirit thus ! I would not leave My virgin treasure in the plunderer 's hands . HASSAN . Hassan I hear approaching steps . ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman Let us retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exeunt . ( Enter Fernando . ) FERNANDO . Fernando de Lara Why hope , yet dread ? Why chide the tardy flight Of lagging time , by headstrong passion spurred , Yet tremble as it flies , and strive and pant To grasp its wings , and hold it from the brink O'er which we fear to look ? This is not well ! There 's more of madness than of reason in it ! My multitudinous and hurrying thoughts Chafe with unprofitable wasting wrath Against their prison walls . Mind ! What is mind  --  Its strength and majesty , we vaunt so high ; Making ourselves such glory from its powers , And claiming worship from the grosser throng For the indwelling deity ? Vain boast ! I , who now seek a shelter in this temple , Where the immortal dwells , from storms without , Find but its pillars prostrate in the gloom ; And feeling , raving madly ' mid the ruins , My bosom labours with the load it bears ! Grief , when it comes alone , in wonted weeds , Primeval daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart ! But when remorse and horror tread behind , It is a ghastly band ! Oh , will no veil Shut their imbodied hideousness from sight ? Is it not all a dream ? How can our deeds Bring good or ill to the unconscious dead ? Why should we , for an unsubstantial shade  --  The dark imagining of a sick brain  --  Offer a living , bleeding sacrifice ? Heaven does not will such things : ' T is man that makes His worst calamities  --  then hurls at fate The maledictions he himself deserves ! But soft  --  she comes ! No ! let me perish first ! So fair , so innocent ! what ! cast her from me ! ( Enter Zoraya . ) Zoraya ! what a world of joy were this , Were every moment thus ! ZORAYA . Zoraya I sought my father ; Yet if my presence brings Fernando joy , I will not feign regret . My simple heart Knows no disguise . Nature and love are true . FERNANDO . Fernando de Lara Thou couldst not veil thy soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crystal wave Shows not more clear the pearly gems beneath . ' T was sweet to think , upon the tented field , Where hostile legions met , that their soft rays Followed the warrior 's path ; that thy pure prayers Were breathing up for him , and calling down The cherubim , with fourfold wings , to shield him ! See this embroidered scarf thy hands have wrought ! The silken vesture mantling o'er my breast Seemed like an angel 's plumes unfolded here . ZORAYA . Zoraya Oh , I have prayed in agony for thee To Him , the Christian 's God , whom I adore ! But my devoted country ! ' T is the land That gave me birth  --  the paradise of nature  --  The beautiful , thine arms victorious ravage ! Those olive groves are bathed in native blood ! The Xenil  --  stream of thousand silver fountains  --  Flows mournful , thickened by the same red tide ! My mother 's ashes too . FERNANDO . Fernando de Lara Zoraya , cease ! I can not meet reproach from thee ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ZORAYA . Zoraya Fernando , Did I upbraid thee ? FERNANDO . Fernando de Lara Tremble to rouse Conflicts too terrible for thee to witness ! Yet fear me not , sweet neophyte , mine own , Beloved , betrothed ! ' T is thou alone hast power To tame the lion in me ! E'en in battle Thine image , like a spirit of mercy , came With such beseeching gentleness . I paused To bind the wounds I made , and almost wept Thy fallen brother in each conquered foe ! ZORAYA . Zoraya I know thee merciful as brave ; forgive ! I am not worthy thou shouldst blend with mine A destiny so glorious ! Can thine eyes Turn from the daughters of thy country , fair As the first rose the nightingale selects , To rest upon the flower whose dusky tints By foreign suns were dyed ? FERNANDO . Fernando de Lara Transplanted here , Sweet exile from the garden of the sun , Thy beauty shames the blossoms of our bowers . How cold to thine their pallid charms ! The bloom Of richer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft , redundant locks , Loose floating down in folds of living jet ! And then those eyes ! they rival with their beams The everlasting jewelry of heaven ! This plighted hand  --  ZORAYA . Zoraya Enough : I did not crave This costly tribute to unvalued gems : And yet they are priceless , since beloved by thee ! Thy love , Fernando , ' t is a gift too dear For words to speak its worth ! ' T is freedom , country , More than all to me ! I sometimes fear That Heaven itself is second in my heart ; That when I bound my faith to thine , and owned The God whom thou ador'st , earthly fire Upon the altar burned ! FERNANDO . Fernando de Lara Pure is the flame Kindled or felt by thee ! If there 's a sight Dear to the saints  --  the delegates of Heaven  --  ' T is when too faithful , young , and loving hearts In truth and purity like ours unite ! This day , Zoraya , dost thou not remember ? ZORAYA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fernando de Lara Speak , Speak of my mother !

Zoraya No maiden shame prompts me to veil the heart Where thou art throned ! But I 'm a daughter still  --  My father  --  FERNANDO . Fernando de Lara Name him not  --  forbear ! ZORAYA . Zoraya To him I am as is the fountain to the desert  --  FERNANDO . Fernando de Lara No more ! Thou driv'st me to the verge of madness ! ZORAYA . Zoraya Unkind Fernando !

What ! can the incorporeal subtile air Condense at once , and shape itself like thee ! Avaunt ! thou art not there ! I know thou art But the illusion of this phrensied brain ; And yet my straining eyes behold thee still , Thou pale , vindictive shade , whose ashy lips , Though voiceless , tell unutterable things ! That bleeding breast I know ! point not , I pray , Thy spectral finger there ! Let her not see it ! Oh , misery ! let me go mad at once ! ZORAYA . Zoraya Fernando , if thou ever loved me , cease ! Rave not so fearfully , nor fix thine eyes With such a marble gaze ! Recoil not thus ; There is no phantom here ! Oh , turn , beloved ! Life of my life , wake from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Thou shouldst not look on such a sight Appalling ! I believed the buried dead Ne'er broke their leaden slumbers ; that they slept , Dreamless and cold , till the arch-angle called !

Forgive , thou injured , venerable form ; ' T is I that call thy unavenged spirit From death 's untravelled halls ! Return ! return !

Give me once more The friend I honour . Give to mourning Spain All that she lost when thy brave father fell ! FERNANDO . Fernando de Lara Breathe not his name !

The wretch that drifted o'er the surging waves Of ocean when its foam is lashed by storms , Sees not his yawning sepulchre more clear Than I the chasm o'er which my reason totters !

I see resolve Upon thy lips ; and in thine eye once more Kindles the eagle 's glance . Look to these walls ; There may be treachery here . I marked the Moor Who entered last within them . It may be That I am somewhat to suspicion prone ; But , though his passport could not be denied , The lines upon his swarthy face expressed The sly , malicious cunning I abhor . FERNANDO . Fernando de Lara Well , let us to the ramparts : let the guards Be warned to keener vigilance of duty .

No ! she was formed for everlasting worship ! ( Enter Zoraya . ) ZORAYA . Zoraya Fernando , stay ! Abdallah , ' t is in vain !

To meet with shield to shield , and breast to breast , The guarded foe ' neath the beholding sun , With laurelled life or honoured death in view ? No ! vengeance , Hassan , is a secret thing : It works in darkness  --  ' t is the midnight bolt That strikes unseen ;  --  a crash  --  a blasted victim  --  Then all is still ! HASSAN .

No ! steal with cautious tread around the towers ; Find out the secret path I marked below ; Plunge in the woods , then wing thy steps with speed . Be bold , yet wary . If the hope of plunder , Of strife , revenge kindle them not at once , Tell them ' t is Abdel Osman , still as erst Devoted to his country and his king , A Moslem true , implores their knightly aid !

Abdel Osman Oh , how I love the precious honest soul , Who , cursing treachery , sinks into the snare ! Go , fond credulity , and bid the ranks Of battle roll toward the unpeopled west ! Not there the covert of the hunted deer : Those oriental woods have darker groves . Spirits of vengeance , guide the steps of Hassan ; With supernatural eloquence inspire His pleading lips , and arm with deadly strength Each hand that grasps the retributive steel !

Look , dear Juana , dost thou mark the gleam Of flashing weapons where those sunbeams glance ? JUANA . Juana I see the dancing sunbeams  --  nothing more . ZORAYA . Zoraya Yet look again beyond ; I dare not trust My own unsteady glance . Dost thou not see , Where those dark oaks their sweeping shadows cast , A warlike banner waving ? Canst thou trace The cross or crescent on its silken folds ? JUANA . Juana ' T is but the palm tree towering o'er the wood In regal majesty . Its ample leaves Stream like a warlike banner on the gale . I see no silken folds . ZORAYA . Zoraya Ah ! love transforms Nature itself , and throws o'er every scene Th ' unnatural colouring of its own wild thoughts . This hour decides my fate ; it gives me life  --  A life of angel blessedness on earth  --  Or dooms me to irremediable wo : Then marvel not at my bewildered fears , But wonder at my calmness ;  --  do I weep ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bier , and in his folding banner , Crimsoned with blood , a warrior 's winding sheet ! Oh , should he fall , here , on my knees , before The awful majesty of heaven and earth , I call upon the Christian 's God to hear , The saints to register , a virgin 's vow : This hand shall never meet in love and troth The blood-stained hand of his victorious rival  --  No marriage bonds shall ever bind my faith ! But while in this devoted breast remains One aching throb , that throb shall beat for him ! JUANA . Juana Rise , sweet Zoraya ; do not thus despair : Why should this yet unconquered warrior fall , When love and hope lend vigour to his arm ? Why should he yield to one , when myriad swords Have often flashed their lightnings on his shield ? He will not perish ; he will live for thee ! ZORAYA . Zoraya E'en if he live , Juana , did I say That mine would be an angel 's lot ? Alas ! Where'er I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my love , yet dare not breathe Into a father 's ear the vows that bind me !

Dost thou believe , Juana , heaven permits Futurity to send a warning gloom O'er present joy , prophetical of wo ? JUANA . Juana I do believe there is a voice within That needs no prophet 's aid to warn us back From danger : guilt  --  ZORAYA . Zoraya Guilt ! no , it is not guilt ! His holy mother would not thus have blest With dying lips ! and such a heavenly smile ! JUANA . Juana Too sensitive Zoraya ! pure as warm Is every passion of thy gentle heart ! I meant not to attach a thought to thee That is not stainless as the lily 's cup . I would have said there is a secret voice , A soft , low voice , which not the clarion 's swell Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeming fancy 's false alarms The accents of this monitor of Heaven . ZORAYA . Zoraya Thou know'st not all : I can not , dare not tell thee ! I could have borne an angry father 's wrath If all were dark beside , while he still shone Unclouded in his brightness ! I could turn My glance on him , and every jealous cloud , Tinged with a golden edge , would roll away ! But , oh ! I 've seen that mind which was to me A tower of strength and beauty , rudely shattered , While reason 's wavering light just gleamed to show The ruin some mysterious power had wrought ! JUANA . Juana What dost thou say ! I fear to ask thee more ! I 've seen him silent , sad , abstracted , plunged In reveries deep and stern . His filial grief , Locked in his soul , has threatened such a wreck . ZORAYA . Zoraya Hadst thou beheld him in the fearful hour Dash from his fervent grasp my trembling hand , And back recoil , and bend on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires ! Hadst thou but heard the inexplicable words His raving lips poured in some phantom 's ear ! I shudder at the memory ! JUANA . Juana Can it be That conscience goads him with remorseful pangs ? That he , the proud , the pure , has stooped to crime ? ZORAYA . Zoraya To crime ! Fernando guilty ! never , never ! JUANA . Juana Sweet maid , I pity thee ! Thy bridal day Indeed seems marked by most disastrous omens . Thou wilt not wed ? ZORAYA . Zoraya Shall I desert him now , When grief has laid its blighting hand upon him ? He who , in all the splendour of his rank , With royal favour crowned and martial fame , By beauty wooed , by chivalry adored , In this full blaze of honour bowed his pride , And knelt a captive at the captive 's feet ? Is love alone on beds of roses found , Beneath a heaven of fair unshadowed blue ? No ! ' t is to shame , to sorrow , to despair That faithful love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his happier hour , I would repay the immeasurable debt Of gratitude , devotion , faith , and love ! JUANA . Juana Heaven chase this cloud , and smile upon thy union ! ZORAYA . Zoraya Hark ! heard ye not a sound upon the breeze ? Was it the trumpet note of victory ? JUANA . Juana Thy ears deceive thee ; all is still around , Save the dull murmurs of the restless sea . ZORAYA . Zoraya Why comes he not ? See how the day declines . This long uncertainty is worse than death ! Hark ! hark again , Juana ! hear'st thou not That heavy crash ? I feel the ramparts tremble ! JUANA . Juana ' T is thou that tremblest : oft I 've heard that sound . Some rock is loosened from the ancient cliff , And rolled in mimic thunder to the vale . Let us retire ; in vain we watch his coming . The path is hidden by a wreathed shade Of forest trees , impervious to the eye . ZORAYA . Zoraya Again that crash ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling , ' t is these walls that crumble !

Brave Moslem  --  yet the caitiff dared to make That noble name his battle-word for treason . FRANCISCO . Francisco de Haro I fear thou warm'st a traitor in thy bosom More dark and subtle than th ' insidious Hassan . Look well to Abdel Osman . FERNANDO . Fernando de Lara ( starting . ) Where is he ? I marked him not  --  he shared not in the strife . FRANCISCO .

Be not deceived : ' T was he who , eloquent in zeal , alarmed My fears for thee , and urged me to despatch The bravest cavaliers to guard thy life .

I do suspect this haughty Christian Moor . FERNANDO . Fernando de Lara Thou dost ? Then arm thy self with weapons wrought In heaven 's own armory . Earth can yield thee none To foil the darts of Satan . FRANCISCO . Francisco de Haro How , Fernando , If thou doubt'st his faith  --  FERNANDO . Fernando de Lara Forbear , forbear !

Would'st thou roll down the cloud upon my soul That floats in dim , unearthly shades around , Ready to gather in appalling gloom ? Look on my face , and tell me if I rave ! FRANCISCO .

Thou art the kindest , truest friend That ever miserable man could boast . When I seem cold , ungrateful , selfish , changed , Think that some evil spirit has assumed My lineaments and speech , and heed it not . Go , dear Francisco ; see that every breach These infidels have made is firmly closed .

Oh , cold and passionless ! didst thou but love With agonizing tenderness , like me ! I may , I must be wretched : yet when she , So loved and lovely , rises on my soul In all her sweet and spiritual charms , My troubled passions heave themselves to rest , As sink the swelling billows of the main When the fair wanderer of the midnight deep O'er their dark crests her silver forehead bends !

Weapon of war ! well may'st thou boast thy strength  --  Grenada 's youthful palm tree lies in dust ! FERNANDO . Fernando de Lara Abdallah lives  --  long may his country bless The sheltering honours of its youthful palm .

While life seemed ebbing from his countless wounds , Earthly ambition , like a mighty shade , Receded from his view ; the light of heaven Flowed in upon his soul with healing beams , And he who late a haughty sinner towered , Exulting in his dark idolatry , Before the altar now repenting knelt ! Yes ! noble youth , is not thy prophet mine ? Thy faith , thy country ? Does not every Moor Brand with his curse the apostate who has left The shrine of Allah for the Christian 's God ? FERNANDO .

Methought I stood alone upon a blasted heath , No gale to fan me neath a burning sky That poured its blaze upon my naked soul . A spirit met me there ;  --  I may not paint To mortal ear its wild , unearthly form . It beckoned me ; I followed till I came To shades so deep , a midnight blackness reigned ; Yet could I see as if the noontide sun Still kept its blazing eye upon my path !

Thou , who wert wont to welcome my approach As the first flower of spring the sunbeam 's ray ? ZORAYA . Zoraya The sunbeam is not dearer to the flower , Dear father , than thy look of love to me ; But when thy brow is overcast with clouds , And lightning flashes quiver in thy eye , Forgive me , but I fear to gaze upon thee ! ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman And dost thou think to see my brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles , While yonder field tells of Abdallah 's shame  --  While slaughtered Moors around these ramparts lie , And new-made captives in these dungeons groan ? ZORAYA . Zoraya Alas ! my father , they have sought their doom ! Our captors wielded but defensive weapons . I mourn with thee our desolated land ; But can our sighs and tears  --  ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman Degenerate girl ! Thy false lips utter what thy heart belies ! When thy brave countrymen besieged these towers , Perilling more than life to ransom thine , No gratitude for such a generous effort Rose in thy soul ; no pity for their fate Now pales thy cheeks nor dims thy conscious eye ! The infidel alone absorbs thy thoughts ! For him thy prayers ascend , thy tears rain down ! When , trembling but for thee , I sought to calm Thy terrors with a father 's tender love , I heard thee call upon Fernando 's name , And pray with impious lips that he would shield His bosom from the foe  --  no prayer for me ! Thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Zoraya Oh ! couldst thou read my heart  --  ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman I read it now : Fear , shame , remorse , born of thy guilty love , In glowing shadows flit across thy face ! Lift up thy brow and tell me , if thou dar'st , Thou dost not love this young idolater ! ZORAYA . Zoraya No ! let me bow my forehead in the dust : I dare not meet again a father 's frown ! Oh ! I have seen thee look on others thus , But never on thy child ! Whene'er thy glance Turned toward me , it softened like the cloud On which the moonbeams smile ; and then thy voice Was ever kind and tender in its tones ! Why am I thus an alien from thy bosom ? ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman Hear me , Zoraya ! Never was a child More dear , more precious to a father 's heart ! Thou art to me the blossom in the desert  --  The rainbow in the storm  --  the light , the joy , The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has drank my blood , As an apostate from its holy creed ; Suspected by the Christian , shunned by all  --  What is there left on earth to love but thee ? Why do I linger still in these vile walls , Uttering the hollow cant my lips abhor ? By dangers threatened  --  ZORAYA . Zoraya Dangers , father ! here ! Beloved by the marquess and by his son  --  ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman Beloved by the marquess ? Ah , ' t was the captive , The humble neophyte that graced his triumph , He deigned to honour with the name of friend . His son ! I tell thee , fond , deluded maid , That son 's vindictive hand would pierce this breast , If thou wouldst clasp it reeking with my blood ! ZORAYA . Zoraya Oh ! thou dost wrong him ! ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman Silence ! let me speak ! I am endangered  --  we must fly this castle  --  There is no safety here  --  ' t is death to stay ! ZORAYA . Zoraya No safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Thou didst not utter them ! ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman Repeat them not  --  I charge thee , on thy life ! Nor ask me to unfold their secret meaning ! Had not my plot been baffled , we had been Beyond the power of the usurping dogs . Look up , my child ! We yet will find some home Where the invader 's foot has never trod ; Some orange bower , by peaceful fountains cooled , Upon thy silver Xenil 's native banks ! Grenada 's gallant chiefs shall vie once more For her  --  the fairest of its dark-eyed maids  --  The minstrel 's theme  --  the morning star of beauty ! Yes , daughter of the faithful , let us seek Some temple by idolatry unstained , Where we may kneel once more at Allah 's shrine ! ZORAYA . Zoraya Too kind , too much deceived ! Oh ! frown once more ! Unworthy of thy tenderness , behold These tears and agonies ! they tell thee all ! ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman Now , by the sword and buckler of Mahomet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gushing streams shall wash away the stain , If thou hast brought pollution on my name , And yielded to the Spaniard 's wanton love ! An Abencerrage shall not live dishonoured ! ZORAYA . Zoraya Thou giv'st me courage ;  --  I am innocent : The blood of the Abencerrages flows pure As melting icicles within these veins ! No look of lawless passion ever sent The conscious crimson to thy daughter 's cheek . Fernando loves me , but the captive maid Receives as reverent and true an homage As if Castilia 's diadem she wore . I have deceived thee , father ;  --  given my heart And pledged my faith , unsanctioned by thy blessing : But , glorying in my innocence , I dare Present my bosom to thy glittering steel , And tell thee with my dying breath that here Fernando 's worshipped image is enshrined ! ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman Would that the tomb of her who made me father , Had closed on thee the infant of a day , Sweet in thy bud , but fatal in thy bloom ! Leagued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thy country shall be thine ! Leagued with an infidel , may Allah send  --  ZORAYA . Zoraya Oh ! curse me not ! Thou knowest not all my crime ! Thou , to redeem thyself from captive chains , Assumed the Christian 's name , yet loathed his creed : I , at thy bidding , knelt before the cross ; But , ' ere the mandate came , my heart had bowed In adoration to the Christian 's God ! Yes , on this brow the holy priest had shed Salvation 's dew from the baptismal font ! This sacred cross I 've sheltered in my breast  --  ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman ( Snatching it from her hand , and dashing it upon the ground . ) Perish the symbol of a faith abhorred ! Perish this seal of infamy and wo ! Down , down to dust ! ZORAYA . Zoraya ( Throwing herself at his feet , and grasping the cross . ) No ! trample on thy child , But spare from sacrilege this holy relic . Fernando 's mother , on the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope  --  This precious pledge ! I 'll guard it as of old The ancient Hebrews watched the ark of Heaven ! Oh ! had'st thou seen the glory that illumed The dying features of this lovely saint  --  The light  --  the glow  --  the ecstasy  --  the peace , Thou wouldst , like me , have wept and have believed ! Father , there is a truth , I feel there is , In this religion , sealed by blood divine ! It gives me strength to wrestle with thy wrath : It arms me  --  me , a young and timid maid  --  With power a hero 's arm this moment lacks ! This cross is mine : back to my guardian heart , Thou sacred sign  --  remain for ever there ! ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman Shame of thy lineage ! alien from thy kind ! Traitress exulting in thy daring guilt ! I have no daughter ! never be it said That this unnatural thing was child of mine ! I will have none ! Away , away , thou serpent , That once I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done ! There is no other place to sting . Fool that I was ! Amid the wreck of fame  --  The dearth of joy  --  I dreamed that fate had left A daughter ;  --  and still more  --  that she did love me ! ZORAYA . Zoraya Do I not love thee ? Holy Nature ! plead Zoraya 's cause  --  I have no voice but thine ! ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman Nature disowns thee ! thou hast broken her laws ! Go to thy new-found idols  --  bend the knee , And mock them with the incense of thy prayers ! Go kiss the hand red with Abdallah 's blood  --  The blood of Moslems slain within these walls  --  And at the bridal altar pledge thy vows ! But hear me while I swear , by Allah 's throne , A father 's curse  --  ZORAYA . Zoraya Thou canst not utter it ! Heaven will not hear ! Here , prostrate at thy feet , Behold me fall , submissive to thy will ! Leave me this cross  --  this anchor of my faith ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave me this ! ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman Swear , then , thou wilt not wed this Christian youth ! Lift up thy hand , and call upon the power Thou now adorest , to attest thy truth ! ZORAYA . Zoraya Father , I will not be Fernando 's bride  --  By yon high heaven , that hears my solemn vow , And bids recording angels write it there ! Falls into her father 's arms . ABDEL OSMAN . Abdel Osman Now thou art once more mine ! Come to my heart ! Fly , poor , deluded trembler , to thy nest  --  The spoiler 's hand shall never reach thee here : Though rough , it is a home of love for thee . Dry up thy tears , and lift thy drooping head ; Let not a Christian eye behold thy grief ! We may be doomed to linger for a while , Though thousand perils now beset my path . But as thy father 's life is dear , conceal From him whose love thou hast abjured for ever , The oath that now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farewell , my child ! Exit . ( Enter Juana . ) JUANA . Juana Beauteous Zoraya , what has faded thus The new-born rose of joy upon thy cheek ! How pale thou art  --  how wan ! thou whom so late , Radiant with gratitude and hope , I left . ZORAYA . Zoraya Where shall I fly ? Oh , wretched and undone ! JUANA . Juana From whence this wild despair ! Fernando lives ! For this thy glad thanksgivings rose  --  ZORAYA . Zoraya Fernando ! JUANA . Juana Is he not thine ? thine soon by holiest ties ? Then why  --  ZORAYA . Zoraya Lost ! lost ! for ever lost to me ! JUANA . Juana Good angels help me ! art thou raving too ? ZORAYA . Zoraya Would that I were ! but , oh ! too well I know My doom is fixed  --  irrevocably sealed ! A vow is on me ! That dread vow is borne To the eternal chancery of Heaven  --  By saints attested and by angels sealed ! JUANA . Juana What hast thou done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all thy vows of faith ? How stab with perfidy that noble heart Which gave thee all its wealth of love and trust ? ZORAYA . Zoraya Could I reveal  --  but no , it must not be ! JUANA . Juana When was thy confidence by me betrayed ? ZORAYA . Zoraya Never ! in every sorrow I have found A soothing balm in sympathy so true : I know thy friendship  --  I have proved its worth ! JUANA . Juana Then tell me , dear Zoraya , all thy grief : I 'll bind myself to secresy as deep And lasting as the grave . ZORAYA . Zoraya A father 's life ! I dare not hazard it ! JUANA . Juana There is no oath More solemn than the simple word of truth ! Believe me now , and doubt me when I 'm false . ZORAYA . Zoraya Forgive me ! I require no other bond . Ask what thou wilt , and I will tell thee all ! JUANA . Juana Why , then , that fatal vow ? Oh ! what impelled  --  ZORAYA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou live and bear A father 's malediction on thy head ? JUANA . Juana Monster of cruelty ! he could not dare  --  ZORAYA . Zoraya He could  --  he did ! The deadly bolt was aimed  --  I almost felt it enter in my soul ! Ask me no more ! JUANA . Juana Unnatural sire ! may heaven  --  ZORAYA . Zoraya Juana ! father is a holy name . Revere the rights of nature , and forbear ! JUANA . Juana And canst thou , then , bow such a willing martyr ? ZORAYA . Zoraya A willing martyr ! where 's my resignation ? Is it in these deep throbs  --  these burning tears  --  This hidden agony that passeth words ? Yet in the desolation of my heart One solitary ray of glory shines ! Through shame and obloquy the cross I 've borne  --  Guarded from sacrilege the holy emblem  --  Clasped it undaunted to my sheltering breast , And tore from thence the idol I adored ! JUANA . Juana Heroic maid ! ZORAYA . Zoraya Applaud me not ! I feel The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would dread the cord , the stake , The wreath of flame that crowns the martyr 's brow , Less than the ordeal of the coming hour ! How shall I meet him ?

How can I see that melting glance transformed To phrensy 's flash  --  or hear that voice , as sweet As the lone fountain 's murmur , breathe the tones Of bitterness and scorn ? JUANA . Juana Ah ! think of him ! How will his shattered reason bear the shock ? He never will resign thee ! Pause , and fear The desperation of his outraged love ! ZORAYA . Zoraya Oh ! had I never seen these fated walls  --  Had I been doomed , like other captive maids , To languish out my youth in lonely cells , Uncheered by tenderness , unfed by hope  --  I might have wept my country , but my tears Had flowed without the anguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Maternal pity , like a minist'ring saint , Dropped balm into my woes , and love awoke , Unknown before , a new creation round me !

Permit us to depart . FERNANDO . Fernando de Lara Juana , stay ! I will not lead a victim to the altar . These silent tears are eloquent of grief  --  Not that , the pallidness of maiden fear , O'er which the virgin crimson soon shall steal .

ZORAYA . Zoraya Hear me , Fernando ! Were these words my last , They could not be more solemn or more true . Never , oh ! never , in my dreams of hope , Since first my captive heart a master owned , Have I imagined aught of earthly bliss Like that of being called Fernando 's wife ! I had rather bear that dear and honoured name For one short hour , than live a thousand years Of joy , if such could be , from thee divided ! Oh ! thou whom more than light or life I love , If heaven deny me this  --  if I am doomed To pass my days in solitary wo , While some blest maid my forfeit place supplies  --  Think not another  --  FERNANDO .

Thou know'st it , my beloved : thou know'st I bear The scars of heaven 's wrath upon my soul . Thou tremblest  --  ah ! my sweet , devoted love , I know the secret fountain of thy tears : Thou hast beheld me when , by phrensy mastered , I wrestled with the spirits of the air ! This malady of mind no skill of man Can ever medicine : it comes like gleams Of lightning , and it vanishes as soon , Leaving its withering traces on my brain ! Thou fear'st me , my Zoraya  --  ZORAYA . Zoraya Dost thou think For thy calamity I love thee less ? Dearer , far dearer ! Would my life might prove That even madness could not wean my heart . FERNANDO . Fernando de Lara I ask no proof , no pledge but this pure hand , Whose yielding softness , like a seraph 's touch , Has healing power physicians never knew . I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be before the altar of our God : Wilt thou remember the appointed hour ? ZORAYA . Zoraya Remember ! how could I forget that hour ? FERNANDO . Fernando de Lara Oh ! meet it with a smile , and let this cheek Be clothed once more with love 's celestial hue ! Farewell awhile ! we meet to part no more ! Exit . ZORAYA . Zoraya To part no more ! to part , for ever part ! How like a death-knell sounds that word to part ! Juana , I believe my heart must break ; I feel it must ; I can not bear the conflict ! JUANA . Juana Nay , yield not to despair  --  there yet is hope . ZORAYA . Zoraya Hope ! what hope ? I stand upon the brink Of an abyss immeasurably deep ! There 's not a slender reed that I can grasp . An oath ! I never can recall that oath ; And if I could , a curse ! Where shall I turn ? They told me my religion would sustain The spirit it enlightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See ! I press this cross , In agony , upon my throbbing breast  --  It yields no comfort now ! JUANA . Juana It will  --  it will . Oh ! tempt not heaven with sacrilege like this ! Hadst thou denied thy faith , thou wouldst have felt How far remorse transcends all other pangs . Thy love is too idolatrous  --  ' t is sin . ZORAYA . Zoraya I know its wild excess , but grief o'erthrows The empire of my reason  --  JUANA . Juana Rouse thy strength ! Remember that Fernando 's parting words Declared that at the altar of your God Ye soon would meet : the very name should give A kind of inspiration to thy hopes ! Come , I will be thy handmaid  --  I will wreathe With fairest flowers these too-neglected tresses , Though neither wreath nor gem can add a charm To nature 's loveliness almost divine ! Yet for Fernando 's sake  --  he bade thee bind The virgin chaplet round thy silken locks . ZORAYA . Zoraya Yes , deck the victim ! Strange that he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I marked his words . The sacrifice is near ! There is a custom in my native land , When cold in death the Moslem maiden lies , To crown her icy brow with flowers , and wrap Around her for a winding sheet the robes , The snow white robes , that decorate the bride .

Who would look back On sorrow 's shades with beckoning joy in view , Unless to see the rainbow arch of Hope Drawn on its gloom ? FERNANDO . Fernando de Lara I am a strange compound Of mystic elements ! From childhood 's hour I 've known a restless searching after things Mysterious and unknown  --  and  --  nature 's voice Has always spoke a deep prophetic language . I 've sometimes felt as if the awful curtain That falls between eternity and time , Were lifted , and the shadows of a world Unseen became imbodied to my sight !

Thy temples whiten with the snow of age , And blood that flows through wintry viens is chill . E'en in thy youth  --  PRIEST . Priest My youth was past in sin ! These furrows on my face , so deeply trenched , Are graves where murdered passions buried lie ! I battled with them , not in earthly mail , But armour won by penance , fast , and prayer . Such as thou art was Subdue , my son , Passions whose strength can leave such woful traces ! My daughter  --  ( Enter Zoraya , Juana , and Francisco . ) FERNANDO . Fernando de Lara My Zoraya !

Fernando de Lara I will not look on thee ! Perish the hour When first I gazed upon thy fatal charms ! Perish the day when on the accursed Moor  --  The incarnate fiend of hell  --  these portals closed ! Why did no warning issue from the walls When first his foot the conscious marble press 'd ? Why did no prophet murmurs then break forth To tell the shivering soul what ruin hung O'er this devoted house ? And yet , poor martyr , Thou art not guilty ! no foul murderous tint Sullies the whiteness of thy innocence !

Thou blenchest now ! Dost thou remember , in the forest depths , Below the plain , one dark and fearful spot , Where the black cedars cross their boughs , and make A gloom so thick it weighs upon the soul ?
