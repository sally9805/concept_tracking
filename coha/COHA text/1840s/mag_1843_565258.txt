txt FEW travelers have found more inducements in past popularity , to continue their wanderings over the world , than Mr. Stephens . His earlier works on some parts of the eastern continent , although hasty and inaccurate , were so full of good nature and of entertainment , that the reader closed them with a feeling of personal friendship for the author . In his Central America , he attempted somewhat higher things . His preparation , indeed , for investigating the ruins of that country , was apparently but small ; his accuracy in description , we suspect , was not equal to that of ordinary travelers . Still his enthusiastic ardor in exploring the architectural remains of Copan and Palenque , amid the greatest discomforts ; his narrative of a dangerous journey through a country in a state of anarchy and revolution , together with his perpetual good nature , and disposition to make the least of all annoyances and hardships ; - these valuable qualities of a traveler again ensured him success with his readers ; while the really valuable results of his journey raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for mere amusement . The work before us , is to be regarded as a continuation of Mr. Stephens ' travels in Central America , which were broken off soon after he reached Yucatan , by the illness of the accomplished artist who was his companion . On their return to Yucatan , the Spanish gentlemen , with whom they had become acquainted during their first visit , did all in their power to promote their objects . Letters of recommendation , and fa vorable notices in the newspaper at the capital , gave them every encouragement at the outset of their enterprise . When they reached the interior , the country houses , and the laborers on the farms , were put at their disposal . The curates assisted them with information and advice , and became their most hospitable entertainers . And though few felt much curiosity concerning Indian ruins , and the majority , perhaps , wondered that men could come so far on such a business ; still every kind attention was paid to them , except that of assisting them in their explorations . That would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spaniards of Yucatan . But with all this , the embarrassments they met with , were little less than those of their tour in Cen. tral America . The rainy season was of unusual length , and instead of ending soon after they reached their field , hung on until their frames felt its worst effects , in fever and ague . When they came to a ruin it was overgrown with large trees , to say nothing of bushes , which must be felled , for the sake of the drawings . No surveyor of the route for a railroad at the west , or layer out of cities in the woods , ever had more to do , than our travelers ; and certainly none ever had more inefficient helpers , than an ignorant Maya Indian . Among their troubles , not the smallest arose from the smallest cause . From the bushes which they brushed by , multitudes of garrapatas or wood-ticks dropped upon them , and penetrating the skin , produced such torment , that , between the fever and ague *snd these little animals , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution in not coming away re infecta. * Incidents of Travel in Yucatan ; by JOHN L. STEPHENS . Illustrated by 120 engravings . New York , Harper&amp; 13 rothers , 1843. // The reader is pleased to find that such toils were rewarded by the discovery of a great number of remains . In his former tour , Mr. Stephens went over ground that had been visited before . Palenque had been explored ; Copan had at least been known ; but in Yucatan a multitude of places lay buried in the woods , wholly unknown to foreigners , and a large part of them unvisited by the Spanish inhabitants of the country . It was the high excitement of continual discovery , and the feeling of success , that enabled our travelers to fight with such good courage , against sickness and a host of discomforts ; had they failed of their end , they might have returned with ruined health , or fallen victims to the climate . But the high spirits in which Mr. Stephens writes , prove that he at least is none the worse for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will be soon longing again to break away from the dull life of New York , and penetrate into some new , unexplored field of discovery . May success attend him , wherever he goes , and may Mr. Catherwood be with him , to measure distances , and draw plans , and keep him down to the actual dimensions of things . The features of the country described in these volumes , nre rather monotonous ; and the ruins themselves are sufficiently like one another , to diminish our interest in the latter part of the work . He who has read the description of Uxmal , need go no farther , if he wishes only to form a general notion of the ruined structures . Nor is there much of interest in the present degraded native race , who , having lost their old traditions and distinctive character , have sunk to the condition of mere serfs , however they may be dignified with the name of free citizens of Yucatan . With such materials before him , it might be feared that Mr. Stephens would fall below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very grievous to him , would write a dull book ; but the case is quite otherwise . He has succeeded better , in some respects , than in either of his foregoing attempts . His zeal and cheerfulness carry you along with him , without effort on your part ; he seems more accurate and scrupulous in details , than he has been ; and he finds a thousand things in the present manners and condition of the Yucatanese to speak of , when the old ruins are in danger of becoming an old story . According to the wish with which he closes the work , he may be assured " that there is nothing in these pages to disturb " the pleasant feeling that has existed between him and the reader . We can not , therefore , be very severe towards his faults , yet there is one which we ought to mention , because it affects the value , we mean the permanent value of his work . He has , we think , confined his attention too exclusively to architectural remains ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the ancestors of the Indians now existing , or some other race , constructed the ruins which he has brought to light . The connection of the native American races , with those of the rest of the world , and their relationship to each other , if ever to be made out , must be ascertained by careful study of the usages , civil and religious , and the language of each tribe . It would be , perhaps , unreasonable to expect Mr. Stephens , so soon after his journey , and while as yet he is apparently not very deep in the subject of American antiquities , to talk with authority upon these topics . But it would have greatly added to the value of his work , if he had given an abstract of all that is known in regard to the Mnya nation . At present we know of no book from which any thing , besides scattered particulars , can be gleaned , in the important matter of their religion ; and the meager notices // in the Mithridates , concerning their language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a Spanish Grammar , are nearly all the materials within our reach , by which we can judge of that principal element in a nation 's existence . Surely if he would gratify his own curiosity , and assist in solving a problem , about which he expresses the strongest interest , Mr. Stephens ought to have attended more to these points . And if there were no solution of the problem , still the materials collected for such a purpose , would be of great value . A writer who should do so , would reconstruct , as far as now can be done , the fallen edifice of a nation 's life ; he would give it shape and breath before our eyes ; and whether he could assign it its place on the map of national affinities or not , what he had done would never lose its interest as a part of the history of man . Mr. Stephens ' steps were directed in the first place towards Uxmal , which he had visited in his previous tour , but which he was soon forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This place , the most remarkable and easiest of exploration among all the ruins , with one exception , had been before visited and described by Waldeck ; but it would appear that his researches and drawings did not render future examination unnecessary . Having taken up their abode in one of the chambers of the ruins , the travelers use the troop of Indians residing on the hacienda , to clear away the brushwood which , even since their previous visit , had grown with surprising rankness , and sit down to their work , as to the siege of some fortress ; Mr. Stephens occasionally making visits to neighboring places , and leaving Mr. Catherwood with his instruments , in possession of the ground . We will let the buildings at Uxmal serve as specimens of the Maya architecture , and give some details in regard to them , abridged from the work before us . The building first examined , and called the house of the governor , rests on three terraces , whose united height is forty-two feet ; the lowest presents a front of five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad . The next has a length of five hundred and forty-five feet , and a breadth of two hundred and fifty ; and the third , on which the building stands , is three hundred and sixty by thirty feet . These platforms are support . ed by stone walls , and according to Mr. Stephens the whole structure rises artificially from the plain . That is the case with the great pyramid of Cholula in Mexico , which is over a quarter of a mile long , and one hundred and seventy feet high , but can not compare in elegance of material with the structures of Yucatan , being composed of unbaked bricks alternating with layers of clny. * It is uncertain whether the platforms in Yucatan are in general made by hand , or whether advantage is taken of a rising ground . On one occasion Mr. Stephens , having penetrated into what the natives considered a very remarkable cave , found it to be a series of passages and chambers in one of these mounds formed by art . The Indians of Cholula assured humboldt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one time concealed a number of their warriors , who lay in wait for the Spaniards . But the silence of historians , and the nature of the materials , induce that distinguished traveler to consider this assertion of the Indians as improbable ; although he allows that the pyramid contains cavities of some size . From the second terrace to the third there is no ascent except on the south side and by an inclined plane ; which // makes it necessary for one who has ascended the second in front , that is on the east , to travel half the length of the building and back again , before arriving at the great stair-case of the third terrace , by which the building is finally reached . This mode of gaining the summit , somewhat resembles that which was adopted in the largest temple of the city of Mexico . The stairs there began at the side of the building , and were parallel with one another . After ascending one story , it was necessary to go around the whole temple before coming to the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a journey of more than a mile. * The edifice surmounting these platforms , consists of a double row of narrow chambers , of which every rear one is connected by a door with one in front of it . The palace , for so it deserves to be called , is three hundred and twenty-two feet long , and thirty-nine feet wide . The roof is fiat . The chambers , and indeed all those which were seen in Yucatan , are constructed on a principle which shows a want of knowledge of the arch . The stones of the side walls are laid horizontally , and project inwardly as they ascend . Before the angle is completed by their contact , a roof of stones is laid flat upon them , although in some few instances , the sides meet . In Yucatan , the inside of these triangular arches , if they may be so called , is always made smooth by cutting off the edges of the projecting stones , and usually a slight curve is given to the sides . This mode of building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appendix , " for the extreme narrowness of the rooms in all the buildings , the widest not exceeding twenty feet , and the width more frequently being only from six to ten feet . " That which strikes the eye on examining these , and indeed all the ancient structures of Yucatan , is the extreme richness of the ornaments upon their facades . Usually a number of courses of plain squared stones rise to the height of the doors , and above the doors is found a heavy and elaborately adorned cornice . To judge of the style of the decorations upon these cornices , it is necessary to inspect Mr. Catherwood 's drawings ; and even on them the details are imperfectly exhibited . Justice can be done to these minute carvings only by larger engravings , such as will be published hereafter by our travelers , if the public will encourage the undertaking . It is enough here to say , that many of the ornaments in themselves considered are very elegant ; that certain projecting stones , of a singular form , and unknown use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are found every where throughout the ruins ; that bas-reliefs of serpents , some of them covered with feathers , are of frequent occurrence , and remind one of the close connection of those odious animals with the worship of the Mexicans ; and that here and there hieroglyphics meet the eye . The carefulness of detail in the workmanship of most of the structures in Yucatan , is proof , perhaps , that they bad the same fondness which the Mexicans exhibited for ornaments upon the person ; and the few representations of the human body which were seen argued the same thing , being almost buried in feathers . But we can not infer from it a great degree of civilization , since savage tribes sometimes reach a considerable degree of elegance in the figures with which they tattoo their skins . The style of a remarkable building at Mitla , in the state of Oaxaca , where the Zapotecs lived , is of the same description. * The use to which this building * Clavigero , 17262. * Humboldt , u. s . II , 153. b // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a religious structure , as is not improbable , the numerous apartments were intended perhaps for one of those fraternities of priests or monks , which are known to have swarmed in Mexico , as in the countries where Buddhism prevails . On the higher terrace Mr. Stephens discovered by digging into the ground an image in stone , which represents two lynxes , and may*have been an accompaniment of some idol . It was probably buried by the Spaniards , in order to remove from the sight of the Indians objects fitted to remind them of their old superstition . Not far off from it was found on the surface a stone which from its shape appeared to be a symbol , of frequent occurrence on the eastern continent , but which , as Humboldt asserts , had not when he wrote ( 18l3 ) * been traced in Mexico . If this stone really has the meaning which is given to it ,  --  and similar ones were found repeatedly afterwards ,  --  it will afford a more striking proof than most which have been adduced of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concerning another building at Uxmal , now quite in ruins , certain historical notices are preserved . It is called the house of the dwarf , or of the diviner , and consists of a substructure two hundred and thirty . five feet long and one hundred and fifty-five wide , which rises in nearly a pyramidal form to the height of eighty-eight feet , and has upon its top a long narrow building in three compartments , much ruined , but presenting on its front the most elegant ornaments to be seen in Uxmal . Mr. Stephens thinks that a stair-case , supported on a triangular arch , such as he afterwards found still remaining in another ruined city , led up the pyramid on one side to certain chambers below * humboldt1 u. s . I , 228. the main building just spoken of . Up the eastern front ascends a very steep and narrow stair-case , of which Cogolludo the historian of Yucatan makes mention . He is speaking of the sacrifices performed at the principal teocalli , * or temple of Uxmal , which circumstances point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says he , as translated by Mr. Stephens , " had in his hand a large , broad and sharp knife , made of flint . Another priest carried a wooden collar , wrought like a snake . The persons to be sacrificed were conducted , one by one , up the steps , stark naked , and as soon as laid on the stone , had the collar put upon their necks , and the four priests took hold of the hands and feet . Then the high priest , with wonderful dexterity ripped up the breast , tore out the heart , reeking , with his hands , and showed it to the sun , offering him the heart and steam which came from it . Then he turned to the idol and threw it in his face , which done he kicked the body down the steps , and it never stopped because they were very up . right . One who had been a priest , and had been converted , said that when they tore out the heart of the wretched person sacrificed , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground three or four times till it cooled by degrees , and then he threw the body still moving down the steps . " This account of human sacrifices in Yucatan is the more remarkable , because that horrid custom had not long been established in Mexico . The Toltecs , it is said , who preceded the Aztecs in that country , and to whom most of the institutions which the Spaniards found among the Aztecs are ascribed , used unbloody offerings of fruits and flowers , of gums and seeds . The Az- * A Mexican word used in speaking of these temples built on pyramids , and derived from teoti , god , ( tee being the root , and ti a termination , ) and *xelli , house . 4 // tees continued the same rites until the year 1317 , when they immolated the first human victims , in order to terrify the nation of the Coihuans , whose subjects they then were . The custom not long afterwards became a familiar one . At first their principal deity , Mexitli , the god of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed a part of the worship of the other divinities . The Totonacs , who lived around what is now Vera Cruz , adopted the sanguinary worship of the Aztecs ; but had a tradition that the goddess of the fields should triumph at last over the bloodthirstiness of the other gods , and re-establish unbloody offerings . War seems to have been the cause which increased the religious ferocity of the Aztecs , and which by increasing their empire spread their dreadful usages . To such a degree it is said had their original character altered , that men even devoured parts of the human victims whom the priests threw down the Teocallis ,  --  a rite performed no doubt in honor of the god whose worship the priests were celebraping at the top of the pyramid , and within sight of the people below . Such is the account to be found in Humboldt and other authorities , * and received as part of the Mexican history . Now what shall we say of the existence of the same rite among the Mayas . Did it creep in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mexican tradition , and consider the rite as an antiquated one , revived in circumstances calculated to harden , and render ferocious the national character . The latter hypothesis appears to us most probable , particularly as human sacrifices have existed under almost every system of heathenism , and then ceased at the beginning of civilization . In South America the influence of the leading nation , the Peruvians , was of * Humboldt , u. s. 1,216. just the opposite nature to that of the Mexicans . With the spread of their power , and by means of the sword , human sacrifices , it is said , were abolished , and a mild religion extended . If the ceremonies performed at this building prove an identity of religious rites with the Mexican , another structure shows that the same games were known to both nations . This consists of two parts , or two distinct edifices , seventy feet distant from one another , and to all appearance exactly alike . The sides facing each other were adorned with sculptures , and " in the center of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great stone rings . " The use to which these rings and buildings were put , fully revealed itself to Mr. Stephens some time after he left Uxmal , upon seeing a similar ruin at Chicen-itza . The Mexicans , according to Herrera , as quoted by Mr. Stephens , were accustomed to play in similar places with balls of India rubber , which they threw up into the air with such a force and direction as to make them pass through stone rings fixed in the wall . He who did this won the game , and had the right to appropriate the cloaks of all the bystanders as his prize . The most magnificent of all the buildings at Uxmal , when they were in their glory , must have been those now called the house of the nuns . They stand on the highest of three terraces , and iire arranged in a quadrangle around a court . They consist of nearly a hundred chambers , constructed on the same principle with those of the house of the governor . The fronts looking upon the court " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richest and most intricate carving known in the art of the builders of Uxmal , presenting a scene of strange magnificence , surpassing any that is now to be seen among the ruins. ** Among the decorations of one of // the façades , the most remarkable are two colossal serpents , entwined and " encompassing nearly all the ornaments throughout its whole length , " which was one hundred and seventy three feet when the building was entire . One of the serpents has a human head in its open jaws , and the usual addition of feathers as a covering of their bodies is not wanting . The ruins of Yucatan astonish us as much by their frequency as by their vastness and the sculptured work lavished upon them . With the exception of a voyage to the eastern coast , Mr. Stephens confined his researches within an equilateral triangle of about eighty miles base ; and not more than half of this area , as appears from his map , was thoroughly explored . A part of the structures known to have existed when the Spaniards came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in building churches or Franciscan convents . In the general ignorance and listlessness of the inhabitants , it is fair to presume that multitudes of ruins still lie hid in the woods within a moderate distance of the villages , while others may be so overgrown with trees and shrubs as not to be distinguishable from hills . Now within the space above named , some thirty ruins or more have been brought to light by the investigations of our travelers ; most of which are so near one another , that a short morning walk on an open road would have brought the inhabitants together . Some of them are more numerous and others vaster than the ruins at Uxmal . At Kabah , to which place a paved street of pure white stone according to the tradition of the Indians ran from Uxmal , there are remains of fifteen edifices , one of which stands on a terrace eight hundred feet long . At Zayi , a building three stories high was found ; or to speak more properly , three structures ri* sing one above another , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the third on the top of the mound . A mile distant from this another buIlding was discovered upon a terrace of fifteen hundred feet in length . In short , no where in the world , perhaps , are clearer indications given by ancient remains of a dense population , and of the power of priests and princes to concentrate the energies of a nation upon great public works . And all these stones , it should be remembered , were hewn , and these sculptures , excepting the few instances where they were done in stucco , were chiseled with instruments of so poor a material as copper* or flint out of the limestone rock . Almost all the ruins of Yucatan are square , and face the cardinal points . One or two , however , are round like the temples of the god of the winds in Mexico , which took that form to denote that " round and round goeth the wind , and ever continueth its circuits . " The lintels of the doors and window are generally not of stone , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of these are more curiously carved than any thing else . Here and there short columns with capitals and bases were discovered . A few paintings only have escaped the ravages of time . In one of the buildings of Chichen.itza , a number of rude figures appear , executed quite in the Mexican style , with head ornaments as lofty as the whole person besides . The flesh of the men is of a reddish brown color , and that of the women of a somewhat lighter tint . A boat with its * It is certain that iron was not used on this continent . Humboldt possessed a Peruvian chisel of copper , alloyed with one sixteenth of tin ; and observes that this mixture has great hardness , 1.260 .

Antiq. p. 196. // crew appears among the representations , and one man is diving into the water . Nothing , however , either sculptured or painted , has been found in Yucatan , which can compare with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be predicated of the grotesque and deformed conceptions of the human person , above which , it would appear , the Indians of this continent could not rise . A few hieroglyphics are noticed by Mr. Stephens , but his discoveries in this line are by no means equal to those which he made at Copan , upon his journey into Central America . At Uxmal , Waldeck* speaks of seeing the hieroglyphics of the twenty days of the month , upon one of the facades of the house of the nuns . But of such emblems Mr. Stephens says nothing , when speaking of the same building . Another of Waldeck 's assertions is , that the court of the same structure is paved with stones six inches square , each of which is exquisitely cut with the figure of a tortoise . There are , he goes on to say , forty-three thousand six hundred and sixty of these , and though composed of a very hard stone , they appear much worn . It is singular enough , that Mr. Stephens could find nothing of this pavement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the court-yard . As Waldeck could have no motive to invent such a story , the probability is that he found tortoises there , which may have fallen from the sculptured building into the court . Believing them to be part of a pavement , he reached the prodigious number which he assigns to them , merely by his arithmetic . A symbol of the simplest kind , and of extreme frequency throughout the ruins , was the print of the human hand in red paint . This was first noticed , when the very thick back wall of the gov-54 governor 's house at Uxmal was pierced for the purpose of discovering hidden passages , if any there might be . It is found in obscure parts of the buildings , and even within the mason-work , and may have been intended for a charm ; for which purpose , according to a communication from Mr. Schoolcraft , the same mark in white or colored clay , is applied to the bodies of the dancers , at the festivities of our American Indians . Mr. Stephens notices the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the size of the Maya Indian 's hand at the present day . There is another kind of public works , concerning which Mr. Stephens has obtained some valuable information . We refer to the artificial means employed by the old inhabitants , for preserving a plentiful supply of water . There are scarcely any springs or brooks throughout the district visited by our travelers ; and the waters of the rainy season sink , for the most part , into caves in the limestone . Some of the caves are the only resource of the present inhabitants in the dry season . In one of them , visited by Mr. Stephens , at a place called Bolonchen , or the Nine Wells , the water is at a perpendicular depth of four hundred and fifty feet , and is not reached without taking a journey of a quarter of a mile under ground . Another natural reservoir is known by the name of senotes , by which is to be understood large circular pools with sides of rock , of unknown depth , and from fifty to two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruins of Chichen* Itza , and were probably the cause why a city was built in that place . But the great population which covered at least a part of Yucatan , could not have depended on these natural wells alone . A * Chi-chen means well 's mouth , and refers to these reservoirs . * See Bradford , p. 100 . Vol . I. // sufficiency of water obtained by artificial means , must have been a primary care of a people living in such a territory . Accordingly it is found that the ancient Mayas excavated a great number of places , now called aguadas , which appear like ponds ; most of these lie neglected , and filled with mud ; but some which have been cleared out of late , to the great advantage of the neighborhood , prove to be paved at the bottom , and to be furnished with pits and with wells , also paved , and intended as a last resort , after the aguada itself should be dried up . On removing the mud from one of these pools , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones . " These were so laid upon each other , that the stones of each upper layer were put upon the seams of the layer under it , " and the interstices were filled in with clay of red and brown color , of a different character from any in the neighborhood . The stones were many layers deep , and he did not go down to the bottom , lest by some accident , the foundation should be injured . " In another aguada , where the Indians had been in the habit of digging pits , in order to collect the water which filtered through the mud , " they struck upon an ancient well , which was found to be of singular form and construction . It had a square platform at the top , , and beneath was a round well , faced with smooth stones from twenty to twenty-five feet deep . Below this was another square platform , and under the latter another well of less diameter , and about the same depth . The discovery of this well , induced farther excavations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , were prosecuted until upward of forty wells were discovered . These were all cleared out , and the whole aguada repaired , since which it furnishes a supply during the greater part of the dry season , and when this fails , the wells appear , and continue the supply , until the rains come on again . " Nor ought the walls of the ancient cities to pass without notice . At the ruins of Maya pan , once the capital of the whole country , Mr. Stephens was told by the only man who had ever made examinations , that " within a circumference of three miles , ruins were found , and that a strong wall once encompassed the city , the remains of which might still be traced through the woods . " On the western coast , Mr. Stephens discovered the wall of an inconsiderable town , so entire that he was able to walk upon the top of it throughout its whole length . It consists of rough stones laid without mortar , is from eight to thirteen feet in thickness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its course three sides of a rectangle , the sea being the fourth . At the corners there are watch-towers , still in good preservation . The present Indians of Yucatan have retained little or no knowledge of the history of their fathers . As soon as they were subdued , they fell into peaceful and quiet submission to the Spanish yoke , exchanged their bloody rites for the forms of papacy , and their ferocious priests for others of milder dispositions , and seem as if they could not be the descendants of the race whose energy reared , at the cost of such a vast amount of labor , such remarkable buildings . It is very natural , that without letters , and so far as appears , old songs to keep up their recollection of past achievements , with a new religion , which cuts them off from the past national worship , as completely as if they were a newly created race , and with no stirnulus whatever in their condition ,  --  we say it is very natural that in these circumstances , all the traditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should be ignorant of the hieroglyphics upon the ruins , and of those other things in which the // science of their forefathers consisted . It was the policy of their conquerors to obliterate all memorials of the past . The old divisions of time gave way to saints ' days , and the old idols they were taught to regard as demons . The little that is yet known of the institutions of the Mayas , excepting their architecture , is preserved by means chiefly of ecelesiastics of an inquisitive turn of mind , who received their information from converts . Some of these converts also became acquainted with the use of letters , and left manuscripts in their native language , treating of the usages of their fathers . The very few intelligent persons who have devoted themselves to this study , have derived their information from Maya and Spanish manuscripts , penned not very long , perhaps , after the conquest , and it does not seem probable that much can be gleaned from Indians living near the Spaniards , who have long abandoned their old superstitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unlikely , heathens of this race living in unfrequented parts , we may hope that discoveries in regard to the race , will yet be made by enterprising travelers . Mr. Stephens was fortunate in meeting in the interior of Yucatan , with an intelligent Spanish gentleman , Don Pio Perez by name , who had filled an important office at the capital , and was then the principal magistrate at the town of Peto ; and who had given himself to the study of the Maya language and antiquities . The information which he communicated , and of which a part is given in the appendix , is of the most valuable description . It relates to the method of reckoning time among the Indians , to their historical traditions , and their language . According to Don Pio 's account , the Maya calendar very closely resembles the Mexican , and beyond a question is to be referred to the same source . The Mexicans , long before the discovery of this continent , seem to have had a year of three hundred and sixty-five days. * This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days each , and into eighteen months of twenty days ; at the end of which were arranged five supplementary days , included in no month . These twenty days had their distinguishing names and symbols , the latter of which are of frequent occurrence in the hieroglyphics . The number twenty was , no doubt , suggested by the fingers and toes of the human body ; the number thirteen , which seems to be known to the calendars of no nations out of America , was used either on account of the time between new and full , and between full and new moon , when that luminary is visible , or on account of its convenience in intercalating and in reckoning . For as three hundred and sixty-five is one more than twenty-eight times thirteen , if a year began with the first day of the thirteen , the next would begin with the second , and so on through thirteen years , when the cycle would go round again . At the end of fifty-two years , or four times thirteen , occurred the intercalation of thirteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in effect , the Juli* an calendar , only that the intercalation was made not every fourth year , but all at once , at the end of the period , when the deficiency in the number of days had amounted to the elementary number thirteen . It is even said by the most thorough of the Mexican writers on this subject , and seems to receive the sanction of Humboldt , that at the end of every other great period , twelve and not thirteen days were inserted . If this is really so , it implies remarkably close observation , for it * See the elaborate essay of Humboldt , I , 276 , in which we believe the Mexican calendar , according to Gama 's accurate researches , was first fully explained to the learned . // makes the year only 2 ' 39 " too short , and causes the loss of but a day in about four centuries . Besides the year of three hundred and sixty-five days , the Mexicans had another of twenty times thirteen days , which is somewhat used in their history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercalary days , contained one thousand four hundred and sixty , or four times three hundred and sixty-five such periods . The Mexicans applied this calendar , with considerable skill , to their history . In the first place , they counted by the number of cycles of fifty-two years , that had elapsed since leaving their old habitation in Aztlan . Then to determine the year of the cycle , they made use of the numbers up to thirteen , and one of four signs or names of years which followed each other in constant repetition . If , for instance , we use A , B , C , D , for the signs of the year , the order would be 1 . A , 2 . B , 3 . C , 4 . D , 5 . A , and so on to 13 . A. Then would follow 1 . B , 2 . C , and so on . It is obvious that in this cycle the same letter and number would never come together twice . In much the same way , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , ( the last number being chosen on account of its measuring three hundred and sixty , ) the days of the year were distinguished from one another , in a very effectual way . This method of computing time is , indeed , long and complicated in words , but probably shorter in hieroglyphics . Nor is great brevity to be expected of a nation , whose words would take the time while " one might walk to Mile-end green " in pronouncing . The Mexicans connected with these cycles or bundles , as they called them , of fifty-two years , the termination of their mythological ages . These ages , as in some parts of Asia , where a similar view prevailed , closed with the destruction of living things , and began with their regeneration . They are called the ages of the earth , or of giants , of fire , of air , and of water , and have thus a remarkable correspondence with the four elements of antiquity . At the end of each age , some human being escaped the catastrophe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own shape . A sin , le pair survived the deluge of the fourth age , in the form of men , by means of a canoe of pine . The Mexicans at the end of every cycle , became Millerites , and looked forward with the utmost dread , for the fifth destruction . Then was there heard through all Patamba 's streets , The warning voice , woe ! woe ! the sun hath reached The limits of his course ; he hath fulfilled The appointed cycle ! Fast and weep and pray ; Four suns have perished ; fast and weep and pray , Lest the fifth perish also . We must refer the reader to Madoc , for a powerful description of the horror , the silence , the extinction of fires , and the awful rites , which closed the cycles , in expectation of an approaching catastrophe . Southey , however , follows the early Spanish writers , in making a succession of the ages , which Humboldt denies to be the right one . The Mayas had the same length of the year with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty ; the same period or indiction of thirteen years , and cycle of fifty-two . When and how they intercalated , Mr. Perez does not inform us ; but this part of the system can hardly have been separated from the other . Their months and their twenty days , have appellations unlike in form and perhaps in meaning , // to those of ' Mexico . It is remarkable that a number of ' the names are without meaning , in the present language , or have become obsolete , and that several of the days of the month had the same names among natives of Chiapas , Oaxaca , and Soconusco , where a similar calendar was in vogue . They had again the same complicated method which the Mexicans adopted , to distinguish the days of the year , and the year of the cycle . Whether their mythological system included the ages of the Mexicans , the learned Spaniard does not say ; but Waldeck affirms that their traditions made mention of three , the last of which was ended by a deluge. * In adjusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hundred and twelve years , or thirteen periods of twenty-four years each , which is minutely described by Mr. Perez , who adds that some have erroneously supposed each period to consist of only twenty years each . They began their year on the 16th of July.t " It is worthy of notice , " says this gentleman , " that having sought to make it begin from the precise day on which the sun returns to the zenith of this peninsula , on his way to the southern regions , and being destitute of instruments for their astronomical observations , and guided only by the naked eye , they erred only fortyeight hours in advance . " Don Pio Perez has also communicated to Mr. Stephens , a document of considerable interest relating to the history of the Mayas . It is probably the only one of its kind : it is written in the aboriginal language by a Christian convert long after the conquest , and as well for that reason , as on account of our ignorance of the author and his sources , to be received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the founders of the nation in Yucatan from certain towns or districts which we can not identify , and which perhaps like those where the Toltecs and Aztecs of Mexico first lived , may be mythological . Then succeeds the history of the nation in the peninsula , or island , as the manuscript calls it , arranged according to periods , not of twenty four years , as explained by Perez , but of twenty . The chronology is somewhat confused ; and the attempt at settling it quite unsuccessful ; but as much as this may be made out , that at least one thousand and eighty seven years had elapsed from the time when the ancestors of the nation began to emigrate from their unknown dwelling places , to the arrival of the Spaniards in the country . That would carry their traditions back to the year four hundred of our era . It would be of no use to enter into the details of this chronicle . Suffice it to say , that a century after they entered the country , they settled in Bacalar , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town of Chichen-itza , where very important ruins now are to be seen ; that the holy men ' of this place then abandoned it and went to live at Champoton , on the gulf of Mexico ; * that after this , they returned and lived for several epochs under the uninhabited mountains ; and that then they spread themselves over that part of Yucatan where the ruins have been discovered ; several of the more important places there being named in the manuscript , and * Near this place , and on the river of the same name , some leagues in the interior , there are , according to Mr. Norman , many ruins of a kind of sculpture displaying the finest taste , but partially buried beneath water and earth . The same traveler obtained from a mound , seven leagues to the north of Campeachy , a collection of idols , unlike those which have been found in Mexico , together with some earthen vessels . * See Bradford , 32*3 . Waldeck says , on the 12th of January , which is one hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year began on the 9th of January . // the first establishment of one of the caciques at Uxmal being mentioned with its precise date . That date would fall nearly in the middle of the eleventh century . After the settlement of this place , several divisions of the nation are spoken of ; wars arose between them , and one of their cities was destroyed by strangers of the highlanders . ' The manuscript seems to us to preserve a very straight-forward and modest tradition . We see from it , that the Mayas entered the country few in number , and wandered at first from side to side of the peninsula . It is not unnatural to suppose that the highlanders mentioned above , were earlier inhabitants . The nation by degrees divided itself into somewhat independent parts , and these harassed one another . In his summary of this manuscript , Mr. Perez calls the first Maya settlers in Yucatan , Toltecs . It would be interesting no doubt , to trace them back to that early nation from whom tradition derives all the arts and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who , as the pioneers of civilization , are called by Humboldt the Pelasgi of the American continent . But we see nothing in the manuscript which thus authorizes us to connect the two races , unless it be in the names of the unknown places where they first lived , and about which M. Perez may possess some knowledge which he has not imparted to others . And indeed , if the dates of the record are to be relied upon at all , they go back farther than the annals of the Toltecs , whose migration from a northern region by the common consent of historians , is assigned to the sixth century before Christ. * After them , * The authorities for the date originally were Mexicans , who , at and soon after the conquest , well understood the native history preserved in hieroglyphics . Some of the facts of Mexican history are the subjects of hieroglyphics still extant . from the same quarter , came other nations speaking according to the Mithridates the same language , the last and most powerful of whom were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year 1160 . Before they arrived in Mexico , the Toltecs had been broken up and dispersed by pestilence . A part of them traveled into Central America , but as an actual nation long since disappeared . Now if these things are so , and if the dates of the Maya history can be relied upon ; the latter appeared first on the stage of history , and may for aught we know , have been the first to make unprovements in the arts . And if the nations who successively appeared in Mexico spoke one language , as the best authorities maintain , the Mayas can not have belonged to that race , since their grammar and words are widely different . No competent philologist has as yet thoroughly studied the Maya language . Its peculiarities of course strike the eye , on first glancing at the imperfect accounts of its grainmatical system which are within our reach ; its resemblances to other languages of the continent can only be fully known to one who has explored it with care . It agrees with the Mexican in having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ g , r , s , and the Spanish j ; and has five or 5LX sounds chiefly guttural , peculiar to itself . Its closest affinities are with certain dialects of Central America , as that of the Quich6 Indians , who resembled the Mayas in being a cultivated tribe at the conquest . Its general aspect is one of greater simplicity ; of a seemingly nearer approach to the languages of easternmost Asia , than the American languages in general exhibit . It makes no distinction of gender and number by means of its forms ; and thus departs from that law according to which so many of the American dialects distinguish // by the termination between animate and inanimate objects . It uses , like the Mexican , numerous endings to form derivative nouns and adjectives ; but the two dialects differ much in the terminations which they adopt . It excels the Mexican in having a comparative form for its adjective . Its numerals are wholly distinct from those of the Mexican ; and this diversity of numeral roots *n the languages of the continent , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity of the tribes . Did they count by gestures , and on their fingers and toes until they separated , or how happens it that they have departed in so important a class of words from the primeval type ? In the Mexican the numerals , from six to nine inclusive , are obvious compounds of a root standing for five united to one , two , three and four . This appears not to be the case in the Maya . Both languages , like a great many other American ones , make twenty , or a score , the chief element in counting . Thus one hundred is five score , one hundred and twenty , six score . The Mexican pursues this system of twenties farther , having a distinct name for the square of twenty , or a score of scores , and for its cube ; and these in a certain sense take the place which the square and cube of ten occupy in other systems . In personal pronouns the Maya language is rich . It has a distinct form of them , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a pronominal subject , and thus to a certain degree supplies the want of that important verb which is unknown to many of the native languages. * Its verbs are divided into four conjugations , one appropriated to neuters and passives , and three to active verbs ; the tenses are denoted partly by endings , and partly by auxiliary words , and the form is unchanged through the persons . It has a large number of naked monosyllabic roots , which give it a widely different aspect from the dialects of Mexico . Composition is effected in many cases at least , by simple juxtaposition , ( with the aid no doubt of a principal accent on one of the syllables , ) and it is said that elisions are of frequent occurrence , as hap. pens in the compound words of our North American Indians . As examples of composition and derivation , we offer from kab , hands , the words , naakab , thumb , jalkab , fingers , chumuckab , middle-finger , kalcab , wrist , pocol-cab , washing hands , tancab , * palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For these examples , we are indebted to the vocabulary in the work of Mr. Norman , who has meritoriously endeavored to give his readers a general view of the Maya Indians , as they once were , and has not confined himself to architectural remains . Mr. Stephens received from the Spanish gentleman whom we have often named , a copious vocabulary of several thousand Maya words and a series of grammatical forms , but has not published it in his work . We hope that before long he will let it be known , either through the transactions of some learned society , or as an appendix to a new edition of his travels . Our readers will probably think , after the view that has been presented of the Maya nation , that the question which so greatly interested Mr. Stephens , whether this nation constructed the edifices of Yucatan now in ruins , may be very safely and confidently answered in the affirmative . If their traditions reach Two of these wor ( ls ought probably to be spelt with k instead 0f C. K stands for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * This is noticed by the distinguished philologist , Win . von Humboldt , in the introduction to his work on the Kawi language , VoL 1 , p 284. // back to the founding of the ruined cities , if their accurate calendar displays as much of science as their sculptures do of art ; if their religious rites were celebrated in these ruins at , and even after the Spanish conquest , how can we suppose that they stepped into the place of an earlier and more civilized race , which race can no where be found either in tradition , or among existing nations ? And if some should think that the present Indians are too weak , indolent and degraded , to be the descendants of such a race as reared the monuments of Yucatan , a few considerations , we think , will satisfy them that there is no improbability in supposing that a period of national prosperity may be succeeded by even greater degeneracy than we here behold . If some violent cause , such as conquest , takes away the motives that were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the persons who applied those motives , and who alone could apply them , what is there to prevent the old national life from being extinguished ; nay , what can maintain it after it has undergone such a catastrophe ? It seems probable that all the nations of this continent , which rose above the level of barbarism , had a powerful priesthood , allied by interest and perhaps by blood with the governing families , in whose hands the knowledge possessed in the nation was lodged , and whose control over the common people , founded upon religious notions , was absolute . The greatness of the empire of Mexico was built on a close union between the priests and the nobles or chief warriors . The high priest is said to have been generally of royal blood . The empire founded by the Incas of Peru has been called a monastic despotism . Now if invaders , such as the Spaniards , become the masters in such a country , the princes , and more particularly the priests , are destroyed by death or flee to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the execution of the laws , the religious rites , the sway over others by means of fear and communication with the gods , the knowledge of the calendar and the hieroglyphics-these have vanished away ; and the mass of the nation is in nearly the same circumstances as if they never had had the institutions which raised them a little above their neighbors . Now we are led to believe , by comparing their religious rites with those of the Mexicans , and by other considerations , that the priests and nobles of the Mayas exercised supreme control in the nation . If so , there is nothing strange in their having large masses of men at their disposal ; in their constructing large buildings as palaces or temples , and in their leaving a void , when they passed away , which was equivalent to the destruction of the national life and civilization . How could a nation recover from such a shock , and go on just as before . If the brahmins and warrior caste among the Hindoos , or the priestly caste and princes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monuments of literature and architectural art , at which the world now wonders , were completed , no doubt the same thing would have taken place in those countries also ; and the Greek traveler who first penetrated into such a region , and compared the ancient monuments with the barbarism and ignorance of the inhabitants of his own time , would very probably have assigned the monuments to a prior race of men , and have broached some theory in explanation , which the next generation of his countrymen would have received for historical truth . Another inquiry which naturally arises is , whence did these Indians derive their arts ? This inquiry seems sometimes to imply in the minds of those who make it the // supposition that the arts and sciences must have one single origin ; that one favored nation was the depository of these blessings ; that like the torches in the games they passed from one people to another , and were enkindled but at one spot . Now this in its widest extent is a very false supposition . It is opposed to history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another , and ascribes civilization , where it has existed , to combined causes , partly internal and partly external . It is opposed to what we know of our common nature and origin . If all men are of one blood , all ought to retain some fragments of those arts which the race probably possessed before a catastrophe of which so many of their traditions make mention . And if all have one nature , inventive power and genius ought not to be absolutely confined to one place , but be spread in very different proportions perhaps  --  but still be spread whereever barbarism had not entirely embruted the human mind . Civilization is a thing of parts , and is drawn from many sources . In one quarter the Arabic numerals arose , in another the art of navigation , in another still , metallurgy ; and thus no quarter of the world can boast itself against another and say , " I have had no need of thee . " Nor is the existence of the same arts , or institutions , or forms of religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived them from the other . Necessities common to those who live under the same sky , or who are at a similar stage in civilization , and views of the operations of nature , arising from the common properties of the human mind , may often have caused resemblances in nations that have grown up apart , and with no influence on each other 's life . It is only when resemblances are close , and particularly rn things which are arbitrary , that a special connection between na tions becomes probable , unless there is a historical probability that at one time they lived together . Striking agreement in such a thing as language , where much is arbitrary , or rather depends on special and slight causes , is a better reason for putting two nations in the same group than a very considerable similarity in their civil and religious institutions . The remarkable coincidences which Humboldt traces out between the names of the signs in the zodiacs of eastern Asia and the appellations of some of the Mexican months , is stronger proof that the race of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by parallels in many things where nations are less capricious , such as the mode of building and the ceremonies of worship . If there is justice in these remarks , we should with caution attribute the proficiency of all the nations of this continent to one source  --  to the Toltecs , for instance , to whom Mexican tradition goes back as the source of the institutions in that country . That the American Indians , though unquestionably of the same race , have for many ages formed distinct communities , is proved by the great diversities in their dialects . Some of these tribes lived on and near the soil of Mexico when the Toltecs came there . Now it is remarkable that some of these tribes , if the existing remains are any proof , far excelled the Mexican group of Indians in sculpture and in architecture . We may admit , then , the probability that these arts were native among them , or at least not derived from the Mexicans . On the other hand , the great proficiency of this latter nation in celestial observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the names of the months in the Maya tongue being not significant are probably foreign ,  --  these circumstances show that the Mayas borrowed their calendar , and that // it may have come from Mexico . There was a number of tribes in Central America and just north of it , who made far greater advances in civilization than most of their brethren . Whether their dominion was once more extensive than we know it now to have been , and whether the more northern ruins should be ascribed to some of them , we do not presume to say . To this group of tribes the Mexican tribes , after their mythical emigration , belonged ; and , as neighbors are wont to do , borrowed from them and gave to them in return . Into the proofs of the common origin of the Indian race in both Americas , we do not mean to enter ; still less do we propose to trace out their affinities with the nations of the rest of the world . In regard to this latter point we must refer our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which nearly all the facts known and results reached before 1840 are assembled , and in which it is maintained that the red race has had a very wide diffusion over Etruria , Egypt , Madagascar , ancient Scythia , eastern Asia , and through the islands of Polynesia . In regard to the former point we will only say here , that ancient skeletons recently examined , among the rest one of a female brought from Yucatan by Mr. Stephens , add their weight to that of the many other convincing arguments in favor of referring all the tribes of the continent to one source . Mr. Stephens gives us numerous sketches of the present condition of the Indians . The picture is by no means a pleasing one , although it reveals mild traits of character and a capacity for improvement . They live in general on the plantations of Spanish proprietors , and occupy their patches of ground on condition of performing a certain amount of work for the landlord . The treatment of them differs not essentially from that of serfs . In some few cases they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village where the Indians form a peculiar society : the lands are owned in common ; their cookery is done by wholesale at one hut ; and they are expected to marry within the village . We recommend to Mr. Greeley and others who are visited with new illuminations about socialism to make a pilgrimage to this fraternity . The Indians of Yucatan are now free and independent , but their freedom bodes little good . An age of disquiet seems to lie before them . It is apprehended in the country itself , that they may imitate the Indians of Central America , and form a native party opposed to the Spaniards . Meanwhile the priests , to whom certainly the praise of kindness and humanity towards them is due , seem to be attempting nothing , and we know not what the government will dare to attempt , in order to make them fit for liberty.
