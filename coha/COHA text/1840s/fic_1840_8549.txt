INTRODUCTION . The following dramatic sketch , written some years ago , though but recently produced , was so well received on its representation , both before a New York and a Buffalo audience , that the author is induced to lay it before the public in a printed form , for the gratification of many of his friends , who have expressed a desire to obtain copies . The author is quite aware that it is in many respects faulty ; but he had not leisure to review it and " with ; all its imperfections on its head , " sends it forth to judgement . DRAMATIS PERSON .

SCENE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre ;  --  two gothic chairs on : Blanche and Martyn discovered seated ; Blanche R. H. Martyn L. H. Blanche . Blanche  --  Yes , as I was saying , Martyn , my old mother used to talk to us at winter nights about the weather and grandeur of our old master 's family . Martyn . Martyn  --  I have heard much of the greatness of their ancestors . Let me see , how long is it Blanche , since Sir Philip 's father died ? Blanch . Blanche  --  Let me reckon ,  --  I was just fifteen the day he died , and now  --  ( I 'm almost ashamed to own it )  --  Martyn . Martyn  --  Ashamed ! and why ? Blanche . Blanche  --  Because it 's a great age to come to and have no husband , so it is . Martyn . Martyn .  --  Ah ! what age ? Blanch . Blanche  --  Well then , Martyn , as you are my master 's private friend as well as servant , you shall know ;  --  I 'm twenty  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm almost afraid to tell  --  it sticks in my throat  --  come nearer Martyn ; ( They draw their chairs nearer ) Now do n't mention it for the world ;  --  I  --  I 'm twenty-four ! Martyn . Martyn  --  Twenty-four ! Blanch . Blanche  --  But now Martyn , I 'm sure I do n't look a day more than fifteen ; do I ? Martyn . Martyn  --  I 've seen many at fifteen less handsome ! Blanch . Blanche  --  Oh ! thank you Martyn , thank you ; I always said you were a man of taste ; though the back-biting news-mongers do talk about you . Martyn . Martyn  --  Ah ! what do they say ? Blanch . Blanche  --  Why everything , because you turn the tenants of our master out of doors when they do n't pay their rent ;  --  now that 's not your fault ; and they speak of our master as a brute , and say that he behaved in a most shameful manner to his brothers ! Martyn . Martyn  --  You say brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blanch . Blanche  --  Oh no ; he had two , but the younger is long since dead  --  he died abroad , and they say that Sir Philip was the cause of his banishment . Now I 'm very careful of what I say about Sir Philip , but I do think he might make some provision for poor Reginald his only living brother . ( Peter Frost , heard L. H. They rise suddenly . ) Frost , Peter Frost ( without. )  --  Blanche ! Blanche ! Blanch . Blanche  --  Coming , Peter ! ( crossing to L. ) How the old fellow frightened me !  --  But Martyn , it 's the opinion that Sir Philip is no better than he should be  --  though I would'nt say a word against him  --  why he 's a brute  --  a miser  --  a wicked , wretched , horrid man  --  but I would'nt speak a word against him ;  --  for this is such a slanderous world that I should'nt be at all astonished if some day people talked about me ; out I 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old as Peter Frost . Exit . L. H. 1st E. Martyn . Martyn  --  So ! Suspicion is afloat !  --  Sir Philip however will never heed it ;  --  yet the stronger he pursues his wicked course the sooner must he reach its end ! Enter Peter Frost , L. H. 1st E. Peter . Peter Frost  --  Ah ! Martyn , is that you ? well , well , you are Sir Philip 's favorite ,  --  you are the only one he dare not vent his spleen upon ,  --  he calls me an old fool ! ah , well , his kind father ( Heaven bless his memory , ) never used the old man thus ; I have grown gray in the service of the family ; ah ! like the heartless hunter , he rides his horse till infirmity and age creep upon him , then lets the poor beast drag out life as he can . Martyn . Martyn  --  Has Sir Philip used you ill ? Peter . Peter Frost  --  Ay ! and thrust me from him as he would a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wished to see him . Martyn . Martyn  --  Did he admit him ? Peter . Peter Frost  --  No alack , he would leave him to beggary while he revels in their father 's halls ; ah ! the old man was the dupe of Sir Philip , his bastard too ! well , well , I shall soon die and he 'll be rid of his burthen . I 'm a very old man , three score and eighteen ! Ah , here comes the poor Reginald . Enter Reginald , L. H. 1st E. Reginald . Reginald  --  Speak , honest Peter , will my brother see me ? Peter . Peter Frost  --  Alack ! he does refuse , and he bade me have thee thrust from the door ! Regin . Reginald  --  The heartless wretch ! but I 'll yet have my revenge : I 'll proclaim to the world  --  Peter . Peter Frost  --  Hush ! hush ! not so loud , he is in his study ! Regin . Reginald  --  I care not ! and the fiend shall yet be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir , for Heaven 's sake forbear ; should he hear your threats  --  ( approaching him . Regin . Reginald  --  Pander ! minion , base satellite of a monster , I stand in my rightful halls . Martyn . Martyn  --  Rail on , sir , you know me not . returns . Peter . Peter Frost  --  Reginald , good boy , come with me , I 'll try to calm Sir Philip , and you may see him presently : ah , boy ! I remember when thou wert born ;  --  I nursed thee and thy brother Albert : Poor Albert ! he 's dead now ; well , we must all die in time ! Regin . Reginald  --  Who drove my brother from his father 's house ? who discarded me ? This fiend that bears the form of man . Sir Philip . Sir Philip  --  ( Without C. D. )  --  Rascal ! I 'll scourge thy bones bare . Servant . Servant  --  ( C. D. )  --  Mercy ! mercy Sir P. Sir Philip  --  ( C. D. )  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry of a servant heard at back ;  --  Peter urges Reginald off , L. H. Sir Philip beats a servant on at C. D. Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Dost know me knave ! wilt banter with me thus ? I 'll have thee flay 'd and salted ; ' t is a good And smarting med'cine , and will teach thee better Manners . Hence from my sight . ( Exit Serv't . ) Now Martyn , tell me , hast collected all My rents ? hast dealt with all as I commanded ? Enforced the law and shown no spark of mercy ? Martyn . Martyn  --  I have . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Good ! right ! Is that vile Ploughwell cast in jail ? Martyn . Martyn  --  He is ; his wife and children are much distressed . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  My heart is adamant  --  invulnerable To the implorings of the wretched dogs . A stranger unto pity is my soul . I live to serve myself and banquet on My own won thrift as suits my stubborn will ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My wealth 's my world , o'er which I monarch am ; They call me bastard ;  --  let them call me fiend , Monster , what they will ; I 'll drown their railings With the music of my gold :  --  almighty gold ! That lifts the blackest soul of crime to fame  --  ' T is the world 's honor , human nature 's idol ! Martyn . Martyn  --  Know you that your brother is without ? Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Brother ! a dog , that barks about my place , As tho ' it were his own ! let him beware The poachers gun  --  I hate him as a serpent That crawls along the path that I must tread . Good Martyn , list , I 'd ask a service of thee . Martyn . Martyn  --  Command me , I 'm yours . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Listen ! ( They sit . ) My father had three sons born unto him By Reginald 's fair mother ;  --  I the first , But yet no wedlock blest my birth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's frowns ; The lawful , favoured offspring I despised , And swore to work their ruin . I kept my oath . My father loved them  --  I a story framed , So cunning that it mocked fair truth itself . I pour 'd it into his fond ear ;  --  ay , blinded His very senses and his soul tormented With seeming damning proofs that they his sons , Had laid a plot to rob him of his life , And thus possess his vast estates ;  --  he started  --  He raved at their ingratitude ;  --  I bade him Plan a deep disguise and keep his watch Upon the portico ;  --  then hastening To Reginald and his brother , bade them fly And save their father , who was just attacked By villians bent on murder . They flew out To the portico ; they rushed towards their father , Where with drawn sword I stood out his defender . Soon they were banished from his heart , and I , The long despised , became his favorite child ; He forgave them soon ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Reginald , The upstart boy , became a vagrant . Martyn . Martyn  --  Did not your father take this much to heart ? Sir P. Sir Philip  --  ' T was his death blow ; I marked him waning daily . Until each glow of life grew dim in death ; But yet the dotard would not change his will ; He prayed for them in life 's last agonies . Martyn . Martyn  --  Then your brothers are still his heirs ? Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Aye , Reginald ; the other 's in his grave , And soon must his vile brother join him : Martyn , Come nearer ; thou art poor , and I would see thee Rich ; thou hast qualities would grace thee well , That now are hid by poverty :  --  Come nearer . ( Draws up his chair and speaks in a whisper . ) Rid me but of this vagrant brother , and On my bounty build thyself a fortune , For my own hand shall lay the corner stone . Martyn . Martyn  --  Tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Feat casy done , boy ! wealth most easy gained : Gold 's a sweet balm for conscience ; ' twill procure thee Absolution ; and as holy fathers say , ' Twill save the foulest soul from purgatory :  --  Wilt do it ? Martyn . Martyn  --  What ? Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Send him to his account . ( significantly . Martyn shrinks , Sir P. looks sternly at him . ) Wilt do it ? Martyn . Martyn  --  I dare not ;  --  ' t is too horrible ;  --  you 're frantic . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Frantic , slave ! ( seizes him ) I 'll strip And send thee forth a beggar on the earth ; Thou art my minion , whose breath , heart and soul Are mine by barter  --  Martyn . Martyn  --  ( Kneeling . ) Oh sir , reflect ;  --  you did t is true , feed and clothe me  --  my life is yours  --  take that but do not force me to shed another 's blood . Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinning fiends , By all my wealth and power , if thou dost Refuse , me slave , the setting sun shall see Crows with horrid screams feasting on thy carcass . Martyn . Martyn  --  Well , I consent ; but ' t is for you ; your brother 's blood be on your own soul ! Sir P. Sir Philip  --  I 'd wade through rivers of it ; but I 'd gain The dear purpose of my soul . Reginald . Reginald  --  ( Without L. H. ) Hold back  --  nought shall oppose my entrance . ( Enters , L. Sir P. Sir Philip  --  So , brother , you will call and see me sometimes ? I am much bound to you ;  --  how jogs on the world ? Regin . Reginald  --  Villain ! where is my father 's will ? Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Ah ! so bold ! it is my will you do not see it . Regin . Reginald  --  This was my father 's house ! Sir P. Sir Philip  --  It has changed owners , brother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Sir P. Sir Philip  --  This is a wrong way to obtain them . Regin . Reginald  --  I will have satisfaction ; ay , justice . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  You may get the whip , boy . Regin . Reginald  --  Monster , you dare not ; coward thou  --  Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Coward ? liar ! wert thou not beneath me , I 'd write the word in thy rebellious blood ! Regin . Reginald  --  I believe thou wouldst stop at naught . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Right , base boy ! I 'm glad to see you know me : Tho ' mountains piled on mountains did oppose me , I 'd clamber o'er them all , but I would reach The glorious pinnacle my soul yearns for  --  You are in my power and  --  Regin . Reginald  --  Then thus will I free and avenge me ! He rushes at Sir P. with a sword , who disarms and presents a pistol at him . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  In , in to yon chamber , and speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lock the hall door . Exit Martyn . L. H. Regin . Reginald  --  Oh , mercy ! do not murder me ! save me , but for the sake of my poor wife . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  The deep waters that foam beneath this mansion will stop the loudest tongue . Come , or  --  Regin . Reginald  --  Mercy ! I 'm not prepared to die ; I  --  He forces him towards the door . R. H. Sir P. Sir Philip  --  I will not kill thee , brother ; in and fear not . Forces him in and locks the door  --  Martyn returns ; stage becomes dark gradually . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Who saw him enter ? Martyn . Martyn  --  None but Peter Frost . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Now , Martyn , mark ;  --  the window of that chamber Opens o'er a whirlpool ; there 's the key , And there my dagger  --  mark now ; in that room Is my most dreaded foe , and he must die ; See him but dead , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye cling to the north pole , My ever watching vengeance shall pursue thee .

Martyn . Martyn  --  He 's gone ! Ah , what 's this attached to the dagger ? ' t is the key of the small chest that doubtless contains the will ; it may be of service : So now for my office of blood ;  --  ah , hark ! he returns . Music  --  Opens the door . Reginald . Reginald  --  ( Within . ) What would you ? Martyn . Martyn  --  Silence , or die ! Goes in and closes the door  --  Sir P. enters . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  I fear his firmness ;  --  no , he is faithful ; His death secures me ; dire extremity ! ( pauses . Ha ! what power is working in my breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide , seem darting from their seat ! ' T is conscience  --  ' t is the weak soul 's monitor ; Base rebel , peace ! I bear a heart of marble . The door slowly opens , Martyn peeps out but perceiving Sir P. he instantly closes it . Loud cries within ! Reginald . Reginald  --  ( within ) Save me ! mercy ! mercy ! Martyn . Martyn  --  ( within ) Die , enemy of my master ; die ! A struggle heard . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Ha ! ha ! ' t is done ! I 'll now retire , ha ! ha ! I 'm sole possessor of these vast estates , Despite of man or devil : even Albert , From the dark grave could he rise before me , or The charnel house of death yield up my father . Ha ! what form is that now passing in its shroud , With blood congealed upon its mangled breast ? Pshaw ! fool ! ' t is conscience at her tricks again ; Ha ! ha ! ha ! away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's freaks . Hark ! he disposes Of the body ; no fancy that , by hell ! Martyn runs in with a bloody dagger ; seeing Sir P. , starts back . Martyn . Martyn  --  Ha ! who 's there ? Sir P. Sir Philip  --  ' T is I , good Martyn ; speak , is he dead ? Martyn . Martyn  --  Behold the drops of life upon this dagger . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  ' T is a colour suits mine eye ; stay thou here and see all stains removed ; we are now fast friends  --  friendship sealed with blood ! Martyn ! Martyn  --  I dare not reflect on what I 've done ; but may not the old steward suspect ? Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Some certain drops in his evening broth will render his tongue harmless : be that my care ! Martyn retires up . Enter Blanch , hastily R. Blanch . Blanche  --  Sir Philip ! Sir Philip ! Bath start . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Curse on thy tongue ! I 'll drag it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman ; and have a right to use my tongue ; and I will do it in spite of his big ugly looks . ( aside . ) Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Well , jade , tell thy errand . Blanch . Blanche  --  Some friends wait to see you , sir ; that 's my errand , and I do n't like to be snubbed at so ; I 'm twenty two years of age , and I ought to command respect tho ' I do n't look more than fifteen ! oh dear ! Exit whimpering . R. H. Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Reginald , farewell ! Now rumour 's busy tongue Will ne'er resound with calls for thee , a beggar ; And should the listening ear of night find voice To teli this deed , why on that minion 's head Must fall the axe of justice ! Ha ! ha ! ha ! Sole titles mine . Who dare dispute my claim ?

Martyn  --  Now to the chest that contains the will . Alas ! poor Reginald ; he hath a wife and helpless child . Exit . L. H. SCENE II .  --  A Chamber . Enter Blanche . R. H. Blanch . Blanche  --  Twenty two and no husband ! Oh dear , I wonder what can be the reason ? I 've a handsome face and figure , and as pretty an ankle as any girl in the county ; and yet nobody proposes : heigho ! what can the reason be ? Song ; " Why do n't the men propose ? " Enter Giles . L. H. Giles . Giles  --  Oh , my nose ! oh , my nose ! Blanch . Blanche  --  Why Giles , la , what ails your nose ? Giles . Giles  --  Why enough ; ay , too much ; as Martyn , the slave that our master bought three years ago , was flying along the portico , he sent his head bang against my nose ! down fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on taking no more notice of me than a cabbage stalk . Blanch . Blanche  --  Ah , Giles ; Martyn is n't half as bad as they say ; for when Sir Philip turned mother out of house and home ; when she was standing in the snow with her two children in her arms , and the auctioneer was selling off her goods , I saw the tears stand in Martyn 's eye , and he gave her a purse and said in a whisper , " Here , this be yours , and may heaven bless you . " The old woman cried for gratitude , I cried for joy , and Martyn cried because he could n't help it . I 've loved him ever since . Giles . Giles  --  Well we differ ; I think him as great a brute as his master ; I mean our master , as you seem to think so much of him , perhaps you 're going to persuade him into matrimony ? Blanch . Blanche  --  No I 'm not , I only wish I could ! Giles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Blanche  --  I did once , almost ; but poor Martyn 's so melancholy . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  ( Without . ) Giles ! Giles . Giles  --  Oh dear ! that 's Sir Philip ; I shall be half killed ! its your fault , Blanch , you detained me ; I wish with all my heart there were no women in the world . Exit . R. H. Blanch . Blanche  --  " No women ; " I wonder what the men would do if they had no women to blame for their follies ! Oh ! dear ! I wish I was a man ! Twenty-two and no husband ! I 'll take courage and propose to somebody ; I will . Rather than be a cat-nursing , tea-drinking , snuff-taking , man-hating old maid , I 'd die to-morrow , so I would ! Exit . R. H. SCENE LAST . A Splendid Chamber .  --  Chandeliers lit in center , a table luxuriously spread on L. a sofa of crimson velvet .  --  Sir Philip , discovered . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeds stand glaring to my view ; My father 's dying curse , like a dread bell In waste of night , is ringing in my ears ; My mother 's sunken eyes I now behold , E'en as when she died , my love imploring For her seducer 's sons . I gave them hate : Their wedded mother perished by the cup Poison 'd by my hand : but why reflect ? The past , to lethe ; hail the golden future ! Is here a future ? Is there a life hereafter , When we are divested of gross mortality ? Man is at best but a superior animal , Curst with the sun of intellect , which shows In the bright beauty of its transient beam , The insignificance of our frail nature . For me , I laugh at priests and all their clan ! Earth 's mighty glory is reward for me ; The other world I know not of ; and so Must run my chance with men as good as I. A knock . Come in . Enter Madaline . L. H. Madaline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your orders I have dared to cross your threshold ; but my husband , my dear Reginald ; where is he ? Speak ; I pray you tell me . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Rag-patch ! what know I of the vagrant ? hence ! nor soil my mansion floor with thy tread . Mad . Madaline  --  Ah , Sir Philip , there was a time , when his father lived , you were a humbler key , and crouched and fawned as a dog fawns on its master ! Sir P. Sir Philip  --  I was then the outcast , the pennyless bastard ; I 'm now master of these proud halls ; you see my state is changed . Mad . Madaline  --  I do implore thee , as thou dost hope for peace in thy death hour , not to drive my husband to despair ; the chilling blasts of poverty have already swept our humble hearth ; Reginald craves not the title , it is freely yours ; but as thou art his father 's son , look with a pitying eye on our distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach our little boy to pray for thee . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  His curse will do as well ; but thou art beautiful , and if ye list , enter my service , and thou shalt have gold to repel the darts of poverty ; my love  --  Mad . Madaline  --  Ah ! wouldst dare to insult my honor ? Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Ha ! ha ! ha ! honor and poverty seldom walk together . Mad . Madaline  --  Judge not by thine own breast sir ; the wretched hovel canopies virtue and honor , when the palace oft covers fraud and murder ! Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Ha ! wretch ! dost dare provoke me ? call not my vengeance down , or it may crush thee . Mad . Madaline  --  Thou most rapacious and foul son ;  --  thou unnatural brother ; I fear thee not . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Wretch ! I 'll stab thee to the heart and dye thy haggard cheek with thy own base blood !

Peter Frost  --  By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants hath reported so , to the magistracy , and they are here . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  ( Aside . ) Then all is safe ; they dare not suspect me ! Enter Magistrate , Soldiers , Blanche , Giles and all the household ; the guests alarmed come down centre . Magistrate . Magistrate  --  Sir Philip , I come upon a most painful errand . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Your honor is right welcome ; I have heard the charge . What ho ! Martyn ! Keep silence all ! if he be guilty he shall die ; if innocent , I 'll defend him with my life ! The Judge sits centre ; Martyn Enters . Mag . Magistrate  --  Sir , you are accused of murder ! Mark ! he turns pale and trembles ; mark ! Martyn . Martyn  --  What ! is Reginald murdered ? Mag .

Throws off his cloak and turban and appears in a splendid dress . Sir P. Sir Philip  --  Fiends and devils ! thou hast spoke thy last ! Draws and rushes at him .  --  Reginald enters and places himself before him  --  he starts back horror-stricken . Ha ! the dead arise from their dark halls to blast me  --  fiends grin at my agonies , making my brain a furnace of living fires . Hence ! hence ! He falls upon his face . Enter Madaline L. H. Mad .
