Covers , Edges and Spine Main text NIGHT SKETCHES , BENEATH AN UMBRELLA . Pleasant is a rainy winter 's day , within doors ! The best study for such a day , or the best amusement ,  --  call it which you will ,  --  is a book of travels , describing scenes the most unlike that sombre one , which is mistily presented through the windows . I have experienced , that fancy is then most successful in imparting distinct shapes and vivid colors to the objects which the author has spread upon his page , and that his words become magic spells to summon up a thousand varied pictures . Strange landscapes glimmer through the familiar walls of the room , and outlandish figures thrust themselves almost within the sacred precincts of the hearth . Small as my chamber is , it has space enough to contain the ocean-like circumference of an Arabian desert , its parched sands tracked by the long line of a caravan , with the camels patiently journeying through the heavy sunshine . Though my ceiling be not lofty , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , till their summits shine far above the clouds of the middle atmosphere . And , with my humble means , a wealth that is not taxable , I can transport hither the magnificent merchandise of an Oriental bazar , and call a crowd of purchasers from distant countries , to pay a fair profit for the precious articles which are displayed on all sides . True it is , however , that , amid the bustle of traffic , or whatever else may seem to be going on around me , the rain-drops will occasionally be heard to patter against my window-panes , which look forth upon one of the quietest streets in a New England town . After a time , too , the visions vanish , and will not appear again at my bidding . Then , it being nightfall , a gloomy sense of unreality depresses my spirits , and impels me to venture out , before the clock shall strike bedtime , to satisfy myself that the world is not entirely made up of such shadowy materials as have busied me throughout the day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things without him will seem as unreal as those within . When eve has fairly set in , therefore , I sally forth , tightly buttoning my shaggy over-coat , and hoisting my umbrella , the silken dome of which immediately resounds with the heavy drumming of the invisible rain-drops . Pausing on the lowest door-step , I contrast the warmth and cheerfulness of my deserted fire-side with the drear obscurity and chill discomfort into which I am about to plunge . Now come fearful auguries , innumerable as the drops of rain . Did not my manhood cry shame upon me , I should turn back within doors , resume my elbow-chair , my slippers , and my book , pass such an evening of sluggish enjoyment as the day has been , and go to bed inglorious . The same shivering reluctance , no doubt , has quelled , for a moment , the adventurous spirit of many a traveller , when his feet , which were destined to measure the earth around , were leaving their last tracks in the home-paths . In my own case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look upward , and discern no sky , not even an unfathomable void , but only a black , impenetrable nothingness , as though heaven and all its lights were blotted from the system of the universe . It is as if nature were dead , and the world had put on black , and the clouds were weeping for her . With their tears upon my cheek , I turn my eyes earthward , but find little consolation here below . A lamp is burning dimly at the distant corner , and throws just enough of light along the street , to show , and exaggerate by so faintly showing , the perils and difficulties which beset my path . Yonder dingily-white remnant of a huge snow-bank ,  --  which will yet cumber the sidewalk till the latter days of March ,  --  over or through that wintry waste must I stride on-ward . Beyond , lies a certain Slough of Despond , a concoction of mud and liquid filth , ankle-deep , leg-deep , neck-deep ,  --  in a word , of unknown bottom ,  --  on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have occasionally watched , in the gradual growth of its horrors , from morn till nightfall . Should I flounder into its depths , farewell to upper earth ! And hark ! how roughly resounds the roaring of a stream , the turbulent career of which is partially reddened by the gleam of the lamp , but elsewhere brawls noisily through the densest gloom . O , should I be swept away in fording that impetuous and unclean torrent , the coroner will have a job with an unfortunate gentleman , who would fain end his troubles any where but in a mud-puddle ! Pshaw ! I will linger not another instant at arm 's length from these dim terrors , which grow more obscurely formidable , the longer I delay to grapple with them . Now for the onset ! And lo ! with little damage , save a dash of rain in the face and breast , a splash of mud high up the pantaloons , and the left boot full of ice-cold water , behold me at the corner of the street . The lamp throws down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onward from corner to corner , I discern other beacons , marshalling my way to a brighter scene . But this is a lonesome and dreary spot . The tall edifices bid gloomy defiance to the storm , with their blinds all closed , even as a man winks when he faces a spattering gust . How loudly tinkles the collected rain down the tin spouts ! The puffs of wind are boisterous , and seem to assail me from various quarters at once . I have often observed that this corner is a haunt and loitering-place for those winds which have no work to do upon the deep , dashing ships against our iron-bound shores ; nor in the forest , tearing up the sylvan giants with half a rood of soil at their vast roots . Here they amuse themselves with lesser freaks of mischief . See , at this moment , how they assail yonder poor woman , who is passing just within the verge of the lamp-light ! One blast struggles for her umbrella , and turns it wrong side outward ; another whisks the cape of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most unwarrantable liberties with the lower part of her attire . Happily , the good dame is no gossamer , but a figure of rotundity and fleshly substance ; else would these arial tormentors whirl her aloft , like a witch upon a broomstick , and set her down , doubtless , in the filthiest kennel hereabout . From hence I tread upon firm pavements into the centre of the town . Here there is almost as brilliant an illumination as when some great victory has been won , either on the battle-field or at the polls . Two rows of shops , with windows down nearly to the ground , cast a glow from side to side , while the black night hangs overhead like a canopy , and thus keeps the splendor from diffusing itself away . The wet sidewalks gleam with a broad sheet of red light . The rain-drops glitter , as if the sky were pouring down rubies . The spouts gush with fire . Methinks the scene is an emblem of the deceptive glare which mortals throw around their footsteps in the moral world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hems them in , and that can be dispelled only by radiance from above . And , after all , it is a cheerless scene , and cheerless are the wanderers in it . Here comes one who has so long been familiar with tempestuous weather , that he takes the bluster of the storm for a friendly greeting , as if it should say , " How fare ye , brother ? " He is a retired sea-captain , wrapped in some nameless garment of the pea-jacket order , and is now laying his course towards the Marine Insurance Office , there to spin yarns of gale and shipwreck , with a crew of old sea-dogs like himself . The blast will put in its word among their hoarse voices , and be understood by all of them . Next I meet an unhappy slip-shod gentleman , with a cloak flung hastily over his shoulders , running a race with boisterous winds , and striving to glide between the drops of rain . Some domestic emergency or other has blown this miserable man from his warm fireside , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  how carelessly he has taken his stand right underneath a spout , while staring at some object of curiosity in a shop window ! Surely the rain is his native element ; he must have fallen with it from the clouds , as frogs are supposed to do . Here is a picture , and a pretty one  --  a young man and a girl , both enveloped in cloaks , and huddled beneath the scanty protection of a cotton umbrella . She wears rubber over-shoes ; but he is in his dancing pumps ; and they are on their way , no doubt , to some cotillon party , or subscription ball , at a dollar a head , refreshments included . Thus they struggle against the gloomy tempest , lured onward by a vision of festal splendor . But , ah ! a most lamentable disaster . Bewildered by the red , blue , and yellow meteors in an apothecary 's window , they have stepped upon a slippery remnant of ice , and are precipitated into a confluence of swollen floods , at the corner of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be other than a looker-on in life , I would attempt your rescue . Since that may not be , I vow , should you be drowned , to weave such a pathetic story of your fate , as shall call forth tears enough to drown you both anew . Do ye touch bottom , my young friends ? Yes ; they emerge like a water-nymph and a river-deity , and paddle hand-in-hand out of the depths of the dark pool . They hurry homeward , dripping , disconsolate , abashed , but with love too warm to be chilled by the cold water . They have stood a test which proves too strong for many . Faithful , though over head and ears in trouble ! Onward I go , deriving a sympathetic joy or sorrow from the varied aspect of mortal affairs , even as my figure catches a gleam from the lighted windows , or is blackened by an interval of darkness . Not that mine is altogether a chameleon spirit , with no hue of its own . Now I pass into a more retired street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presenting a range of strongly-contrasted pictures . Here , too , may be found the golden mean . Through yonder casement I discern a family circle ,  --  the grandmother , the parents , and the children ,  --  all flickering , shadow-like , in the glow of a wood-fire . Bluster , fierce blast , and beat , thou wintry rain , against the window-panes ! Ye can not damp the enjoyment of that fire-side . Surely my fate is hard , that I should be wandering homeless here , taking to my bosom night , and storm , and solitude , instead of wife and children . Peace , murmurer ! Doubt not that darker guests are sitting round the hearth , though the warm blaze hides all but blissful images . Well , here is still a brighter scene  --  a stately mansion , illuminated for a ball , with cut-glass chandeliers and alabaster lamps in every room , and sunny landscapes hanging round the walls . See ! a coach has stopped , whence emerges a slender beauty , who , canopied by two umbrellas , glides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music . Will she ever feel the night-wind and the rain ? Perhaps ,  --  perhaps ! And will death and sorrow ever enter that proud mansion ? As surely as the dancers will be gay within its halls to-night . Such thoughts sadden , yet satisfy my heart ; for they teach me that the poor man , in this mean , weather-beaten hovel , without a fire to cheer him , may call the rich his brother ,  --  brethren by sorrow , who must be an inmate of both their households ,  --  brethren by death , who will lead them both to other homes . Onward , still onward , I plunge into the night . Now have I reached the utmost limits of the town , where the last lamp struggles feebly with the darkness , like the farthest star that stands sentinel on the borders of uncreated space . It is strange what sensations of sublimity may spring from a very humble source . Such are suggested by this hollow roar of a subterranean cataract , where the mighty stream of a kennel precipitates itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth . Listen awhile to its voice of mystery ; and fancy will magnify it , till you start , and smile at the illusion . And now another sound ,  --  the rumbling of wheels ,  --  as the mail-coach , outward bound , rolls heavily off the pavements , and splashes through the mud and water of the road . All night long , the poor passengers will be tossed to and fro between drowsy watch and troubled sleep , and will dream of their own quiet beds , and awake to find themselves still jolting onward . Happier my lot , who will straightway hie me to my familiar room , and toast myself comfortably before the fire , musing , and fitfully dozing , and fancying a strangeness in such sights as all may see . But first let me gaze at this solitary figure , who comes hitherward with a tin lantern , which throws the circular pattern of its punched holes on the ground about him . He passes fearlessly into the unknown gloom , whither I will not follow him . This figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of a more appropriate one , I may wind up my sketch . He fears not to tread the dreary path before him , because his lantern , which was kindled at the fireside of his home , will light him back to that same fireside again . And thus we , night-wanderers through a stormy and dismal world , if we bear the lamp of faith , enkindled at a celestial fire , it will surely lead us home to that heaven whence its radiance was borrowed .
