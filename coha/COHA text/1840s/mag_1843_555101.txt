txt SOME years have elapsed since the publication of this work , and , as it is now widely known and highly esteemed , it may seem that its character is sufficiently determined , and that any extended notice of it is unnecessary . In this country , however , its republication is of recent date , and the number of persons who have had opportunity to examine it is comparatively small . A work of such a character is not likely to attract immediate attention among a community of readers , who are deluged with reprints of the more ephemeral productions of the English press ; and the few who are able to appreciate it , are more likely to wait for the chance of obtaining an English or French copy , than to read it in a coarse and clumsily executed American edition . But we will not complain of the demerits of the reprint , since to contribute in any way to the circulation of such a book is to render essential service to the cause of letters on this side of the Atlantic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , though the means are here wanting , which could be found only in well-stocked libraries , for a full examination of its statements and the general merits of its execution . It is remarkable that , before the publication of this work , no English writer had attempted to give a general history of letters , or a particular account of the literature of his own country . No one was willing to undertake a task , for the due performance of which so many qualifications were required , and from which so much would naturally be expected . Accurate learning , much general information , a fair ac // quaintance with all the sciences , a perfect mastery of the languages of modern Europe , a discriminating taste , a sound judgment , and a pleasing style , are some of the essential requisites for success in such an enterprise , and therefore very few persons could engage in it without incurring the charge of undue presumption . Only the veterans in the literary field could grapple with such a gigantic undertaking , and , even with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather diminish than increase the laurels , which they had earned in less ambitious efforts . More than two centuries ago Lord Bacon perceived the want of a history of letters , and marked out the plan on which it should be prepared ; but the task became no whit less difficult , when that mighty intellect had displayed the importance of the work , and established the principles for its execution . One of his pregnant sentences forms the appropriate motto of the present history , for it describes in few words the general scheme , on which the writer has conducted his labors . We may spare criticism on the plan , which is recommended by such authority . With the exception perhaps of Dr. Southey , no living English writer appears better qualified than Mr. Hallam for supplying the deficiency , that was pointed out by the great Advancer of learning . His previous writings , if they did not display that wide range of general scholarship , which is essential to success in a task like the present one , afforded good evidence , at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that any work from his pen would be elaborated with the utmost care . The " Constitutional History of England , " and the " History of Europe during the Middle Ages , " were generally admitted as standard works , from the very day of their publication . They were classed at once among " the books , which no gentleman 's library should be without ; " they became an essential part of the reading of every well-educated man . And the reputation which they have obtained is a just tribute to the judgment , learning , and discretion of the writer ; for it is not founded on any captivating qualities of the subject , on any studied graces in the treatment of it , or on any subserviency to the passions and prejudices of the day . Mr. Hallam is a political writer without undue bias from the spirit of party and sect , a pleasing one without the affectation of rhetoric // and eloquence , and a learned one without any unnecessary display of erudition . The subject which he has now treated is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publications ; and , as the work was known to embody the labors of many years , it was received with curiosity and respect , and is likely to establish for him a wide and enduring reputation . A leading characteristic of these volumes , as well as of those formerly published , is the grave and dignified impartiality of the writer . We do not allude merely to the absence of party spirit , any indications of which in a history of literature would be not only offensive , but absurd , though too many precedents for their admission into equally improper places might be found in contemporary publications . British writers have too frequently allowed the exciting and distorting influences of modern politics to blind the judgment of the critic and to warp the fidelity of the historian , even when the subjects discussed , or the facts narrated , were apparently removed to the safest distance from the appropriate arena for such disputes . The fouler exhibitions of this malignant spirit of politics have even soiled the pages of ancient history , and bespattered the notes to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects may often be traced , so far , at least , as to determine whether the writer belongs to the school of the Quarterly , the lEdinburgh , or the Westminster Review . As the cool and dispassionate temperament of Mr. Hallam preserved him from this error in a great degree , even when traversing the dangerous ground of English constitutional history , we might well expect , that his good sense would guard against it in the treatment of his present subject . But he is entitled to much higher praise for impartiality . His taste is singularly just and catholic . It is not warped by modern associations , nor blinded by national feeling . His estimate of French literature , for instance , is fair and liberal , forming quite a contrast to the judgments of many of his countrymen , who are very slow to recognise high merit on the other side of the channel . Voltaire* s opinion of Shakspeare is but the counterpart in absurdity of many English criticisms on Corneille and Racine . Towards the latter , indeed , Mr. Hallam appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a sense of the unjust award of former judges on the English bench . // We find it difficult to admit , that , in point of style , " he is second only to Virgil among all poets , " or that his female characters " have the ideal grace and harmony of ancient sculpture , and bear somewhat of the same analogy to those of Shakspeare , which that art does to painting ; " but we cordially echo the assertion , that " it is a very narrow criticism , which excludes either school from our admiration , which disparages Racine out of idolatry of Shakspeare . " A critic would hardly subject himself to this reproach , by maintaining that the female characters of the French poet are too often insipid , and that his versification lacks spirit , and is too uniformly sweet and monotonous . It is probably more difficult to be just towards the men of science , the metaphysicians , and the political writers of a former age and another church , than to criticize with fairness the elegant literature of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is as easy to detect the mistakes of a former century , as it is flattering to our own pride to expose them . The boundaries of philosophy , ethics , and theology , run into each other , and a Protestant writer may be pardoned for viewing with suspicion the casuistry of the Jesuits , while a countryman of Locke and Newton may very naturally triumph over the errors of IDescartes . But our author 's resolute impartiality avoids even the more secret and excusable causes of a biassed judgment . He is careful always to obtain the right point of view , - neither to view the past through the atmosphere of the present , nor to allow acknowledged excellences to be shadowed entirely by neighbouring faults . If his judgments are ever impugned , therefore , it must be for natural incorrectness of taste or a faulty discrimination , rather than for borrowed prejudices . The literary criticism contained in these volumes is of great merit . It is neither commonplace nor affectedly profound . So much has been written upon the poets of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer any thing further , which should bear even the semblance of novelty and truth . But Mr. Hallam 's remarks , even here , have all the air of freshness , which naturally invests a virgin subject , and his disquisitions upon the great Italian poets , and even upon Shakspeare and Milton , are among the most ingenious and interesting portions of the work . This task had been an easy one , if his taste had allowed him to // indulge in the misty speculations and fine-spun theories , which too often form the staple of German criticism . An endless thread of this sort may be spun by any one of an ingenious and fanciful turn of mind , but it will not sustain the lightest touch of scrutiny . Naturally averse to this dreamy kind of writing , Mr. Hallam 's remarks bear a strong impress of good sense and correct taste , and are adapted rather to please and convince , than to bewilder or astonish the reader . It may not appear the highest praise to say , that the criticism is sound and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign models , is in vogue at the present day , that it is truly refreshing to find a subdued , temperate , and unambitious tone once more adopted in the school of taste . Paying the tribute of hearty admiration to his favorite authors , our historian is still not carried away so far by his enthusiasm , as to indulge in the rash and extravagant assertions , in which some writers labor to display their sensibility , but which lead one to doubt the sincerity of the very feeling which they are designed to prove . He ventures to point out faults even in Shakspeare , and in nearly every instance to qualify praise with some censure . His carefully regulated judgment appears as much in his notices of individuals , as of books . The Boswellian disease of inordinate admiration never fastens upon him , nor , on the other hand , does he ever appear ambitious of Johnson 's favorite character of " a good hater . " With such characteristics , it appears , that , if Mr. Hallam is not always a brilliant companion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken of the variety and extent of the reading and general information , which are necessarily embodied in a work of this character . An examination of the volumes bears out the remark , and would seem to prove , that the preparation for them must have been the labor of a whole life . With great candor , the writer has allowed the whole of Bacon 's remark to stand as the motto of his work , though it hints at the fact , which might , it is true , be naturally inferred under such circumstances , that , in so vast an undertaking , the whole of the information given , must not be viewed as the fruit of original research . Speaking of the number of books to be examined , for the purpose of a history of letters , Bacon remarks , that the end must be obtained , " non comm perlectione , ( id enim infinitum quiddcun esset , ) sed // degustatione et observatione argumenti , styli , methodi , etc . In this way , ( he continues , with his usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , as if by an incantation , may be evoked from the dead . if the limitation was necessary in his age , how much is the necessity increased by the almost endless multiplication of books in later times Mr. Hallam mentions some subjects , such as mathematical science and anatomy , on which his observations are derived from secondary sources ; and , when characters of books are inserted with a reliance upon other judges , without direct examination , the reader is usually warned of the fact . Such frankness marks the high-minded scholar , and inspires full confidence in his fidelity as a guide . After all these limitations , the work is a singular monument of literary industry , a vast storehouse , in which are garnered the rich accumulations of an active scholar 's life . With Italian , French , English , and modern Latin literature , the author seems to be equally familiar . He is less acquainted with Spanish books , and his knowledge of German is evidently partial . The nature of the work imperatively required a full acquaintance with theology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature , the drama , poetry , and belleslettres , and on all of these the writer speaks with equal confidence . We could hardly expect more , even from the prodigies of German industry . In executing such a work , there was evident danger of overlaying it with erudition , and presenting only the lifeless form of general literature , without any of its vivacity and grace . A writer intent only upon the display of his acquisitions would surely have fallen into this error , from which the refined taste and freshness of thought and language , displayed by Mr. Hallam , have effectually preserved him . The volumes abound with curious information , tasteful criticism , and elegant disquisition ; and , considering also the miscellaneous nature of the contents , affording pleasant cates for every kind of appetite , we hardly know of a more readable book . If any portion is open to the charge of dullness , it is the rather diffuse analysis of some ponderous works on ethical and political science , for which the previous studies of Mr. Hallam may have created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be expected to share . He probably forgot the extent of such matter , when he wrote the remark ix* // the preface , that this should not be considered as a book of reference on particular topics , but as an entire and synoptical work . Most persons would rather refer occasionally to such copious abstracts , than read them continuously . One source of interest he has voluntarily resigned , by omitting entirely the biography of authors , and alluding but very seldom to any peculiar traits in their characters , or remarkable incidents in their lives . It is true , that much gleaning in so wide a field would swell the book beyond reasonable compass ; but we incline to believe , that a somewhat larger portion of narrative than he has admitted , would throw light upon many of the topics discussed , and much facilitate the reader 's progress . The lives and writings of literary men have such an intimate connexion , that in some cases , as in that of Descartes , for instance , we can not gain a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The practice of the French and Germans has been to introduce much general speculation into the history of letters . A full consideration of the general causes affecting the literary character of any age or country is blended with much ingenious theorizing on the possible results of a different combination of circumstances , and on the degree in which external influences may be resisted , or evaded . We can not entertain much regard for such speculations . Though a proud title , that of " the philosophy of history , " is claimed for them , they have been sadly abused in our times , and their utility , to say the least , is not very apparent . It is far more likely , that one 's patience will fail in the perusal , than that the writer 's fancy will be exhausted in the manufacture of such lucubrations . After an event has taken place , it is very easy to lay down general principles , in virtue of which it may be demonstrated , that it must have happened precisely in that way , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a connexion between cause and effect would have been discovered before the event happened . If so , it is a great misfortune , that the theorist was not born in the very age and country wherein his abilities as a prophet might have been manifested . M. Cousin has studied the philosophy of this subject so thoroughly , that he has even discovered a method of writing history a priori , founded on the original principles of the human mind , and the necessary connexion between ideas . He has demonstrated his theory // in reference to the past , though we believe he has not yet written out his narration of every thing which is to happen , even to the end of time . Mr. Hallam has cautiously avoided such fanciful speculations , so that it has even been objected to his work , that it is not so much a history of literature , as a catalogue raisortn* of books and literary men . If he has erred at all , it is undoubtedly on the safe side , and we are sure that the real value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it may not at once acquire so brilliant a reputation , as if written on a different model . We feel certain that the writer has gone honestly to work , - that the story is fairly and fully told , - without mutilation or coloring , in order to suit a preconceived theory . This assurance is worth all the elaborate fancies , that the most ingenious speculatist ever framed . To inspire perfect confidence is one of the highest results at which a writer , who aims at instruction , can hope to attain . There is little profit in receiving information , when one is obliged to doubt and question at every moment . Let the facts be honestly set forth , and the reader may speculate for himself . If the lesson be not an obvious one , it is probably not true . If it requires to be supported by nice deductions and fine-spun reasoning , arguments of equal tenuity will be able to overthrow it . The writer can claim a power of framing general conclusions superior to that of his Teader , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has seen fit to communicate . If so , he is to blame for unnecessary secrecy . Let him keep back the inferences , and divulge the facts . Such was the plan , at least , on which the ancients wrote history , and their other writings show no inaptitude for contriving the most comprehensive theories . We do not mean , that Mr. Hallam is wholly averse to general speculation . His work is something more than a mere dictionary of books and names . It bears the marks , throughout , of a comprehensive , acute , and thoughtful mind , that can not watch the succession of facts x*ithout being struck with the connexion between them , though he usually puts only the clue to the maze of causes and effects into the reader 's hands , and leaves him to trace out its remoter windings . Some of the general remarks , for instance , on the great events which took place in Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , and their effects on the literary // spirit of the age , and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of philosophy and letters , are ingenious and profound . But they are everywhere made subsidiary to the leading object of the work . Pacts are not overlaid by theory , nor wrested into unnatural conforinity with it . The history suggests general reflections , instead of furnishing them ready made . It is a vast repository of materials , on which the future speculatist may build . But it is time to look more particularly into the contents of these volumes . The work commences with an introductory chapter on the general state of literature in the Middle Ages , up to the end of the fourteenth century . As the writer had treated this subject at length in a former work , a very brief sketch is here given , which , however , supplies many curious additional facts , that have been brought to light by recent researches . The history and antiquities of the Middle Ages have been studied of late with great zeal in Europe , the interest which attaches to the subject being partly a cause and partly a consequence of that great revolution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into such general favor . Fragments of the popular poetry of those times have been hunted up with great eagerness , and , though we can not but believe , that its intrinsic merits in most cases have been even ludicrously exaggerated by the zeal of philologists and antiquaries , it is still very interesting , from the light which it throws on the origin and growth of the modern languages of Europe . Mr. Hallam has given a brief , but clear , summary of the results of recent inquiries respecting the formation of the Italian , Proven*al , and French languages from the Latin , and of the English from the Anglo-Saxon , and has pointed out the sources of information for those who wish to pursue the subject . His account of the remarkable change in versification , from the metrical verse , marked by quantity , in use by the ancients , to the rhythmical poetry , measured by the accent or emphasis , ad'opted by the moderns , appeared novel to us , from the very high antiquity ascribed to the latter system . Traces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second century , and even much earlier , long before the ancient arrangement by quantity had become obsolete . The two systems existed contemporaneously for a considerable period , the one among the instructed classes , and the other in the songs and // popular poetry of the day , as its jingle was more pleasing to the ears of the vulgar . A necessary inference from this statement is , that " the distinction of long and short syllables , even while Latin remained a living tongue , was lost in speech , and required study to attain it . " If this be so , it is strange that no more definite explanation has reached us , of the means by which the quantity of syllables was indicated in the pronunciation . The mode of reciting ancient verse is still a mystery ; for no difference of emphasis , or tone , can make a syllable of many letters appear short , and it is extravagant to suppose , either that poetry could be read aloud only in a kind of chant , or that it could be distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pronouncing words agreeably to quantity was a part of the education of the higher classes , the common people being unacquainted with it , it is strange that we do not find some rules and directions concerning it laid down in the books . It should have formed an obvious topic of speculation and precept , and the total silence respecting it , observed even by the critical and rhetorical writers , is inexplicable . If the common people were ignorant of it in the second century , there is no reason to suppose , that they were better instructed in the days of Augustus ; and Mr. Hallam seems to favor this conclusion . But is it credible , that , to the ears of the great body of the people , Virgil and Horace wrote nothing but prose ? Commencing with the fifteenth century , the plan of Mr. ilallam 's work includes , in great part , the history of that great awakening of literary spirit in Europe , which is usually called " the Revival of Letters . " With more propriety might it be denominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequently for the Greek , classics . The search after manuscripts , the elucidation of the text , and a painful imitation of the style of the ancient writers , formed almost the only employment of the learned . Science had few votaries , and the nascent literature of their own age and language was viewed rather as a relaxation , than as a broad and honorable field of exertion . Italy alone boasted of three great men , whose writings had purified and strengthened the vernacular tongue , and whose native prose and poetry furnished as bright models for study and imitation as the imperishable remains of Roman and Grecian genius . But these very writers were hardly aware of their own success . // They threw carelessly aside the treasures which they had collected above ground , and continued to delve in the Latin mine . Boccaccio wrote Latin with more care and diligence than he did Italian , and Petrarch prized his poem of " Africa " more highly than his sonnets . The men who first set the example of this passion for ancient literature , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though too many of their eminent successors appear to us , at least , only as laborious pedants . The former were weary of the subtile and vain disputes of scholastic philosophy and theological literature , and of the barbarous Latin in which they were carried on ; and to their refined perceptions , the elegance , harmony , and correctness , the faultless purity , of ancient Roman poetry and eloquence came like the revelation of a new world of intellect . The classics occupied their whole minds , and they naturally disregarded the contemporaneous literature which was beginning to spring up around them - the ballad epics of Germany and the poetry of the Troubadours , for instance , - in which strength was attended with rudeness and impurity , and a luxuriant fancy borrowed no grace or polish from art . Familiarity with Latin , and a competent knowledge of Greek , became the common badge of all the learned . By means of the former , scholars of different countries corresponded with each other , and a clannish and emulous feeling was kept alive among them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they seem to have considered almost as barbarous dialects , fit only for the vulgar . It was a fortunate circumstance for the progress of learning , that the scholars dispersed through Europe possessed this substitute for a common language , without which , in that age , communication with each other had been difficult , and in many cases impossible . They were few in number , comparatively , and widely scattered among the nations ; and without this means of intercourse many of them would doubtless have lived and died in perfect seclusion . Another advantage was , that each university was thrown open to pupils of all countries , and learned men of every clime could be invited to take a share in instruction . The practice of giving lectures , conducting correspondence , and writing books in Latin , has been long since abandoned ; and the consequences have been very favorable to the diffusion // of learning ; but it may well be doubted , whether they have equally aided its progress . It were idle now to discuss the project of a universal language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , it was practicable , has long since passed away . But the substitute for it , which was possessed for a long period by European scholars , exerted a greater influence , than is commonly attributed to it , in promoting the revival of a literary spirit , and aiding the progress of science throughout the civilized world . In searching for the causes of the enthusiasm for antiquity , which manifested itself particularly in Italy in the beginning of the fifteenth century , Mr. Hallam attributes much to the pride , which the inhabitants of that country felt in their descent from the Romans ; and he alludes to the story of Rienzi , as a proof of the ardor which might be kindled by ancient recollections . But it may be doubted , whether this feeling was strong and permanent enough to exert so much influence on the pursuits of the learned , and whether classical studies were not rather a cause , than a consequence , of the proud sense , which the Italians entertained of their high parentage . Besides , though the scholars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other countries , and became as vivid and lasting there , though it was fostered by no national associations . A more natural explanation presents itself in the contrast , to which men of taste must have been keenly sensible , between the polished specimens of Roman genius , and the rude literature and other half-barbarous studies of that age . A perception of this contrast evidently animated the exertions of such persons as Petrarch and Poggio , and probably kindled equal zeal in many of their contemporaries . Born in this way , the devotion to classical studies was kept alive and strengthened by a less honorable feeling , - by the pride which scholars felt in an exclusive means of intercourse with each other , and in a pursuit so far removed from the taste and occupations of the common people . In every subsequent age , also , the pride of scholarship has centred particularly in these studies , an acquaintance with them being made to constitute , often very improperly , the only distinction between an educated and an uneducated man . No exclusiveness of this sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was enough , that their pursuits were tolerated by the side of an employment , distinction in which formed the chief triumph of the learned . // The exaggerated estimate of ancient genius undoubtedly caused the neglect , with which the first blossoms of modern literature were received . Some of the most remarkable productions of the human mind , like Dante 's great poem , attracted but little notice for many years after the death of their authors . Mr. Hallarn says , that , for a hundred years , it was thought unworthy of a man of letters , even though a poet , to write in Italian . A more important effect of this classical zeal was manifested in erecting a standard of taste , and establishing principles of criticism , on which the literature of after times was formed . Greek and Roman associations reigned paramount for a long period in the schools of taste . An undue importance was attributed to method , polish , correctness , and purity , while vivacity , strength , and naturalness were held in lighter esteem . The effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy and France , where the enthusiasm for antiquity , nursed by the pride of descent and consanguinity of language , was first felt and most widely diffused . It was less perceptible in England , where classical studies never flourished in an equal degree . The elaborate and artificial style of the Italian prose writers may be traced to this cause , which produced its most striking effects , however , in forming the pedantic taste and solemn stiffness , which characterize the literature of the age of Louis the Fourteenth . The separation between the Classical and Romantic schools of criticism , may be considered as beginning in the fifteenth or in the eighteenth century . In the former case , the taste of the educated classes was formed entirely on the ancient models , while the popular poetry was adapted of course to the feelings and associations of the multitude , to whom it was addressed . The two schools stood side by side , but not in opposition . But in later times , the relative importance of classical studies has sensibly diminished , even with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antiquity in our eyes , and the poetry , which once formed the amusement of the populace , is now the object of the scholar 's anxious research and careful study . The opposition between the two kinds of taste has become obvious and striking ; it is waged with equal arms , and Romanticism , aided as it always is by the popular voice , threatens to push its old rival wholly off the throne . Leaving this rather worn subject , we come to a few more // general remarks of our author on the prevailing trains of sentiment and opinion , which shaped the public mind at the close of the medlieval period . Our readers may like to possess Mr. Hallam 's opinion on one of the most interesting topics which here come into notice , and we therefore extract the passage . " The popular taste had been also essentially affected by changes in social intercourse , rendering it more studiously and punctiliously courteous , and especially by the homage due to women under the modern laws of gallantry . Love , with the ancient poets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied by a sense of deference or inferiority . This ele-9 vation of the female sex through the voluntary submission of the stronger , though a remarkable fact in the philosophical history of Europe , has not , perhaps , been adequately developed . It did not originate , or at least very partially , in the Teutonic manners , from which it has sometimes been derived . The love.songs again , and romances of Arabia , where others have sought its birthplace , display , no doubt , a good deal of that rapturous adoration which distinguishes the language of later poetry , and have , perhaps , in some measure , been the models of the Proven*al troubadours ; yet this seems rather consonant to the hyperbolical character of Oriental works of imagination , than to a state of manners where the usual lot of women is seclusion , if not slavery . The late editor of Warton has thought it sufficient to call that reverence and adoration of the female sex which has descended to our own times , the offspring of the Christian dispensation . ' But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such principle , we must look a little farther down for its origin . " Without rejecting , by any means , the influences of these collateral and preparatory circumstances , we might ascribe more direct efficacy to the favor shown towards women in succession to lands , through inheritance or dower , by the later Roman law , and by the customs of the northern nations ; to the respect which the clergy paid them ( a subject which might bear to be more fully expanded ) ; but above all , to the gay idleness of the nobility , consuming the intervals of peace in festive enjoyments . In whatever country the charms of high-born beauty were first admitted to grace the banquet or give brilliancy to the tournanient , - in whatever country the austere restraints of jealousy were most completely laid aside , - in whatever country the coarser , though often more virtuous , simplicity of unpolished ages was exchanged for winning and delicate artifices , - in // whatever country , through the influence of climate or polish , less boisterousness and intemperance prevailed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commencement of so great a revolution in society . " - Vol. i. p. 101 . Most of the circumstances here assigned as causes seem ratl1er to be manifestations of the very change of opinion , the origin of which is sought to be explained . The question is , why were the women admitted to inherit lands , or why did the clergy show them more respect , or the nobility esteem servitude to them as the highest distinction of a true knight ? Mr. Hallam appears to underrate the influence of the only Ceause , which is sufficiently general and powerful to account for this striking alteration of sentiment . It is true , that the Christian doctrine does not directly prescribe respect and forbearance towards the xveaker sex , but its indirect influences , especially in that form , - the Romish faith , - which was then almost universal in Europe , were highly favorable to the advancement of woman in society . The worship of the Virgin Mother necessarily redounded to the advantage of her sex . In hymning the praises of the blessed Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy transition to the kindred excellences of female saints and martyrs , and then to the general qualities of the female character , which always affords the brightest patterns of unbounded faith , meekness , fortitude , and love . An imperfect understanding of the Gospel scheme could not wholly obscure the truth , that these gentler virtues , most unlike the strong and stern qualities of man 's rtider nature , still occupied a much higher rank than the latter as Christian graces . In this way , without the force of direct commands , the silent influence of our religion constantly leads to a higher appreciation of the weaker sex . Woman has gained estimation , and even reverence , wherever the Gospel has been preached . Besides , the natural constitution of the sexes , when its effects are not restrained or mo ( lifled by positive institutions , makes the strong a suitor to the xveak . The passion of love , when custom or law does not allow it the unnatural right of manifesting itself through harsh authority , or brute force , humbles man into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant or refuse . Hence , to do away the prejudices , and the absurd institutions , derived from Paganism and Oriental manners , was to restore woman to the use // of a natural advantage , by which Providence has balanced the superior strength of the other sex , and to give her an immediate superiority . In other words , when opinion establishes the rightful equality of the two , so that man is debarred the privilege of strength , woman at once becomes his superior , - his sovereign . He must bend at her footstool , and execute her behests . Now , Christianity teaches the natural equality of the whole race , and by doing away with Pagan institutions , and thus directly rescuing females from the condition of slaves , it indirectly raised them to a higher state . Men fell into natural subjection to them , and became proud of their chains . We trust that this solution of the problem , which we honestly believe to be the true one , is satisfactory to our fairer readers . Mr. Hallam thinks , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an element of European manners in the south of France , and near the close of the tenth century . It is very probable , that the condition of the sex was sensibly ameliorated at a much earlier date , though it is impossible to affirm this with certainty , as we possess so few indications of the state of manners and domestic life in those ages . Very naturally , the imperfect civilization of the times , with the constant wars and intestine commotions which accompanied and followed the fall of the Roman Empire , greatly retarded the change , which the spread of the Christian religion was slowly bringing abo*it . Real gallantry at last appeared among the people , who have ever since boasted of it as a peculiar trait of their national manners , and at a time when various circumstances were preparing the way for an outburst of religious enthusiasm . Somewhat later , poetry and roniance , by inculcating a deeper vein of sentiment , and lending more varied , * fanciful , and exaggerated expressions to passion , powerfully contributed to the progress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly considered by our author , but though the topics are tempting , we must pass on to the graver portions of the work . The history is divided in chronological order , with a minuteness and strict adherence to the plan , which are rather perplexing , from the frequent change of subject and the scattered position of the materials . Thus the introductory chapter is followed by a general account of European literature from 1400 to 1440 , and then the circumstances of most // importance in literary history , and the books published , are ranged into decennial periods , and considered in this fragmentary way up to the end of the century . After 1500 , another division , into subjects , is added to the chronological arrangement , and philology , science , philosophy , theology , poetry , the literature of taste , &amp;c. , are separately treated , usually by half centuries , up to the end of the work . Hence , when an author xvrote on several subjects , and published at different periods , one is obliged to look at half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gather a full account of his writings . Lord Bacon 's " Essays " are considered in one division , his larger philosophical works in another , and his " History of Henry the Seventh " in a third . Some of Shakspeare 's plays fall into the latter half of the sixteenth century , and the remainder into the first half of the seventeenth ; in a third place , we find a notice of his Sonnets , and in a fourth one of the two longer poems , - these being separated from the plays by the division of subjects . Mr. Hallam 's general scheme of distribution is a good one , and , as we have said , it has the weight of Lord Bacon 's authority but it seems to be too rigidly followed out . It were better to treat of one author in full , in that half century in which his principal works were published , and under that subject to which he chiefly devoted himself . The brilliant period of Lorenzo de ' Medici , when Florence became for a time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the brevity , which his limits required , but with a glow of language , that marks the natural attractions of the subject . The names of Politian , Ficinus , and . Iohn Picus of Mirandola are enough to cause one to pardon much to the political faults of the prince who patronized them , and of the city which gave them a home . They were men who enriched genius with learning , and if they al - lowed the one to pass out in extravagance , they prevented the other from degenerating into slavishness and pedantry . If the Platonic enthusiasm of the two latter displayed itself with too little regard to the limitations of reason and good sense , much excuse for them may be found in the circumstances , which first kindled their ardent feelings and gave too wide a range to'their speculations . The study of Greek , a taste for which followed so soon upon the revival of Latin literature , enabled them to pass from the elegant but meagre // disquisitions of Cicero , to the eloquent and suggestive dreams of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they found ample nutriment for speculation in the dogmas of their own church , and the mingled philosophy and theology of the Grecian sage . They were shielded from the charge of heresy by the recondite nature of their studies , and the lofty flight and mystical expression of their doctrines . Their taste first led them to the study of Plato , whose full-robed and gorgeous speculations in their eyes far outshone the dry technicalities and verbal subtilties , to which the philosophy of Aristotle had been reduced . Afterwards , the license of speculating on such lofty themes began to be fascinating in itself , apart from external decorations , and they learned to mingle the still more fanciful doctrines of the later Platonists , - the Alexandrian school , - with the original teachings of the master . The casual coincidence of these dogmas with some parts of the Christian scheme has often contributed to their popularity , and made them an object of study with those whose minds were naturally inclined to religious mysticism . This partial agreement was sufficient to shield the system that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant priesthood but his friend and pupil , Picus of Mirandola , whose ardent temperament and thirst for knowledge had involved him in the mysteries of Oriental philosophy and the Jewish Cabala , was not so fortunate . The nine hundred theses on all subjects , metaphysical , theological , magical , and cabahistical , which he published at Rome , and offered to defend against all comers , roused the suspicion of churchmen , who could not understand them . A great clamor was raised , and he was obliged to retract and explain to a considerable extent , before the Pope pronounced him free from censure . Mr. Hallam remarks , that the whole Platonic theology of Ficinus " appears a beautiful , but too visionary and hypothetical system of theism , the ground-works of which lay deep in the meditations of ancient Oriental sages . " It belongs to a class of speculations , which have exercised more or less the aspiring and fanciful minds of every age . The eager curiosity of men respecting the nature and origin of the human soul , its connexion with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligences , has caused the formation of a great number of systems , imposing from the // grandeur of the subject considered , captivating from the gorgeous dress in which the doctrines are usually conveyed , but heating and unsatisfactory in their effects , and having no support either in reason or revelation . Indulgence in such fancies seems to incapacitate the mind for calm judgment and sound reasoning , and for any application of the common laws of scientific inquiry . In reading the exposition of them , one is at a loss to know whether the writer puts them forth as serious doctrines , which are to be examined and admitted , or rejected , on the strength of the reasons advanced , or as mere poetical dreams , which may please the intellect for a time , in the same manner that the taste and fancy are gratified by fiction and romance . Revelation affords no materials for them , and seems even to discountena* ce their formation . The teachings of Christianity are exclusively practical in their aim , though , to a certain extent , speculative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basis , or sanction , for the moral precept . Mere curiosity is never indulged , for the object of religion is not knowing , hut doing . The immortality of the soul , and the being and attributes of a God , are revealed as furnishing objects for pious meditation , and incentives to virtuous conduct ; hut no information is vouchsafed respecting the mode of a future life , the manner of spiritual existence , or the relation which the enfranchised spirit will hear to the Deity . The ambitious mind may speculate upon these questions , but it will speculate in vain . The entire want of success in the inquiry is apparent at once to the cool observer , though it is hidden from the wild imagination and excited brain of him who is engaged in the profitless pursuit . Gleams of the invisible world seem to open upon his straining eyes . Things around him appear to lose their reality . The words of Scripture no longer convey a plain precept , or narrate a simple fact ; they are invested with a hidden meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being . An ambitious and erratic philosophy thus passes over into an insane illuminatism , and he , who began as a scientific inquirer , ends with bringing forward the absurd pretensions of a miracleworker and a prophet . Spiritual impostures have germinated alike in the cell of the fanatic , and in the closet of the over ardent and daring seeker after speculative truth . Picus of Mirandola is one of the most remarkable instances // of a great mind , unhappily perverted by such delusions . As a prodigy of early attainments , no parallel can be found for him , except in the half fabulous story of the Admirable Crichton . He came to Florence when he was but txventy-two years old , having at that early age exhausted all the metaphysics and theology that were taught in the schools , acquired a knowledge of Hebrew and other Eastern languages , and made for himself a name among scholars and men of taste by the graces of his Latin composition and Italian poetry . He had come to loathe the philosophy then commonly taught in the schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more closely the doctrines of Plato and Aristotle , he became convinced , that they were but different expositions of the same system , and were both derived in the main from the books of Moses , which appeared to him to be the common storehouse of all science and art . r* hi notion inspired him with new zeal for the study of the Oriental languages , and especially of the Cabalistic books , whence he derived the greater part of his celebrated theses . Though many of these books , which he had sought out with great pains , were but modern forgeries , he believed that they contained a true revelation , and furnished the only means for demonstrating the divine mission of the Saviour , and explaining the mysteries of Christianity . His great plan , which he did not live to finish , was but an expansion of that of the later Platonists , being intended to reconcile all differences of doctrine , and to unite all theories in one grand eclectic system . He died at the early age of thirty-two , leaving a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a warning example against those pursuits , on which he had expended his marvellous industry and genius , without profit either to himself , or to his fellow-man . The Platonic Academy at Florence , which engrossed so much of the favor of Loreuzo de ' Medici , and of which Ficinus and Picus were the distinguished ornaments , hardly survived their deaths ; but the disposition which it had created for wild and fanciful speculations in theology and philosophy , continued to be perceptible in the schools for nearly a century . The mystics and theosophists henceforward occupy a prominent place in the history of philosophy , till the labors of Bacon and Descartes exposed the fruitlessness and vanity of their theories , and established the method and principles // of philosophizing for modern times . The history of this speculative movement in the fifteenth and a part of the sixteenth century is curious , as it shows the first effect of the new-horn zeal for letters , and the increased study of the languages , on the philosophical tendencies of the age . The knowledge of Greek and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared with all the freshness of recent inquiries , and enriched what had seemed hitherto as an exhausted ground of speculation . On the first opening of a new store of systems , the points of similarity , which they exhibit with each other , and with theories previously known , naturally come first into notice , and the primary effect is to encourage the introduction of Eclecticism into philosophy . In this way , the Alexandrian school arose , forming a connecting link between the ancient systems of the Greeks , and the theology of later times , and of other countries . The comprehensive view of other theories , which forms the groundwork of an Eclectic philosophy , encourages lofty expectations of the ultimate ends to be obtained ; and the forced and allegorical interpretations , which are rendered necessary by the attempt to reconcile conflicting doctrines , lead to a mystical form of thought and language . Enthusiasm and mysticism are the twin children of an Eclectic spirit in the schools of speculation . The Platonic Academy at Florence commenced a movement , which was at once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Platonists , and which would have produced equally great results , if the rapidly increased learning and intelligence of the age had not earlier checked its progress . Maturer study and reflection bring out the points of contrast and the antagonist principles of different theories , and expose the futility of any attempt to melt them into one . The invention of the art of printing , and the reformation in the church , with the consequent enlarged freedom of thought and inquiry , were destined to produce better fruits in philosophy , than the mere revival and conglomeration of old errors . Descartes showed , that the whole work must be commenced anew , on a different foundation , and with fresh materials ; and Bacon established the method and the principles , on which the new structure was to be reared . The character and labors of the most eminent men of letters during the first century and a half after the invention of // the art of printing appear in strong contrast , in some respects , with those of a similar class in our own age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what appears to be the superior industry of the former , and their greater devotedness to the cause . The men of this generation seem like dwarfs , following in the footsteps of giants . Scholars then worked without any of the rich means and appliances of study , which now enable a schoolboy to accomplish in a month , what then required the toil of years . Grammars and dictionaries were either to be prepared for the first time , or could be found only in a rude and imperfect state . Separate and full treatises on collateral subjects did not assist the student with a rich store of subsidiary information . But modern scholarship , with its ample apparatus , and all its accuracy and refinement , looks puny and trivial , when one contemplates the gigantic monuments of toil , that were left behind them by such men as Budams , Scaliger , Turnebus , and Stephens . Weighing the two classes of scholars together , seems to be like an attempt to balance the ponderous folios , which inclose the learning of those times , against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a generous breadth of margin , which gratify the luxurious tastes of our contemporaries . Both in London and Paris , a little army of commentators and other laborers were recently employed on a new edition of Henry Stephens 's Thesaurus , one of the earliest Greek lexicons , as it certainly is one of the largest . The original work was perfected by one man , and was by no means the only , or even the chief , labor of his life , while the modern edition employed so many hands , and was several years in progress . A fanciful writer might compare the modern editors to a swarm of insects , hovering over the carcass of a lion . It may be noticed also , that competent judges do not find the new edition so far superior to the original in fullness and accuracy , as might be expected from the great facilities for rendering it a perfect work . The division of labor , and the distraction of different employments , are undoubtedly the cause of this apparent inferiority of modern days . The scholars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because they worked only a small field . They were well acquainted with the Latin and Greek classics , because they had no occasion // to study any thing else . Science was hardly created , at least in the extended modern signification of the term . How many branches of it exist now , and how comprehensive and varied , a general knowledge of which is essential to every well-educated person , though he may choose to concentrate his own efforts , in the main , on a single department of letters , or one object of research . The accumulated productions of the human mind during three active centuries lie around the scholar in endless profusion , and , as it is ever more easy and delightful to receive than to create , it needs no little selfdenial to turn away from such a banquet , and devote one s labors to a single and narrow task . Besides , in a former age , the work was to be commenced from the very foundation , and every inch of an individual 's progress carried forward the limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it requires much time and toil to reach the startingpoint of fresh inquiry , and many are employed on a secondary task , - in working over again , putting into new shapes , and reducing to a shorter compass , the stores of learning inherited from former centuries . There is as much activity of mind as ever , but the fruits of it do not all appear on the surface . But it must be conceded , that the labor of working up to the present boundaries of knowledge does not favor the disposition or the capacity to extend those limits . A new science , a new object of study or effort , is prosecuted with much greater zeal and success in the earlier years of its history , than after it has made considerable progress , and is established as a regular department of education . The published correspondence of such men as Erasmus , Scaliger , and their learned contemporaries , shows the singular acerbity with which their literary controversies and personal disputes were managed . The whole vocabulary of abuse is applied with a vigor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers in modern times might derive a lesson . Judging from the specimens that we have of their letters , and other controversial writings , it does not appear , that the " still air of delightful studies * was favorable to gentleness of disposition or patience under wrong . Perhaps it may be laid down as a general truth , that men who are more conversant with books than with society , who are more accustomed to use language on paper than in conversation , do not weigh the force of harsh terms , or observe // the proprieties of dispute with that caution , which characterizes the speech of persons , who mingle much with the world . It requires more effrontery to speak with freedom , than to write with it ; and reproachful language committed to paper is dwelt upon and studied , till it rouses all the angry passions of him to whom it is addressed . When the matter in dispute borders upon theological ground , the violence with which it is urged is naturally increased , and this circumstance explains much of the haste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now speaking of , were conducted . Nearly all the actors in them were excited by the strife in words that accompanied the Reformation , and it is well known with how much heat this great religious quarrel was carried on . iiJany of Luther 's publications are summarily characterized by Mr. Hallam as " bellowing in bad Latin . " The remarks of our author on the Reformation and its effects are very brief , hut they are well considered , and display very favorably his cool and impartial judgment . The theme lay in his path , for the influence of this great religious movement is very apparent in the history of letters in general , to say nothing of the store of publications which it directly occasioned . We extract a paragraph , that contains an ingenious and striking comparison . " We can not give any attention to the story of the Reformation , without being struck by the extraordinary analogy it bears to that of the last fifty years . lie who would study the spirit of this mighty age may see it reflected as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Man , who , speaking of him col. lectively , has never reasoned for himself , is the puppet of impul. ses and prejudices , be they for good or for evil . These are , in the usual course of things , traditional notions and sentiments , strengthened by repetition , and running into habitual trains of thought . Nothing is more difficult , in general , than to make a nation perceive any thing as true , or seek its own interest in any manner , but as its forefathers have opined or acted . Change in these respects has been , even in Europe , where there is most of flexibility , very gradual ; the work , not of argument or instruction , but of exterior circumstances slowly operating through a long lapse of time . There have been , however , some remark . able exceptions to this law of uniformity , or , if I may use the term , of secular variation . The introduction of Christianity seems to have produced a very rapid subversion of ancient pre . judices , a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiments flow , in nations that have at once received it . This has also not unfrequently happened through the influence of Mohammedism in the East . Next to these great revolutions in extent and degree , stand the two periods we have begun by comparing ; that of the Reformation in the sixteenth century , and that of political innovation wherein we have long lived . In each , the characteristic features are a contempt for antiquity , a shifting of prejudices , an inward sense of self-esteem leading to an assertion of private judgment in the most uninformed , a sanguine confidence in the amelioration of human affairs , a fixing of the heart on great ends , with a comparative disregard of all things intermediate . In each there has been so much of alloy in the motives , and , still more , so much of danger and suffering in the means , that the cautious and moderate have shrunk back and sometimes retraced their own steps , rather than encounter evils which at a distance they had not seen in their full magnitude . Hence we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what again More , Erasmus , Melanethon , Oriander , would have been in the nineteenth century , and what our own contemporaries would have been in their times . But we are too apt to judge others , not as the individualities of personal character and the varying aspects of circumstances rendered them , and would have rendered us , but according to our opinion of the consequences , which , even if estimated by us rightly , were such as they could not determinately have foreseen . " - pp. 283 , 284 . Among the more valuable portions of Mr. Hallam 's work are the clear and full notices of the philosophical writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . The summary given in each instance is necessarily brief , but it is distinct and precise , so far as it goes . The historian is content to act in his only proper office , which from the nature of the case is a secondary one , - to develope the views or the system of another , without interlarding it too much with his own opinions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He never uses the theory of another only as a pretext for expounding his own . Frequently he confines himself to the humble task of making an analysis or abstract of a particular treatise , and allowing the reader to form his own conclusions respecting its truth and value . The influence of a system is estimated from effects aemally produced , from known facts in the subsequent history of speculation , and not from a dogmatical view of the necessary consequences of // certain opinions . In the amount and clearness of the information afforded , Mr. Hallam 's work is far superior to Dugald Stewart 's agreeable but sketchy " Dissertation on the Progress of Metaphysical , Ethical , and Political Philosophy . " it does not contain so many pleasing disquisitions , nor is it written with such copiousness and elegance of style . But the parts are more justly proportioned and coherent with each other , and the history is more definite and complete in itself . Stewart too often takes for granted the reader 's general acquaintance with the subject , and therefore considers it only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and there upon the main topic , but does not consider it methodically and at length . His dissertation affords some very pleasant reading , but is unsatisfactory as a whole , and is almost useless as a work of general reference . Mr. Hallam 's book is less ambitious in its aim , but it is more complete and instructive . The account of Lord Bacon 's writings , and of the chief characteristics of his philosophy , is carefully labored , and fully sustains the justness of the preceding remarks . The topic was a perplexing one to manage , not that it is difficult to offer something new respecting it , for though trite it is not exhausted ; but because so many clashing opinions and superficial views are entertained respecting the nature and the value of the Baconian philosophy . Few subjects are so much talked about and so imperfectly studied . It is no trifling task to master its details and become thoroughly acquainted with its spirit and general bearing , though fragments may be gathered , and crude and imperfect notions imbibed , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we possess only a part of the system , which was laid out with such wonderful breadth and method in the Instauratio Jllagna , but which the author did not live to finish . It may be questioned , whether he ever expected to finish it himself , even if he had hoped for a longer life and greater leisure , than he was destined to enjoy . His scheme covered the whole ground , reaching up not only to the actual , but to the possible limits of human knowledge , and , notwithstanding the great progress of science since his day , we are still far from realizing his magnificent anticipations . Laboring at once on several portions of the grand plan , endeavouring not only to establish the theory , but to exemplify it by his own discoveries , and frequently interrupted // in his studies by the active business of life , it is not strange , that some difficulty should be found in piecing together the parts of his unfinished work , and ascertaining the whole reach and aim of his philosophy . It is easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to show the direction in which it leads , and to comment on a few of the pregnant and instructive maxims , which are found in its details . But it does not admit of being summed up in a single aphorism . It probably did not dawn upon Bacon himself as one idea , capable , indeed , of numberless applications , and leading a thousand ways , but all referrible to a single point . Those who speak of induction and experiment as his sole method , of physical science as the only field , and of practical utility as the solitary aim of his speculations , have but a very imperfect idea of the Baconian philosophy . The great merit of Bacon does not consist in his overthrow of the philosophy of the schools , any more than that of Socrates depends on the refutation of the Sophists . Both these great minds were more skilful to create than to destroy , and their fame rests on their success in animating and directing the efforts of their followers and successors , and on the consequent positive accession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , the authority of the Aristotelian philosophy had visibly declined . Within the moss-covered walls of the universities , indeed , its adherents still maintained their ground ; but the barrenness of the system was perceived , and it continued to be taught only because nothing but mystical speculations or arbitrary hypotheses were offered in its place . The subtilties and vain refinements of the scholastic logic and philosophy were still exercised in the theological field , but science gained nothing in this warfare of words , and the futility of the dispute was generally manifest . The Instauratio . Magna begins with remarks on the decayed condition of philosophy and natural science , as an admitted fact . " The very authors , " - we paraphrase rather than translate the words of Bacon ,  --  " the very authors who have arrogated to themselves a dictatorship in the sciences , and decide with so much confidence on all subjects , when they come to themselves after a short interval , begin to complain of the subtilty of Nature , the dark recesses in which truth is hidden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of causes , and the weakness // of human intellect ; appearing none the more modest for this , - that they chose to refer their failure to the common unlucky fate of men and things , rather than confess their individual weakness . " The wisdom which we have inherited from the Greeks , he continues , has become a kind of scientific play , and is proper only for boys . It is fertile in controversies , but barren of fruit . A particular examination of the state of the sciences at this period , would cast another shade over this gloomy picture . Astrology , alchemy , and natural magic were still favorite objects of inquiry and research . There were glimmerings of dawn in the science of the heavens , but the true theory was not yet separated from the false . It was one guess among many . The sailor steered his vessel by the compass and the pole-star , and not by regular observations of the heavenly bodies . Still he went boldly on his course , and geography as a science had made rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary of the prevalent systems of philosophy , and wished for a better , but knew not whither to turn . With such aids and lights on his path , Bacon commenced his task of legislating for science , - of governing a kingdom that existed as yet only in the far-reaching sagacity of his own mind . The task seemed much like that of Plato , establishing laws for his ideal republic , or of Sir Thomas More , directing the affairs of Utopia . But how different the result ! To illustrate his precepts by a running commentary of examples , we must have recourse to the most brilliant discoveries of modern times , - to the Optics of Newton , the experiments of Lavoisier on the gases , those of Davy on the alkalies , of Watt on Steam , and of Franklin on electricity . The younger Herschel , in his excellent " Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy , " has recently completed a survey of modern science , and of the methods by which , enlightened by past experience , inquirers are now conducting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentional , is still the most instructive commentary on the . N'ovum Organon . If the historical survey were extended a little farther , if one should examine the failures of scientific effort , the false theones and exploded hypotheses , of the last two centuries , and thus ascertain the causes of error , he would complete the illustration of another branch of the Baconian philosophy . // It is this forecast of mind , this comprehensive and clear view of science , not as it was , hut in the state which it was destined to attain , that gives the most vivid idea of the commanding genius of Bacon . He did not deduce rules from practice , as the Greek critics founded a theory of Epic poetry on the examples of Homer in the Iliad and the Odyssey . The history of the past displayed a warning , hut offered no guidance , and he looked to the future only for a satisfactory trial of his method . He aimed to effect a complete survey of the field of human knowledge , and by comparing the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine what efforts were to be prosecuted , and what relinquished from the impracticability of the end proposed . To adopt his own illustration , he wished no longer to wander darkling on the plain , but to mount the watchtower of a higher science , - speculam altioris scientice , - whence the whole field could be seen in one view , and the bearings and relations of all its parts be clearly defined . He had full confidence in the future , and the gloomy lessons of experience could not shake bis trust . " As for the possibility , " he observes , " they are ill discoverers , who tbink there is no land , when they can see nothing but sea . " From his elevated position , not only did his eye catch the first beams of the rising sun , long before it was visible from the plain below , but he beheld the vast region on which it shone . Its high mountains , and pleasant valleys , and broad fields , rich with the promise of harvest , were all extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out for the benefit of coming generations , who were to enter in and take possession . It seems , therefore , that Cowley , in his quaint fashion , has aptly enough expressed the nature of the service , which the great Jmprover of Learning rendered to his fellowmen . Bacon , like Moses , led us forth at last ; The barren wilderness he passed , Did on the very border stand Of the blest promised land ; And , from the mountain-top of his exalted wit , Saw it himself , and showed us it . ' One quality , which has added to the popularity and consequently to the influence of Bacon 's writings , is the impressive character of his style . His imagination was often misled by the false taste of the age , but its power and grandeur // could not be entirely perverted or hidden . It sometimes flashes with the greatest brilliancy , when the subject appears to afford the least scope for its appearance , and it is always at hand to minister to his intellect , or to lend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly enveloped in the most splendid imagery , which hangs round it like the drapery round the limbs of an ancient statue , only giving higher ideas of the strength and symmetry of the form , which it partially conceals . His wit often degenerates into conceit , and his fancy is discursive and lawless ; but these qualities lend vivacity and point to the aphorisms , in which his most striking thoughts are conveyed , and give them a stronger hold on the attention and memory of the reader . On the whole , the style of Bacon is unique , and it certainly can not be recommended as a model for philosophical writings but it gives a vivid idea of the strength and comprehensiveness of his genius , and it has aided and widened the influence of his speculations . Mr. Hallam appears to be little sensible of its power , for his remarks upon it are confined to a censure of the strange and rather fantastic nomenclature , which Bacon attempted to introduce into science . We may admit the awkwardness of the terms thus invented , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's style . We have said , that it is impossible to sum up the Baconian philosophy in a single proposition . No one word offers the key-note of the whole system . No single theory is presented with a show of sweeping generalization , aided by which we can resolve the errors of former inquirers , and be guided in future by a safe path to a certain result . Mr. Hallam justly observes , that Bacon obtained " a triumph over arrogant usurpation without seeking to substitute another ; and he may be compared with those liberators of nations , who have given them laws by which they might govern themselves , and retained no homage but their gratitude . " In consequence , his name is not specially connected with any one speculation or method , and his philosophy can not be brought at once to any simple and decisive test . It must be studied as a whole , in the same comprehensive spirit in which it was conceived . Its theme is as broad as the whole field of human knowledge , and its parts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connexion , or arbitrarily included under a single principle . Every one knows // that induction , as a method of study , is at least as old as Aristotle . But Bacon first perceived its full importance as a means of scientific inquiry , analyzed it , and determined the proper rules of its application . We are familiar enough with the modes of its present use ; hut how many instances can he found of its successful application as an implement of science in the ages before the thue of Galileo and Bacon ? It was easy to hit upon , for it was in common use by the vulgar , after a rude fashion , in their ordinary concerns . But it was not in favor with philosophers and men of science . They were ambitious of a higher organon of investigation . Fanciful hypotheses , hasty anticipations of the truth , longdrawn deductions from principles arbitrarily assumed , endless commentaries and explanations of the writings of men , who were supposed to have mastered all science only because they lived nearer to the infancy of the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient observation and methodical study , was used as a means of increasing the stores of human knowledge . Bacon showed the way to success by reversing their methods , and teaching humility as the first lesson . He was humble in the choice of means , for he recommended beginning with particulars , and rising by degrees to general propositions , - a course which had hitherto been viewed with contempt . But he inculcated self-dependence , by repudiating the authorities which had long reigned paramount in the schools . He did not wholly reject the Aristotelian logic , but he limited its use to verbal disputes , and proved that it was inapplicable to discovery and invention . He claimed no superiority for physics over speculative science , but he divided their respective territories by a broad line of distinction , and restricted each to the employment of its own proper means of investigation . He discouraged mere speculation in natural science , because it was fruitless ; but he also showed the absurdity of merely accumulating particular facts without any principle of order or selection , as from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is best illustrated by himself , though we are again obliged to paraphrase rather than translate the quotation . " Those who have hitherto treated the sciences , have been either empyrics or dogmatists . The empyrics , like ants , only heap up their stores , and use them for food . The speculatists , like spiders , spin their webs out of themselves . // The middle course is that of the bee , which gathers materials from the flowers of the garden and the field , but works them over and digests them by its own faculties . Not unlike this process is the true business of philosophy , which does not depend either wholly or chiefly on the original power of mind , nor yet does it gather materials from natural history and mechanical experiments to be stored away entire in the memory , but to be refashioned and digested by the intellect . " * The philosophy of Bacon is not exclusively utilitarian in its aim or tendency . He did not restrict the ends or uses of science to the physical well-being of mankind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , who confined themselves to frothy declamations concerning virtue and the true nature of happiness , and neglected the real improvement of the race . It is undoubtedly true , that the inductive method properly so called , as explained in the . N'ovum Organon , has a primary reference to physical science , and , through that , to the increase of human power , and the multiplication of bodily comforts . How highly Bacon estimated such results is apparent from the way in which he speaks of the three great inventions of modern times , - the art of printing , gunpowder , and the mariner* s compass . These three , he observes , have changed the appearance and condition of things over the whole earth , - the first in literature , the second in war , the third in navigation . Innumerable changes have followed these inventions , - " so that no empire , no sect , no star seems to have exercised so great power and influence over human affairs , as these mechanical contrivances . " t But the inductive method is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . N'ovurn Organon , very incomplete in itself , when perfected , was destined to fill up only a portion of the scheme described in the Instauratio *Magna , which was meant to include all the objects of human knowledge . Ethical science occupies one division of the treatise on the " Advancement of Learning , " and the whole spirit of this work is opposed to any narrow views of the objects to be studied , or the ends to be gained , by the scientific inquirer . Mere practical utility is nowhere held up as the only purpose to be answered by the advancement of knowledge . Not unworthy in itself , it was not broad // and dignified enough to be considered by Bacon as the proper limit of endeavour . It is everywhere taken for granted , that knowledge is a sufficient good in itself , and , the desire to attain it being presupposed , the writer 's chief care is to guide the student into the proper path , and to direct his efforts . This high appreciation of learning for its own sake can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighty words . " Lastly ; leaving the vulgar arguments , that by learning man excelleth man in that wherein man excelleth beasts ; that by learning man ascendeth to the heavens and their motions , where in body he can not come , and the like ; let us conclude with the dignity and excellency of knowledge and learning in that whereunto man 's nature doth most aspire , which is immortality or continuance ; for to this tendeth generation , and raising of houses and families ; to this buildings , foundations , and monuments ; to this tendeth the desire of memory , fame , and celebration , and in effect the strength of all other human desires . We see then how far the monuments of wit and learning are more durable than the monuments of power , or of the hands .

Neither are they fitly to be called images , because they generate still , and cast their seeds in the minds of others , provoking and causing infinite actions and opinions in succeeding ages ; so that , if the invention of the ship was thought so noble , which carrieth riches and commodities from place to place , and consociateth the most remote regions in participation of their fruits ; how much more are letters to be magnified , which , as ships , pass through the vast seas of time , and make ages so distant to participate of the wisdom , illuminations , and inventions , the one of the other .

But Bacon certainly did not consider the power and happiness thus obtained , as the greatest contribution of science to the well-being of mankind . The question , which has excited some controversy , whether the philosophy of mind falls within the scope of Bacon 's inquiry , and is to be prosecuted by his method , can be easily answered , when we have fairly determined what that philosophy is , and what forms its proper object . The first branch of it is Mental Science , or the Philosophy of the Mind , properly so called . Psychology is the latest term in common use , and is perhaps the most convenient one . Here we are concerned with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the supposed seat or origin of various phenomena , that admit of number , arrangement , and classification . These phenomena , again , are not produced fortuitously , or at random , but are subject to fixed laws , more or less obvious , that may be definitely expressed . The phenomena are often complex , also , and need to be analyzed and reduced to their simplest elements . We speak of the science as confined entirely to the mind , without forgetting that one important point in it is the question , whether there be any such separate existence as the mind , distinct from matter . If this question be determined in the negative , it would appear , at first sight , that no division can be made , - that there is no room for any science separate from that , which treats of the laws and properties of bodies . Yet the subject is not really affected by the determination of this doubt . Every one is conscious of thinking , reasoning , willing ; of pleasure , love , and hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , figure , extension , and other qualities usually attributed to matter . Now , wedo not need to assume in the outset , that there is a separate existence or entity , in which the first class of these attributes inhere . There is no doubt that the two sets of phenomena are perfectly distinct from each other . There is no danger of confounding them . Avoiding all hypotheses , therefore , it may be said that psychology treats of those properties which we learn from consciousness ; physical science of those that we know through the senses . If this view is correct , if psychology is a science founded // on the observation of facts , and proceeding by successive generalizations , then the Baconian method is as applicable to it as to any other . It was so considered by Bacon himself , as appears from his very explicit language . " For human knowledge which concerns the mind has two parts ; the one that inquireth of the substance or nature of the soul or mind the other that inquireth of the faculties or functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much collect a history , and form tables , concerning anger , fear , shame , and the like , and also concerning examples from civil life , and as much concerning the intellectual operations of memory , combination and partition , judgment and the others , as concerning heat and cold , or light , or vegetation , or such things . " If further proof were xvanting , we might refer to the writings of Berkeley , Hartley , Reid , and others , as affording many happy instances of the successful application of the inductive method to this part of the philosophy of mind . The other branch of mental philosophy is far more comprehensive , and embraces all that is usually denominated Metaphysics . All science proceeds from one generalization to another ; and must end therefore at a point , - in a science that surveys the bases of all the others , determines their proper relations , and binds the whole into one orderly system of knowledge . It is true , that the word is commonly used in a more loose and popular sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently broad to include all the questions usually discussed by metaphysical writers , and it coincides exactly with Bacon 's division of the science . " Of Natural Philosophy the basis is Natural History , the stage next the basis is Physic , the stage next the vertical point is Metaphysic . " This last is concerned only with first principles ; it deals with a class of questions lying at the roots of other sciences , but usually passed over by the inquirer on the main subject , either from a fear that the discussion will lead too far from his proper track , or that the problems are insoluble , or that the solution may be taken for granted without affecting the remainder of the inquiry . Thus the psychologist studies the phenomena of mind , and the law of their arrangement , succession , and mutual dependence , putting aside , as we have done above , the question respecting the real nature of the thinking principle , and the efficient cause of the changes which it exhibits . So the student of // physical science investigates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , leaving quite out of view the problem respecting the essence of matter , and the formal causes , or internal constitution , of particular bodies , by virtue of which they exhibit their appropriate qualities , and are what they are . The latter portion of this problem , indeed , Lord Bacon seems to consider as forming the chief , if not the only , business of the metaphysician , though his province is now commonly understood to include the whole of the inquiries thus waved by the psychologist and the man of science , together with some others , that we proceed to notice . The ancients , it may be remarked in passing , unxvisely confounded the two branches of investigation , and fancied that they were studying nature , when they were only cavilling about abstruse questions of the kind above mentioned . Their physics were all metaphysics . Ethical philosophy treats of the rights and duties of moral beings . It considers man as a responsible agent , the subject of moral laws as absolute and imperative as those of an organic nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respecting duty and merit presupposes the free agency of man . Laws relating to conduct imply obli- gation and responsibility , and neither of these can exist without the power of determining our own actions . The dark problem of the freedom of the will , therefore , lies at the gate-way of all ethical inquiries , and most writers on the subject are content to hurry by it as an ugly phantom , with which , they thank their stars , no one but a metaphysician has any thing to do . Even the mathematician , in the axioms which form the basis of his science , and especially in the infinitesimal quantities , which he finds so useful at every stage of his progress , leaves behind him curious and subtile problems for the metaphysical inquirer to solve . The theologian , so far as he is concerned with natural religion , refers a portion of his difficulties , and those which lie the nearest to the starting-point of his inquiry , for the same person to consider and resolve . Lastly , at the root of all science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainty of knowledge itself . All study and research proceed from certain postulates , the truth of which is implied at the outset , and at every step of our progress . We rely on the fidelity of the senses , on the information // afforded by consciousness , memory , and the organs of observation . No inquirer thinks it necessary to examine the foundations of belief in general , for his own science is not more concerned than any other with the common basis of investigation . He is content to rest upon the common ground , leaving it to others to ascertain what the nature of belief is , and why it is granted in some cases and withheld in others . But this fundamental inquiry is a problem that we can not wholly wink out of sight . The answer to it must deeply affect our views of the dignity of human nature , and the certainty of human knowledge . It is possible to indulge a comprehensive skepticism , that affects not merely our trust in one proposition or one science , however important , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respecting our capacity for progress of any kind . The broad problem respecting the origin of knowledge has been agitated again and again by a class of inquirers reluctant to abandon the attempt altogether , yet half conscious that it transcends the farthest reach of their faculties . How is experience possible ? - is the question , according to Kant , that lies at the threshold of every system of metaphysics , which pretends to be called a science . His own solution is a mere evasion of the difficulty , and the problem remains , as before , a proof , that philosophers do not always succeed in dispelling the doubts , which their own speculations have raised . If this view of the province of metaphysics be correct , it follows , that , far from being excluded from Bacon 's inquiry , it covers the very position which he hoped to attain . It coincides very nearly with his philosophia prima , wherein he hoped to find the vantage-ground , from which to complete his survey and trial of all systems and all knowledge . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generalization , being , to adopt his own metaphor , the stage next to the vertical point of the pyramid of truth . It underlies all the other sciences , constitutes a point of departure for them , and , if any important discoveries within its province are ever effected , it must materially affect their principles and mutual relations . But , in this particular , it is hardly wise to entertain any sanguine expectations . The problems of which it consists have been constantly agitated from the infancy of the human race down to the present time ; but it would be hard to point out one difficulty that has been removed , or // one point that has been finally determined . Fortunately , they lie out of the path of the common inquirer , or they may be avoided by him without detriment to his further researches . If they are removed from this indepcndent position , and mingled with common investigations in science , they invariably perplex and mislead the student . Standing by themselves , they may task the ingenuity of the disputant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the attempt to solve them ends only in disappointment , the inquirer may console himself with the equal failure of those who have gone before , and with the indirect gain to his own powers of investigation , while engaged in the trial . We ascent entirely to the remark of a writer , who was certainly not prejudiced in favor of this abstruse science , that " the chief value of such speculations will be found to consist in the exercise which they afford to the faculties , and the delight which is produced by the consciousness of intel .. lectual exertion . " The question respecting the actual influence of Bacon 's genius on the progress of science since his time , is a curious one , and is discussed with ability and learning by Mr. flab lam . But we must pass over this portion of his remarks , and come to the account of the writings and philosophical merits of Descartes . Dugald Stewart has given to this cele* brated man the proud title of " Father of the experimental philosophy of the human mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lofty appellation , though his services were great , and his influence on the course of speculation in Europe was conspicuous , and , for the most part , beneficial for more than a century , and can hardly be said to have ceased at the present day . Literary history presents few more instructive examples of the reciprocal workings of thought and action , than that which is found in the life and writings of Ren6 Descartes . His active life , - a busy and eventful one ,  --  was designed , as he affirms , to be a prepara* tion for his philosophical labors , and these last , in their turn , modified and directed his conduct and fortunes . His vocation was a peculiar one , and was selected very early hi life and he educated himself for it with great care , not only in the academy and the closet , by books and lectures , but also in the crowded camp , on the battle*field , in the amusements of a great metropolis and the dissipation of a court , and , // finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an account of his life , and the progress of his studies , in the " Discourse upon Method , " the first of his philosophical publications . The narrative is a curious one , and we may rely in the main on its candor and truth , though it is doubtful whet*her his early career was governed exclusively by a single principle , and directed with such unity of purpose , as he represents , and as it probably appeared to him , when reflecting upon it in the latter part of his life . He was born in 1596 , of a noble , though not a wealthy family in Touraine . At an early age , he was sent to school at La Fh*che , to profit by the instruction of the Jesuits in the scholastic philosophy , which was then in vogue . The weakness of his health , particularly a complaint in his chest , procured for him a dispensation from the regular exercises of the seminary , and a permission to employ his leisure as he saw fit . This liberty he eagerly improved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , bad , or indifferent . The result was unfortunate . lie discovered such a conflict of opinions in science , so much disputation and uncertainty in philosophy , and such imperfect aids to investigation in the systems of logic which were then in use , that the pursuit of truth under the guidance of former inquirers seemed a hopeless task . Mathematics afforded him some relief , and he studied this science with ardor and success . But the field here was too narrow for his ambitious and grasping intellect , and he sought in vain for demonstrative evidence in the other sciences . He resolved , therefore , to give up his books , and to seek for the elements of a better philosophy in active life , - to study henceforth only the great volume of the world . He thought that men must regulate their daily conduct on more correct data and by sounder principles , than could be found in books , or they could not succeed so well . By mingling in their pursuits , and quitting the beaten paths of study , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his own guidance in erecting a new system of knowledge . If we may trust his own account , these were the meditations of a boy of sixteen . At this age , he quitted La Fl*che and went to Paris , where he remained for four years . A portion of this time he spent in study , devoting himself chiefly to mathematics , // and laying the foundation of those discoveries in geometry , which are among bis most important contributions to science . The remainder of the period he gave up freely to the amusemerits and dissipation of the metropolis . At the age of twenty he entered the army as a volunteer , and in the employ of Prince 1'laurice of Nassau , and , subsequently , of the Duke of Bavaria and the Emperor Ferdinand the Second , he saw much service and became fully acquainted with the military profession . He was present at the great battle of Prague , and on that and other occasions is said to bave distinguished himself in arms . Yet he disliked the employment , and had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the better to keep his original purpose constantly in view , and to make all his experience subservient to the great object of constructing a new system of inquiry and belief . Becoming weary of military life , he resigned his commission , and spent several years in travelling . He visited Denmark , Hungary , and Italy , and spent a year or two at Paris , and as much at his birthplace . With a temperament naturally sanguine and enthusiastic , constant meditation on his magnificent plans so heated his brain , that he was in danger of becoming insane . He had remarkable dreams for three nights in succession , in which it seemed that the great road to truth , the object of his constant search , was pointed out to him by divine aid , and a method indicated for establishing all science on an immovable basis . When he waked , of course , he could remember nothing distinctly , but he vowed that he would make a pilgrimage to Loretto , if he should ever be so happy as to recover these mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his devotion for a time to the doctrines of the Rosicrucians , a sect of mystifying quacks , who first came into notice about this period . But he soon detected the emptiness of their professions , and quitted them in disgust . At the age of thirty-three he went to Holland , intending to fix his abode there , and prepare for the world the fruits of his meditations and varied researches . And what had he gained from his extended travels , his renunciation of books , his military service , his twenty years observation of men and things ? At first view , it appeared that all had profited him little or nothing . He had found that common men engaged in active life were no wiser than // books and philosophers ; that opinions differed as widely in the mass , and fluctuated as rapidly in the individual ; that all persons relied on probabilities , because they could not attain to demonstration ; and that they did not arrive at a knowb edge of the truth , because they were drawn away from its pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seemed that he had derived from his experience some advantage in the discipline of his faculties , and the perception of the causes of the errors committed by others ; and he now wished to live in perfect retirement , that he might have leisure to mature his thoughts , and to prosecute his researches . He confided the secret of his retreat to one friend only , that his necessary correspondence by letters might be kept up , and changed his habitation frequently , that he might avoid the search of others , and any interruption from visiters , whom he detested . He was naturally timid , and the persecutions that Galileo was undergoing , deterred him for a long time from publishing any of his speculations . Overcome at last by the solicitations of friends , who knew the importance of his researches , he gave to the world his treatise " upon Method , " first published in 1637 . The character of Descartes appears with as much distineness in this short treatise , as in the preceding sketch of his early career . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercised by the severe discipline of mathematical study , and freed through his long intercourse with the world from the prejudices of the closet and the narrowing influences of exclusively scholastic pursuits . His boldness inclined even to arrogance , and he was not always willing to allow to others the same freedom of inquiry which he claimed for himself . He easily detected the fallacies and assumptions of the philosophical systems which were then current , and he aspired to erect one in their place , which should stand on as firm a basis , and be secured with as much method and strength , as the science of the geometer . The structure was to be entirely his own , and to include none of the forms or the materials of the theories which it was intended to displace . He had observed , he says , that works executed by one hand were more regular , and the parts more harmonious and better fitted to each other , than those which united the contributions of different minds and successive ages . The political constitution of Laceda*mon excelled that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the work of one mind , and came perfect from the conception of a single artificer . " I had remarked , also , that , in forming opinions on obscure subjects , it was unsafe to be influenced by the example of the greatest number , for one was often more likely to find the truth than many . instead of choosing , therefore , among the judgments of others , J thought it right to form an opinion for myself . But as those who walk by night proceed with slow and cautious steps , I resolved to look carefully around , so that if I did not advance fast , there might at least be no danger of falling . " He determined , therefore , to admit nothing except upon clear and certain evidence , to avoid precipitation in forming his judgments , to divide difficult questions into several parts and examine each in succession , and to treat all subjects of investigation in a certain order , beginning with the simplest , and rising by degrees to the more difficult and abstruse . These rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to find any speculative writer , before the time of Bacon and Descartes , who successfully reduced them to practice . Trhere was no great merit in the mere enunciation of them even at that period ; but to adhere to them with great closeness and fidelity in the exposition of a new theory of knowledge , affords proof of no ordinary strength and discipline of mind . The methodical and cautious manner in which he conducted his researches , and his strict adherence to the principles which he had established , had a happy influence on the formation of his style , which is a model of correctness , perspicuity , and good taste . He was rather imperious in disputation , and he certainly showed no lack of confidence in his own powers when he proposed his scheme for a thorough reform in philosophy . But his language at the commencement of his work was sufficiently subdued and modest . " I may be deceived , " he says , " and these may be nothing more than glass and pebbles , which I am here offering for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to errors , and how doubtful is the favorable testimony of friends . I do not intend , therefore , to point out a universal method of seeking after truth , but to describe the road on which I have travelled . The narration will at least serve the purpose of a history or a fable ; among some things which it will be well to imitate , others may be found , which ought carefully to be avoided . " // The philosophy of Descartes deserves attention and respect , not more from the mixture of important truths with the errors which it contains , than from the excellent spirit in which it was conceived , and the uniformity and careful adherence to principle , with which it was carried out . If we except the writings of Bacon , which were published but a few years before the " Discourse upon Method , " and which Descartes probably had not seen , it was the first steady assertion of the right of free inquiry in speculative science , after the bondage of thought for ages . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infallibility of the ancients , the superiority of their modes of inquiry , and the authority of the established schools , - the first attempt to found a theory of science on independent research and the dictates of common sense . It differed from the philosophy of Bacon , in that its own principles were reduced to practice , and an attempt was made to execute the work , for which the former proposed only to show the way . Bacon invented a method , while Descartes erected a system . Viewed as a whole , this system was defective and unsound , though it contained the germs of many truths . It had the inherent vice of an entire theory , which Bacon himself exposed in the most pregnant and forcible terms . " Another error , of a diverse nature from all the former , is the over early and peremptory reduction of knowledge into arts and methods ; from which time commonly sciences receive small or no augmentation . But asyoung men , when they knit and shape perfectly , do seldom grow to a farther stature ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is in growth ; but , when it once is comprehended in exact methods , it may perchance be farther polished and illustrated , and accommodated for use and practice ; but it increaseth no more in bulk and substance . " - Advancement of Learning , p. 55 . Misled by the example of the geometer , Descartes selected what may be termed the a priori method in speculation , - adopting a principle or a fact as the basis of the inquiry , and reasoning down from that to inferior truths . The chain of his philosophy begins with his own existence , and proceeds to the reality of a First Cause , the being of a God , on whose veracity the whole strength of the subsequent convictions is made to depend . He began by doubting every thing , by refusing to admit the validity of mathematical evi // dence , the existence of outward things , of his own body , or even of himself . Universal skepticism , he maintains , is the true point of departure in philosophy , for this alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does not carry us forward a step on the road to truth . How can I rise from this abyss of unbelief ? I doubt every thing but to doubt is to think , and thought implies existence . I think ; therefore I am . Hence , it appears that my own existence may be taken as a sure basis , on which to build a system of belief . I will begin with this , resolved to admit nothing as a philosophical truth , which may not be deduced from it by strict and accurate reasoning . But I have already supposed the non-existence of the outward world and of my own body , and it is evident that my own being is not affected by the want of them . The essence of my being , therefore , consists in thought , and is wholly independent of place , body , or any material thing . This being or entity , then , of which thought is the essence , is more easily known than the body , and may be conceived to exist , though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being , - that is , an existence capable of knowing , doubting , affirming , denying , and susceptible of pleasure and pain . But I may have experienced all these states without knowing any thing of the qualities or laws of matter , and therefore the study of matter can avail me nothing in the study of my mental constitution . Whatever is admissible by the senses , whatever can be pictured by the imagination as an outward thing , can not be subservient to the knowledge of mind . The next step in the theory , the proof of the being of a God , we had occasion to examine at length in a recent number of this Journal , and therefore we pass over it at present. * Having established the fact , that a perfect being exists , Descartes immediately deduces from it a ground of belief in the reality of the external world and in the legitimate inferences of die understanding . For a perfect being can not wilfully deceive his creatures , and therefore the faculties with which he has endowed us , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects , are worthy of trust . In other words , we are not liable to any errors but those which arise from the imperfect or unguarded use of the // senses and the understanding , and which may be ascertained and corrected by due care and diligence . According to this system , it is obvious , that even the intuitive convictions of the reason , - the axioms of geometry , for instance , - do not merit confidence for their own sake , or because they are absolute and universal , but we rely upon them through our trust in the wisdom and goodness of God . The fallacy of this method is very apparent ; for the credibility of intuition is made to depend upon a preceding argument ; and , whether demonstrative or not , this argument owes its only efficacy to the intuitive convictions on which it is built . More briefly , intuition is admitted on demonstrative evidence , though the demonstration itself is founded upon an intuition . The great merit of the Cartesian theory consists in the distinct recognition of personal existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the admirable argument for the immateriality of the thinking principle . These are the great services which the author rendered to the philosophy of mind , and they certainly go far to justify the praise , which is awarded to him by the historians of the science . The distinct enunciation of these truths by Descartes , and the publication of the works of Bacon , make the commencement of the seventeenth century an era of great importance in the history of opinions . Copernicus , Kepler , Galileo , and Descartes himself had already commenced the brilliant career of modern discovery in physical science . The two whose character and writings we have briefly noticed , accomplished as much for the philosophy of mind . Differing widely from each other in doctrine and in the systems of knowledge which they respectively advocated , we find a similar spirit pervading the works of both , the same contempt for the puerilities of the scholastic philosophy , the same freedom and originality of thought , and equally broad and generous views respecting the scope of human endeavour and the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that happy law of progress , which causes the mediocrity of one age to surpass the greater originality and power of its immediate predecessor . But their works will continue to be studied , as occupying a prominent place in the history of philosophy , and as curious monuments of the power and fertility of human genius . Mr. Hallam 's work is so rich in topics of interest , that we // have already gone beyond the proper limits of an article , in rather desultory remarks suggested by only a small portion of his labors . We close with the expression of gratitude to him for undertaking an important and difficult task , and of respect for the ability , learning , and taste , with which it is executed.
