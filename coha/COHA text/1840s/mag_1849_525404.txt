txt THE reputation of the public men of every country is the property of the nation , and illustrates the character of the government . This is especially so in the United States , where the invigorating influence of our free institutions is displayed in the lives of those who , deriving no aid from wealth or powerful connections , rise from the level of common exertion to distinction , and reach stations which interest the whole country in their history . The position which the Hon. Henry W. Hilliard has attained among the public men of the United States , is another instance of this influence which our brief history has furnished , and will make the following sketch of his life , up to the present moment , acceptable to our readers in every part of the country . He is a native of North Carolina , but shortly after his birth his parents removed to Columbia , in the State of South Carolina , where he grew up to man 's estate . He was educated at the South Carolina College-an institution justly celebrated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who have taken its degrees , and the enlightened patronage which it receives from the State . He graduated with distinction at eighteen ; and , as a proof of the early bias of his mind towards politics , it may be stated that the oration which he delivered on the occasion had for its subject , " The tendency of the American Government to exalt the character of its people . " In his youth he enjoyed the rare advaiitage of associating with men of mature minds , who had already reached distinction , but who extended to one whose aspirations after honorable preferment , and whose strong sympathy with intellectual exertion even then interested them , a friendship which cheered and stimulated him ; - such men as Preston , Legar&amp; , and others , who , at that time , exhibited in the Legislature of South Carolina , those great powers that have since earned for them the noblest national fame . Mr. Hilliard , after leaving college , entered immediately upon the study of the law , which he prosecuted for some time in Colunibia ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice in a new field , induced him to remove to Georgia , where he continued the study for nearly two years longer in the office of Judge Clayton , at Athens . Within a few days after reaching his twenty-first year , he was admitted to the Bar . At that time , when about to enter upon the career of manhood , he adopted those religious sentiments which he still entertains , and connected himself with the Methodist Episcopal Church  --  a church characterized by the earnestness of its faith , and the strong resemblance of some of its usages to Puritan habits . Of this Church he has ever since continued a member , engaging in its service , and unhesitatingly complying with its forms , which enjoin upon him the duty of proclaiming , at times in public , the truths of the Christian system . He commenced the practice of law ; but in a few months be was invited to fill a chair in the University of Alabama , and one of the subjects confided to him was the Constitution of the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he employed not only in instruction but in study , he resigned his appointment . Shortly after , having removed to Montgomery , he resumed the practice of his profession with great success . In 1838 the political course of Mr. Hilliard begins . The Hon. Dixon H. Lewis at that time represented the Montgomery district in Congress , and , having adopted Mr. Calhoun 's plan of the SubTreasury question , he undertook , upon his return home , to bring his constituents to the support of that measure in a series of able numbers which he published over the 610 Dec. // signature of a " Nullifier . " Most of the asp* ing men of that part of Alabama fell in with Mr. Lewis opinions ; but Mr. Billiard offered to them a very vigorous opposition . He replied to the articles of IIr . Lewis as they appeared , in the leading Whig paper of Montgomery , in six letters , over the signature of " Junius Brutus ; " and he succeeded in rallying the great body of the Whig party against the doctrines which Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention ; and while Mr. Lewis ' numbers were attributed to " a determination on the part of certain politicians of the extra session to bring over the nullifiers to the support of Mr. Van Buren 's administration , " Mr. Billiard 's replies were hailed as " an argumentative and eloquent refutation of Mr. Lewis ' views . " In the summer of 1838 , Mr. Billiard was elected to a seat in the Legislature of his State , after an animated contest ; and the triumph was regarded with pleasure , even in South Carolina , where the discussion to which we have referred had been observed with much interest . The most important paper published in Columbia expressed high gratification at the success " of the leading champion of the cause in refuting the arguments in Mr. Dixon Lewis ' papers ; " and it added , " the election of Mr. Billiard is the decision of the controversy between Junius B rutus ' ( Mr. Billiard ) and A Nullifier ; ' ( Mr. Lewis ; ) and this deed of the stripling with his sling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Billiard is of our college-he left us some years since , carrying with himthe best wishes and the high expectation of this community . " Judge Smith , who had previously distinguished himself as a Senator of the United States from South Carolina , was , at that time , a member of the Alabama Legislature ; and , in an elaborate speech , he urged that body to adopt resolutions instructing the Senators from that State to give their support to the SubTreasury scheme . The task of replying to him was assigned to Mr. Billiard by his political friends in the House ; and the manner in which he acquitted himself heightened the reputation which he had before acquired . His argument was a full one ; and we find his views of the doctrine of instruction , as applied to Senators in Congress , expressed with so much justness and force , that we regret our limited space will not allow us to quote them at length . After adverting to Edmund Burke 's splendid and philosophical exposition of the relation existing between the representative and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Senator of the United States to the Legislature of a State , was a peculiar and limited one . " It was the aim of the Constitution to ensure to the Senate of the United States a fixed and steady policy , to protect the exercise of an enlightened and independent judgment , and to encourage the infiucuce of lofty and expanded considerations . In the representative branch of the National Legislature , every popular feeling , and even prejudice , is expected to be felt and exhibited ; coming from the great body of the people , directly responsible to them , and holding offices for so brief a season , they are supposed to feel sensitively , and to reflect most faithfully every fluctuation in public sentiment . But the waves of popular commotion , which will sometimes , in the purest republics , and among the most generous people , rise too suddenly and mount too high , are expected to dash and break at the feet of a calm and unmoved Senate . " Against the political features *of the Sub-Treasury scheme , his argument was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be under the control of Congress , and as little dependent as possible on the President ; that " among the powers assigned to Congress , is the control of the public funds , in itself a very high trust . They the representatives of the people are to guard the treasure of the nation with unrelaxing vigilance , and no appropriation can be made without their action . It will at once be seen how deeply this arrangement concerns popular liberty , and any measure which proposes to disturb this adjustment of power , is condemned by the Constitution , and is hostile to the dearest public interests . " Mr. Billiard served but one session in the Legislature-professional engagements inducing him to decline a reelection . He took part , however , in the great contest of 1840 . Having urged in the Harrisburg Convention , of which he was a member , the nomination of Mr. Clay without success he returned - t* Ala1849. 611. // bama and threw himself into the contest for Gen. Harrison with his characteristic energy . Being the elector for his district , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming majority for the Whig candidates . So powerful an impulse was given to the cause that it rolled its triumphant tide over South Alabama , and shook the mountain fastnesses of the northern portion of that State . In Georgia , too , Mr. Hulliard exerted himself , with the greatest success , for the interests of the Whig party . The next year he was nominated for Congress , but the Legislature interfered in behalf of Mr. Lewis , and , for the first time , adopted the general ticket systemreferring the question whether it should continue to be the mode of electing representatives , to the people , who decided that the district system should be restored . Mr. Hilliard received in bis own district an overwhelming majority , but was , of course , defeated by the northern portion of the State . In the summer of 1841 , he was offered a foreign mission , which he declined ; but in the spring of 1842 , he was sent out as Minister to Belgium , to succeed the Hon. Virgil Maxey , who was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with the representatives of other nations , and afforded him the opportunity of becoming extensively acquainted with the condition of the European States . His own countrymen travelling abroad received from him such attention as have been , on more than one occasion , the subject of public acknowledgements . One of our own citizens , residing in Albany , who , in company with three others from the State of New York , visited Brussels in 1843 , described Mr. Hilliard " as really an American Minister and a practical republican . " Mr. Hilliard voluntarily gave up his mission , and returned to the United States in the fall of 1844-having repreresented his country in a manner so satisfactory that he acquired the good will of the Belgian Government , while he enjoyed the confidence of his own ; and while the Belgian journals of Brussels contained the most favorable notices of him when about to retire from the Belgian Court , he received from home an official assurance that his resignation was accepted because it had been repeatedly tendered , and that his conduct was entirely approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then going on , and warmly advocated the election of Mr. Clay . in the spring of the next year he was brought out as a candidate for Congress . T*h* Montgomery district was , at that time , represented by a democrat ; and the task of redeeming it was not a light one . Mr. Hilliard was , however , elected and took his seat in the House of Representatives at the opening of the twenty-ninth Congress . Since that time he has become well known to the whole country . A great question which came before Congress , excited the deepest concern in the public mind , and which gave rise to a protracted and powerful debate in both houses , afforded him the opportunity at once of exhibiting his powers . Mr. C. J. Ingersoll , chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , soon after the opening of the session , reported to the house a resolution , instructing the President to give notice to the Government of Great Britain of our intention to terminate the joint occupancy of the Oregon Territory , the title to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Hillard made one of the first speeches upon the question , and took a position that was new and bold ; he proposed to amend Mr. Ingersoll 's resolution , which instructed the President to give the contemplated notice forthwith , so as to empower the President to give the notice , at such time as , in his judgment , the *uhlic welfare might require it , thus transferring the responsibility from Congress to the Executive , where it properly belonged . His speech in support of his views was pronounced on all sides to be a most triumphant one . It made a profound impression on the house and the country , and he at once took rank with the first debaters in Congress . Political and personal friends gathered about him with their congratulations , and among the members , the venerable Mr. Adams was observed to approach and grasp him by the hand , saying with deep feeling , " Sir , I can forbear no longer ; I am come to congratulate you ; I think you have settled the question . " 61i2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time he desired to avoid a war if it could be done without too great a sacrifice of the rights and the dignity of the American Government . It seemed to him that peace between the two countries , and our own interests , could both be better served by action , than by the further postponement of a settlement of the question . A paragraph or two from his speech will present his views There are occasions when , to save what is dear to us , it becomes necessary to act promptly ;  --  to act with decision , and to act immediately , is often the only way to act with effect . I do not see that we have any course left but to act , whether we regard the perpetuity of peace or the possession of the territory in dispute . If we would avoid war , we must have the causes of war passed upon and settled . It is not always by adjourning over great , and difficult , and delicate questions , that war can be avoided . Our condition in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompt , decisive , comprehensive action . If we should leave this question open , in the present state of the two countries , who can avoid seeing that war is inevitable 3 " When Lord Ashburton returned to England , after having successfully arranged the difficulties about the northeastern boundary , and was congratulated in the British Parliament on his success , I believe that experienced statesman said that the national sky was then clear and without a cloud , saving one minute speck upon the horizon , which he did not doubt would soon disappear . But how has his prediction been fulfilled 3 That little speck , then no bigger than a man 's hand , and scarce perceptible on the far-off margin of the heavens , has since become a dark , and lowering , and portentous cloud it has swept over the face of the sky , and hangs all over our northwestern frontier , gloomy as night . The whole aspect of the question is changed ; and , if we wish now to maintain our position as the friends of peace , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights ; we must shun a temporizing policy ; we must adopt vigorous measures , and carry them to the very farthest verge to which they can be maintained without a violation of the terms of the convention . Otherwise , we shall find that the population of the two nations intermixing in that remote territory , carrying with them the prejudices and heat of the contending parties , protected by and amenable to conflicting jurisdictions , entering into the eager competition of trade-will , at no distant day , precipitate us into a war with Great Britain . " Nor , sir , is the danger of war all that is involved in the adjournment of this question ; we incur the danger of losing the territory altogether . And why do I think sol From the whole colonial history of the British empire . There was a time when Spain possessed great and extensive colonies , but they have dwindled away . There was a time when France could boast of her colonies , but they have dwindled away . There was a time when Holland swept the seas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they have dwindled away . In the mean time Great Britain has gone on , growing in strength , extending her power , and spreading her armies abroad , into every part of the habitable world . Her language , her laws , her military prowess , fill both hemispheres , while she has belted the globe with her fortresses , to say nothing of her colonies . The British people and their Government well understand the management of colonies . When in Europe , a short time since , a distinguished British diplomatist said to me , " Sir , France does not understand how to manage colonies ; we do understand it ; " and he spoke the truth . Since the year 1609 , Great Britain has acquired no less than fortyone colonies , twenty-four of which she has obtained by settlement , nine by capitulation , and eight by cession . In the possession of Oregon , she seeks to plant herself there permanently , and is employing all her power and all her skill to establish her authority over the greater part of that region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might lead to war . He should sincerely deplore such a result . He had no sympathy with the warlike spirit which had been manifested by others upon the floor . He said : " Peaceful triumphs alone are those which I seek  --  the benign victories of reason and truth . These I desire , and none other . If , however , while pursuing such a policy  --  a policy wise , vigorous , but conciliatory , war should come upon us , I trust the country will be prepared to meet it . If it should come upon us as the result of a.moderat* but firm assertion of our national rights , the response in every American bosom must be , " Let it come . " The venerable gentleman from Massachusetts near me , ( Mr. ADAMs , ) in tones which rang on my heart like a trumpet , reminded me of the days of our revolutionary glory . The old fire which blazed so brightly in that ever memorable struggle , seemed to be flashing up within him ; and , whilst I listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cause we should all act as one man . If we should go into the war in this spirit , I should feel little anxiety as to how we should // come out . The power of England is fast approaching the culminating l ) oint . It must soon reach that climax in the history of nations from which they have , one after another , commenced their decline ; and she ought not to enter into a contest with a great Power . If wise counsels prevail , she will not . Yet , if she should be so irrational , on the ground of such a controversy as that of Oregon , as to rush into such a contest , I trust that she will be driven hack from these shores shorn of her splendor ; and she may be very sure that when this happens , it will prove no temporary eclipse , but will endure for all time to come : and she will be left a portent in the political heavens , Shedding disastrous twilight over half the nations . ' " He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific coast , because he believed that it would contribute to the wealth , the power , and the glory of the country . At that time we had no other possessions on that distant region than those which we might be able to secure in Oregon , and he fully estimated the advantages which an establishment there would give us in prosecuting our trade with Southern China . We quote from the conclusion of his speech the following passage " In either of the views which I have presented , it is impossible that the importance of Oregon can he overlooked . I trust that these great results will be realized , and I hope at no distant day to see a mail line established across the continent . England has very recently been engaged in an experiment in ascertaining the shortest overland route across the continent of Europe to the East Indies ; and I believe the Oriental Steam Company has determined upon that through Germany , by Trieste ; but if we construct this railroad , she will then be dependent on us for the shortest and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her East India possessions . Is not the language of Berkley in the progress of fulfillment , when he wrote that immortal lineWestward the star of empire takes its way . ' When Oregon shall he in our possession , when we shall have established a profitable trade with China through her ports , when our ships traverse the Pacific as they now cross the Atlantic , and all the countless consequences of such a state of things begin to flow in upon us , then will be fulfilled that vision which rapt and filled the mind of Nunez as he gazed over the placid waves of the Pacific . " I will now address myself for a moment to the moral aspect of this great question . Gentlemen have talked much and eloquently about the horrors of war . I should regret the necessity of a war ; I should deplore its dreadful scenes ; but if the possession of Oregon gives us a territory opening upon the nation prospects such as I describe , and if , for the simple exercise of our rights in regard to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unjust war , the ren ret which every one must feel will at least have much to counterbalance it . One of England 's own writers has said : The possible destiny of the United States of America as a nation of one hundred millions of freemen , stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific , living under the laws of Alfred , and speaking the language of Shakspeare and Milton , is an august conception . ' " It is an au0ust conception , finely embodied ; and I trust in God that it will , at no distant time , become a reality . I trust that the world will see , through all time , our people living , not only under the laws of Alfred , but that they will be heard to speak throughout our wide-spread borders the language of Shakspeare and Milton . Above all is it my prayer that , as long as our posterity shall continue to inhabit these mountains and plains , and hills and valleys , they may be found living under the sacred institutions of Christianity . Put these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mental eye ! Civilization and intelligence started in the East ; they have travelled and are still travelling westward ; hut when they shall have completed the circuit of the earth , and reached the extremest verge of the Pacific shores ; then , unlike the fabled god of the ancients , who dipped his glowing axle in the western wave , they will take up their permanent abode ; then shall we enjoy the sublime destiny of returning these blessings to their ancient seat ; then will it be ours to give the priceless benefits of our free institutions , and the pure and healthful light of the Gospel , back to the dark family which has so long lost both truth and freedom ; then may Christianity plant herself there , and while , with one hand she points to the Polynesian isles , rejoicing in the late recovered treasure of revealed truth , with the other present the Bible to the Chinese . It is our duty to aid in this great work . I trust we shall esteem it as much our honor as our duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missionaries , give them the hible in one hand and opium in the other , but bless them only with the pure word of truth . I hope the day is not distant-soon , soon may its dawn arise  --  to shed upon the farthest and the most benighted of nations the splendor of more than a tropical sun . " Mr. Billiard was a member of the Committee of Conference , which disposed of the question by reporting a resolution as Dec. // which he had proposed , and it was carried through both Houses by large majorities . At the same session , he was entrusted by the Committee of which he was a member , with the duty of inquiring into the expediency of openi% a communication with Europe by a line of Mail Steamers of our own , and he presented an elaborate report in favor of the enterprize , of which the House ordered five thousand extra copies to be priuted ; and a bill , framcd in accordance with its views , was passed . Utterly opposed as he was to the usurpation of authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Mexico , he steadfastly sustained the cause of the country , by voting on every occasion in favor of granting the supplies of men and money which the Administration asked for carrying on the war , from the first to the last , incurring with some others who thought as he did , the censure of those who felt it their duty to arrest hostilities by depriving our Government of the means of repelling them . In one of his speeches on the war , he said " But first , as to the war . This is the great theme of the message  --  the prominent colossal figure in the foreground of the picture , about which the other objects are grouped in humbler and smaller proportions . I suppose it must be so ; our foreign relations , with the single unhappy exception referred to , are all of the most amicable kind ; our internal tranquillity is perfect ; the vast resources of our country are in a course of prosperous development . There is but the one check to our prosperity ; but for this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been discharged , and we might now have been engaged in plans for increasing the happiness of our peo plc , and advancing in our high career of civilization . But , though it must be admitted that war is a calamity , yet I can not bring myself to agree with those who think it best to arrest all our movements against Mexico . I concur in opinion with a distinguished Senator from Delaware , ( Mr. J. M. CLAYTON , ) who , some days since , took occasion to say , that he was decidedly in favor of sustaining  --  the Government in the prosecution of the war . My honorable friend from Philadelphia , ( Mr. J. R. INGERsOLL , ) has avowed the same determination . I do not see that any other course is left us . The question is not now , whether we shall plunge into a war or not ; the question is , a war having been commenced , shall we sustain it , or shall we let it go down * Shall we infuse new vigor into the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shall we withdraw all support from the war , and arrest it before it has accomplished its objectsl If the question were now presented to me , between peace and war , I should undoubtedly be in favor of peace . But no such election is presented to us . The spectacle before us is a war in progress ; our own country on one side , a foreign country on the other ; our own country , at every step which our armies take , holding forth an offer of peace , an offer which the enemy as yet have shown no disposition to entertain . This is enough for me . I range myself on that side on which I see the standard of my country . The question before Cono*ress is " Shall we prosecute this war P ' On t ' *at question I can not hesitate for a moment . The Constitution has conferred on Congress the prerogative of declaring war . We have recognised the war , and by that vote we have made the Chief Magistrate responsible for the mode of conducting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the theory of our Government , he is charged with the conduct of the war . He is invested with all the authority which belongs to that important station . It is for us to say how far we will go in voting supplies ; and it must be a great crisis , one such as I have never yet seen , and which has never occurred in our history , which would warrant me in refusing to vote them . Other gentlemen must of course decid.p for themselves ; these are my convictions . I shall , therefore , while I should be happy to see this war brought to a speedy and honorable termination , continue to sustain the G*-. eminent in its prosecution , till such termsi * - peace as we ought to accept can be secured . I trust , too , that this will- be the sentiment of the whole country . So far , the progress of the war has been marked by a self-sacrificing and patriotic spirit , which illustrates our free institutions , and by victories as remarkable and brilliant as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the interruption of the long career of peace which our country has enjoyed , we have at least gratifying proof that it has left no enervating influence on the national character . " He added : " We ought not to strike with a view to dismember the possessions of a weaker people , but our operations ought to be characterized by unfaltering energy , and by such a putting forth of strength as shall teach those against whom they are directed that it is their interest to seek a speedy peace . I would accept the first sign of such a disposition on the part of Mexico ; and so far from degrading or // most generous terms . They should be marked by the magnanimity of a great nation treating with a weak * Upon the proposition which has been more than once brought forward in Congress , to exclude slavery from the territory acquired from Mexico , Mr. Hilliard has expressed himself with great force and clearness . He regards the proposition as neither patriotic nor in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution . This question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views it as a southern representative , but he uniformly treats it as a great American question , involving our highest interests and appealing to the patriotism of the whole country . He insists that the principle of the Wilmot Proviso is unjust and dangerous-originating in no real concern for the condition of the slave , but prompted by a desire to aggrandize one section of the Union at the expense of the other . He has at all times vigorously resisted what he conceives to be a threatened encroachment upon the rights of the South , but he has as steadfastly contended for the preservation of the Union . His opinions of this great question are expressed with so much clearness in his speech viewing the policy of Mr. Polk 's administration , in the House of Representatives on the 24th of July , 1848 , that we quote a passage from it . " In regard to the authority of Congress over the Territories of the United States I desire to give my views . The question , at all times an interesting one , has now assumed great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , that Congress possesses exclusive power to legislate for the Territories of the United States . Of this I do not entertain a doubt ; and , while I have heard various opinions expressed here in regard to this subject , I am at a loss to see how any one who examines it can reach any other conclusion . That the whole power over the Territories originally rests in Congress is perfectly clear , and it remains for those who assert that the right to legislate in respect to them belongs to the people who inhabit them to show at what time the power is transferred from Congress to the inhabitants . But , sir , this question has been so often examined here that I will not consume my limited time in considering it . " My second proposition is , that while Congress possesses the exclusive power of legis lation for the Territories , that power is by no means an unlimited one . It is just here that gentlemen often fall into error . Exclusive does not mean unlimited . The power to which I refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; hut it is restricted , as are all powers delegated to Congress . While Congress , then , undertakes to exercise the power of exclusive legislation for the Territories , it is bound to carry on its legislation in reference to the character of the States of this confederacy from which it derives the power . It must regard the rights of all the States , and can not , without an abuse of power , legislate for the benefit of one section at the expense of another ; it is an abuse of its power , as an agent for the States , I care not whether the legislation be for the benefit of the South at the expense of the North , or for the benefit of the North at the expense of the South . " This brings me to my third proposition , which is , that Congress is not , in its legislation for the Territories , to look to their welfare alone , but is bound to regard the good of the parties interested in the ownership of the Territories . This , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions advanced by a distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts , the successor of Mr. Adams , ( Mr. Mann , ) in his beautiful introductory speech in this hall  --  a speech which , I confess , I listened to with admiration , though I strongly dissented from some of its sentiments . The gentleman insists that Congress , in legislating for the Territories , must look to their good alone , and shape all measures so as to advance their prosperity without any regard to the rights of the people of the several States . This doctrine , though it has a certain charm about , is wholly erroneous . Let us apply this reasoning to the Territory of Oregon , which , stretching along the Pacific coast , fronts certain parts of Northeastern Asia . Would Congress have a right to say that this Territory should he occupied only by colonists from China because a prosperous trade might be attained with the East , and the prosperity of Oregon rapidly advanced if that course were taken l Unques tionably not . Or , suppose that Congress should happen to conclu*1e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow only a manufacturing population to remove there , would it be proper to legislate for this object * Unquestionably not . " The gentleman from Massachusetts considers territory which we acquire as the property of this Government , and insists that Congress possesses the right to control it absolutely . This is a very common error . It results from a certain system of political training . If our Government were a monarchy , and all powers , or the sovereign power , centered in the crown , the argument might hold good ; or it might be // were consolidated into one great empire . But , sir , ours is a federative republic ; it bears no resemblance to an empire whatever ; it is a structure unlike what the world ever saw , deriving its powers from sovereign States , who are members of this confederation ; and this Government , this General Government , can exercise none but the powers which are clearly granted to it by the States . Whatever territory is acquired , is acquired for the people of the several States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to it as their agent . " There are other fully reported speeches of Mr. Hilliard 's which we feel strongly disposed to examine and quote from , but our want of room will not allow it . He has participated in the debates which have arisen in Congress upon all the great questions affecting the country since he became a member , and his efforts have exhibited a thorough acquaintance with the subjects which they touch , while they are characterized by the spirit of the enlightened and christian age in which we live . In the speech from which we have just quoted , he says " California and New Mexico are ours , and costly acquisitions we must admit them to be ; Yucatan has barely escaped our grasp ; and what other neighboring provinces are next to be overrun , and conquered , and annexed , no man tell . Our true policy is peace . We are set apart by a dividing ocean from the Old World ; we have nothing to do with its complicated system ; we have no balance of power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other nations . We should desire friendly relations with every people , entangling alliances with none . When the rights or the honor of the country demand it we will go to war , as we have done twice with great Britain ; but war is too great a calamity and too much opposed to the principles of Christian civilization for any insufficient cause . With the blessing of God we shall advance rapidly enough in a career of peace . Our po. litical system is at once great and economical ; it should he kept so ; we need never go to war to extend our territory or to increase our wealth and power . Patrick Henry said , in the true American spirit , " Those nations which have gone forth in search of grandeur , power , and splendor , have also fallen a sacrifice and been victims to their own folly . " I was struck last summer with an article which met my eye in one of the best reviews of our day , a French review , " La Revue des Deux Mondes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North America offers us to-day is nothing less than the whole of the new continent learning to recognize its masters in the Anglo-Americans , in education ; and the simple and beautiful constitution of 1789 , after half a century only of existence , extending an influence under which all must come , sooner or later . ' " This great triumph , if we are true to our principles , will be accomplished without arms . " His speech in support of the appropriation for sending a minister to Rome is so deeply imbued with the spirit to which we have referred , that we can not forbear from giving a short passage from it . He said " I regret that the opportunity was not afforded me of replying to the speech of my honorable friend from Pennsylvania , ( Mr. Levin , ) before the committee proceeded to vote on the appropriation , which provides the means of opening diplomatic intercourse with the Papal States . The speech was remarkable for the beauty of its language and the elevated tone of many of its sentiments , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of toleration ; it disclosed none of the spirit of the beautiful sentiment of St. Augustine , Let there be charity in all things . ' " I can not , of course , within the few minutes allowed me , attempt to reply to the speech of the honorable gentleman , but I shall seek an early occasion to do so , when I hope to be able to show that there is much in the present condition of Italy to awaken the hopes of all men who watch with interest the progress of reform throughout the world . In the meanwhile , let us not , in our impatience , forget that there is a mighty difference between reform and revolution . A reformation is brought about by the steady and gradual march of truth ; while a revolution , like the earthquake , too often upheaves to overthrow and crush .

It can never be put down . While a representative of the freest Government on earth may be employed in observing the progress of liberal principles in that interesting and important part of Europe , and may serve to diffuse a better knowledge of our political system , I can not discern that we can suffer any injury from such intercourse . " In my judgment , neither Christianity nor free principles have anything to fear from a // a minister to the Papal States , as I would to any other Power . I would encourage every reform in the Government . I would cheer the friends of freedom , in all Europe , by sending a minister from the United States of America , where the noblest toleration is granted to all opinions , to reside at a Court where hitherto the policy has been to crush all freedom of thought and action . It would be a spectacle of high moral interest , to such a representative from Republican America , taking his post amidst the ruined temples and arches of a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its colossal proportions . * * * * * My honorable friend and myself do not differ in our horror of an intolerant and dangerous system ; but we do differ in our views of the true policy to be pursued towards the Papal power . We both desire to sustain the Bible , and to vindicate Protestant Christianity . I need not say that I am no partizan of the Pope ; on the contrary there breathes not a man whose sympathy with the Protestant cause beats stronger or quicker than my own . I can never forget its battles nor its victories , its persecutions nor its triumphs . But , sir , I solemnly believe that toleration is the wisest as well as noblest policy . * * * * * Our true policy is to exiend our peaceful relations with the world . We bave notbing to fear from an intercourse of that kind with other Powers .

It carries on its agencies in secret . Bring it upon the open field ; do not shun it ; bring it into open intercourse with a free Protestant nation , and civil and religious Jiberty will achieve new triumphs . ' While , however , Mr. Hihiard has shown a disposition to recognize and encourage the first efforts made by every people to establish free institutions , his remarks upon the resolutions offered in the House upon the reception of the news of the overthrow of the government of Louis Philippe , show , at the same time , that he does not mistake every popular outbreak for a national struggle for liberty . He moved to refer the resolutions to the Coinmnittee on Foreign Affairs , saying , " He simply desired to secure a proper expression of the sympathy which we felt in that movement . The occasion , ** said he , " is one of no common moment-it must deeply affect the cause of mankind throughout the world . I am not ready to extend the sympathy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunge into the wild , unrestrained and reckless experiment of ideal liberty . Every kingless government is not of necessity a republican government . Liberty can not exist without law ; its elements must be consolidated , and its great principles be embodied in a Constitution . The great movement in France must develope institutions before it accomplishes any permanent good for the French people . I confess 1 am not free from apprehension with regard to the future . The convulsion which exhibits a form so attractive to-day , may yet upturn the foundations of society , and result in the wildest anarchy . On the other hand , there is in the great popular movement , which has so suddenly and so successfully expelled royalty from France , much of promise for that beautiful country and for mankind . I solemnly believe that the time has come when king-craft has lost its hold upon the human mind : the world is waking from its deep slumber , and mauhind begin to see that the right to govern belongs not to crowned kings , but to the great masses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to sustain our Minister , Mr. Rush , who so promptly , without the opportunity of consulting his Government , hailed the popular movement which expelled a powerful dynasty and proclaimed a Republic . It was a generous impulse which prompted the act , and the country will applaud it . Tihere are , certainly , some features in the scene that France presents , not wholly agreeable to a thoughtful observer , and which awakens the apprehension that the Provisional Government just established , has promised more than it can redeem . The fraternite which has been adopted may not be consistent with regulated liberty ; it may be the dream of idealists and not the conception of a philosophical statesman . The measure , too , which has been adopted in regard to the labor and wages of operatives , doubling their compensation and undertaking to employ them on the part of the Government , is a very unsafe one . Every one accustomed to the order of a well regulated liberty must see the danger of such legislation . It partakes too much of a system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , these // may be but temporary arrangements , designed to give the new government time to adjust the complicated details of the great task which has been undertaken . These are circumstances that may awaken apprehension , but they can not repress sympathy . No , sir , they can not prevent the expression of our deep and full sympathy with a people struggling to make a free government like our own . I , for one , can not look on such a spectacle unmoved . It may be premature-it may even be rash , but I should feel myself unworthy of a seat in an American Congress if I could refuse to cheer a people engaged in such a work . May they go on and prosper , and may they erect upon the soil of France a government resting upon the great principles of constitutional law , ensuring order at home , commanding respect abroad , and throwing over Europe the clear and steady light . of rational liberty . " Mr. Hilliard possesses an acquaintance with Foreign Affairs that has made him a distinguished and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for consideration in the House . His report on the subject of our Foreign Missions , made at the first session of the last Congress , is an elaborate review of the whole diplomatic system , full of information , and suggesting certain modifications in our intercourse with other nations , which seemed to him to be required by the dignity of the country and its growing power and resources . This course of study and his residence in Europe , both qualify him for usefulness in that department of public affairs . His recent election is the most brilliant triumph of his life . One of the first to discover in Gen. Taylor those great qualities that fit him for places of high trust in the service of his country , he was conspicuous in giving impulse to the movement which resulted in his triumphant election . In the Philadelphia Convention he did his utmost to secure his nomination , and on the adjournment of Congress he threw his energies into the contest in Alabama , and contributed his efforts towards bringing that state so nearly to the support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hilliard , having unbounded confidence in his character and principles , was willing to confide to his administration VOL. iV .

Hence he refused to participate in any mode of action that seemed to imply distrust ; and he declined to put his name to the address prepared by Mr. Calhoun , and issued by a portion of the southern members to their constituents . Faithful as a southern **26;1386;TOOLONG opposed , as he had shown himself to be , to any encroachment on the rights of the section from which he comes , he did not , it seems , think it his duty to co-operate in that movement . He had , besides , expressed it as his firm purpose to exert whatever power he possessed for effecting a settlement of the important question which so deeply interested the country and threatened its tranquillity , so as to secure the rights of the South without impairing the strength of the Union . This course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alabama , and a canvass ensued which is described as far the most excited ever witnessed iu that state or , perhaps , in the Union . The most formidable opposition was organized against him-an opposition to which talent , energy , and money were freely contributed as elements , and unparalleled efforts were made to ensure his defeat . The press and the stump teemed with the most violent denunciations against him his speeches and votes were misquoted and misinterpreted to make him odious to the people . His refusal to sign the address sent out by some of the Southern members , was represented to be conclusive proof that he was faltering in the vindication of Southern rights ; while certain appeals which he had made in Congress in behalf of the Union-appeals which were intended to rouse the patriotism of the representatives from every part of the country-were tortured into open renunciations of the section which had given him birth , and which had advanced him to honors . The contest , relentless , implacable and heated , drew the attention of the whole state , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eloquent and influential gentlenien of both parties entered the lists , and extraordinary exertions were made on either side . Mr. Hilhiard is described as having borne himself throughout the protracded and trying 40 // contest with the most determined manliness , never for a moment yielding a principle or asking a concession-staking every thing upon the open field . He met the opposition in the most fearless spirit ; defied the combination against him ; entered the arena in person ; appealed to the people throughout his extensive district , and addressed them in mass-meetings ; brought the question before them in all its relations , involving in its ultimate settlement the honor of the South , the safety of the Union , and the glory of the nation ; and insisted that , under Gen. Taylor 's administration , we should be able to maintain " the RIGHT5 of the States , and the UNION of the States .

He is just reaching the prime of manhood , and we may hope that a long career of usefulness and distinction opens before him . Mr. Hilliard as an orator , enjoys a wide and enviable reputation . His speeches are characterized by comprehensiveness and liberality . Generous in sentiment , candid in opinion , inclined to the most favorable construction of action and conduct , he ever deals justly and liberally with an opponent . But when provoked by any low or unfair attack , his sarcasm is irresistible . Keen as the blade of Saladin , it cuts to the quick or leaves excoriations that smart through life . In his wielding it is a fearful weapon , never used unless deserved , but when used scathing to an unmeasured degree . Many of his speeches , during his late canvass , in grandeur of style , indignant declamation , wit , and burning sarcasm , would have earned him distinction among the first orators of any day or country . His style of oratory , when engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear a strong resemblance to that of Fisher Ames , vividly recalling that eloquent statesman to the memory of those who are acquainted with his peculiar manner . He requires an occasion to arouse him to his best efforts ; but his powers are most advantageously displayed when encountering a formidable opposition . He is characterized by energy , firmness , and unswerving adherence to the principles which he professes . Of Mr. Hihiard 's literary attainments we have not space to say anything . He has been a Regent of the Smithsonian Institution from its organization , and still continues to manifest the deepest interest in the success of that great establishment.
