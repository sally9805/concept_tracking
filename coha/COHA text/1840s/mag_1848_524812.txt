txt THE proceedings of the Convention at Chicago in July last , and the hope founded upon them of an early and favorable action of Congress on the subject of river and harbor improvements , give a new interest to what has heretofore been said and written , touching the extent of the power of Congress in making the desired appropriations . In this connection , several of the doctrines advanced by Mr. Calhoun , in his Report to the Senate on the Memorial of the Memphis Convention , hold a conspicuous place ; and , from the character of their author , as well as the novelty and importance of the principles presented , are worthy of a special examination . Such an examination we propose to give , prefacing what we may offer with a brief abstract of so much of the Report as comes within my purpose . Convinced of the importance of th' navigation of the Mississippi and its great tributaries , and of the indispensable necessity of removing the obstructions to them , Mr. Calhoun raises the inquiry , by whom these obstructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " has the power , and whose duty is it , to improve the navigation of the Mississippi and its great tributaries ? " He answers : " It is certainly not that of individuals . Its improvement is beyond their means and power . Nor is it that of the several States bordering on its navigable vaters : it is also beyond their means and power , acting separately . Nor can it be done by their joint action . There are sixteen States , and two Territories that soon will be States , lying either wholly or partly within the valley of the Mississippi , and there is still ample space for several more . These all have a common interest in its commerce . Their united I. NO . I. NEW SERIES . 2 which that could be obtained is expressly prohibited by the 10th section of the 1st article of the Constitution , which provides that No State shall enter into any treaty , alliance , or confederation . ' But if neither individuals nor States , acting separately or jointly , have the power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government , if the power exists at all , as there is no other agency or authority , in our system of government , by which it could be exercised . But if it does , it must be comprised among the expressly granted or enumerated powers , or among those necessary and proper to carry them into effect ; as under the one or the other all the powers belonging to it are to be found ; and thus the question is presented for consideration-is it to be found in either 2 " Whether the needful power be found in either the express or implied powers , the Report proceeds to consider ; and after denying that it is to be found in the clause giving to Congress the power " to levy and collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises , to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United . States , " or that it is to be found in the category of necessarily implied powers it expresses the opinion , " after full and mature consideration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power " to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among . the several States , " and more specifically , in that to regulate it among the States . After expressing this opinion of the existertce and origin of the power , the Report goes on to explain what the Committee " believe to be the nature and extent of the power ; " and , on this point , the Committee are of opinion that the words " among the States " restrict the power to the regulation of the commerce of the States with each other , as separate or dis 1848. 15 // tinct communities , to the exclusion of its regulation within their respective limits , except as far as may be indispensable to its due exercise . Their effect , in other words , is , to restrict the power delegated to Congress to regulate commerce among the States , to their external commerce with each other as States ; and to leave their internal commerce , with the exception above stated , under the exclusive control of the several States respectively . In reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair interpretation of the terms " regulate commerce , " within the restriction above indicated , as imposed by the terms " among the States , " the Committee are of opinion , " that they confer upon it all the powers which belonged to them ( the terms ) as fully as the States themselves possessed it , except such , if there be any , as may be prohibited by the Constitution from being exercised , either expressly or impliedly . " On this assumption , and on further inquiry , " what powers the States were accustomed to exercise in regulating their commerce , before and at the time of the adoption of the Constitution , as far as they relate to its safety and facility , " the Committee find that " the powers they exercised for that purpose were restricted to the establishment of light-houses , buoys , beacons , and public piers ; " and that these powel 's were exercised by the several States , up to the period referred to , along the Atlantic coast . The Committee hence conclude , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the terms " regulate commerce ; " and that " Congress , from the beginning of the government until the present time , " have exercised them accordingly . Having fixed the subjects upon which Congress might legitimately exercise the power " to regulate commerce , " along the Atlantic coast , the Committee proceed to inquire whether the Mississippi might be brought within the power , so that " snags and other obstructions which endanger and impede its navigation , " might be constitutionally removed ; and after elaborate argument , they express themselves of the opinion that that river is within the principle of the power , and that it " extends to the removal of all obstructions within its channel , the removal of which would add to the safety and facility of its navigation . " They are also of opinion that it " extends to the removal of like obstructions in its navigable tributaries , including such as have three or more States bordering on their navigable waters , but not to those whose navigable waters are embraced within one , or , farthest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to the objects of the power " to regulate commerce , " the Committee proceed " to consider whether harbors , or canals around falls or other obstructions of the Mississippi , including its great tributaries ( thereby meaning those bordered by three or more States , ) are embraced in the power ; " and they come to the conclusion , " that harbors , except for shelter , are not " within the power ; and that the cutting of canals or the construction of roads around falls , &amp;c. , are also excluded from it . From the abstract of the Report thus given , it appears , that the Committee concede the power to Congress , of river and harbor improvements in its general principle , hut encumber it with such modifications in the application of it , as to deprive it largely of its value . It may well be regretted , that a mind so ingenious , and , in general , so sound , in vindicating a pnnclple of such transcendent moment as the author of the Report admits the one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to present it in its applications , as to make it as broad in its operation to do good , as it is obviously capable , in itself , of doing it . We propose to discuss and to controvert the three following propositions presented in the abstract 1 . That the constitutional power of Congress " to regulate commerce among the States , " by the removal of obstructions from navigable waters , does not extend to those waters which run within only one State . 2 . That it does not extend to those confined to two States , whether dividing or flowing through thesa. 3 . That it does not extend to the construction of harbors for commerce , but only those for sheller . A fourth proposition , viz. , that the power does not extend to the cutting of canals , or the construction of roads around falls , shoals , or other obstructions or impedi 16 Jan. , // ments to navigation , &amp;c. , has , in its principle , for years , been so much , and in such various forms , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , and shall therefore omit it . As to the first proposition , that the power does not extend to rivers running in only one State : It will be remembered that the Committee has said , in reply to their own question , " Who has the power , and whose duty is it , to improve the navigation of the Mississippi and its great tributaries ? " that " it is certainly not that of individuals , because beyond the reach of their means and power ; " nor yet that of the several States bordering on its navigable waters , acting separately , for the same reason ; " nor can it be done by their joint action , " because they are prohibited by the Constitution from forming any alliance , &amp;c . The Committee then go on to say , that , as the power and duty belong to neither of these , if they belong anywhere , it must be to the Federal Government ; and , after much discussion , they find them there , with certain modifications , under the power " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perceive why this reasoning of the Committee is not , or may not be , just as applicable to the cases of rivers running in one State or Iwo States , as to those of rivers bordered by three States . Rivers under the former class of cases , it is *onceded , are just as much open to the commerce of all the States , as those of the latter are , and all the States may be equally interested in the improvement of their navigation ; and it is evident that the point of inability to improve the navigation for the want of means , is or may be quite as true ( if not more so ) of the one class of cases as of the other . It is equally evident , that the failure to improve for want of such- means on the part of a single State , in a given case , might not be more inconvenient to such State itself , than to the States generally , whose commerce with such single State , through a river running only within its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be of the greatest moment to the general good . Hence , it should seem that , to make such a case an exception to the general power of Congress to make appropriations for river improvements , the argument establishing it should be so certain as not to admit of reasonable doubt . If there be such doubt , the clearest public good would seem to require , that the benefit of it should be given in favor of the power and against the exception . Do the Committee make out such a case beyond such doubt ? Do they , indeed , give colorable support to their proposition ? Let us examine . Two reasons are offered in support of the proposition *Yirs1 . That the power " is restricted to the external commerce of the States , with each other , to the exclusion of their internal ; " and , Second . That the commerce of such rivers is under the exclusive control of the States within whose limits their navigable waters are confined , with two exceptions , viz. : first , " that no vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled to enter , clear or pay duties ; " and , second , " that vessels from other States shall not be subject to any regulation or law in navigating them , to which the vessels of the State to which they belong are not . " As to the first of these two reasons , I shall consider it as equivalent to another proposition in a previous part of the Report , viz. : that the words " among the States , " restrict the power " to regulate commerce " to " its regulation with each other , as separate and distinct communities , to the exehision of its regulation within their respective limits , except as far as may be indispensable to its due exercise ; " and that , " withjthis exception , the internal commerce of the States is under the exclusive control of the several States , respectively . " Now , upon this proposition I have two remarks to make First . That it would be difficult to find a subject for the exercise of the power " to regulate commerce among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exist within the limits of a single State . It must have a locality somewhere-at least , in its inception  --  and this can not be in more States than one . If this be so , the negation , in the proposition , of the power , as to its exercise within the limits of a single State , would seem to be meaningless ; and the exceptioa may be regarded as , in fact , an affirmation of the power ,  --  without the limit which the idea of its being an ext*eption would imply . My second , and , perhaps , more impor 17 // tant remark upon this proposition , would be , that as it stands in the Report , it involves a confusion of ideas ; which appears thus : The power given to Congress is , " to regulate commerce among the States . " Of course , these terms exclude the power to regulate the commerce of a single State within its own limits ; and yet we are told that this latter power exists , " as far as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " This must be the meaning of the Report ; for , in the point in hand , no distinction is made between internal and external commerce , as respects operations within a single State . Now , we deny that the power exists in Congress , at all , or for any purpose , to regulate the commerce of a single State , within its own limits , as such ; and the confusion of ideas involved in the proposition of the Report , consists in this : that it makes an act of Congress , executed , within the limits of a single State , with a view to the external eommerc&amp; of such State with other States , to be an act so far regulating the internal commerce of such State itself . Now , such an act can , in no conceivable bearing , be so construed or regarded ; for , the commercial operation to which it applies must take its character as an operation of internal or external commerce , from its purpose ; and this , by the supposition , looks exclusively to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our proposition , on this subject , would be this : that whatever legislation , to be carried out , for the regulation of commerce within the limits of a single State , is connected with , or bears upon , the promotion of commerce outside those limits , must be considered as embraced within the power " to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States . " Hence , any appropriation made by Congress for the improvement of a river running in only one State , the object of which would be , to promote the commerce of that State with other States , or with foreign nations , would manifestly be within the Constitution . This the Report denies , in its general proposition , that the power of Congress to improve rivers , does not extend to rivers running in only one State . But this denial , in our judgment , can not be sustained . For one thing is quite clear , that every instance of commercial operation , foreign or domestic , must have its origin , as has already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it is intended by the operator to go beyond the State , it is equally clear that he is entitled to the benefit of national legislation , " to regulate " his case , as making a part of the commerce with foreign nations or among the several States , for which the Constitution has provided . There will , of course , be instances innumerable , of commercial operations intended to terminate within the State in which they have originated . These are admitted , nay , claimed , to be exclusively subjects of State legislation . But a rule is necessary to discriminate between the two classes of cases , that we may know when to apply the power and when not ; and , for this purpose , we can perceive or imagine no other rule , than that afforded by the intentions of the parties as carried out and proved , either by a transmission of operations beyond the limits of the State , on the one hand , or a re* tention and consummation of them within these limits , on the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations or among the several States ; in the other , it is not . In the one case , the congressional power applies ; in the other , not . And when a river , improved by act of Congress , though running within only a single State , ( as the James in Virginia , or the Penobscot , or Kennebec , in Maine , ) is used for the transportation of articles of commerce beyond the limits of the State , then the appropriation for such improvement is brought within the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States . If these views be sound , then , although the proposition , that the power to regulate commerce " is restricted to the external commerce of the States with each other , to the exclusion of their internal , " be in itself true , yet it is not true as a reason why that power does not apply as well to an improvement of a river running in only one State , as to that of a river running through half a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in a given case , must depend upon whether the river requiring it shall , or shall not , be navigable for the general commerce of the States . And this would be as true of a river running through a dozen States , 18 Jan. , // as we hold it to be of a river running through only one . Its national navigability , so to speak , and not its locality , in either case , whether bordered on by one State or a dozen , must determine its claim to national means for its improvement under the power to regulate commerce . We come now to the second reason for the first proposition . It is stated in the form of a rule , with two exceptions to it . The rule , as stated , is , that the commerce of such rivers ( as run within one State only ) is under the exclusive control of the States within whose limits their navigable waters are confined . The exceptions are , first , " that no vessel from another State , coming or going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties ; " and second , that " vessels from other States shall not be subject to any regulation or law in navigating them , to which the vessels of the State to which they belong are not . " Now , this second reason ( thus stated in the form of a rule ) is , without the exceptions , merely a corollary from the first ; for , if the power of Congress be denied over rivers running only in one State , the exclusive power of the State over such rivers must , of consequence , be admitted ; and hence , all the argument just presented against the first reason , must be of equal force against the second , unless the second , as a rule , be placed upon diffrent ground from the first by the exceptions connected with it . These exceptions could give that different ground , only by their effect to e8*ablish the rule , of which they assume the proof , and which they profess to qualify . Have the exceptions that effect ? We think not , for two reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not belong to the same category ; and second ) because , if they did , the exceptions are co-extensive with the rule , and by neutralizing , destroy it . First . The rule and the exceptions do not belong to the same category . The exceptions are stated , as though they were limitations to the power of a State in the control of its rivers , &amp;c. ; whereas , as to the first of them , it is clearly*'only a limitation of the general power of Congress " to regulate commerce . " This appears from two considerations : first , that it is found under the limitations of the powers of Congress in the arrangement of the Constitution ; second , it is essentially embraced within the proper business of regulating commerce , which , being exclusively in Congress , is prohibited to the States . As to the second exception , it is clearly entitled to no force , because the power denied by it to a State , would be as fully prohibited in the exclusive power in Congress to regulate commerce , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the citizens of each State in every other State , on which the Report professes to found it . For , any discrimination in the rights of navigation in a particular State , between the citizens of such State and the citizens of other States , would be obviously an exercise of the power to regulate commerce ; and hence , the exception , from whatever provision of the Constitution it may be drawn , may properly , if not only , be regarded , as a limitation upon the power of Congress to regulate commerce . The effect , then , of the exceptions is , not to prevent a State from doing a thing which , without them , it might have done , ( for the subject matter of *ie exceptions being exclusively in Congrcss , a State could not , as has been seen , have done such a thing at any rate ; ) but simply and only to impose particular limitations upon the legislation of Congress , which , without these limitations , the general power to regulate commerce w&amp;uld have authorized . The States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have stood without them . Hence , the second reason in support of the general proposition being entirely unaffected by the exceptions connected with it , leaves it liable , as we have said , to all the objections urged against the first ,  --  being a mere corollary from it . But , Second . Admitting the reason and the prohibitions to belong to the same category ; admitting that they sustain to each other the relation of such exceptions ; that the prohibitions refer to the power of the States over their internal commerce , and not to the power of Congress " to regulate commerce among the States ; " still , the fact that everything is comprehended within the exceptions which could be necessary to a free and unlimited commerce among the States , makes the exceptions as broad as the rule , and , of course , nullifies it . What more , indeed , is necessary to a per- qwq treaty , alliance , or confederation . " The two clauses considered together , then , are thus : F&amp;st , " No State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 8econd , " No State shall , without the consent of Congress , enter into any agrQement or compact with another State . " Now , the connection of these two clauses together , has , as is declared in the Report , a twofold object : first , the intention of the framers of the Constitution for the insertion of the clause in question , ( that is , the first of the clauses above quoted ; ) and second , to show the bearing of that clause on the point under consideration . As to the first of these objects , it xviii be observed , that the reason , and the sole reason , given by the Report for the insertion of the last clause as above quoted , was to prevent the elusion of the first . This reason , of course , logically implies that the first clause comprehended all that was expressed in the second , but which , not being expressed in the first , might be eluded . Buf this reason could not be the true one ; for if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No State shall enter into any agreement or compact with another , " without adding , " without the consent of Congress . " This addition carries the clause beyond the reason asserted for the introduction of it , and of course indicates some other reason for it than that affirmed by the Report . What that other reason is , will appear directly . As to the second object of the connection of the two clauses , viz. , to show the bearing of the last clause upon the point under consideration , it will be borne in mind that the " point under consideration " is , that the constitutional power of Congress does not extend to such rivers as are confined to two States ; and the inquiry is as to the " bearing " upon that " point " of the clause , " No State shall , without the consent *f Congress , enter into any agreement or compact with another State . " Now , it is evidently the meaning of the Report , in the connection of the two clauses , that this " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point " than as it refers to the distinction between the power of Congress over rivers bordered by three States , and the want of that power over rivers confined to two . For , as the Report assumes the existence of the power in the first class of cases , the di*tinction must presuppose that the clause was inserted with a sole reference to twO States , and of course can be applicable to no possible case that shall be predicated of them . This distinction is evidently deduced by the Report from such a reading of the two clauses as makes their terms reciprocally equivalent , and their objects identical . Now we deny the correctness of this reading , and maintain that the terms , " tre4y , alliance and confederation , " in the one clause , have an entirely different meaning , and refer to entirely different subjects matter , from the terms " agreement and compact " in the other . We maintain that a larger meaning and application were intended by the former terms than by the latter ; that the terms " compact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the States , such as regulations of mutual police , boundary , jurisdiction , &amp;c. ; and that the terms " treaty , alliance and confederation , " referred to the higher negotiations of international diplomacy ; the first being permitted with the consent of Congress , nd the last abso* lutely prohibited with or witl*out such consent . That the reading of the two clauses here suggested is the true one , appears to us to be sustained by several obvious considerations . In the first place , we would say , that the detached form in which the two clauses are presented , affords the strongest prima facie evidence that they referred to entirely different subjects ; and that if the one had been intended as a qualification of the other , it would have been so expressed . The distinction , too , between foreign relations and home relations , as predicable of the several States , was a sufficient reas on for the insertion of the two clauses : the first clause using terms suited to - the diplomatic dignity , and the last clause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they respectively referred , And then , again , the qualification , " with the consent of Congress* " in the one clause , and the absence of that or any other qualification in the other , can not leave a doubt that entirely different topics were in the minds of the Convention , in the contemplation of the two clauses , respectively . The matter is made still clearer by considering the wisdom of the distinction between the 1848. 21 // unqualified prohibition in the one clause , and the only qualified prohibition in the other : the first putting negotiations for treaties , alliances and confederations-importing the relations of peace , war , and the largest range of international politicsentirely beyond the power of the States , even with the consent of Congress ; the last , leaving smaller matters-embracing topics of public convenience , boundaries , local jurisdictions , and the like-subjects to compact or agreement with the consent of Congress . The first were the subjects of unqualified prohibition , because they were of a class of which it could never be proper that any State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified prohibition , because they were of a class upon which it might be highly convenient that the States should be at liberty to negotiate , provided the cases made were such as should be justly entitled to the assent of Congress . Now , this reading of the two clauses makes them entirely independent of each other ; and , while it presents in them two substantive and distinct matters , each of moment , for the Constitution to act upon , and furnishes the true reason for the insertion of the " agreement and compact " clause , it at the same time vindicates the Convention from the imputation of an afterthought and repetition in one clause , to relieve a slovenly omission or imperfection in another . But , if these views be just ; if there be nothing in the reason presented by the Report for the insertion of the clause in question ; and if it be true , that the two prohibitory clauses refer to entirely different objects , and have no more relation to each other than any other two independent clauses in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in this discussion sheds no light upon the matter which the Report intends to illustrate , . and fails to establish the proposition which it affirms . We have thus far discussed , together , the two paragraphs quoted from the Report , with reference to the effect of the connection of the two prohibitory clauses of the Constitution referred to in them , upon the proposition under consideration ; and here , perhaps , so far as the repetition of that proposition is concerned , we might safely Jan. , rest . But there are some matters in the second paragraph , * standing separately * There is also a matter in the first paragraph , which , though not , as we couceive , vital to thediscussion , we still regard as worthy of attention , either as conveying a doctrine singularly erroneous , or as betraying a looseness of thought or a slovenliness of expression , quite discreditable , in my judgment , to the author of the Report . A careful analysis of this first paragraph gives the following proposition , viz. , that the provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State , from entering , clearing or paying duties in another , would bring all such-streams as are confined to two States exclusively under the control of the Federal Government , as much so as the Mississippi itself , so far as the power to regulate commerce is concerned , were it not for another provision of the Constitution , providing that " no State shall , without the consent of Congress , enter into any agreement or compact with another State . " Now the author may not mean what this language clearly imports ; but , if he does , it appears to me to contain a most extraorditmary statement , leading to a result more extraordinary still ; for , unless we greatly misapprehend that language , such result must be in direct conflict with the previous liroposition of the Report , claiming the control of the Mississippi and all its navirable tributaries , bordered by three States , as coming within the power of Congress " to regulate commerce. , * This will appear from what follows . We understand the statement , then , to affirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prohibitory clause quoted in it , Congress would have the exclusive control over such streams as are bordered by only two States ; and , second , that this control would come , not from the power to regulate commerce , but from the clause exempting vessels going from one State to another , from payment of duties , &amp;c . And as the control thus ascribed to Congress , and so originating , would be possessed , as the proposition declares , to the same extent as over " the Mississippi itself , " we might suppose , without anything further , that it was intended to ascribe the power of controlling the-Mississippi itself to the exempting clause also . But it will be remembered that , in a preceding part of the Report , the control over the Mississippi is ascribed to the power to regulate commerce , without any allusion to the exempting clause . Supposing the Report to mean this , and supposing also the prohibitory clause above quoted out of the way , the proposition makes the control which Congress would , in such case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand upon different ground from that which it has over rivers extending to more States than two . And hence , as the proposition , in reference to the power in the first class of ' cases , assumes the exempting clause as its proper source , and in connection with it , specifically bases the distinction , givincr the control of Congress over rivers bordered by three States , on the one hand , and denying that control over rivers confined to two States , on the other , upon the sole ground of the clause that " no State shall , without the consent of Con gress , enter into an agreement or compact with another State , " it must follow , as the opinion of the Report , that , in the absence of both the exempting and prohibitory clauses from the Constitution , the power of Congress to regulate commerce would extend only to rivers bordered by three States , to the exclusion of those confined to two or only one . Now , as this distinction precedes all discussion of the effect of either the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand , especially of a strict constructionist , that he show us that clause of the Constitution by Calhoun 's Report on the Memphis Memorial . // from the first , which we deem vital to this discussion , and which we can not pass over without notice . Thus , in the first place , the Report says , " In order to prevent so important a provision from being eluded , ( that is , the provision that " no State should enter into any treaty , alliance or confederation , " ) the provision immediately under consideration was inserted , prohibiting the States from entering into agreements or compacts in any case whatever , except one State with another State , or with a foreign power ; and to prevent the abuse even of that limited power , the consent of Congress is required . " Now , here is a jumble and confusion of words and ideas , utterly amazing in a mind so remarkable for precision as Mr. Calhoun 's . The text of the Constitution is , " No State shall , without the consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another State or with a foreign power . " Mr. Calhoun 's interpretation or paraphrase of this text is , that the States are prohibited from entering into any agreements or compacts in any case whatever , " except one State with another State , or with a foreign power . " This exception in favor of " one State with another State , " &amp;c. , he calls a " limited power , " to prevent the abuse of which the consent of Congress * is required . The text declares a prohibition with a qu6l*ficalion , viz. , the consent of Congress . The interpretation declares a limited power with a restraint , viz. , the consent of Congress ; and what is very curious is , that this very element in the text , viz. , the consent of Congress , which imposes this restraint , is the very source from which the power restrained is derived . For , take away from the text the phrase , " without the consent which , expressly or by implication , that distinction can be sustained ; and , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not , then we are at liberty to place the two cases on precisely the same ground , as regards the power of Congress to regulate commerce ; and as the Report denies , in the case supposed , that that power would extend to the case of a river borbered by only two States , we , on our part , deny that it extends to the case of one bordered by three . The result is , that in the absence of the exempting and prohibitory clauses in question , the naked power to regulate commerce alone remaining , that power would not extend at all to the improvement of rivers running in one , two , or a dozen States . All the argument of the Report then , in favor of the general proposition of the power of Congress to facilitate commerce by removina impediments to navigation , drawn from the poweFto regulate commerce , must fall to the ground This conclusion , the author of the Report could 23 of Congress , " and you have the naked unqualified prohibition thus : " No State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Take from the text that phrase , and Mr. Calhoun would hardly be supposed capable of the absurdity of construing the remainder anything but an absolute prohibition , much less a limited power . And yet , strange as it may seem , he has , in effect , committed this absurdity , by separating , in his paraphrase , that part of the sentence which speaks of the prohibitionwith one exception , creating a limited power -- from that part which refers to the consent of Congress as a restraint , to prevent that limited power from being abused . He has , in effect , declared , that the words , " No State shall enter into any agreement or compact with another State , " convey a grant of power ( ! ) , " to prevent the abuse of which , the consent of Congress is required . " But the whole idea of a grant of limited power , or power in any sense , is quite absurd . It must be observed , that the terms of the clause are prohibitory and not permissive . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress-not a State may do a certain thing , with such consent . The purpose of the clause is to deny a power , not to grant one ; to prevent something from being done , not to promote it ; and the consent of Congress , if given , must be considered as given against a rule and not as fulfilling one . Hence the power which a State might exercise with the consent of Congress , is , to all practical intents , dead , until such consent be asked and given ; and therefore the clause , until such consent be asked , in a given case , must be regarded as though it were not in the not , of course , have thought of ; and yet , it is believed , it can not be escaped . For if the proposition of the Report be correct , that the power of Congress over rivers bordered by three States is derived from the power to regulate commerce , and if the power over rivers confined to two States , in the absence of the exempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same source , it follows that the latter power , if it exist anywhere , belongs as well to Congress as the former ; which latter proposition the Report , in effect , denies . Now , to escape the dilemma , the Report must either abandon what it claims in reference to three States , or yield what it denies in reference to two ; and if'the prohibitory clause , relied upon to prove the power wanting in the one case , shall be conclusive to that end , then the power in the other must share the same fate , and river and harbor improvements , under the auspices of the nation , be dispensed with altogether . 1848. // Constitution . Now the whole assumption of the Report assumes the reverse of this ; for , in making the qualified prohibition of two States to enter into an agreement , in relation to a river confined within them , to work the effect of taking from Congress all power over such river , is in effect to assume that such qualified prohibition was in fact no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at most was merely nominal ; as though the consent would certainly be asked if it were wanted , and granted if it were asked . The case would be different if the power , instead of being prohibited without the consent of Congress , had been given unless prohibited by Congress . In the last case , a State might act unless stopped ; in the first , it could not act unless permitted . The first case might of itself furnish no absolute refutation of the proposition of the Report ; the last , in our judgment , if there be any such thing as inconsistency of ideas , makes it irhpossible that the proposition should be true . To conclude , in a word , this point in the discussion , our proposition would be this : that the power to " enter into treaties , alliances and confederations , " and the power " to make agreements and compacts , " both existed in the States anterior to the Constitution ; but that instrument prohibited the former absolutely , and the latter , except when all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy of attention still remains in the . paragraph in hand . The Committee having found an exception to the prohibition , in favor of " one State with another State , " feel bound to give a reason for it . That reason is , that , without the exception , " the prohibition would substitute the federal authority for that of the States for the adjustment and regulation of all the various subjects in which the several States may have an interest in adjusting and regulating , including such as the one under consideration , and thereby would give greater extension and minuteness to the authority of the Federal Government , than was desirable or consistent with the objects for which it was instituted . " This language is cool and oracular-uttered , evidently , as though felt to be undeniable , and intended clearly to be impressed as by authority . Now , we affirm every syllable of it to be utterly gratuitous ; without a word in the Constitution to sustain it , or a thought in the necessity of the case to suggest it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which the Federal Government was instituted , " in reference to its " authority , " by a purely arbitrary rule , and one , ( in its application to two States as distinguished from three or more , as the objects of the exception , ) without even the semblance of a reason . If the argument from " greater extension and minuteness , " had any force , it must apply to subjects matter of authority , and not to the parties , whether two States or three , that might be interersted in them . For nothing can be clearer , than that the authority of the Federal Government , in the adjusting and regulating of various objects " in which the several States may have a mutual interest , " may be quite as important , in given instances , in its exercise upon two States as three ; and any discrimination between them , such as the Report proposes , might , and probably would , often work the rankest injustice , if not the greatest danger . But as the proposition is offered without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to fall by its own weight . A single other matter in the paragraph under consideration , is entitled to notice . " Under the exception , " the paragraph goes on to say , " it is left to the States , when only two are interested in the navigation of a river , or on any other subject , to take it under their own exclusive jurisdiction and control by an agreement or compact between them , with the consent of Congress . " With the consent of Congress ! But suppose this consent in a given case should be refused ? A work of vital moment to the two States-perhaps to the Uniongoes unaccomplished . The States can not do it , because Congress will not permit them to make a compact ; and Congress can not do it , because their power to permit the States to do it operates a prohibition to themselves . There can be no escape from this dilemiun , except by assuming that the consent of Congress would be always , in all cases , certain ; which would be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires it . This effect must , of course , make such an assumption inadmissible in practice , as it certainly is in theory . Now , can a result such as Jan. , // this , in the action of this government , be regarded in any other light than as destroying all claim to confidence in any proposition that shall lead to it ? We trust our system is not quite so weak , puerile and , we may add , unworthy , as the truth of such a proposition would presuppose it . In our judgment , the point is worthy of serious discussion , only in consideration of the source from which it comes . We here close what we designed to offer upon the two paragraphs of the Report , whether singly or together ; but before leaving the second general proposition which we undertook to discuss , and upon which the two paragraphs referred to have so material a bearing , we shall offer a few general reasons why , in our judgment , that proposition can not be sustained . First . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrine of the Report , that it is of indefinite application as to the subjects of it . It will be observed that the Report specifically applies the operation of the clause , " No State shall , without the consent of Congress , enter into any agreement or compact with another , " only to the power of Congress " to regulate commerce . " Now are there not other provisions of the Constitution to which that operation may be applied with just as much propriety as to this ? We maintain that there are ; and in this , we are borne out by the Report itself , when it declares that there are " various subjects in which the several States are mutually interested in adjusting and regulating , " which come within its doctrine . Now there are , at least , a dozen of these " various subjects " which might be mentioned , in entire consistency with the reasoning and admission of the Report , and coming within the doctrine ; but we shall name only one . How , then , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or from one State , shall not be obliged to enter , clear or pay duties in another ? " To our mind , the application of the principle in question to this clause , forming an exception to it , would be just as legitimate , as it is to th' clause giving to Congress the general power to regulate commerce : nay , even more so ; for there is a reason of high justice for its application in the former case , if it be applicable in the latter , in the fact , that as , by its latter application , the two States interested are deprived of the aid of the General Goyernment in necessary improvements of a river for navigation , they would clearly be entitled to levy duties upon vessels coming from other States , in order to supply the means of making such improvements themselves . This power of levying duties , in the case supposed , is manifestly sustained by the just principle of compensation ; for , as other States have the advantage of a navigation , made practicable and useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , in equity , bound to contribute in the only way they can , to reimburse those two States the expenditures to which they have been subjected for the general accommodation . Now is Mr. Calhoun prepared for a consequence like this , of the doctrine of his Report ? We apprehend not . Nevertheless , we see not how he can escape it , unless by assuming the Constitution to be a mere convenience , to suit particular occasions , such as caprice may select , or a miserable jumble of contradictions , denying the uniform and equal justice which it professes to secure . Second . In connection with the objection just offered , and without the advantage of the exception suggested in it , in favor of the power of two States , in the case supposed , to levy duties , &amp;c. , it may be urged as a conclusive and overwhelming argument against the proposition of , the Report , that its operation would work the most monstrous injustice upon the States to which its principle would attach . Two States , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This river is open to the commercial enterprise of all the other States ; thousands of the inhabitants of the latter States trace their fortunes . to the navigation of it ; the nation at large , by universal consent , derive annually millions of profit from it ; and yet the two States , at an enormous annual expense , and by a standing compact , ( Congress kindly consenting to it , ) must keep such river in order ! the common natinnal purse giving back nothing of the enormoun gains thus constitutionally realized by the whole confederacy , from the constitutional plunder of a part ! And more and worse than all this : when the two States implore of the nation relief from such a load of injustice , they are insultingly told that , to relieve them , would be to interfere with 1848. // their State rights ! They have exclusive control of the river ; and any interference of Congress to remove obstructions from it , for the general good , would be an outrage upon their proper State dignity and honor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nullification to vindicate them . The Report introduces us to a new category-State wrongs ; but says nothing of nullification to redress them ! A third objection is , that the proposition of the Report , ascribing the control of Congress over rivers bordered by three States to the power to regulate commerce , can not stand consistently with the proposition under consideration . It will be observed that the whole force of the argument of the Report , for the discrimination which it sets up between three States and two , in regard to the power of Congress over rivers , turns upon the assumption that two States may make a compact , but that three or more can not . It follows , hence , that if three or more States . could make a compact , their case in regard to the power in question would stand upon the same ground that the case of two does ; and , as the Report excludes the latter from the power , it must necessarily exclude the former also . Now if the " treaty , alliance and confederation " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that three or more States might make a compact , as well as two ; and that , hence , in such case , the power in question would be no more applicable to the case of rivers in three or more States , than to that of rivers confined to two . Now , the necessary effect of this view is , to make the power ascribed to Congress over rivers bordered by three or more States , to come , in point of fact , from the " treaty , alliance and confederation " clause . But the Report , in tcrms , ascribes the power to the clause giving to Congress the power " to regulate commerce among the States . " Now , it is quite clear that the power can not come from both of these clauses ; much less , sometimes from the one , and sometimes from the other , as may suit the convenience of some present purpose . It must come certainly , definitely , and under all relations , from only one of them , if it comes from either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce , " or it does not . If it does , then the reasoning of the Report , founded on the " treaty , alliance and confederation " clause , must fall to the ground . But the reasoning of the Report , upon the matter under consideration , consciously or unconsciously to its author , presupposes that clause , as is shown above ; and therefore , for all the purposes of this argument , the clause " to regulate commerce " must be considered as inapplicable . And hence , as without the " treaty , alliance and confederation " clause , three or more States might make a compact ; and as it is , according to the Report , because two States may make a compact under the " agreement and compact " clause , that Congress is denied the power over rivers confined to such two States ; it follows , that , in the absence of the " treaty , alliance and confederation " clause , ( three States being , in such case , enabled to make a compact , ) the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be denied also  --  the clause " to regulate commerce notwithstandihg . Now , this reasoning , to make the Report consistent , requires that it shall abandon either its proposition that the power of Congress over rivers running in three States or more , comes from the clause " to regulate commerce , " or the proposition under discussion-which claims that that power does not extend to cases of rivers running in only two States . Which of the two propositions the Report shall abandon , remains for itself to say . Our purpose alone is to prove , that its adherence to the first proposition is a conclusive objection to the tenableness of the last . A fourth objection to the proposition under consideration is , that it assumes a reading of the " agreement and compact " clause , which is not borne out by the good sense of the case , or by acknowledged rules of legal interpretation . This reading limits the application of the clause to two States only , where there is every reason for applying it to all of them . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consenfof Congress , enter into agreements or compacts with another , " we understand the meaning to be , that the States , generally , are prohibited from making agreements with each other , in any number , whether two or ten , without the consent of Congress . This view , we say , is clearly // sustained by the obvious reasons for the insertion of the clause , as already explained ; these reasons being just as applicable to any other number of States as to two . It is as clearly borne out by acknowledged rules of legal interpretation ; for should a law declare that " no man shall do this or that thing , " without a certain penalty , every lawyer must say , that it is not one man merely that is embraced in the provision , but every combination of men , no matter what the number who might , by violating such provision , come within its bearing . The clause in question , we maintain , stands on the same ground . We proceed now to the third proposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That the power " to regulate commerce * can not be exercised in the construction of harbors for commerce , but only those for shelter . Three arguments are urged by the Report in support of this proposition : First , that the States , in the exercise of the power of regulating commerce , never extended it to the improvement or construction of harbors for commerce-nelther subsequent to , nor before the Revolution , while colonies . This , if true , is an extraordinary fact ; but the inference drawn from it is more extraordinary still . No one will be so absurd as to say , that harbors are not indispensable to commerce . The question then is , who shall build them ? Undoubtedly the public , through its proper government . You can not expect individuals to do it , it being " beyond their means . " Each of the States , then , certainly after the commencement of the Revolution , and before the adoption of the Constitution , must have had the power to build them ; and if they did not exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess it , but because they had no occasion to use it . They probably had harbors enough already , and which had grown at different points on the Atlantic coast so gradually , as that their growth was not particularly observed , and made no mark in the history of the times . There certainly were harbors then as there are now ; and they were built by somebody ; and to say - that the particular State governments did not build them , is to say what all rational probabilities pronounce to be untrue . i3ut , at any rate , it is no necessary , or at least , conclusive argument against the existence of a power , that it is not exercised ; especially in a case like this , where the necessity of its exercise , in the infant growth of a continent of States , must be so infrequent compared with the whole extent of country , as to make no distinct impression when it occurred . The States , then , we hold , must have possessed the power to build commercial harbors at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being so possessed by them , it must , according to the admission of the Report , have passed over to the present national government , under the power " to regulate commerce . " The second argument of the Report against the power of Congress to build harbors for commerce , viz. , that they must necessarily be located within the limits of individual States , and therefore be controlled by them , has already been answered in what we have said in relation to the regulation of commerce within the limits of a single State . A harbor must have a locality within a single State , or nowhere . And to say that because it is so , therefote it is not a proper subject of congressional legislation , is simply to beg the question ; and there we leave it . The third argumeat , viz. , that the Constitution discriminates between the powers of a State to levy duties on imports and exports on the one hand , and on tonnage on the other , giving the net proceeds of the first to the national treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the State , appears to me to be founded in perfectly arbitrary conjecture , sustained neither by the history of the government , nor the reason of the thing . There are a hundred purposes to which a tonnage duty might be applied with equal propriety as to that of building harbors ; and it is worthy of a moment 's thought , that harbors must be built before the duty can be levied ; so that the question stands open for discussion before the fact can exist upon which the argument is predicated . Why it should , be assumed and asserted as a fact that the tonnage duty which might be levied by a State , was intended for the single purpose of building harbors , and for no other , we can not comprehend ; and before we will believe the fact , we demand the proof ; and until this comes , we shall regard the assertion of it as 1848. 27 // another begging of a question . But , Airther , it must be borne in mind , that " the consent of Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a State ; and as this consent may be refused , the argument in hand is liable to the objection already urged against the argument deduced , for another purpose , from the power of two States to make a compact , to which the same contingency is attached . The distinction between a harbor for commerce and a harbor for shelter , is , to our apprehension , utterly without meaning , The only possible difference between the two , that we can see , is , between a vessel 's lying at a wharf to take in lading for a voyage , and her lyin* at the same place to wait the passing of a storm . There is a wharf in either case , and it serves both purposes equally well ; and why we should not be permitted to call that a " facility " to commerce which gives the convenience of shipping the freight that is the substance of it , as well as that which protects from the winds the vessel in which such freight is shipped , may be a curious question for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , but , in our judg*ent , is utterly unworthy a moment 's attention of a practical statesman . We here conclude a discussion -- already too long protracted-which we regret has not fallen to abler hands . There are those who think the Report which we have examined , refutes itself , and therefore requires no elaborate criticism to expose its errors . This may or may not be just . Whether so or not , however , there is a power about Mr. Calhoun 's name and . position , which would make it worse than in bad taste , to regard any state paper slightingly that comes from his pen . He is , without doubt , one of the master minds of this country and age ; and thousands take their law implicitly from his opinions , however extravagant in themselves , or feeble in the argument that would sustain them . It is to such , that we would especially address what we have said , in the hope , that though we may not succeed in producing conviction , we shall not entirely fail to awaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
