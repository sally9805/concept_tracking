Boston Miscellany , September , 1842 . After the close of the civil wars , which ended in the acknowledgment of Augustus as Emperor of Rome , the territory of several of the Italian cities was confiscated , and distributed in lots among his disbanded soldiers . Among these cities was Cremona , and the territory not having held out as well as was expected , a portion of that of the neighboring city of Mantua was taken sans crmonie to make up the deficiency . Hence , the well known verse in another Eclogue , Mantua , v miser nimium vicina Cremon ! Among the occupants of the Mantuan territory thus invaded was the poet Virgil ; but on his personal application to Augustus for redress , his property was restored to him and secured in his possession . These incidents form the subject of the poet 's first and best eclogue , in which he introduces himself in the character of a shepherd under the name of Tityrus ; describes his journey to Rome for the purpose of laying his case before the emperor ; expresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his neighbor Meliboeus , who laments very bitterly the necessity of quitting his paternal property . The personage of Meliboeus is rather more prominent than the other , and suggested the title , which has been prefixed to the imitation . CHARACTERS . First Shepherd , called in the original , Meliboeus . Second Shepherd , Tityrus . Main text The former having quitted his cottage on his way into exile , accompanied by his flock , passes the house of his neighbor representing the Poet , whom he finds reclining under a beech-tree , and holds the following dialogue with him . First Shepherd . First Shepherd While you , my friend ! beneath your beech-tree laid , Whose spreading branches yield so cool a shade , Attune your oaten pipe to sylvan lays And make the woods resound with your Aminta 's praise ; We , hapless exiles , forc 'd afar to roam , Leave our lov 'd fields and all the joys of home . Second Shepherd . Second Shepherd Oh Meliboeus ! sure a god bestow 'd The blessing on me ; he shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrine Shall often bleed some tender lamb of mine , The generous Prince , who heard and did befriend An humble shepherd , gave him leave to tend His flocks at pasture on their wonted plains And freely sing his own dear rustic strains . First Shepherd . First Shepherd Oh , blest with all a shepherd need desire ! I may not envy , but I must admire Your happy fortune ,  --  thus to hold your ground When wild confusion shakes the country round . But I , less favor 'd , feel the general shock ; Forsake my home , and sadly drive my flock To exile with me . All unus 'd to pain , The puny wanderers scarce the toil sustain . This ewe , that fainting in my arms I hold , Just bore me twins ,  --  the promise of the fold , But all too weak to join the travelling flock , Poor things ! I left them on the naked rock . Alas ! good friend ! too well I now recall The various omens that foretold it all . For this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crow would sit for hours and croak On you old holm-tree :  --  signs , that might have taught . A child , had I , dull fool , but mark 'd them as I ought . No more of this , nor let my selfishness By such complaints your faithful heart distress With useless grief ,  --  but tell me , gentle friend ! The god , the generous Prince you thus commend , The noble patron to whose kind decrees You owe your fortune ,  --  tell me who he is . Second Shepherd . Second Shepherd When I to Rome  --  good shepherd ! hast thou heard What wonders lurk beneath that little word ? For me , I own , before I view 'd her towers , I fondly thought her some such place as ours , Our pretty Mantua , where so oft we drive Our flocks to market . Shepherd , as I live , It shames me now the idle dream to tell , That liken 'd things in no way parallel . Why , gentle shepherd ! Rome as far outvies All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all fear of rivalry Or envious peerage , as the cypress tree In yonder garden towers in spiry pride Above the lowly bushes by its side . First Shepherd . First Shepherd But what of Rome ? what powerful cause or care Could lead a rustic swain to wander there ? Explain , good shepherd ! Second Shepherd . Second Shepherd Freedom ! gentle friend ! To sue for Freedom was my glorious end . Sweet nymph ! she mock 'd my hopes with long delay ; She made me linger till my locks were grey ; But smil 'd at last . Good shepherd ! I had been Too long the victim of a thriftless quean , On whom , enthrall 'd by love 's inglorious chains , In costly gifts I wasted all my gains , Nor hop 'd for liberty , nor car 'd for gold . In vain I toil 'd ; in vain the victim sold For many a shrine ;  --  in vain my cheeses bore The highest prices ; empty was my store : My Galatea wanted all and more : At length , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revers 'd the charm , and taught me to be wise . First Shepherd . First Shepherd Aminta 's charms your heart may justly move , Since thus she gave you life as well as love . I well remember when the voyage you made To Rome , how oft the graceful mourner pray 'd At every altar , call 'd in loud despair The gods to aid her ; still with generous care Kept the ripe fruit that paid her husbandry In mellow pride untouch 'd upon the tree . For you , my friend , the fruit was kept ,  --  for you She wept and pray 'd :  --  we all ,  --  the country through Deplor 'd your loss ,  --  the very groves of pine Lamented it in tears of turpentine ; Grief 's gushing tides each fountain 's margin wet , And alders shone with dew-drops of regret . Second Shepherd . Second Shepherd In truth , good shepherd ! much it griev 'd my heart From such a mistress ,  --  such a friend to part , But nowhere else could I pursue my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous patron , in whose honor 'd name Twelve times each year my loaded altars flame . At Rome I found him ,  --  there my suit preferr 'd ; All trembling I , while he as kindly heard . And , courage ! shepherd !  --  never fear !  --  he said ;  --  Pursue your labors ! till your wonted glade In peace !  --  no stranger shall invade your plains Or dare to interrupt your much-lov 'd rustic strains . First Shepherd . First Shepherd Oh favor 'd ancient ! dwelling as before On your own fields !  --  nor need you wish for more . Small though they be , and of that narrow bound , Half , naked rock , and half , a swampy ground , O'ergrown with rushes ,  --  they to you become , Being , as they are , the dear domain of home , More rich and charming than Hesperian bowers . Amid their well-known haunts and wonted flowers No pasture strange shall harm your pregnant ewes , No stranger flock contagion shall diffuse Among them :  --  here beneath your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade . From yonder willow hedge the toiling bee With drowsy hum shall sing your lullaby ; The distant woodman trill his ditty clear To rock and hill ; and on the elm-tree here Your favorite bird , the pretty ringdove , woo His gentle mate , the constant turtle coo . Second Shepherd . Second Shepherd Delightful thoughts ! and ere your friend shall cease To bless the giver of a boon like this , Great Nature 's general laws no more shall stand ; Deer tread the deep , and fish frequent the land ; The Parthian bathe him in the turbid Rhine And blue-eyed Belgium bask beneath the Line . First Shepherd . First Shepherd Less favor 'd we to various regions haste , Crete ,  --  frozen Scythia ,  --  Afric 's thirsty waste ,  --  Or northward , where the circling Sleeve Footnote : 1Kb divides Britannia 's cliffs from all the world besides . Ah luckless shepherd ! shall I e'er again Some ten years hence behold my lov 'd domain ? My little palace , roof 'd with thatch , espy , In time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Oh God ! what horrors civil discord pours Upon the people ,  --  all my rural stores ,  --  The rich reward of all my toils and cares ,  --  My golden grain ,  --  my curious grafted pears , My luscious grapes ;  --  all sacrific 'd to feed The ruffian butchers , by whose rage we bleed . Away , my goats !  --  poor fools !  --  in other time How blest !  --  away !  --  no longer shall you climb With skilful step the mountain 's beetling brow While stretch 'd in some green bower , I view you from below ; No more I sing ;  --  I feed my kids no more : Song , labor , pastime , hope itself is o'er . Second Shepherd . Second Shepherd Hard lot ! but , gentle friend ! forget your care ! And deign to-night my humble roof to share ; Sweet apples , chestnuts , cheese in plenty spread Shall be your meal ;  --  fresh leaves your fragrant bed . Night hastens on :  --  o'er yonder roof aspires The smoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun descending throws A lengthening shade ;  --  ' t is time to seek repose .
