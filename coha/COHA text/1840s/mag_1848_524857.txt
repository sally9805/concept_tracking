txt THE name of Brockden Brown had acquired an attractive sound to our ear , before ever we read a line of his writings . The honorable distinction which was awardcd to him , as a novelist , by the British press , at a period when it was almost certain that every hook with an American imprint would only be mentioned to be carped at , and which , perhaps , more than any other single circumstance , prepared the way for the Transatlantic fame which irving and others of our countrymen have since so abundantly enjoyed , contributed not a little to impress our boyish imagination with reverence for this remarkable man . As a nation , we have been accused , by the great critics across the water , of an insensibility to the genius of this writer , and the sole glory of duly appreciating his merits has been strongly claimed in the same quarters . We suspect , however , that this charge , and the pretensions with which it is coupled , are somewhat groiwidlessthat the chief fault of our ancestors was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most brilliant of the men of letters in their day , they would persist that Barlow 's Columbiad and Dwight 's Conquest of Canaan were true poems , and might very properly be placed on the same shelf with , at least , the " Last Judgment , " and " Leonidas . " Brown was eagerly read in his time ; obtained a considerable income from his novels ; and received flattering attentions from the learned and the influential of our land . But that since his death he should have fallen into comparative neglect , was nearly unavoidable , from the very character of his writings . We do not mean to be understood that such works are useless or trivial . We will not go so far as to say , with some whose judgment we respect , that , from its own ni*ture , it is impossible for a novel to lire ; bu*t we do say that , in the main , every geheration will have its own favorites , and that one novelist will , in ordinary cases , succeed to another with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , fixed itself permanently in the hearts of many ages ; but this is a rare composition , far above the rank of " Wieland . " It is plain that the novel has a place provided for it among the literary wants of man . Little intervals of businessodd ends and fragments of time-such as would otherwise almost inevitably be given to idle musing , or still worse , to melancholy self-reflection , are , by the aid of these products of the fancy , made to give an agreeable relaxation and refreshment to the mind , with a secret impulse onward and upward in spiritual culture , to be found nowhere else . Neither is it altogether foolishly , we think , that some persons make these books the companions of a tedious voyage , or of a temporary stay at an inn , seeking from them a sort of oblivious exhilaration , that shall for a moment stifle all the vexations of the present circumstances , and remove every anxiety and disquietude of life : just as one sometimes takes an opiate before submitting to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to take due vengeance on a mutinous tooth . In short , we may easily discover a thousand different ways , in which this species of literature becomes an important provision for the human mind . Among all these circumstances , however , we find no occasion for admitting " Pelham " to the brain of a miss at school , nor the " So4ows of Werter " to the meditations of a youth desperately in love-with himself . We suppose that nobody under the sun is justified in reading , or blessed in being suffered to read , a romance of any kind , who is not fully competent to understand that a pretty story is not a history of the whole world , and that a finepiece of sentimental philosophy is not the sum of human wisdom and genius . This department of literature has a distinct character , and a plainly marke4 boundary , that divides it from all others . The author of a novel , no less than the 260 // dramatist , is required by the nature of his work to observe certain " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our knowledge , has ever gone so far as to lay down exact " rules , " to which every writing of this kind must be conformed ; neither has any Quintilian applied the irresistible power of analysis to the best models in this species of ideal creation . But there is a sort of critical common sense , nevertheless , respecting these matters , which we must esteem , for all practical purposes , at least , infallible . A novel is universally understood to be a story of passion ; of adventure ; of events intricately involved and marvellously extricated ; of insurmountable obstacles swept away by the force of heroism , by the violence of love , or by the frenzy of gloomier passions ; perhaps of supernatural occurrences and of divine or angelic interpositions ; and certainly of experiences passing through the whole range from the depths of grief and anguish to the full rapture of realized wishes and hopes . We generally expect a calm , sunny beginning , among the ardent yet tranquil thoughts of dreamy youth , in the abodes of childish years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of events issuing from this point , thickening and confusedly mingling as they proceed - lover and loved playing at cross purposes , thrown into seemingly inextricable confusion , every incident increasing their embarrassment , and proportionally increasing their affection , as the impossibility of its gratification becomes more and more apparent , until they come into a state of downright despair ; and lastly , an entire and triumphant unravelling of all the intertwisted threads , and the completion of a perfect web of golden felicity . All this , we say , is generally expected ; and that author may , in most cases , be safely said to possess either very insignificant , or else very confident , powers , who ventures to disappoint this common anticipation . It needs some courage , even , to give the chief prominence to any other passion than love . The author of " Caleb Williams " was almost the first who dared , in a decided manner , to transgress the general custom in this respect ; and - it was not altogether without reason that Brown was , by some , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single particular is a sufficient ground for predicating the relation of master and disciple . That Brown was , in the highest sense , original , is nevertheless true . And we do not think it too much to add , that many of the later and more celebrated novelists of Great Britain have many incidents and scenes , not to say characters , which seem to have been rather more than suggested by passages in the fictions of our own countryman . Charles Brockden Brown was born at Philadelphia , in the year V7 ' 71 . His family was highly respectable , though involved in the heresy of George Fox . He was always studious , and , in some particulars , he was considerably precocious . After a pupilage of five years with a Mr. Proud , from whom he learnt Latin and Greek , he began to devote his attention , at sixteen , to poetical composition ; sketched no less than three epics-of the " six weeks " kind  --  and made some progress towards their completion . Fortunately , no Joseph Cottle standing ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design doubtless , into the fire . In addition to these more iiiagnificent endeavors , it is known that he now and then gratified the vanity , incident to boyish years , of gracing the Poet 's Corner of a respectable country newspaper . Subsequently , he studied law-mainly , it is evident , to gratify the wishes of his friends , and without any definite purpose of his own . He never entered on the duties of that profession . He always had one favorite purpose , manifestly , however at times he may have suffered it to lie dormant . From the time of relinquishing his law studies , his attention was turned to literary pursuits ; and henceforward he continued to write more or less assiduously until the time of his death . He published no work , of any pretensions , before " Wieland , " which appeared in 1798 . This was followed , in the next year , by " Ormond , " " Arthur Mervyn , " and " Edgar Huntley . " In 1801 , he published " Clara Howard , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first issued in England . During the same year of the latter publication , he was married to a lady of New York-where he had spent a considerable portion of his time since he first became known as an author  --  and was , the rest of his life , permanently settled at Philadelphia . He died in February , 1810. . *b4:6. 2611 // The main incidents in the life of an author , almost always , are the conception and birth of his books , and their progress in the world . It is in these , therefore , that we are to look for his character , and for the sum of his life . It was , at least , the fortune of Brown to make no very decided and abiding impression on those about him , aside from that which was left on their minds by his writings . We are told , indeed , that he was of a gentle nature ; that his manners were , in general , pleasing ; that he conversed with ease and effect , and that he was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the many , he appeared to be only a man much given to reveries and moods of abstraction ; and perhaps his absent manner sometimes so unconsciously possessed him , when in society , as to call forth a smile on the countenances of some of the less polite and less intelligent of the circle in which he moved . But all these little incidents , that go to make up an extended biography , after all concern us but little . It is not in circumstances like these , that the real man is exhibited . We are forced to recur to the only sure index and representative-his work-in order to gain any correct knowledge , or to form any true judgment . The first work which finds its way into the world , from the pen of whatsoever writer , has probably within it so*iie true tokens of the power in which it originates . The best qualities of such a mind may indeed be altogether concealed . Its defects may here assume their worst form . The work itself is by no means the measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnestly written , deliberately put into the hands of a publisher , and willingly exposed in the literary shambles , may be esteemed a rare book indeed , if it contains no certain intimations of the quality of the mind from whence it proceeds . We do not hesitate to pronounce " Wieland " to be the product of an extraordinary mind-such a work as could proceed from no other than a gifted spirit . We are quite sure that we detect in it the lineaments of a genius fully as original , and profound , and comprehensive , as that of Irving or Bryant . But then we are compelled to add , that Brown never lived to reach that maturity of experience and cul ture , to which these two have attained . The author of " Wieland " was only a youth-his life never passed that limit . Schiller , and Byron , and Shelley , are all said to have died young ; but their youth was manhood compared with his . In years , to be sure , there was not this difference-but youth knows no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , burdened with an almost constant melancholy and gloom , which he never could wholly overcome , and under the thraldom of which , none of the security and peace , essential to the highest achievements , could ever be his . But for physical inabilities , he might , doubtless , have risen above his mental infirmities , and accomplished results of which he has now left behind only some faint promise ; but he was himself destined to be overcome , and he perished in the midst of the conflict . True genius , we are confirmed , never blazes forth at once with its noonday splendor . Chatterton , indeed , may have written remarkable verses at sixteen , and Pope may have lisped in numbers ; but of this we are sure , neither Shakspeare nor Milton , neither Goethe nor Schiller , achiev* ed their greatness without a long and severe process of culture . Re-modellings of Titus Andronicus , hard struggles with the Two Gentlemen of Verona , and anxious pains with Venus and Adonis , must inevitably precede Hamlet and the Tempest . Lycidas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as premonitions and exercises of a strength , which only years of wrestling with " evil tongues and evil times " could nurture up for the iealization of Paradise Lost . Wallenstein and the Robbers seem scarcely to be products of the same mind ; and that Wilhelm Meister was written by the author of the Sorrows of Werter , seems to require some credulity to believe . Yes ,  --  the evolution of genius demands a vehement and long-protracted struggle . None can be developed without it , and the more powerful , the greater the throe of parturition . Many persons , doubtless , will question whether the species of writing , in which Brown was engaged , was of a character that would tend very much to the promotion of the culture he above all things needed . This suspicion is not without its good reason . Of two such novels as 262 . LV. . aru. , // " Ormond " and " Edgar Huntley , " both written in one year , the last , perhaps , considerably worse than its predecessor , and each inferior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little in the way of improving style or the faculty of invention . If these were all the particulars in which culture is necessary , or in respect to which we find the chief necessity , we should have no hope from such a discipline . But we regard the matter far otherwise . The culture we mean is necessarily a hidden work-different in different individuals , and in all indescribable , yet attainable only by means of constant exertion , vigorous action of the mind , in one direction or another . The first question to raise is , evidently , whether there are any true marks of genius in these works already put forth-plain tokens of the presence of a superior energy , that has not yet worked itself clear of the gross impediments and earthly mixtures that surround it . If such a power is detected , then the constant and vehement action which we observe , however it may at first appear to us , is doing a good work , in a manner undefinable and imprescriptible , and moving towards results which we can but imperfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very complicated . The predominant passion is religious enthusiasm . The interest of the narrative is kept up by a constant appeal to the aid of mystery and wonder , rather than by the relation of thrilling adventures , or by impressive and dazzling description . Love , indeed , has a considerable place , but only a subordinate one . The scene is laid on the banks of the Schuylkill , at only a little distance from Philadelphia . The time is the middle of the last century . The grandfather of Wieland was descended from an ancient and noble family of Germany , but marrying the daughter of a merchant , he and his offspring were degraded from their rank , and cut off from their inheritance . Wieland 's father was apprenticed to a trader in London , and served out his full time . Through the want of books and society , he became a man of melancholy and morose meditation . Accidentally meeting with a work containing a full account of the history and d9ctrines of a certain fanatical sect , ( the Camissards , ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VOL . I. ) *O . III . *EW SERIES . 18 made it a subject of intense study ; and became , in the end , a thorough convert . His religion prompted him to become a missionary among the Indians of our own country . He made a feeble and ineffectual attempt to impart his extravagant notions to the savages along the banks of the Ohio ; but soon settled on a farm in the situation already indicated as the scene of the story . Here he married ; bought slaves ; became wealthy . But in all his pursuits , his peculiar religious notions never left him . He builds a curious chapel , on a height above the river , to which , at noon and at midnight , he constantly repairs , to pay his devotions . Here , at last , at the usual time of his nightly visitation , he is found senseless , with his clothes consumed from his body , and a mysterious cloud of fire overhanging him . He lingers on in the acutest suffering , and dies a horrible death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unperformed duty . His wife soon followed him , overborne by the shock which this astounding and unaccountable occurrence gave to her sensitive mind . Two orphan children are left in possession of their estate , and dependent on the fostering care of a maiden aunt residing in the city . One is the Wieland of our tale , the other is Clara , the narrator . One of the friends of their childhood was Catharine Pleyel , to whom , subsequently , without any very romantic love-making , the former is married . Wieland occupies the paternal mansion , and Clara , from a certain pride of housekeeping , builds a dwelling nearly a mile distant , and settles down with only the immediate society of a female servant . Wieland inherits the gloomy religious nature of his father . No pains bad been taken to impress his mind with precise and rational opinions respecting divine things . His mother was a simple Moravian , devout in her way , but equally careless with her husband about instilling her own peculiar views into the minds of her children . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modelled by no religious standard . We were left to the guidance of our own understanding , and the casual impressions which society might make upon us . " At first thought , such a neglect in the religious training of his own children , on the part of one who had been so anxious to convert // world , may seem unnatural . A second thought , however , will assure one who knows a little of the ways of this world , that nothing is more common than inconsistencies of this very kind . There are men , who delight to please everybody , and to labor for the improvement of every community  --  but their own family and their own neighborhood . God seems to require of them some magnificent sacrifice , some heroic endeavor -- anywhere but at their own fireside , and in the midst of the circumstances in which fortune has placed them . Wieland inherited violent religious passions . This element of his character , thus unnaturally predominant at the outset , and neglected by the hand of sober and persevering discipline , came at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve himself and the innocent ones about him in hideous ruin . Not long after , Henry PleycI , brother of the wife of Wieland , was added to their society , after having spent some years in Europe . His views , were skeptical , yet his nature was kindly , his intellect of a high order , and in his fondness for music and poetry , he fully sympathized with each member of the circle into which he was now comc . The action of his peculiar views upon Wieland , and the reaction of the faith of the latter against his skeptical arguments and incredulous pleasantries , may doubtless be understood as contributing their share towards the consummation of that fatal growth in which Wieland 's superstitious feelings were rapidly progressing . The four spent many hours of gaiety and pastime at the " temple " where the elder Wieland came to so mysterious an end , and which had been refitted into a beautiful summer retreat . This was especially the favorite resort for musical diversion , sometimes for the reading of favorite authors , occasionally for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness . But a different season was approc ching . One evening , a letter of a certain acquaintance , who was travelling in the Southern States , had been the occasion of some slight controversy between Pleyel and his friend . This letter had been received while all were in the " temple , " and was accidentally left behind , on returning to the house . In order to settle the dispute , Wieland went for the letter . The scene that followed we shall give in the author 's own words . The passage is as good a specimen as we could select , for exhibiting the main characteristics of the author 's manner . " In a few minutes he returned . I was somewhat interested in the dispute , and was therefore impatient for his return ; yet , as I heard him ascending the stairs , I could not but remark , that he had executed his intention with remarkable dispatch . My eyes were fixed up . on him on his entrance . Methought he brought with him looks considerably different from those with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anxiety , were mingled in them . His eyes seemed to be in search of some object . They passed quickly from one person to another , till they rested on his wife . She was seated in careless attitude on the sofa , in the same spot as before . She had the muslin in her hand , by which her attention was chiefly engrossed . " The moment he saw her , his perplexity visibly increased . He quietly seated himself , and fixing his eyes on the floor , appeared to be absorbed in meditation . These singularities suspended the inquiry which I was preparing to make respecting the letter . In a short time , the company relinquished the subject which engaged them , and directed their attention to Wieland . They thought that he only waited for a pause in the discourse , to produce the letter . The pause was uninterrupted by him . At length Pleyel said , Well , I suppose you have found the letter . ' " No , ' said be without any abatement of his gravity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill . ' Why not ? ' - ' Cathanne , have you not moved from that spot since I left the room ? - She was affected with the solemnity of his manner , and laying down her work , answered in a tone of surprise , No . Why do you ask that question ? - His eyes were again fixed upon the floor , and he did not immediately answer . At length , he said , looking round upon us , Is it true that Catharine did not follow me to the hill ? That she did not just now enter the room ? ' We assured him , with one voice , that she had not been ab-* sent for a moment , and inquired into the motive of his questions . " Your assurances , ' said he , are solemn and unanimous ; and yet I must deny credit to your assertions , or disbelieve the testimony of my senses , which informed me , when I was half way up the hill , that Catba*ine was at the bottom . ' " We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levity on his behavior . He listened to his friend with calmness , but without any relaxation of features . // true ; either I heard my wife 's voice at the bottorn of the hill , or I do not hear your voice at present . ' " Truly , ' returned Pleyel , it is a sad dilemma to which you have reduced yourself . Certain it is , if our eyes can give us certainty , that your wife has been sitting in that spot during every moment of your absence . You have heard her voice , you say , upon the hill . In general , her voice , like her temper , is all softness . To be heard across the room , she is obliged to *exert herself . While you were gone , if I mistake not , she did not utter a word . Clara and I had all the talk to ourselves . Still it may be that she held a whispering conference with you on the hill ; but tell us the particulars . ' " The conference , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on in a whisper . You know with what intention I left the house . Half way to the rock , the moon was for a moment hidden from us by a cloud . I never knew the air to he more bland or more calm . In this interval I glanced at the temple , and thought I saw a glimmering between the columns . It was so faint , that it would not perhaps have been visible , if the moon had not been shrouded . I looked again , hut saw nothing . I never visit this building alone , or at night , without being reminded of the fate of my father . There , was nothing wonderful in this appearance ; yet it suggested something more than mere solitude and darkness in the same place would have done . " I kept on my way . The images that haunted me were solemn ; and I entertained an imperfect curiosity , hat no fear , as to the nature of this object . I had ascended the hill little more than half way , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , distinct , powerful , and were uttered , as I fully believe , by my wife . Her voice is not commonly so loud . She has seldom occasion to exert it , but , nevertheless , I have sometimes heard her call with force and eagerness . If my ear was not deceived , it was her voice which I heard . " Stop , go no further . There is danger in your path . ' The suddenness and unexpectedness of this warning , the tone of alarm with which it was given , and , above all , the persuasion that it was my wife who spoke , were enough to disconcert and make me pause . I turned and listened to assure mys*lf that I was not mistaken . The deepest silence succeeded . At length , I spoke in my turn . Who calls ? Is it you , Catharine ? ' I stopped and presently received an answer . Yes , it is I. Go not up ; return instantly ; you are wanted at the house . ' Still the voice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stairs . " What could I do ? The warning was mysterious . To be uttered by Catharine at a place , and on an occasion like this , enhanced the mystery . I could do nothing but obey . Accordingly , I trod back my steps , expecting that she waited for me at the bottom of the hill . When I reached the bottom , no one was visible . The moon-light was once more universal and brilliant , and yet , as far as I could see , no human or moving figure was discernible . If she had returned to the house , she must have used wondrous expedition to have passed already beyond the reach of my eye . I exerted my voice , but in vain . To my repeated exclamation , no answer was returned . " Ruminating on these incidents , I returned hither . There was no room to doubt that I had heard my wife 's voice ; attending incidents were not easily explained ; but you now assure me that nothing extraordinary has happened to urge my return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . ' " This inexplicable event was treated by Pleyel as a mere deception of the senses . Catharine could not wholly recover her mind from disquietude , although the arguments with which Pleyel maintained his opinion seemed plausible . The sister of Wieland recurred at once in her mind to the death of her father-on which event from a child , she had been accustomed t ruminate , and which she could never a& count for as other than miraculous-th ugh she found it impossible fully to credit such a solution . But on the imagination*of Wie* land himself , the effect of this occurrence was truly momentous . He had king regarded his father 's death as the result of a Divine decree-of a supernatural interposition . The affair of this evening sunk his mind into a deep , permanent religious gloom-strong and transforming as that which took possession of the soul of Pascal , after his almost miraculous escape from death , yet wanting all the counterbalancing effect of culture and manly reason that saved the French scholar from every tendency toward insanity . He regarded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow escape from some impending danger-perhaps from tb* fate of his father . Time wore on . News had come of an immense inheritance in Lusatia , not only of wealth but also of political power , which was the undoubted right of Wieland , and which needed only his presence to se*i*r* . Pleyci long and strenuously urged hui* re // able , " said Wieland , " to grasp at wealth and power , even when they were within our reach ? Were not these the two great sources of depravity ? What security had he , that in this change of place and condition , he should not degenerate into a tyrant and voluptuary ? Power and riches were chiefly to be dreaded on account of their tendency to deprave the possessor . He held them in abhorrence , not only as instruments of misery to others , but to him on whom they were conferred . Besides , riches were comparative , and was he not rich already ? He lived at present in the bosom of security and luxury . All the instruments of pleasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were within his reach . " Wieland and Pleyel walked out alone , one evening  --  and this matter was to be discussed for the last time . They promised their friends , whom they left in the house , a speedy return . But they did not come again until after midnight . They . had wandered involuntarily into the " temple . " Both had heard once more the mysterious voice-confirming the one in his resolution to remain on the banks of the Schuylkill-announcing to the other that the Baroness de Stalberg , for love of whom he was chiefly anxious to hasten his return to Europe , was dead . The senses of both gave the same report , and Pleyel was , for a moment , confounded . Subsequent tidings confirmed to the latter the message he had heard ; and Wieland was forever fixed in his first resolution of remaining where he was . At this stage , another character is introdueed . Carwin appears as a rustic . The first *impressions which his countenance and voice make upon Clara are peculiarly vivid* and not altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wieland family , and manifests traits of a cultivated and active intellect , and of a refinement of feeling and expression altogether above his apparent condition . But on all the events of his past life , he maintains an invincible taciturnity . Aside from this singularity , his society was welcome , and his presence always gave pleasure . His intercourse , for a long time , only strengthened the good feelings entertained towards him . Cli*ra confesses that her affections had been secretly given to Pleyel . On a certair evening , there was to be a rehearsal of a tragedy which they had lately received from Germany . She looked forward with fond anticipations to the approaching interview with Pleyel and her other friends . Usually punctual to a minute , he now delayed . The evening wore on into night , and still he did not come . She was full of apprehension and alarm for his sake . The intended amusement was defeated by his absence ; and she returned home , and retired to her chamber . She could not sleep , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Some time before , she had heard what seemed to be the voice of two ruffians in a closet near her bed , whispering about her murder . In trepidation , she had fled to the house of her brother . But the fright was now remembered scarcely at all  --  and Pleyel had always regarded it as the result of a dream . She went to this closet , to-night , for a manuscript left by her father . A voice within cried , " Hold , hold ! " And yet she unaccountably persisted in her endeavor . The door opened , and a human figure stepped forth . It was Carwin . The danger of Clara was not unlike that of the Jewess Rebecca in the presence of Bois-Gilbert . Her courage was not the same ; but like her she escaped , and Carwin left the house . At morning , she is called on by Pleyel , and his absence on the previous evening is explained . He comes , with what seems to him indubitable proof , to charge upon her the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction which his own senses seemed to affirm . He heaped the bitterest reproaches on her head , and withdrew , as he said , to embark at once for Europe . From the fatal night on which the rehearsal had failed , the intense excitement and hurry of events has no interruption till the end . We can not hint at a tithe of the occurrences that now take place , but there is one overwhelming incident , which the reader of these volumes remembers in spite of all others , and which even seems to be the principal event to which all the rest are but secondary and subordinate . Wieland conceives himself to have received from Heaven a terrible monition of duty . He is called to sacrifice the dearest objects of his affection  --  to offer up , // through death , his wife and his little ones ! Let no one start back from this idea as unnatural-as only horror , without any traic grandeur or pathos . We want no betver assurance of genius of a high order , than the manner in which this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In only an ordinary mind , such an event as is about to be related would assume a revolting form . The attempt is hazardous , but the author comes off with a full triumph . Wieland gives an account of this occurrence in a free , fearless , and enthusiastic manner , at the close of his trial for murder . We can give but a portion of the impressive and affecting scene ; but the whole is , an exhibition of the author 's highest power . " While she was gone , I strode along the entry . The fellness of a gloomy hurricane but faintly resembled the discord that reigned in my mind . To.omit this sacrifice must not be ; yet my sinews had refused to perform it . No alternative was offered . To rebel against the mandate was impossible ; but obedience would render me the executioner of my wife . My will was strong , but my limbs refused their office . " She returned with a light ; I led the way to the chamber ; she looked round her ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . " At length. , she fixed inquiring eyes upon me . The light now enabled her to discdver in my visage what darkness had hitherto concealed . Her cares were now transferred from my sister to myself , and she said in a tremulous voice , Wieland ! you are not well ; what ails you ? Can I do nothing for you ? ' " That accents and looks so winning should disarm me of my resolution , was to be expected . My thoughts were thrown anew into anarchy . I spread my hand before my eyes that I might not see her , and answered only by gr*oans . She took my other hand between hers , and pressing it to her heart , spoke with that voice which had ever swayed my will , and wafted away sorrow . " My friend ! my soul 's friend ! tell me thy cause of grief . Do I not merit to partake with thee in thy cares ? Am I not thy wife ? ' " This was too much . I broke from her embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this pause , courage was once more infused into me . I resolved to execute my duty . She followed me , and renewed her passionate entreaties to know the cause of my distress . " I raised my head and regarded her with steadfast looks . I muttered something about death , and the injunctions of my duty . At these words she shrunk back , and looked at me with a new expression of anguish . After a pause , she clasped her hands and exclaimed " 0 Wieland ! Wieland ! God grant that I am mistaken ; but surely something is wrong . I see it ; it is too plain ; thou art undone-lost to me and to thyself . ' At the same time she gazed on my features with intensest anxiety , in hope that different symptoms would take place. , I replied to her with vehemence " Undone ! No ; my duty is known , and I thank my God that my cowardice is now vanquished , and I have power to fulfil it . Catharine ! I pity the weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not spare . Thy life is claimed from my hands ; thou must die ! ' " Fear was now added to her grief . What mean you ? Why talk you of death ? Bethink yourself , Wieland ; bethink yourself ; and this fit will pass . 0 why came hither ! Why did you drag me hither ? ' " I brought thee hitherto fulfil a divine com- , mand . I am appointed thy destroyer , and destroy thee I must . ' Saying this I seized her wrists . She shrieked aloud , and endeavored to free herself from my grasp ; but her efforts were vain . Surely , surely , Wieland , thou dost not mean it . Am I not thy wife ? and wouldst thou kill me ? Thou wilt not ; and yet-I see-thou art Wieland no longer ! A fury resiatless and horrible possesses thee -- spare me-spare-help - help-  ' " Till her breath was stopped she shrieked for help-for mercy . When she could speak no longer , her gestures , her looks appealed to my ' compassion . My accursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sudden , thy struggles to be brief . Alas ! my heart was infirm ; my resolves mutable . Thrice I slackened my grasp , and life kept its hold , though in the midst of pangs . Her eyeballs started from their sockets . Grimness and distortion took the place of all that used to bewitch me into transport , and subdue me into reverence . " I was commissioned to kill thee , but not to torment thee with the foresight of thy death ; not to multiply thy fears , and prolong thy agonies . Haggard , and pale , and lifeless , at length thou ceasedst to contend with thy destiny . " This was a moment of triumph . Thus had I successfully subdued the stubbornness of human passions ; the victim which had been demanded was given ; the deed was done past recall . " I lifted the corpse in my arms and laid it on the bed . I gazed upon it with delight . Such was the elation of my thoughts , that I even broke into laughter .

I imagined I had set myself forever beyond the 1848. 267 // reach of selfishness ; but my imaginations were false . This rapture quickly subsided . I looked again at my wife . My joyous ebullitions vanished , and I asked myself who it was whom I saw ? Methought it could not be Catharine . It could not be the woman who had lodged for years in my heart ; who had slept , nightly , in my bosom ; who had borne in her womb , who had fostered at her breast , the beings who called me father ; whom I had watched with delight , and cherished with a fondness ever new and perpetually growing ; it could not be the same . " Where was her bloom ! These deadly and blood-suffused orbs but ill resemble the azure and ecstatic tenderness of her eyes .

I leaped from the floor ; I dashed my head against the wall ; I uttered screams of horror ; I panted after torment and pain . Eternal fire and the bickerings of hell , compared with what I felt , were music and a bed of roses . " I thank my God that this degeneracy was transient ; that he deigned once more to raise me aloft . I thought upon what I had done as a sacrifice to duty , and was calm .

" While I revolved these ideas , new warmth flowed in upon my heart-I was wrong . These feelings were the growth of selfishness . Of this I was not aware , and to dispel the mist that obscured my perceptions , a new effulgence and a new mandate were necessary . " From these thoughts I was recalled by a ray that was shot into the room . A voice spake like that which I had before heard- ' Thou hast done well ; but all is not done  --  the sacrifice is incomplete-thy children must be offered-they jmust perish with their mother ! - ' he perishes by his own hand .

An unworthy connection with the servant of Clara , as well as an unwarrantable curiosity respecting the affairs of the'Wielands , had betrayed him into many difficulties , from which he could in no way extricate himself but by the aid of a singular faculty-which he had in former times carefully cultivated , but which he had long since determined never to use again-commonly named ventriloquism . This name , indeed , is inadequate to express the exact nature of the powers exerted by Carwin , yet we employ this word as the nearest approach to a description of the character of his agency that a single word can give . Of such a kind , then , was the voice first heard by Wieland , when approaching the temple . From such a source were the words heard by him and Pleyel , while talking in the same place  --  the whispers heard in the closet of Clara  --  and all the sounds that had any appearance of the supernatural . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Pleyel had overheard , and from thence inferred the hypocrisy and crime of the latter . Carwin dreamed not , bad as he really was , of what results he was about to be the occasion , and the knowledge of these events made him truly miserable . Such is an outline of this tale  --  a meagre synopsis of a work that must be read as the author has written it , in order to convey a just notion of its merits , or to carry to the heart its real power . We can not forbear stating here our regret , that a man of such celebrity and authority in the republic of letters as Mr. Prescott has since become should have undertaken the biography of one for whom he could claim no higher consideration , and in the increase of whose reputu7tion he could feel no more interest . * When we The subsequent events may be easily imagined .

We do not complain , nevertheless , because both these authors have fallen short of perfection . We should have been content with considerably less than this . But in Mr. Prescott 's biography there are one or two particulars in respect to which we must be permitted to express , with all due deference , some degree of dissatisfaction . We are surprised at the contempt with which this biographer speaks of the agency given to ventriloquism in " Wieland.

" - Lifeof C. B. Brown , pp. 141 , 142 . We are not ignorant of the many low and degrading associations connected with the word , ( a word , indeed , that is nowhere found in Brown 's own pages , ) nor how easy a matter it is by a little misrepresentation of the author 's use of this instrumentality , in the development of his plot , to throw ridicule upon the whole story . Whatever was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this last result in the most perfect manner . He has committed the error of representing the novelist as keeping up , all the way through his work , a constant excitement of mystery and wonder -- of machinery seemingly supernatural , or , at all events , of the highest order of the unaccountable  --  a continual belief of some great agency altogether beyond the reach of ordinary experience-all of which proves in the end to be only the low tricks of a miserable juggler . How many will be caught reading a book of which they have received such intimations ? Viewed in its true light , the case is quite different-unless we greatly misapprehend . The whole destiny of the Wielands is made to rest upon the character of Wieland himself . All the calamities that follow , unspeakable as they are , the author very plainly attempted to attach entirely to the uneducated and ungoverned religious passion of the main actor in these events ; and he has , beyond question , succeeded . The mistake of supposing the chief agency to be devolved on Carwin , could hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had given these volumes a thorough , continuous reading . Especial pains seem to have been taken to show how insignificant and how purposeless are the instrumentality of Carwin , and his tri*iks : nay , the very necessities of the fiction required this agency to be as mean and conte*nptible as possible . It was absolutely necessary that " confirmations strong as holy writ " should be formed out of " trifles light as air . " When is was the main purpose to make out a religious frenzy more powerful than the strongest promptings of reason and the tenderest ties of affection , ought the impulse which sets that frenzy in motion to be sublime , and , to all ordinary minds at least , irresistible ? or ought it to be altogether too weak and insufficient to have any influence over a man in his 1848. 269 // right mind ? What is the issue ? It matters very little to assert that the alleged means by which Carwia produces , indirectly , such tremendous effects , " is altogether incompetent to the various phenomena of sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , in the first place , that some of the most wonderful and important of these phenomena are left ( precisely according to Mr. Prescott 's wish ) without an attempt at explanation ; and secondly , that as to all the occurrences which are accounted for by ventriloquism , the main efficacy of that power , as well as the appearances to which it gives rise , are all derived chiefly from the mind acted on rather than from the more ostensible agent and agency . Pleyel , indeed , hears a feigned conversation , in which the voice of Clara is so nearly imitated as to produce a perfect illusion . Here there is nothing that wears the least tinge of a supernatural character Here all the responsibility rests on the ventriloquist and his art . The illusion depended not at all , for its efficacy , on the mind of Pleyel . He credits the evidence of one of his senses , just as he would do in any other case  --  and is duped , without himself conspiring with his enemies . But the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . Coleridge asserts , in his oracular. way , that Othello was not impelled to the murder of his wife by the passion of jealousy ; but that the proofs of the guilt of Desdemona , so far as he was able to judge of them , amounted to a certainty ; and that the conduct of a husband , acting under the certainty of the falsehood of his wife , must be referred to some other impulse than jealousy . iNow , there is a striking similarity-in certain particulars , though there is abundant diversity in othersbetween the catastrophe of Othello and that of " Wieland , " as well as in the means by which , in each case , the catastrophe is brought about . There is , indeed , nothing that looks in the least like imitation : it is evident that the resemblance in question is purely accidental . Both the dramatist and the novelist drew from the same common fountain-Nature . Othello , as we understand the drama , goaded on into a persuasion which only a mind susceptible of the deepest and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangles his wjfe , out of revenge . Wieland , led on by a series of occurrences , most unimportant in themselves , and respecting which he takes no pains to ascertain any other cause than the supernatural one which his impassioned mind first suggests-nay , without even suspending his judgment until something more than his first vague impression should be furnished , *s a ground of decision-becomes so fully confirmed in his religious frenzy , that he sacrificed his wife out of obedience to a sense of duty . Now Coleridge regards the few trivial circumstances and chances , that work such a madness in the brain of Othello , as very sufficient reasons for inducing that fatal persuasion , and vents all his wrath , of course , upon lago . But Mr. Prescott has none of that reverential feeling for his subject , which led the critic of Shakspeare to addpt any conclusion , however absurd , rather than admit his fallibility . He regards the means by which the fatal frenzy of Wielund is wrought up to its highest pitch , as inadequate , unimportant , contemptible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the justification of his author in the character of Wieland himself , but permits all his indignation to rest on the novelist , who has served up such a " feast of horrors , " without the least palliating circumstance to be offered in his defence . Coleridge is certainly wrong-yet he is consistent with himself . We think Mr. Prescott was equally wrong , yet not with just the same consistency . A novelist who had made such a woful mistake . as he attributes to Brown , could not , by any possibility , deserve from his pen a biography of even two hundred duodecimo pages . But for the weight which will always attach to an opinion coming from so distinguished a source , we should have taken much less pains to point out an error sr evident , that few could have ever adopted it , if recommended by any name less influential than that of the author of the three most popular histories of modern times . The author of " Wieland " had , evidently , a deep and ( for one of his years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis on which all real genius must rest . Brown seems , to be sure , to have had comparatively little acquaintance 270 March , // with individuals and classes of men . His intercourse with society was , undoubtedly , mainly confined within the limits of a particular circle , in his native city . In his last years , however , he saw more of men in different regions , and became more familiar with their various customs and peculiarities . But a profound knowledge of man by no means requires a great latitude of observation-certainly does not depend on it alone . We find in the novels of our author but few practical remarks on men and manners ; yet when such do occur , they are usually just and felicitous . His chief power lay in tracing out from the deep , hidden springs of the human soul-from the region of motives , and impulses , and purposes  --  a connected and consistent series of actions and events moving on to momentous issues . The circumstances in which a mind like Wieland 's is made to spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are able to &amp;onceive . In the first place , it is evident that from no quarter of the world could such a mind originate so naturally as from Germany . And then to trace his origin to a family of high and noble blood , and to an individual of ardent poetical temperament , whose love had wrought his temporal ruin , was equally suitable and appropriate . But above all , the morose and solitary habits of his father , hi* deep fanaticism , and his mysterious and terrible end , have a fit relation to the singular being , who was to bring such overwhelming calamities on those who were embosomed in tranquillity , and plenty , and social happiness . The mother of Wieland ought of necessity to be a disciple of Count Zinzendorf . Clara inherited the qualities of the maternal side , with only the better traits of the Wielands . Her brother gathered up in his nature all the leading characteristics of his paternal ancestors , with only a modifying tinge from the religion of his mother . So far , all is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradual progress of Wieland 's mind into that extraordinary state , which constitutes the most impressive feature of the whole story , is admirably portrayed , and the means by which it is effected are , in our opinion , every way unexceptionable . The mysterious and dreadful death of the father could not but have a large place in the memory and imagination of one who was just old enough , at the time of its occurrence , to understand all its realities , and yet just enough a child to mingle with his knowledge of the facts every wild and wonderful conception . That violent end is , to the last , a mystery unexplained . It should be so . The novelist had a right to make this demand upon our credulity , and the necessities of his story compelled him to do it . Any attempt at an explanation of this occurrence would have appeared feeble at the close of such exciting scenes as those which follow , and to have preceded them would entirely defeat the purpose for which it was introduced . Yet this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnessed at an age susceptible of all the strange emotions which it would be likely to excite in the mind of her brother . It was an incident well known to all the other characters of the tale . That strange calamity was , indeed , an adequate cause for marvel and even for awe ; and this was the full extent to which it influenced the mind of any but Wieland . The voices subsequently heard , too , were accounted for by all the rest , in any other way than as being supernatural . To Wieland , unimportant as in reality they were , they afforded sufficient food for the nurturing and maturing of his frenzy . Once completely involved in these toils , every movement , however trivial , and every attempt at extrication , only binds and entangles him the more . Pleyci is brought under the same external influences-he wonders , and knows not how to satisfy his judgment , He credits a mysterious announcement of what he was already confident must be true , yet he wisely suspends his judgment of the character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afforded . Wieland makes up his mind at once , while everything is vague and uncer* tam , according to the promptings of a judg. ment already disturbed with passion . Clara hears mysterious voices in her closet-and she is frightened . Wieland hears , or fan* cies that he hears , ( for the author leaves us to infer that this is mere fancy , and that the mind of the bewildered man has now arrived at that state in which internal and external impulses are easily confounded , ) * 1848. 271 // voice demanding of him the sacrifice of his wife , as a proof of his disinterested piety  --  and he obeys ! Carwin is a character in whom we at first feel much interest ; for we do indeed expect to find in him the key to all these mysteries . Yet it is hardly possible that the reader should ever suppose him to have been introduced as the immediate cause of any supernatural phenomena . We have already begun to suspect that the incidents which produce so great an effect upon Wieland , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysteriousness , indeed , but no very great actual importance . For we see very plainly that we are conversing with real men and women of this world , and that we are not introduced to the island of Prospero ; that , in such an every-day state of things as has been all along described , no reasonable author could introduce an order of events depending on unheard-of laws , and on unnatural agencies . No sane writer of fiction would be very likely to introduce a Caliban into the family of an ordinary country gentleman like Squire Western , or a Mephistopheles among the quiet and simple inhabitants of " sweet Auburn . " Yet , though no reader could justly form any expectation of finding in Carwia a character that should be the author . of supernatural events , in a manner strictly accordant with his own nature , we have no doubt that a majority of readers feel more dissatisfaction with the author 's development of this personage than with anything else in the tale . This was the most critical part of the whole writing. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty , and acquits himself of this " It has not escaped our notice that the author ( in his Advertisement ) speaks of Carwin as the " principal person . " This may seem a conclusive testimony against our opinion of the purpose which this character was intended to serve . But we must be allowed to . doubt that the author means anything more by these words than we have already admitted . It is indeed the character on which the whole , in a certain way , depends , and the one which unquestionably gave the author most pains and perplexity in unfolding . So , also , he speaks of the narrative being told " by the lady whose story it contains " - although no one will pretend that the work is very much like an autobiography . Both these expressions seem to be used in rather a loose manner , to avoid the repetition of names , and not for the sake of explaining a story which is not yet told . task , will afford a tolerably sure test of his powers . It can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a Providence which overrules all events ; that crime has its own terrible and inevitable consequences ; that the error and folly which lead to the same results as crime are equally fatal in their outward effects , and render men equally responsible for those effects . Murder committed in a drunken frolic is not excusable ; the strangling and robbery which the Thug believes it to be his positive duty to perform , and for the omission of which he dreads a terrible retribution , render him as amenable to justice as the same deeds would any other criminal ; and the infanticide religiously perpetrated on the banks of the Ganges is no less heinous because induced by the religious passion . No action is performed without some motive . Even the madman has an irrational motive . Coleridge has taken rather a singular position , in one of his works , where he descants upon a " self-determined will . " A man may do this or that-according to our metaphysician-without rnotiu*e , were it only to show that the thing can be done without motive ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish bulls . It is in this region of motives , if we mistake not , that authors of fiction are most usually assailable , in all controversies respecting naturalness and consistency . The providential laws are violated , when innocence is suffered to be involved in a series of intolerable calamities , brought about by an innocent agent : that is , such a thing is impossible . But that the guilt of one should be the cause of calamities to another , or to many others , is nothing impossible-nay , it is comparatively common . Now the problem for our author to solve was no less than this : To make Wieland the deliberate agent of a most horrible deed , under a sense of duty . Those who deny that the human will acts under the restraint of any superior law , will need no further reason for such an action than , simply , that he willed it . The common sense of every reader , nevertheless , tells him that , in all ordinary states of mind , the phenomenon and the conditions we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be some intervening mo 272 March , // tive , depending for its efficacy on a diseased state of the mind . The mental malady of Wieland , we have already seen , would have come to that stage which rendered the act possible , through the operation of only some very trivial incident , so soon as it was possible for him to credit the reality of a direct , sensuous intercourse with the Deity . It is to confirm this faith that Carwin is introduced . The motive on the part of Carwin , however , must not have been pure malignity-else the design of the author would have been entirely frustrated , by removing the whole enormity of the murder , and the whole weight of the reader 's horror , upon this inferior agent . Now we conceive that this part of the fiction is admirably managed so as to secure all the ends intended . Carwin carries on a complicated system of deceit , into which guilt-of another and different character , in respect to which we feel little indignation , but abundant loathinghas betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow . And therefore , while the part he has played has a sufficient motive , and falls short of the highest degree of guilt , it nevertheless serves the purpose for which he was introduced on the stage . We despise the man-we look upon him as a degraded , insignificant creature . The whole weight of all the dreadful mystery is left to rest upon Wieland ; and the chief responsibility of the calamities in which his family are overwhelmed is not transferred from their immediate cause . The excessive dislike and detestation of Clara towards Carwin has , doubtless , contributed to mislead some readers respecting the real magnitude of the agency which he exerts . This horror is perfectly natural-exaggerated as it nevertheless is . The remembrance of that scene , in which Carwin comes* forth from the closet at midnight , avowing a fiendish purpose , must awaken no very gentle emotions in the mind of such a woman as the sister of Wieland . Nor could she forget the base heartlessness of the deceitful calumny that had for so long a time alienated Pleyel from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most infamous of crimes . But even had Carwin been only , as he pretends , the innocent yet careless occasion of the calamity that annihilated the whole family of her brother , her feelings could hardly have been less violent against him than they were . For all these reasons combined , therefore , it is very plain that the reader who enters into entire sympathy with the emotions of the narrator , and does not form an estimate of things from the facts she communicates , entirely independent of her personal feelings , does injustice to the author . He has exactly followed nature in the words which Clara is made to use , but , of course , he expects the reader to bear in mind by whom they are spoken . On certain particulars , as her own expressions plainly show , she is totally unfit for a dispassionate judgment . Some parts of the closing scenes of Wieland 's life are unsurpassed by any passage which we remember in the most celebrated novelists . The tumultuously shifting clouds of madness that chase through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments of sanity , more terrible than all , excite the mind to a feeling of almost supernatural awe . A more vivid , burning impression than that which these powerful passages leave on the mind , is inconceivable . We detect here , very plainly , the workings of a genius kindred to that which gave birth to the tragedy of Macbeth , and to the wild , frantic energies of the Moor of Venice . We know of few novels that are fuller of moral meaning than " Wieland . " It seems to us impossible for any one to read it without receiving some very valuable lessons , such as can not very soon be forgotten . The dangers of fanaticism , of false notions of the Deity , of a too ready credence of supernatural interpositions , are here effectively exhibited . That direct intercourse of the senses with the Supreme Being is impossible ; that an uncontrolled and irregular flow of the religious feelings is unwise and pernicious ; and that duty never can require of a man any other sac rifice than a renunciation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on almost every page . And if there is a little excess of tragedy in the events here portrayed , even this fault turns to some good account , by adding to the force and permanence of the impression made by the moral lessons connected therewith . On one who reads for critical purposes 1848. 273 // the whole effect of the work is to leave an exalted opinion of the natural powers of the author . These powers , we have already said , were but imperfectly developed . " Wieland " is not , and could not be , a truly great and finished work . Its main defects are but too obvious , without particularization . Its style , except in rare passages , is not uniformly easy and natural , neither have its sentences , in general , a musical flow and cadence . More faulty still is the almost constant exaggeration of horror  --  the carrying of tragedy to the utmost extreme of anguish and gloom . The youthful writer had not yet learned to temper his light and shade-if , indeed , " Wieland " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the latter-neither had he been able to distinguish the boundary that separates the sentiment of pleasurable sadness from the horror of unmitigated suffering and torture . Yet he shows clearly enough , that he was not unconscious of the existence of such a boundary , and that only a little further culture was necessary to put him in full possession of the requisite skill . But we can not give ourselves heartily to the work of tracing out and exposing the errors of a youth whose early death and whose uncommon capabilities ought , after the lapse of so many years , to secure him from any but the kindest mention . The gradual progress of his works towards forgetfulness , ( as we intimated at the outset , ) even his warmest friend could hardly hope to do more than temporarily arrest . There is , therefore , a certain mournful satisfaction in the thought , that even this article , which a few may be disposed to esteem some years too kLte to attract much notice by its title , is perhaps one of the last efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of a youth who gave promise of a fame that should exceed that of even our most honored writers . Could Brown have lived to become a complete master of himself , to reduce all his faculties under perfect controV ; had the long discipline of years and of severe experiences wrought out a way whereby the genial impulses that visited his spirit could find full and free access to the minds of his fellows ; envy itself must have done him reverence . But the course of the divine destinies is inevitable-irresistible . The flower that perishes when first opening from its bud is soon forgot , in the midst of full-blown and perfect blossoms . Not altogether such is the fate of Brockden Brown . His novels are still in the Circulating Libraries of our own and other lands ; and , what is more satisfactory to know , they are still read by no small number . Such , we doubt not , will be their fortune , for a long time to come . Whatever may afterwards be their fate , they will at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a good name to the next generation.
