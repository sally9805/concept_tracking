txt THE Jesuits ! It is a word of ' terror , which NI . Michelet and his friend utter in the ears of their countrymen ; of terror even to many of their Catholic brethren . Nor is the dread of this long slumbering , but now reawakening , body confined to France . Jesuitism is spreading , and silently acquiring strength , in the United States ; for good or for evil , it is gaining ground among us ; and many , whose eyes are open to the fact , see in our future history auto-da-fes and inquisitions , and Protestantism destroyed by a new St. Bartholomew . Under these circumstances , we have thought that a sketch of the founder of Jesuitism , of his purposes and constitutions , might be interesting and even useful . It was in the year 1491 , that the word spread from the ancestral castle up into the valleys of Guipuzcoa , that another son was born to the noble house of Ogner and Loyola . Already had Don Bertram seven sons and three daughters , before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And what a world was that upon which his eyes first opened ! In Germany , a little , fair-haired Martin Luther , eight years old , was gathering fagots with his mother in the woods of Mansfeld . In Florence , a polished , treacherous Lorenzo de Medici , worn out with gout and intrigue , was preparing to take to his death-bed , and sue , without success , to the haughty , unhappy monk Savonarola , for absolution . In Rome , a Roderic Borgia , the incarnation of evil , was looking forward to the day when , as Alexander the Sixth , he should preside over the Christian Church . In Spain itself , the Moor was fighting his last battles , and breathing his last sigh , and Columbus was standing ready to prove with his life the truth of his hold speculations . Ignatius had not yet walked alone , or mastered his first word , before Granada yielded , Lorenzo died , Columbus sailed , and the Holy College , guarded by armed men , chose the vilest churchman of Christendom as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , and the youngest son of Loyola , handsome , intelligent , proud , ambitious , was already destined to the life of a courtier , and given as a page to Ferdinand the Catholic , when that same overbearing monk , // Savonarola , who had refused absolution to the chief of Florence unless he would restore freedom to his country , and all that he had usurped from them to his neighbours , stood forth against the abominable Borgia , and on the birthday of his Saviour proclaimed it as a revelation made to him from God , that he was not to obey the corrupt see of Rome . Men looked on admiring , and fancied the day of retribution had come . Not yet ; this was but the first blush of its morning , and their admiration and fancy died with the unhappy Dominican , whose weak recantations , a year later , were mingled with the hissing of his blood on the coals which were consuming him . The day was not yet ; the great champions were not ready ; the little Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread at Magdeburg and Eisenach ; Ignatius , a boy of seven , was waiting on his most Catholic Majesty . Years pass away ; vast events , to our eyes vague and ghost-like , flit across the stage of European history . Spain and France - mighty burglars - agree to enter , and divide the booty of Naples ; they enter it , quarrel , and Spain remains mistress . Charles is horn , heir to Austria , and Aragon , and Burgundy , and Castile . C*esar Borgia rages like a wolf through the whole centre of Italy . Venice , that mighty monster of the sea , contends with Turkey , France , the Emperor , the Pope , the Duke of Ferrara , the Marquis of Mantua , and Ferdinand of Aragon ; and yet , though the ocean is red with her blood , lives and fights on . The Pope Borgia dies , - dies of his own poison-cup , prepared for another , but seized on thoughtlessly hy himself after riding on a warm day ; he and Ca*sar both drink ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm and reeking entrails of a mule ; but the father is too gross , and dies , and the armed head of Julius fills his place . Amid all this confused hubbub , Luther sits quietly at Erfurt , studying his Thomas Aquinas , his Cicero and Virgil , but above all , when once found , David , and Isaiah , and John , and Paul , and Jesus . Quietly he sits there , his halfmuttered exclamations of del4*ht hardly audible in that world of contest and dispute ; and yet within him is preparing matter with noise enough in it to make all Europe rock . Little Charles of Spain , heir to so many thrones , a lad of some three years old , never once suspects , as he plays with // his golden tassels , that so much trouble for his future life is preparing in the centre of Germany . But so it was ordained ; by study , by sickness , by the murder of his friend , by the lightning of heaven , Luther is led on , forced on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocking for admission at the hermit-house of St. Augustine . The Saint admits him , bestows his own name upon him , and , to uproot the pride of his heart , sends him forth to beg bread of his old friends . He is not merely in Augustine 's house , and bearing the name of Augustine ; but the writings of the old African become , by intense study through ten years , first at Erfurt , then at Wittenberg , his key to the Bible , to life , and to his own heart . The greatest doctor of the Roman Church becomes , in Luther 's hands , its deadliest enemy . We look elsewhere , and find that the boy Jgnatius had chafed at his pacific duties as a page , and , under Don Antonio Manrique , has long since become a soldier . When Luther went to Wittenberg , Ignatius was a lad of seventeen , gay , brave , and gallant ; when Luther struck his first blow at the Church theology , Loyola was a daring and devoted soldier of twenty-five . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor and good feeling , beloved by his followers , admired by the courtiers , with a taste for poetry , and absorbed in the pursuits of war and pleasure , there is hardly a man in Europe who seems less likely to do battle with the bullnecked Augustinian of Saxony . Five years more pass by , and , in 1521 , the monk stands before the Imperial Diet at Worms , the eyes of Europe fastened upon him ; far off , looking down from the towers of Pampeluna on the pleasant plain about it , and across to the steep mountains which rise on every side , the soldier , unseen by Europe , waits the coming of the French army under Esparre . There are few troops in the town , and they are determined to surrender . Ignatius , a mere looker-on , without command , scolds and persuades to no purpose ; he retires into the citadel , followed by one soldier . The commander of the citadel also wishes to surrender , and Loyola opposes him . A conference is held with the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent and insulting ; the French , angry at his conduct , leave the meeting ; and now they must fight . As a volunteer , he leads the van , and is the soul of the little garrison . The French guns have thrown down the wall , // and Ignatius is in the gap ; hot , and fierce , and obstinate is the contest . Suddenly , the self-made leader falls , his right leg broken by a cannon ball , his left torn by a splinter . The contest is over , and the flag of France waves above the high walls and narrow streets of the capital of Navarre . There were two castles in Europe , which , in that year , 1521 , held strong men , engaged in fierce internal struggles ; the one was the Waldburg , overlooking the blue mountains and the Thuringian plains ; the other , Loyola , from which , perhaps , across the vales and hill-sides , the eye might catch a glimpse of the sea of Biscay . In the former sat Luther , doubting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ; his mind and pen never resting , his great heart corroding in solitude , the enemy of God and man torturing and mocking him . In vain he sang the songs he had sung at Eisenach ; in vain he leaned against the oak and listened to the nightingale ; in vain he gave his whole soul to the task of reviving a vase of violets which the snow had caused to droop , and wept like a child over one that defied his power . His soul was at ease only in the busy struggle of the world , and in his " Patmos " did but grow more hitter against all opponents . In the other castle lay Ignatius , lame , sick , hopelessly deformed . His broken limb had been set unskilfully , and he caused it to be fractured again ; a bone projected near the knee , and he made the surgeons cut it off , scoffing at the agony ; the leg was still too short , and he stretched himself on the rack to lengthen it . It was all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young courtier , the handsome soldier , were those words , - hopelessly deformed ! The light of life was eclipsed , and the music of praise was silenced for ever . Thin and pale , with lips grown white from suffering , and eyes too proud to weep , but dull with dead hopes , Loyola lay waiting the administration of the eucharist . It was the vigil of the festival of St. Peter and St. Paul , and the medical attendants said he could hardly live till morning . The priest caine , and the mysterious wafer was given to the dying man . But before his dying sight still flitted the forms of enemies he had slain , and ladies he had loved ; he had eaten of the body of Christ , but was far from being filled with his spirit . The night wore on ; the relatives , one by one , retired ; with failing vision Ignatius watched the fantastic // figures on the tapestry , as they moved with the mountain wind , until , to his faint brain , they seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scowled on him ; at moments he remembered the rite just administered , and then he thought of the holy men whose festival was to come on the morrow . Again he lost all consciousness , and then , recovering himself , asked if it was death or sleep . Such intervals became more and more frequent ; he was then passing away , and with cold lips he tried to fashion a prayer to Jesus , to Paul , to Peter . His lips ceased moving , his eyes closed ; the watchers by his side , worn out , dozed in silence . The wind stirring the forest boughs , and the tread of the sentinel , were the only sounds heard in the castle . At that hour , to the unconverted soldier , whose heart beat so wearily , appeared the majestic form of an old man , whose quick , kind eye filled with tears as he gazed upon him . " I am Peter , " said the old man , " and I am sent of God to heal and save thee . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning , passed the watchers , who waked not , though his garments swept their feet ,  --  and disappeared . Daylight stole over the Pyrenees , and the watchers of Loyola wakened like guilty men , and crept to the bed-side to see if he still lived . Calmly breathing , with placid brow , and cheeks no longer drawn by pain , the Heaven-rescued man slept as one to whom health has come again . His heart was no longer weary , no longer wholly given to the world ; the Apostle had driven out disease , and planted the germ of that faith which was to develope into Jesuitism . The germ , - it was but the germ , - and the great enemy , tired of buzzing about Luther 's ears in vain , strove hard to root out what the Apostle had planted . The lame , but now convalescing man , as he lay there hour after hour , day after day , thinking of the future , grew nervous and impatient , and longed to be amused . They searched the castle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and again . Those old chivalric romances had been his Bible for many a day ; his faith , and thence his life , had been shaped by them ; from them he had drawn that spirit of gallantry and war , which had sustained him thus far , and was , under new forms , to sustain him through yet greater contests , and to lead him to greater victories . They brought him " The Lives of the Saints , " St. Benedict , St. Dominic , and St. // Francis ; these , at least , he had never read . How he turned the hook over , and glanced it through in utter despair , is not written , but is none the less sure . Then the remembrance of his dream , or of the actual visit of St. Peter , - he knew not which to think it , - came over him , and his eye caught the account of the miraculous conversion of St. Francis . He read it through with care , read it again , and a third time . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure , of the impossibility that he should thenceforth be a soldier , of the conquests which the holy men , whose written lives lay before him , had effected , of the work yet to be done , of the field yet white with the harvest . His eye kindled with a new hope , his hollow cheek flushed with the fever of a new ambition , and turning to the beginning of the volume which a few hours before seemed so tedious , he read it with his heart . Then rose the curtain from that dark future over which he had brooded so long he saw God 's purposes in his wounds and sickness ; he knew why he had been torn from the war-saddle , and stripped of his manly beauty . He was a chosen vessel ; God had great objects in store for him ; he might regain the Holy Land , the Lord 's sepulchre , Calvary , and Bethlehem , not , like the old crusaders , with an arm of flesh , but by the omnipotetice of spiritual power . Who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spaniard , as , with many struggles and relapses , - by prayer , and reading , and silent thought , - he became the soldier of Christ threw up his allegiance to Charles and to Spain , and bound himself to God and the whole earth ; quenched for ever his cherished love " for a noble lady of the court of Castile , " and devoted himself to her who is indeed greater than countess or duchess , even to Mary the Virgin ? His friends saw the change , and guessed the cause . His brother urged him to remember his renown , his warlike genius , and " to do nothing foolish . " Ignatius answered little , discussed nothing , promised nothing , wavered not at all . He , who had been stretched on a rack to lengthen his leg , would not be easily turned aside from the redemption of a world . He was now well , and one day proposed to ride over to Navarreta to see Manrique , his instructer and companion in arms . With two servants he quitted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we may imag // me . We can almost see him turning his horse , as he ascends the last hill that overlooks Loyola , and while his servants on their mules jog along under the oaks and chestnuts , we can observe his lips move as he bids farewell for ever to home , friends , wealth , fame , and pleasure , and with iron will binds himself to poverty , chastity , pain , self-denial , and reproach . He visited Manrique , sent back his servants , and pursued his way alone across the peninsula to Montserrat . There was at that time in the monastery of Montserrat a Frenchman , John Chanones , who had been long a man of the world and distinguished in it ; hut the Holy Spirit had called him , and he sat on the mountain , chief-confessor of the pilgrims who flocked thither . One evening , there came to him a man richly dressed , with the manner of a knight , and , though thin and feeble in appearance , wholly unlike the common people who thronged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , which were those of an agonized soul . His confession would he long and trying ; he had written it , he said , that he might omit nothing , and asked leave of the priest to commence on the morrow . He did so , and for three days , upon his knees , interrupted only by his own sighs and lamentations , did Ignatius pour into that sympathizing ear the tale of his sins , his sufferings , his conversion , his purposes , his temptations , and his fears . Well versed himself in the dangers of the world , the confessor listened with feeling , and answered with wise words . He showed Loyola how Satan slips into the very act of conversion , and prompts the half-saved soul to spiritual pride ; he pointed out the true life for the penitent to pursue , and the dangers he would need especially to guard against ; he sketched for him the varying features of the Evil One , so that he might know them even when they came before him in the guise of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his weary post on the third evening , and , going forth , sought out the meanest beggar of the place , and bestowed upon him his rich apparel , clothing himself in the coarse gown and simple sandals of a common pilgrim . His sword , however , was still by his side , retained there , that , in due time , it might he dedicated to his holy mistress . That night , the devotee who rose , as the clock tolled twelve , to pray before the altar of the Virgin , was startled to find there a man pacing to and // fro , as the young candidate for knighthood was accustomed to do before admission to his order . In a pilgrim 's dress , but with the hearing of a soldier , and carrying in his hand a knight 's sword sheathed , this solitary figure walked there before the altar , or knelt , or stood gazing upward , muttering prayers , or talking in low tones to himself , from midnight till early morning . He then hung the sword upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to the service of Our Lady , received the communion , and on foot , with hare head , sought concealment in the hospital of Manresa , until the port of Barcelona should he opened , and the way to the Holy Sepulchre lie clear before him . Meanwhile , the great warfare with the flesh and the Devil was to he maintained ; so he girt himself with an iron chain , put on a shirt of hair , fasted on hread and water , or , if he ate herbs , sprinkled them with ashes , slept upon the ground , and thrice a day applied the scourge to his flesh . Seven hours of every twenty-four he spent upon his knees in prayer ; to wound his pride , he begged from door to door ; and to confound that personal vanity which had so long ruled him , he made himself revolting to the sight , so that the children stoned him in the streets . But at this very time , a report spread in the village , that the loathsome beggar was a grandee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with altered eyes , and met him as if he had been a saint . The Great Tempter came , too , and whispered , that , if he would only return , changed and sanctified as he was , to his old haunts , the court and camp , he would he able to reform and regenerate them . But Ignatius knew the features of the deceiver , and , plying his scourge with redoubled force , shouted , " Away from me , Satan ! " and for a time he fled . Then he came again , in a new form , and despondency stole over the heart of the weakened devotee ; but again he was recognized and foiled . A third time he came , and whispered in a voice of kindness words of comfort . Why should this penitent fear to die ? Was he not saintly in his sufferings and self-mortification ? Was he not approved and beloved of God and Jesus ? Angels seemed to descend and invite him to paradise . But the enthusiast was even here a match for the tempter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggerated them , dwelt on them , made men sit by him and recite them in his ears , nntil the false heaven and the fallen angels vanished . // Words can not picture the mental condition of Ignatius Loyola during that period of his life . We may call him fanatical , mad , hypocritical , perhaps ; but call him what we will , he was training his nature to endurance and labor such as few men have ever encountered . To form any just opinion of what he was , however , we should study his Spiritual Exercises , " composed chiefly at this time , in 1522 . In them shines forth the most marvellous compound of extravagance and good sense , of the wildest enthusiasm and the calmest wisdom , of intense , heart-rending passion , and deliberate meditation . His life was a similar compound . He united then , in a manner which has characterized his order to this day , overwhelming impulses with the coolest judgment , manifested in adapting means to ends . r* he parallel hetween Loyola as he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sixteen years earlier , which has been run by Ranke and D'Aubign6 , we regard as entirely unjust ; for when we consider , that Luther 's strugr gles with himself arose from the action of conscience and intellect , were waged by means of his intellect , and terminated in a doctrine , - while Loyola 's came from conscience and a past life of wrong-doing , went on by the instrumentality of imagination and feeling , and resulted in a new life , we see no ground for any comparison between the two . Luther 's whole process , which , we repeat , led him to a doctrine , and not to the Reformation , was characterized by those features , both good and evil , which distinguish Protestantism , and Loyola 's by those which are peculiar to Catholicism ; and any parallel between the two men is but a comparison of the two faiths which they embodied , and addresses itself to prejudice , and not to fair judgment . At length the plague ceased , and the port of Barcelona was opened . Loyola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thousands ; for he had become known far and wide , had preached and exhorted to the conversion of many , and was already sainted in hundreds of warm and pure hearts . He went to Rome to receive the Pope 's blessing , thence to Venice to embark , and on the 31st of August , 1523 , landed at Jaffa . When Ignatius reached the Holy Land , with his heart burning to convert the infidel Turks , and rescue the sepulchre of Jesus from pollution by rescuing those who polluted it from Moham // med , Luther , on his part , was just commencing , in defiance of the Elector , now trembling under the hand of death , his warfare upon the mass , " the sacrilege of Tophet . " " Ketha , " not yet his , and , indeed , hardly over the tremor which she felt as she left , with her companions , the monastery of Nimptsch , looked on admiring from the house of the burgomaster of Wittenberg . Luther triumphed ; the dean , frightened by the reformer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice in the church of All Saints , on Christmas day , 1524 . The monastery , too , at that time , was no longer a home for monks , but had become the property of the University ; and Catharine Bora was beginning to think , that she might yet be the wife of the great reformer . Luther triumphed , but not so Loyola . His bright dreams of converting the heathen were all dispelled by the absolute command of the Pope 's representative in Jerusalem , that he should return forthwith to Europe . The Franciscan little knew to what a proud heart he spoke ; his easy eye saw nothing of the struggle in the enthusiast 's breast , as he bent without one word to the authority of the Church , resigned his new ambition , crushed his new hopes , and forgot his disappointments in a long , last gaze upon the miraculous footprints of Jesus on the Mount of Olives . Five months after he landed at Jaffa , Ignatius was again in Europe ; and when Luther , on the 11th of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house of Amsdorff to receive the nuptial benediction , Ignatius was studying Latin among little children in the grammar school of Barcelona . He had been led to think , as he returned from Palestine , that , to convert others , he must himself become wiser , a linguist and a theologian ; and there he sat , with difficulty mastering the rules of Latin syntax , while the heart of Europe stood still with dismay at the Insurrection of the Peasants . There he sat , studying , contending with the Evil One , who for ever drove out his Latin verbs with Spanish prayers ; or waited on the sick in the hospitals ; or preached to those of evil lives ; or won to the Church the innocent who were yet beyond its fold ; a saint in the eyes of many , and gifted with divine power , but among the last one would even then have selected to meet the triumphant monk who had worsted popes , emperors , and kings . 36 * // At the end of two years , he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to whom a fourth was added at that place . And he studied philosophy , not in Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas , - who were not much more to his taste than to Luther 's , - but in the highways and hovels , in prisons and by the side of dying men , now among the dissolute students , and now amid a group of little children ; he studied and he taught , and to such purpose that men thought him a magician , or at least a heretic . The ears of the Inquisition were at that time wide open , for the din of the Lutheran battle drove away sleep ; even Spain was menaced , and every suspected man was watched with countless eyes . The abominable practices of Loyola and his disciples , which consisted mainly in doing ten times as much good as the priests , looked very like heresy , and quietly , but speedily , inquisitors from Toledo passed to Alcala . The whole life of Ignatius was examined , but neither magic nor heresy was found in it ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiring of the accused , through the Vicar-General , to go no more barefoot , - no very severe sentence for that tribunal . But Satan , who had so long been trying to corrupt Loyola , all to no purpose , was bent upon trying what danger and suffering could do ; and it was not long before a new accusation arose , of such a character as caused the VicarGeneral to cast him into prison , where he lay many weeks , and when proved wholly innocent , he was released with the injunction , that he should give up preaching under penalty of excommunication . This was on the 1st of June , 1527 . The sufferings of poor Loyola were now complete . Six years ago , all worldly honor and power were torn from him , and he gave them up without a sigh ; two years later , the haughty Franciscan of Palestine demanded the abandonment of hopes and plans that were deep in his heart , and he abandoned them instantly ; and now he is bidden , by one who speaks almost with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long believed the voice of the Almighty required him to exercise . It was a trial even for a saint 's faith and patience . With reverence he remonstrated , and was sharply answered , that he should not preach novelties . " I did not think , " said he , raising his calm , devout countenance , and looking the VicarGeneral // full in the face , " I did not think , that to preach Jesus Christ was a novelty among you . I appeal to the Archbishop . " If Luther , who , far off in Germany , was at that moment , perhaps , struggling in great agony with temptation , sickness , and despair , had been near when Loyola spoke those words , he would assuredly have welcomed him as a fellow-laborer . The Archbishop of Toledo , to whom he appealed , advised him to go to Salamanca , which he accordingly did . But Satan was there before him , and no sooner did he commence teaching the people than he was once more cast into prison , where he stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , however , by his judges , save that he preached rather too well , they were forced to set him free , though forbidding him to preach even orthodox doctrines , until he had read a course of divinity . Here again , as at Alcala , the voices of God and of the Church seemed opposed ; in vain did the enthusiast try to reconcile them obey he dared not , and disobedience would hut expose him to the dungeon again , and close his lips and his mission . But Loyola was not a Hamlet , to waste his life in trying to reconcile opposing duties . He cut the knot he could not loose , and turning his back on Spain , in mid winter , alone , - for his disciples , too , left him at this juncture ,  --  he passed the Pyrenees in safety , through storms , and snow , and bands of robbers , and early in February , 1528 , stood looking down on the tall houses and narrow streets of Paris , from the heights of Montmartre . Thirty-seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his regenerated existence ; - and there he stood , alone , without a friend in the vast city below him , with but a little money , given him by some compassionate people in Barcelona , and in the character of a mere student ; for his only object in Paris was to procure a proper education . Strangers from England and from Italy brushed by him as he meditated , and talked of the application which it was rumored Henry was about to make to the Pope for a divorce from Catharine ; of the reported alliance between the English king and Francis against the Emperor ; of the devastation of Rome since its fall the May previous ; and of the horrors of its pillage , which , after nine months ' occupation by the Spaniards and Germans , had not even then ceased . Their words fell on Loyola 's ear , but // made no impression . His mind was filled with the single thought of becoming the spiritual regenerator of the immense multitude moving at his feet ; his projected life of poverty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed to him , and , ore he returned to the Hospital of St. James for the night , the work of the morrow , of many morrows , was determined for him . Placing the little fund he had in a companion 's hands for safe keeping , he begged his bread from door to door ; he pursued his study of Latin at Montaigne College ; and having obtained a hold upon some young Spaniards , proceeded with them through the " Spiritual Exercises , " described by him six years before , and persuaded them to sell all they had , to give their money to the poor , and to beg with him enough to support life . But these young men had friends , who looked on all this as madness , and tried to persuade them to come back to common sense ; failing in this , they seized and withdrew them by force from the company of Ignatius , and denounced him , as a dangerous seducer of youth , to On , the inquisitor , who ordered him to appear and explain his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The friend to whom he had confided his money had proved a rogue , and having spent part , had run away with the remainder . He reached Rouen , there fell sick , and was at last brought to great want and suffering . In this emergency , he wrote to Loyola , and at the moment that the inquisitor summoned the Spanish enthusiast before him as a criminal , he was toiling on his way to Ronen to aid the poor wretch who had robbed him ; and before he returned to stand his trial , at the call of the representative of the dread tribunal , he had , by asking alms , obtained enough to procure the repentant wrong-doer a passage to Spain . He returned , was tried , and acquitted . During seven years , Loyola remained in Paris . His life there was one of poverty , struggle , patient toil , and earnest study . It was the life that had been revealed to him during that first evening on Montmartre ; to which hill he frequently retired for prayer and meditation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to enter . To reclaim the sinful was one of his chief aims , and no suffering , no labor , deterred him from it . Having long tried to turn one from licentiousness by reason and persuasion , he at length placed himself one evening by the side of the road along // 425 The Founder of the Jesuit8. which the offender was to pass , plunged to the neck in a half-frozen pond ; and as the young man came near , there was heard , as from the earth , a voice picturing God 's punishment for sin . Startled by such sounds in the partial darkness , the youth trembled and stopped . " It is I , " said Ignatius ; and , as the terrified and conscience-stricken man crept to the water 's edge and peered through the gloom at him , he continued , " And here will I suffer , 0 sinner , for your sins ! Go , gratify your lust . " But his darling purpose was the realization of that dream which for ten years had haunted him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlist disciples to aid him in the work . Through six long , silent years he labored , and for every year could count one convert . It was in February , 1528 , that he reached Paris ; in August , 1534 , in the suhterranean chapel of Montmartre , Ignatius , Xavier , Laynez , Salmeron , Bobadilla , Rodriguez , and Faher , bound themselves to the conversion of the infidels of Palestine , or , if they were not permitted to go thither , then to go whithersoever the Vicar of Jesus should send them . But while , with the enthusiasm of Jesuits , they bound themselves by that memorable vow , with the calm good sense of Jesuits , also , they deferred the execution of their purpose for two years and a half , in order to complete their studies . When Loyola himself went to Spain , early in 1535 , it was with the understanding , that his disciples would meet him in Venice , in 1537 . This act of Ignatius , his separation from his disciples for two years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we regard as one of the most characteristic of his life . It shows his coolness , his confidence , his power over his companions , his justice , and his self-command , in the clearest manner . Any but a master-mind , which , after so many years of fruitless toil , found itself on the brink of apparent success , would have urged immediate action , and have watched the new converts with jealous eyes , lest they should have forgotten all the past in ( Ireams of the future . Loyola delayed the execution of his cherished scheme , left his disciples to the snares and dangers of Paris and the world , and turned his steps homeward , to repair , before he left Europe for ever , the wrongs of his youth in his native neighbourhood . He reached that neighbourhood , and took // up his abode at a hospital in Aspeytia , near by the castle of his fathers . To that castle , however , he was asked in vain . In vain was he tempted by rich meats , sent from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He preached on the open hill-side to the thousands that flocked to hear him ; he founded charities ; he broke up the gaming-houses he stripped , by his eloquence , the rich ornaments of the women from their heads ; and publicly asking pardon of one to whom , when young , he had done a wrong , gave him two farms as a partial compensation for what he had suffered . It was no wonder that such a man , in that age and land , was able " to do what he pleased " ; and was followed , almost worshipped , as a miracle-working saint . Having in this manner hidden farewell to his birthplace , about the end of 1535 lie repaired to Venice , there to await his companions . They came , earlier than was anticipated by some weeks , on the 8th of January , 1537 . This they did because of the war then raging between France and the Emperor . When they reached the place of embarkation , though they found their leader there prepared to set forward to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the Turks and Christians , which continued through that year . Loyola , we say , was ready to go forward ; during the year which he had passed in Venice , new views had , probably , been unfolded to him ; but he had not in the least abandoned his determination to aim first at the rescue of that land where Jesus taught and died . During that year , he had become acquainted , had lived and labored , with Gianpietro Caraffa , afterwards Paul the Fourth , the chief of the Theatines , and one of the most eloquent , violent , self-willed , self-sacrificing , in short , thoroughly Roman Catholic , rulers by whom the Universal Mother was ever governed . From him Loyola caught something , but not much ; and even in receiving this , he refused so much more , that he made the future Pope his enemy ; so openly his enemy , that , when the missionaries for Palestine thought proper to ask the ruling pontiff for his blessing on their enterprise , it was judged best by Ignatius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to ask 14 . That blessing , through the good offices of Peter Ortiz , who represented the injured Catharine of England at the court of Rome , was given ; and those who were yet laymen having been ordained as priests , they waited // for the new year to open the way to Palestine . If it was not open by the close of the year , then their vow bound them to follow the Pope 's behests . They waited , not in idleness and luxury , but in hospitals , prisons , and hermitcells . Labor and suffering , self-denial and self-sacrifice , were not words and resolutions , but acts , with those men . But they waited in vain ; the path was closed , and now another career opened before them . It was at Vicenza that Ignatius met his companions , who had been scattered through various cities on their deeds of mercy . Forty years of constant effort and exposure had matured the expression of that calm , commanding countenance , upon which not a shade of disappointment or regret could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great purpose of his life . When he bade the castle of Loyola farewell in 1522 , tears stood upon his cheek ; when he abandoned Palestine , his lip trembled ; when tyrannized over at Alcala and Salamanca , his eye flashed fire ; but years had done their work , and in the spirit of true faith and resignation , he now pointed out to his followers the way which God had opened for them . It was not Palestine , but the whole wide world , that was to be their field ; it was not the Mohammedans , but all heretics , all pagans , all sinners , whom they were to convert and bring into the fold of the Saviour . As he spoke , the visions of his youth returned upon Loyola ; he saw again , as at Manresa , the opposing camps of Jesus and Satan ; he heard again that voice of divine melody , which had so often given him strength in his trials , and saw Mary herself smile upon him . " Brothers , " he said , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are The Company of Jesus ' ; he is our Captain , and , battling under him , we will drive back the heretics of Germany , and carry the gospel to the farthest East , and to the new-found heathen of the West . " They listened as to a prophet ; they felt the presence of Jesus in the midst of them , sanctioning the words of their elder brother ; they received the spirit of faith which enabled them to fulfil the prophecy . Ignatius , Laynez , and Faber went at once to Rome , to offer the services of the Company to the Pope . The others divided themselves among the Universities of Italy , to aid the youth in the pursuit of heavenly wisdom . They bound themselves to live in hospitals , and upon alms ; to receive // no money ; to preach with apostolic plainness ; to teach children ; to aid all men ; and to obey one another in turn . The chief and his two companions were received with kindness at Rome ; their works had gone before them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished men ; the others were appointed to teach in the University . From that time , Rome became the residence of the founder of the Jesuits ; sometimes in disgrace , sometimes persecuted , once tried , and through perjury almost condemned , he still lahored to assist the suffering , and to perfect the outline of that order which it was now agreed should be founded by the members of the Company of Jesus . The spirit had been breathed into them at Viceuza , the form was taken at Rome ; and after long examinations and debates , after prayer and fasting on the part of the comrades , and struggles to resist them on the part of those who feared all change , it was at last approved by the Holy Father on the 27th of September , 1540 . In that year , the cause of Luther received two wounds the bigamy of Philip of Hesse , half-sanctioned by the Reformers ; and the foundation of the " Society of Jesus . " The order being sanctioned , a general was to be chosen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not he that any other than Loyola would be chosen general , and though he resisted the choice , it was clear that his resistance must yield . At length , on Easter day , 1541 , he acquiesced in the unchanging wish of his followers . On the following Friday , this now triumphant enthusiast , who for twenty years had labored for that day , walked with his little band through the streets of Rome , visited the seven churches , received and gave the communion , took the vows of poverty , chastity , and obedience , and bound himself and his brethren to go wherever the Pope should order , and to teach little children the Christian doctrine . To this last duty Ignatius at once devoted himself , and through forty days the church of Santa Maria de Strata was filled with curious and awe-struck listeners ; - the noble , the rich , the beautiful , learned divines , and venerable teachers , were there , catching with eagerness the broken Italian of the Spanish saint , as he expounded the catechism to the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most part men and women wept , or smiled through their tears , as they // heard the heart-felt , heart-reaching accents of him who had studied divinity so profoundly in the great school of life . Nor did the active benevolence of Loyola prove less when he possessed power , than when he was borne down by poverty and weakness . He still visited the prison , the sick-bed , and the poor man 's hovel ; he labored to convert the Jews , to reclaim the vicious , and to ward off danger from those yet uncorrupted . He founded institutions and asylums in pursuance of his designs ; but the two great objects of his life thenceforward were , to complete the Constitutions of his society , and to fulfil the weighty duties which devolved upon him as its first general . The Constitutions of Loyola are worthy of deep study they unfold his plans , and reveal his spirit . They should be investigated by every student of associated action , and in many points we believe they are worthy of imitation . Let us examine them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight the battles of Jesus , and to conquer the enemy of Christ and man . His followers were to do this first in themselves , and then in others ; remembering , that every blow struck for another 's salvation helped to secure their own , provided the act was done in the spirit of Christian love . To attain these two ends , self-sanctification and the good of others , Ignatius saw that there was needed less of solitary contemplation , and more of active labor and benevolence , than was to be found in the other orders of Christendom . He saw , too , that the true field for action was education , in its widest sense ; and that the instruction and edification of the young especially was the best method of securing a hold upon the adult population of the world . With equal clearness , he perceived the immense advantage to be gained by occupying those portions of the world , which as yet lay in heathen darkness . The faith of the Western Church was truth to him ; the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread its power was to spread the power of the gospel . In farther India , in remote Peru , he would lay foundations broad and deep for the Church to rest upon securely , even when , in Europe , the earth rocked under her . With these two great instruments , the education of the young and the conversion of the heathen world , he would combine the power derived through the confessional , and the moral influence growing out of self-sacrificing charity . Aid // ed by these , he knew his followers might preach to good purpose , and lay hold of the springs of life in their hearers . But how could men be found capable of such labors as were to be required even of the privates in that Company of Jesus ? They were to be made ; to be made at once perfectly obedient and perfectly self-sustaining . They were not to be machines , but men ,  --  and yet men acting with the unity , the regularity , the unconsciousness , of the various parts of a machine . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order , and were to pursue those purposes with the devotion due to individual ends . They were to annihilate themselves , and yet develope every faculty and taste to the utmost . They were to combine the characters of the religious recluse the devoted missionary , the finished scholar , the polished gentleman , and the Christian man of the world ; to respect no claims , to regard no rules , which interfered with the purposes of the order ; for these were God 's purposes , far above all other claims and human regulations . Such was the problem before Ignatius , to make such men . He and his successors solved it ; they made men who , in union , could do more for good or evil than any others the world has ever seen ; and who did more good when the true purpose was in view , and more evil when a false one usurped its place . They attained success , first , by choosing the right material , and rejecting every one who might begin , but could not go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the musket at the armory , and only those who were beyond all question were kept . Secondly , he who entered the society was to abandon every thing beyond it ; to hold no converse with the world , except under a superior 's eye to hate father , and mother , and all , for the sake of Jesus . Thirdly , the whole course of education for the order was calculated , like that of a military school , to secure perfect obedience , - that peculiar loss of individuality which is seen among soldiers , with whom the corps is every thing , and the man is nothing . Fourthly , exercises were contrived which caused each member to learn his own resources and rely upon them , - to cultivate and know every power he possessed . The Jesuits were like an army drilled to the last degree in unity of action , and yet so that every man among them could sustain the duties of a partisan warrior . And fifthly , the discipline which was to devel // ope the youth into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardened , not to be changed . But Loyola saw that all must not be of one rank , or bound to the same duties . He established , therefore , four grades first , professed fathers , bound to live by alms , and to go on missions ; secondly , spiritual coadjutors , without individual property , but provided for by college revenues ; these were the instructers ; thirdly , the scholars , or Jesuits in the process of development ; and fourthly , the temporal coadjutors , who retained their property , and assisted witheut recompense in the administration of the society . At the centre of this body sat the general , receiving , as through electric telegraphs , news from every quarter ; a despot , whose will seemed almost omnipotent , whose eye was on every member in the farthest isles of the Indian sea , and yet who was himself watched and ruled , and who was absolute only within the prescribed circle of his power . If he went beyond that circle , he was warned ; and if the warning was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlines of those Constitutions , which , with prayer and praise , and , as he believed , under the inspiration of God , Ignatius drew up ; which he submitted to the chier men of the society , and left to be approved by the first general congregation that should meet . Into the history of the order we do not propose to enter ; but one remark is worthy of a place here , - that the evils of Jesuitism did not appear until the Constitutions had been practically changed , the plan of Loyola violated , and the balance of power overthrown . Ignatius lived fifteen years at the head of the society which he had founded . He died in 1556 , at the age of sixty-five . Luther had died just ten years before . In the latter portion of Loyola 's life , we see a man calm and firm as Washington , ruling with the energy and the success of a narrow , but mighty , mind . Obedience was his watchword ; he who had obeyed others required others to obey him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct and will should comply , but that the mind should deem that course true and right which the superior determined to he true and right . He withstood popes , cardinals , and kings , when they came within his province , as resolutely as Luther , and with far more dignity . He would not allow his followers // to receive any high office in the Church , but required devotion , entire devotion , to the order they had joined . Novelties he hated and abjured ; he was the man of the past , of the ages of blind faith , passive obedience , and pattern excellence ; as Luther was the man of the future , of the ages of destruction , and doubt , and disobedience , and progress . Rapidly and widely Loyola saw his order spread . At his death , it existed in fourteen provinces ; hundreds of its members were laboring in India , America , and Africa , and millions of souls were under its sway . In the very year that he died , it became fixed at Cologne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestants , on the field where the Reformation had triumphed , saw themselves surrounded by papal forces far different from the lazy monks whom Luther , and Erasmus , and Hutten warred against . Then the enthusiast prepared himself to die in triumph . God had granted his prayer , had rolled back the tide of heresy , and won new lands for Christendom . We can see him on that night of the 30th of July , when all had left him , and when , filled with the conviction that his end was close at hand , he bent for the last time before his Maker , giving thanks for the victory which Jesus had secured to his faithful soldiers . And as he looked back and scanned the life of which he was so soon to give an account , his idle youth , his laborious manhood , his successful old age , did Ignatius find himself a hypocrite ? Never , we believe , did a man 's heart acquit him more entirely of that crime than did Loyola 's . He saw his folly , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he knew that he had sincerely , heartily , laboriously , striven to advance the cause of the Church ; and as the body failed , and the remembrance of that other death-night in the ancestral castle , when Peter had appeared to him , rose upon his soul , the calm , stern old man became a visionary youth again . The mountains of his boyhood rose about him ; the pebbly brooks he had sat by , reading romances , again gurgled in his ear . The unknown maiden , to whose service he had mentally devoted himself , came by upon her palfrey ; his heart was yet young , and far purer than when Peter healed him by a touch . rhen , death stood by him , a dreaded and ghastly form from below ; now , it was an angel stooping from above to receive him . In his excited mind , the bubbling brook , the maiden 's // laugh , changed to the hymns of blessed spirits , and the form of his early lady-love became that of his true Mistress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day broke over the Eternal City . It was scarce sunrise , when the fathers came to visit their superior . The color had left his lips , his pulse just moved , but his eye was calm and full of light . They put cordials to his mouth , but he woule not taste them . They would have sent for the physicians ; but he , by gesture , forbade them . They knelt by his bedside , they heard the death-rattle , and they marked the life leaving the eye . One word his faint lips fashioned , and faintly it echoed through the room , as if spirits had repeated it ; it was the name of his Great Captain , " Jesus " ; before the echo ceased , Ignatius Loyola had passed to another world . What , then , was this man ? He was one based upon sincerity , above all things ; narrow and stationary , fanciful and fanatical , a deep faith still worked in every thing he did and wrote . He was not a man of vast intellect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without convincing men , obliged them to yield by force of will and nerve of character . His institution was not the result of long meditation and profound ambition , but sprang from circumstances , from the inability of the Companions to reach Palestine , and the experience of their leader during that winter in Venice spent with Caraffa . Its success came from the sincerity of the men who formed it . Less true and devoted , they would have received the honors of the Church ; they would have refused such utter devotion to their order ; they would have rebelled against the despotic power of the general . The Constitutions of the Jesuits were less the result of the wisdom of thought , than of the wisdom of devotedness . Laynez was a man of thought , and did much toward perfecting the Constitutions ; but their great features were from the soldier Ignatius . The truth of this view will he seen in the history of the order ; for when selfishness took the place of self-sacrifice , the Constitution* were changed , the general was stripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members , as it no longer served to forward their individual ends ; the honors of the Church were received , worldliness took the place of sincerity , and Jesuitism was without power . Lastly , Loyola was a conservative , attached to the past . 37* // Forms he was ready enough to violate ; but the substance of old things , the excellencies of the middle time , he clung to with desperation ; and lest he should lose them , he clung also to its follies and its evils . He was a man of one idea , and this idea was , like that of Hildebrand , to bring all things , temporal and spiritual , physical and intellectual , into submission to the will of God , and to the Roman Church . This design may be ascribed to ambition ; but look at the life of Loyola up to the year 1538 , and where are there plans which show ambition ? Yet he had then been laboring sixteen years . And what shall we say of the institution which he founded ? The end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for what can be higher than the sanctification of the human race and the spread of Christianity ? Though we think Loyola 's Christianity was but gross superstition , this judgment can not affect our estimate of his design . It may he said , also , that the means proposed for gaining the end were admirable , for their efficiency has been attested by their success . And what may be done by Protestants in this country to stop the growth of Jesuitism ? Shall they try to preach or write it down ? To vote or burn it down will hardly be openly advocated as the true method . To us the proper course seems to be this ; to found better schools , and to seek out more self-sacrificing laborers , more earnest missionaries , more persuasive preachers . Let Protestantism quit scolding , and live out a better Christianity than Romanism and Jesuitism , and these latter can not succeed . But if they form the church militant , while Protestantism continues to be only the church termagant , the power and the growth will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
