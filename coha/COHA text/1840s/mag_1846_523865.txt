txt TIrE great difficulty in political , as in religious , polemics is to " be just and fear not " - whether in relation to one 's own party or their opponents . it is not easy to withstand the pressure from around of the multitude that are always struggling to get the farthest possible in the advance ; and many are seduced into extremity of argument , from the apparent strength , and credit for boldness , which extreme positions give to those who most eagerly occupy them . The numbers are great , moreover , of such as imagine that moderate views imply weakness of character , and that loud and positive assertions are indicative not only of power but of security-borrowing the old war-maxim , that half the effectiveness of a fortress lies in the formidable front it can be made to bear . We have endeavored to showourselves not of this class . From the commencement of this Review , we have sought to make it evident to the country , that-as in literature , and morals , and social interests , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forged before we were born , but are ready to entertain the possible necessities.of change in the forms of thought-so in politics , we engage in no mere partisan warfare , but take our stand on high national questions , considerations of general and abiding importance , yielding ourselves , in the great tide of human affairs , to the current of a wise and constitutional progress . Believing that the views of the Whig Party , in relation to the public interests , are mainly just , their movements honorable and salutary-that , as a body , they are conservative without binding themselves to the past , progressive without destroying-we have taken our stand unalterably with them . So doing , however , we have not held ourselves bound to see no good in any opinions or actions of our opponents . If their courses will really bear the tests of virtue and utility , it shall be sufficient to insure our regard . Acting otherwise , the Journal we have estltblished with some care and labor were worthy of being despised to-day , and of sinking to-morrow . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in some good degree , followed out this course of calm and evenhanded justice . It was certainly in this spirit that the Oregon question was discussed in our Inst number . On that subject , indeed , it was less difficult to take such ground , since the Oregon controversy was a question purely national , in which , regarding the just maintenance of our rights , the views of the American peol ) le were nearly unanimous , and which should never have been dragged into the arena of party politics . For so attempting to monopolize it for future political ef VOL . III . // fect , gambling with the common anxiety and interest of the country , the Administration , and especially the leaders of the party supporting it , were , in that argument , severely censured . And they were censured alone . For it.cannot be pretended that the Whig party at the Baltimore convention , or at any time before or since , in Congress or out of Congress , made even an incipient movement towards employing this question for political purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Administration party did not so employ it . The whole country knows it to be the case , and many of the public journals in their own interest have borne witness to the fact . The war-speeches , also-valiant and seasonable-of ambitious orators and presidential aspirants , were somewhat distant from our approbation . I3ut aside from these , we spoke , according to our convictions , of many things to be commended in the position of the Administration in this controversy - it being , in fact ( after the renewed offer of the 49th degree ) the position of the country . We especially commended the argument of the Secretary of State , which , on the question of original naked title , ( apart from reasonable rights arising from circumstance ) we held to be unanswerable . We supported that argument , particularly in relation to the Spanish title , by collateral reasonings against the sophistical attacks of the English press , and what we could not help considering the mistaken views of the venerable and learned ex-diplomatist , Albert Galiatin . Of the motives  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , in the very next move , offering to yield four-ninths of it , we said nothing sincerely desiring that on a great national question , our government , of whatever party , should appear to stand well before the world . Thus much , then , of justice , at that position of affairs . We are now disposed to exercise the attribute- " lex summa moralium " - still further . It is a quality , we are aware , less generally appreciated by them than mercy , notwithstanding that they stand in about equal need of the two . But we shall be rewarded in the exercise itself . We will even be liberal : we will endeavor to lay open the entire policy of the Party and its Executive , so that the whole country shall be able to admire . To effect this satisfactorily , it will be necessary to refer to statements and positions employed in our arguments on the question in the last number . We shall not dwell upon them , but simply advert to such as will serve to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , another object in view , and that is , to state some points for our title itself more clearly than was done in the former article . We begin , then , with reiterating our opinion , that the argument of the Secretary of State respecting the superiority of the American claim , considered as an abstract title , based on the conventional admissiohs of international law , remains impregnable . We have seen no counterstatement in foreign journals even tending successfully to overthrow it . On this side of the Atlantic several arguments have been constructed against itespecially against the validity of the Spanish title-from well-informed and most able pens . These have , of course , come from the Whig side of politics . We do not regret it . It is well that the strong , inquiring and fearless minds of the Whig party should be divided on such a question . A corresponding phase of things has been seen on the opposite side . Many intelligent writers and journals belonging to the party in power , have taken the ground , that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel . This division has taken place on both sides , because men have felt that it is a national question , and ought to be lifted out of the mud and fog of partisan politics into an atmosphere where one can breathe with some freedom , and find that not all political illumination comes from one direction . Who could regret such a result ? And if the division of Whig opinions on the subject has at all tended to this , we rejoice at it . In none of these arguments , however , has the American title been on the whole successfully invalidated . A skillful writer in the North American Review , following the able disquisition in the Edinburgh , attempted to show , that neither nation has a ground of claim sufficient to base a title of absolute possession to any part of Oregon , so that there can be nothing in the way of making between them any kind of partition of the territory . Now we are not disposed to deny that the conventional canons which nations have agreed upon respecting the territorial rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupancy , and prescription , have , from the very first , been open ( in the wide application // allowed them ) to various objections . They were all , primarily , of slight foundation , vague , and unsatisfactory , as compared with the guaranties of individual rights by civil law , or in comparison with many other received international regulations . how far discovery of a coast could confer a right to the vast interior of a continent  --  to what distance the claim by first discovery and exploration of a river could extend beyond the head-waters of that river , or whether at all-what length of time must pass before a right of prior discovery is lost by neglect to occupy-what period of years , during which a claim put forth by a nation is not objected to , can give a title by prescription  --  to what extent occupancy at one point of a coast , or inland , can *stablish a right to contiguous portions of territory , and how far the general principle of contiguity gives a people possessing one unoccupied region a claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which exists elsewhere -- all these points were exceedingly undefined , and left to be determined very much by circumstance and sufferance . They were also , to some degree , contradictory . A claim resting on discovery and exploration of a line of coast might , in many cases , conflict with one reposed on disc*very and exploration of a large river , whose course , either of the main stream or of its branches , should , at the distance of two or three hundred miles inland , run parallel with the coast . In other cases , sovereignty extending over a large region on the principle of contiguity , might encroach on territory claimed by a nation occupying some single point or two on a coast or river of that region . Nor can it be denied , that all these conventional rules were laid down by Christian nations with a singular disregard to the fact , whether any savage tribes , or how populous , might for centuries have inhabited the coasts or rivervalleys , islands , or continents , which they so coolly partitioned among themselves , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intended for all who live on it . There are not , indeed , forcible arguments wanting for the doctrine , that the law of progress-improvement-is the only law which the Human destinies can acknowledge ; that savagery , therefore , must be subject to civilization , and the wilderness can be left for wild tribes to roam over no longer than till it is *vanted for the uses of cultivated society . Still , we confess we should be glad to know at what grade of barbarism the dividing line is to be drawn , across which the civilized foot can not step upon an occupied soil as it it had no owner . If the savages of North America , of Southern Africa , ' of New Zealand , of Australia , whose simple arts had not , extended beyond the bow and arrow , the stone kettle , the feathered dress , and the tent of skins , could be subjected to English sway without hesi*tation and as a matter of course , why should English writers be troubled that the Spanish dominion was with like indifference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peru , whose inhabitants had attained to but certain forms of a sombre and barbaric civilization ; or that the French are wetting the Desert with the blood of Abd-elKader 's indomitable Arabs , because the Desert should be civilized ; or that the Czar of Russia is sending his armies to ' make the half-cultivated mountaineers of Circassia acquainted with Russian refinement ? Why should not the English Government , having subdued , with a due mixture of craft and carnage , all the provinces of Lower India , finish the bloody reduction of Nepaul among the mountains , and then advance , with the complaisance of a nation that is doing its duty , upon Mahometan Persia on the one hand , upon the spacious empires of heathen Burmah and Siam on the other , or commence a better order of things in Tartaric China ? Or what should hinder the " Holy Alliance " from proceeding to their intended partitioning of Turkey , whose mosques , palaces , populous cities and manufactures do not quite redeem her from the reproach of barbarism ? The Hottentots of the Cape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step above these are the ice-housing Esquimaux of Labrador amid the Polar Sea ; one step above these the miserable Root-diggers of the Pacific Coast ; one or two removes from these , the hunting tribes of the Prairies and the Atlantic regions-tentbuilders and planters of Maize ; while all the Indian races of the North were considerably less advanced in modes of living than the Mobilian tribes formerly inhabiting along time Gulf : - if superior to these in knowledge and the arts of life , the Araucanians of Chili were yet inferior to the Peruvians and Mexicans ; these to the inhabitants of India ; these , in some respects , to the Chinese , who , also , on the whole , are decidedly less civilized than the Persians , the Turks , and the ancient Moors . Where , then // shall the dividing line he drawn ? Shall it depend upon the amount of population , whether a people can consider as its own the territory it inhabits ? But the confusion of lines here is greater than among degrees of barbarism . Some of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied a limited soil ; others , in small and scattered hands , wandered over immense regions of wilderness . The Mexicans and Peruviar*s were populous nations , living in citie* , and cultivating nearly all the country they possessed ; while large portions of Turkey and Persia are nearly as destitute of inhabitants as were the wildest parts of North America : and India and China , again , are the most crowded countries of the Globe . Perhaps , then , to profess the Christian religion may entitle a governinent to overrun , despoil , and appropriate the territory and homes of a people whom Heaven has seen fit to leave a little longer in darkness ! But all such objections are nothing here . The original injustice , or defectiveness and uncertainty , of the conventional principles so long admitted by civilized nations , as pertaining to the discovery and occupation of new countries , it is quite too late now for them to regard in controversies among themselves . The laws which Christendom has laid down , Christendom , within itself , must abide by ; unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole system , because that government which has taken advantage of its indefinite provisions seven times as often as any other , finds it possible , in a present case , to do better xvitliout it . But if these principles were ever fit to he employed , or are not now to be suddenly abrogated , we affirm that there has never been a case in which they could niore clearly apply , than in the Oregon question . Every one of the received grounds of claim exists here , except legitimate occupancy . And they are found , on a just consideration , to be of unusual distinctness . Some one natioii , it is clear , must have made the first discoveries on that coast ; unless two had chanced to make the same or equal discoveries at the same time-which , we know , was not the case ; and a title resting upon them , provided they were published to the world , must , it is equally evident , have belonged to that nation . That there is a claim by contiguity is manifest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case border , contertninously , on the entire region of Oregon . By treaty , also , between us and Spain , there is a ground of title of great importance , unless the validity of the Spanish claim , not only as exclusive , but as to any portion of that territory , can be entirely done away ; and we showed , in our argument on this question , that Spain ( if driven to such a reliance ) could also advance a title by two centuries of prescription . To urge , then , that there is no title at all for any party  --  or other than the very feeble one " by contiguity " - is simply absurd , unless we choose to fling aside , for the occasion , all the principles of international law touching such questions . We shall not repeat the evidences respecting the preponderance of claims on these grounds , between Englammd and the United States . They were set forth at some length in our last number ; and it was shown conclusively , we think , that nearly every point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spaniards first discovered the Pacific Ocean , in 1513 ; that as early as 1542 they had explored , by Governmental authority , the whole coast from Panama northward to the 41st , more probably to the 43u1 parallel , which is one degree within the actual limits of Oregon ; that beyond the doubt of any intelligent student in geographical history , De Fmica , in 1592 , discovered and sailed through the Straits , which have ever since borne his name , separating Vancouver 's Island from the continent ; that they had established settlements at several points , as high up as the shores of California ; that though they occupied no part of the coast farther north , and made no additional explorations , for nearly two centuries , yet they constantly asserted a claim to regions northward , on the ground of contiguity of sea-coast to the parts already explored and occupied-which claim was never called in question , by other nations , in the way of practical denial , ( as alone it could legitimately have been done , ) no foreign vessel venturing forbidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during all this period , once entering those seas ; that this long period of sulThrance of an asserted claim gave them that title by prescrz*ption which they had lost by neglect to occupy ; that , even throwing aside all these grounds of sovereignty in that re*ion , the fnct , that at the end of this longa interval , the Spanish Government sent out th*ee different expeditions , for the express purpose of exploring the whole northern coast-which expeditions // did explore , and make most important discoveries , as high up as the 58th parallel , three and four years before any English or other foreign vessel appeared on the coast at all-estahlishing for Spain a claim , certainly incontestible , unless the principle of right , by prior discovery , he utterly denied ; and finally , that the Nootka Sound Treaty , ratified in 1792 , ( only seven years alter these discoveries , ) has not a single phrase or word , which can be construed into a relinquishment of the Spanish sovereign title ; hut simply concedes certain hunting and trading privileges-rigorously withheld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that purpose , ( that is , the use of the country , ) the express terms being , that " the sovereignty shall he in abeyance , " thus plainly leaving that abstract title to he as valid , after any ( reasonable ) term of years , as it was before the Convention took place . This was the argument for our right through Spain , and we have not , as yet , seen any objections successfully invalidating it . Mr. Gallatin , indeed , in his recent able letters published in Washington , affirms that England did practically question and deny the exclusive Spanish claim to the Pacific Coast , by making the colonial charters which she granted , in the seventeenth century , along the Atlantic , extend across the continent to the " South Seas , " that is , to the Pacific Ocean . What a " practical questioning " , was that ! To stretch a vague pretensionon the vaguest of all principles , indefinite contiguity-for an unknown distance-across a continent of wilderness - three thousand miles of forests , rivers and mountains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hers had ever coasted , hut where another nation had already planted settlements not many leagues below the point where the lowest of these grants would strike the coast , and had explored to a higher parallel ( the 43d ) than would bound the highest ! The granting of those indefinite charters is , in fact , among the most absurd things in all history . it is only to be compared , in ridiculousness , with the pope 's bull , which has been so much ridiculed , and , in truth , bears a strong likeness to it . Nor is it of any more account , that Queen Elizabeth declared to the Spanish ambassador , Mendozn , * that " this imaginary propriety sovereignty could not hinder other princes from transporting colonies into those parts where the Spaniards inhabit not , foiasmuch as prescription without possession is little worth . " These things are mere forms , words . The question is , why , for two hundred and fifty years , vessels were not sent into those seas colonies planted ? legitimate ascendancy made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a practical denial of exclusive claim , amounting to something . Is it said , that the establishment of Meares , at Nootka Sound , 1788 , f was an attempt to do this ? or is to be looked upon as virtually doing it ? But this came too late to be legitimate . To say nothing of the title by prescription , which so long sufferance had now perfected , Spain , we repeat , had just completed such important discoveries along the whole coast , ( prior to any made by England , ) as in themselves gave her a new and perfect title . We can not , indeed , repress our surprise , that this , the most important point of all , should be so constantly and willfully overlooked by the assailers of that title . We again assert , that if a claim by prior discoveries be not worthless , the three distinct explorations of Perez , Heceta and Bodega , surveying many parts of the coast , from California to the 58th parallel , in the years 1774 , 1775-Cook arriving there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overturned ; and that England appears to us , in that controversy , to have been utterly in the wrong . It was her power , and Spain 's weakness , which made that dispute end as it did . England is often magnanimous ; but she has never refused to extend her dominion-most of all , her commerce ; and the most ambitious and grasping of all her ministers , William Pitt , was then at the head of affairs . It is simply asked , what would Great Britain have done , had she been in Spain 's place ? The answer needs not to be intimated . One other point has been raised . It is urged ( in the Edinburgh Review and elsewhere ) that the Spanish title , when made over to us by treaty , in 1819 , had then become invalidated by " non-user , " or neglect to occupy . We see not how this can be . It must of course depend * Campden 's Elizabeth , year 1583. t In the article last month , we made the mistake , p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meare 's establishment , reading 78 instead of 88. // on the length of time necessary to destroy an original title by non-occupation . Now the only date to be reckoned from 5 , necessarily , that of the Nootka Treaty ( 1792 ) when the rights of Spain were put forth by her , and to some extent admitted by England .. But in 1815 we began to negotiate with Spain for her title - pending which transaction , of course , she would abstain from settling the coast . Are twenty-three years time enough for a nation to lose all hold on a valuable territory , because not choosing for a while to settle it ? Surely not . And especially not in this case ; since , by that treaty , no settlements by the English in the mean time could confer any territorial rights on them  --  and still more , because that period of twenty-three years was more confused and turbulent , more filled with mighty and terrible wars , hindering all the arts and occupations of peace , than almost any period of the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by discovery and exploration of the Columbia River , it is most evident to every one that we have strong grounds here for holding a part of Oregon , whether the Spanish title be worth anything or not . To declare the former of no avail because we assert the latter , is undoubtedly preposterous : if left as our only groundin which case alone , however , could it be urged to its full value-it would justly give us as high , at least , as the 49th degree and De Fuca 's Straits . The facts and arguments on these points are so plain , they need not be enumerated . We have reiterated this full corroboration of Mr. Buchanan 's general statement-with a purpose . We are unwilling , for one , that the country should in any degree discredit the broadest title which , on abstract grounds , under the law of nations , can justly be made out for us . If there are just grounds of title to be urged by the opposing claimant under the same received law of nations ; if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but under a far better one , the law of reasonable right-which unquestionably there are , and which we , with our new institutions , new thoughts , new policy , are peculiarly the people to acknowledge ; - let these things , in any practical disposition of the question , be carefully weighed , li6erally allowed-hut let us not fail to place on record before the world the original preponderance of the grounds of our claim . But the chief reason at present in thus justifying and strengthning the abstract argument of the Honorable Secretary of State and the Administration , is to show the greater height of the position from which they have fallen ! More closely to 6bserve the exact nature of that position , we will state succinctly the actual rights of England , also , in the Oregon region . if our previous arguments have been correct , she has very little to urge of abstract , positive claims-very few original grounds of title to the soil-corresponding to those which the Americans unquestionably possess . She has none by occupancy , since the Nootka compromise ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting , with " settlements , " that is , posts , for that purpose-such as the Fur Company have had there ever since  --  but left " the sovereignty in abeyance . " She has none by treaty , since that same Nootka compromise was the only treaty she ever made touching that region-except the repeated conventions of joint occupancy entered into with us , which , of course , left the " sovereignty " just where it was before . That she should have any by prescr*ption , is necessarily out of the case , since her earliest knowledge of the country dates only from Cook 's voyage to that coast , in 1778 . Her sources of title must , then , be reduced to two-contiguity and discovery . The former she can allege , because her Canadian territory stretches west to the Rocky Mountains , and therefore lies over against a portion of 0 egon-that part , namely , above the 49th degree , as that parallel was the boundary agreed upon with Great Britain , in 1818 , between our territory and hers , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim is , indeed , of les value than our own below the 49th degree , since the nearest settlement in Canada is a thousand miles Iarther from Oregon than are our western frontiers , and the necessary and consequent force of this ground of claim is always affected by the greater or less proximity of a nation 's inhabited soil to the region in dispute . It must , also , meet the force of the Spanish title , which , if valid , covers the whole coast , and extending inland , would reasonably reach back to the Rocky Mountains . But this opposition of claims does not hinder each from having its force under the law of nations-f r , as we remarked above , the conventional principles of that law were from the first indefinite and contradictory , so that a claim by contiguity must often // conflict with another based on discovery . Here , then  --  a point to which we did not allow sufficient weight in our former article-England has , if not a preponderant claim , yet a reasonable consideration in her favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , we tacitly allowed in offering , as early as 1818 , to let the same boundary of the 49th degree continue over the mountains down to the Pacific . Great Britain , however , has a counter claim to the Spanish title , in the north of Oregon , superior to this . She discovered , explored , and occupied with trading-posts , ( before any American had been in that quarter , ) the second great river of Oregon-Frazer 's River-which runs from above the 54th degree southward ahout to the 49th degree , thus traversing nearly the whole of that region which so many other circumstances seem to have conspired to allow her . Undoubtedly , this claim , too , must meet the Spanish title , which , if valid , would certaii*ly extend to the distance of two or three hundred miles inland , and would thus cover the whole of the section traversed by that river . Still , it can not reasonably he left out of the account-especially as Spain never set a foot in the interior , from California to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called a case of the conflict of those indeterminate principles allowed to govern such questions , ( although f he discovery of the coast was prior hy some years to that of the river ; ) and all such cases furnish plain grounds for compromise . At any rate , to quote from our former article : " As the discovery and exploration of the Columbia must he , in the eyes of other nations , and of England herself , a most important consideration ' in our favor , supporting the exclusive Spanish title when assailed by England , so her discovery of Frazer 's River is a just considerations in her favor , against that title , as urged hy us . " But these absolute grounds of counterclaim are not those on which this nation should most readily concede to England a part of Oregon . By no legitimate colonization , indeed , but by a guarantied sufferance and privilege-determined in solemn treaty , before we owned the title - British subjects have been in undisturbed possession of all the northern part for a period of forty years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , hunting-interests , and various Tights of property , that can not be overlooked . What touches us more nearlywe have , ourselves , since acquiring that supposed exclusive title , admitted the same arrangement , leaving them joint tenants with us , with privileges of trade and settlement co-equal with our own ; we have , at three different times , renewed that arrangement ; we have , ourselves , again and again , for more than a quarter of a century , negotiated with England , to ascertain and settle conflicting rights-thus tacitly acknowledging that she has rights ; and we have made three offers to compromise , by a line that would leave her four ninths of the whole territory . We come now to the Administration . - Mr . Buchanan undoubtedly saw the force of these circumstances on the British side . He virtually acknowledged them , indeed , by renewing the offer of a division of cLaims  --  or " compromise , " as he prefers to call it-by the 49th parallel . As a lawyer and a politician , however-still more , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to say nothing about them of his own accord , but to show that they had no existence And it will be confessed , that partly from the stronger position on the American side of the question , partly from his creditable powers of reasoning , his argument was superior to any ever constructed on the part of England . We make no question , that-accompanied , as it was , with the evidence of a renewed proposal from us , to yield her a large portion of the country in dispute-the correspondence must have favorably impressed the European mind , not only with the preponderance of our claim , but with the liberality of our government . This impression must have been ( leepened by the additional fact , that the British Minister had rejected that offer , without even a reference to his government . Thus , then , the Administration and the country stood most favorably before the world on this question . With some unnecessary loudness of tone , at flrst , our government had yet committed no false step-had managed all by exposition and argument-had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even succeeded in placing its accredited agent in the wrong . How have they maintained this position ? A question which we would not seek to answer , but for a purpose above personal . or party spleen . It is unquestionable , as all have felt , that'Mr . Pakenham , in summarily rejecting the offer referred to , deserved all // the blame which Sir Robert Peel , in terms the more severe for their measured cour* tesy , has bestowed upon him , it is also evident that our government was right , under such circumstances , in withdrawing that offer : it was due to our national honor to do so . But the next movement was to be made by Great Britain . Accordingly , we find , from Sir Robert 's speech , that the British Government , unable to make Mr. Buchanan 's offer the basis of a new proposal of compromise on their part-as that offer had never been transmitted to them  --  and naturally unwilling to proceed without knowing what it was , yet anxious at once to settle a disastrous dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal to arbitrate . This , the Administration peremptorilyrefuse . Why ? From spleen , because the British Minister had as hastily rejected theirs ? We will absolve even Mr. Polk from an impulse so child - ish . Besides , other reasons were given , which-it is highly proper to consider ! Mr. Pakenham commences this second correspondence , with regretting , for his government , the failure of so many efforts to effect a friendly setttlement by negotiation-that from such a mode great advantages would doubtless have resulted to both parties-that , as it is , the most prudent , perhaps the only step , is to " refer the whole question of an equitable division of that territory , to an arbitration of some friendly sovereign or State " - that this step , it was hoped , would be viewed as a proof of the con-* fidence of England in the justice of her claim , yet of her readiness to incur the risk of a great sacrifice , for the preservation of peace  --  and that the proposal was " made in a spirit of moderation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Buchanan , in reply , objects that the British Government , in proposing to refer to arbitration the " equitable division , " that is , a partition , of Oregon , " assumed the fact , that the title of Great Britain to a portion of the territory is valid ; and thus take for granted the very question in dispute . " The title  --  the bare title alone should be referred . The proposition is accordingly rejected . Now the objection to this " objection " is , that it was quite too legal . Mr. Buchanan has not forgotten the bar : he can not fail to be guarded and finical ; he remembers that it is a lawyer 's maxim to " go for the whole and get what you can . " He was willing , therefore , to put forward a mere technical obstruction , neglecting the spirit of reasonable right in the matter-which is one of the greatest possible errors in a wise diplomacy . It was not , in fact , at all necessary for him to understand the term " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an original inherent title under the " law/of nations "  --  a prior sovereignty in the soil . No one has contended more strenuously than ourselves for the superior validityabstractly considered-of the SpanishAmerican claim . But that claim , as we ha veshown , is hampered with indumbrances , many of which our own government has from time to time helped to heap upon it . It is met by various " circumstances , " " considerations , " even partial counter-claims , advanced under the the same loose rules that apply to itself ; and it is on these grounds , we assert , that some sort of division of that country between us and England is " equitable " - or , in lieu of this , that the " reasonable rights " which have grown up there , in various ways , should be bought out . The .1-Ion . Secretary knew no better then , than he had known before , that Great Britain does claim a superior title to parts of Oregon ; he knew , too , that , on the grounds above named , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century been disputing , negotiating , making offers and counter-offers -- all referring to a division of that same territory-  --  the last of which olThrs came from his own hands ; he knew , therefore , in whatever form the question should come before an arbitrator-as naked title or terms of partition-. these considerations would guide the decision to the same result , granting a " division " - " equitable , " it should be hoped , thus presenting the very phrase he objects to ! Why did he not , then , accept the proposal at once , like a man whose logic is not too keen for his common sense ? As it is not to be expected , however , that the lawyer should be entirely lost in the Secretary of State , we would not find fault with this " nicety of eye , " were it not manifest that he raised the objection merely as a cover . To satisfy Mr. Buchanan 's " legal scruples , " the British Minister offered in reply , just what Mr. Buchanan had indicated . He offered to refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the arbitrator , however ,  --  in case of finding neither possessed of a perfect title to the whole-was to make a division " according to the just claims of each . " He suggests , moreover , that the reference might be made-not necessarily to a // government or crowned head , but to " a mixed commission , with an umpire appointed by common consent "  --  or to " a board , composed of the most distinguished civilians and jurists of the time . " To this noble proposition-tbe noblest which one nation could offer and another receive-one of the noblest , we may say , ever made in any age-what is Mr. Buchanan 's reply ? In that answer , we most painfully feel , he has not only not assumed the wise diplomatist-he has not even preserved tbe right-minded lawyer . It is an unexpected , unnecessary quibble , annexing a condition utterly unworthy in its origin and character , and useless in its results . This offer , says our Secretary , is exposed to the same " objection in point of fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last . For if the arbitrator finds neither party possessing a complete title to the whole , he shall assign to each a portion according to their seeming claims , which " might , and probably would , be construed into an intimation , if not a direct invitation to the arbitrator , to divide the territory between the parties . " " The title , and the title alone , can be submitted . " Arbitrators are " naturally desirous to please both parties " - " make a compromising award , " &amp;c . The proposal is accordingly rejected . Surely this is the absurdest mockery . Invitation to divide the territory ! Do we then really design to have the whole ? Have we for a quarter of a century been pretending to negotiate , to compromise , as a mere cover to an ultimate purpose ? throwing up straw to see how strong the wind is ? making a smoke instead of a " council-fire ? " And is it now the time to accomplish that purpose ? Did Mr. Buchanan ever dream , that we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he once imagined , that England does not believe in ber claim ? Past negotiations have failed : - does he yet hope to get the entire region by a skillful diplomacy ? - carefully to force it away from her ?  --  to soothe her into a soft relinquishment ? Does be suppose , moreoverdoes any reasoning man in this country , or in all Christendom , suppose , that any arbitrator or arbitrators , would , or should under the circumstances , do otherwise than award some kind of division of claims , or an equivalent for relinquished rights ? What , then , doeshe hope for ? What would he have ? - War ?  - -  If he wishes not this flagrant alternative , does be fear in arbitration some sacrifice , not to be thought of ? This he intimates at the end . Weak , pusillanimous , as it is , it stands the only colorable reason given . But it is utterly insufficient . " The United States bold the best title in existence to the whole . " The President , therefore , " can not consent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " can not deprive the Republic of all the good harbors on the coast . " Patriotic man ! He had already offered to give up half of them ! Could he have any reason to complain , if arbitration took away the same extent ? - Or , can he pretend to see the danger of losing more than that ? Certainly , for him or the Republic to fear such a result is equally preposterous , undignified , and unjust . If our claims are , on the whole , so strongly based , as Mr. Buchanan thinks them to be , as nearly the whole country is persuaded they are , how shall we insult Cbristendom with the doubtasserted , implied , or thought-that there is no Christian nation , nor any number of civil and judicial characters , in her limits , who would see the grounds of such claims , and do us justice ? And how would submitting " the title , and the title alone , " advance the settlement of difficulties a single step ? Were it to be decided that we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should still be forced to negotiate with Great Britain respecting those circumstantial rights which have grown up in that region through a period of forty years . We should only have submitted to long uncertainty and delay , to find ourselves at the end in practically the same position as before . We have a higher idea , than most persons seem to entertain , of the value of the Oregon territory and the Pacific harbors . Lying between the vast interior of this continent and Asia , that coast and its harbors hold a most important relation to the rest of North America . We know , too , that the most valuable harbors on the whole coast of Oregon ,  --  and among the finest waters in the world-are in De Fuca 's Straits , near the 49th0 . We confess , moreover , we should greatly prefer , with Mr. Pakenham , that this controversy had been settled by negotiation , for it is really a disgrace that two such nations should have negotiated so many years with " assurances of distinguished consideration , " yet come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method so constantly failing , all considerations pointed to arbitration-an alternative always honorable in cases that // can be litigated at all , and always acceptable to those who have not from the first determined to have " the whole . " Nothing , we are persuaded , could throw half so much doubt , in the minds of other nations , upon both the justice of our claims and our honesty , as this refusal to arbitrate ; and as to the probable result of that procedure , we make no question that the boundary awarded would have been that which all circumstances point out as the most reasonable and the only one-that which we have ourselves four times offered  --  the 49th parallel , deflected to the south at De Fuca 's Straits , so as to pass through the middle of those splendid waters , leaving the most ample harbors on both sides . But there is another and a higher reason than anything of profit , or loss , or common honor , personal to this country , why we could have wished that proposition , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilians , with an umpire " - from different countries-to settle such difficulties as have always heretofore engaged nations in war ! What a precedent ! What an epoch might thus have been created What an example would it have been to all time of the wisdom which might govern the world ! For our own part , we could have been willing to have yielded up even the harbors of De Fuca 's straits -- we had almost said the whole of Oregon . And this proposition came from a British statesman , and was rejected by an Amer-ican ! " Histori* decus est , " ( says Lord Bacon , in his treatise De aug. scien. , " concerning the advancement of knowledge , " ) " et quasi anima , ut cum eventis cause copulantur : - Jt is the ornament , and as it were the soul of history , that with results causes are connected . " We will endeavor , on this hint , to inquire out the reason of a movement for which no reason has been given . When the new Administration entered upon office , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost their availability for party effect . They dared not , just then , contemplate any material change in the Tariff , by a false avowal , of which in many parts of the country they had been raised to power . The Texas controversy was to all practical intents settled . The only question of public interest sufficient to create a general excitement and give a chance to strengthen party lines , was the Oregon dispute . it had been instinctively felt by demagogues , for some time-as vultures sailing against the wind smell carrion at a great distance-that there would prove to be a vast amount of political capital inherent in that question , under some form . The only thing wanted was a way to make it available-for which the Democracy are not usually at a loss . Accordingly , as early as the session of 1842 , they had begun in Congress to agitate for that l ) urpose . In the Baltimore Convention they made haste to seize upon it as their property . They summarily declared that " our " claim-that is , the people's-that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unquestionable . They might almost as well have declared that it was not questioned . What sudden wisdom had fallen on that body , or on any portion of that bodythe elite of " the masses " - that they gave utterance to loud and positive assertions on such a question ? There were undoubtedly some men in the country who had paid sufficient attention to the subject to discern very clearly its various relations , historical and international , though exceedingly complicated and demanding much abstruse research . But were there in all probability four such men in that select mixture ? We make no hesitation in doubting whether there were two whom either tnste or circumstances had led to the laborious study necessary to a mastery of the question . But what if there were ten  --  the number which would have saved Sodom ? How large a part was that of the heterogeneous populace which at Baltimore , in May , 1844 , resolved that " our right to the whole of Oregon is clear and unquestionable ? " Can ten men he responsible for the opinions of five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opinions of the people ? Or can the majority vote themselves into knowledge-as the New York city authorities , at the public expense , furnish themselves with refreshments ? Or is the Democracy right by intuition ? Questions more significant than the answers to them would be satisfactory . However , with characteristic unanimity , that politic body , considering themselves the " body politic " voted the whole matter a plain case , and that the country recognized no patriotism which did not cover Texas and Oregon . Of course , what the J ) emocracy knew , their President must abide by , as this was a case where it would not do for the creature to be less wise than the power that made it . Besides , his knowledge on the subject was , in fact , just about equal to // theirs . Accordingly , in his Inaugural Address-for which undoubtedly he studied the Oregon question all over in order to he certain-he declared our claim not only indisputable , hut to be maintained up to the last foot . Like the Yankee-already found peddling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 54th0 and aleetle nort her . " Like his father in the faith and spiritual director , General Jackson , he was disposed , if withstood by imperious Britain , to " arbitrate at the cannon 's mouth . " This bold stand they had thought to take , not from any native boldness in themselves , nor because they were so sure of the right , and believed in an emergency Heaven would help them . But they supposed , from long inductive reasoning , that what the party leaders asseverated , the party would demand ; and they were weak ( shall we say base ) enough , to be influenced on such a question by such a supposltion . They were even persuaded , that the hostility to Great Britain is so deeply fixed in the general mind of the country , that the most affronting position possible would meet with most favor from the mass of the people-thus increasing the ranks of the Administration from the lines of their opponents . But when the President caine to enlarge a little  --  a very littlehis knowledge on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some difficulties , both intrinsic and extrinsic , to " give him pause . " it was seen that there were a few considerations in favor of English rights in that region , and that they had quite forgotten the action of their predecessors in the case . ilVIore to their guidance , it was found that very little value was set on the territory , that the mass of the people did not want war , that England did not want war-in short , that the national honor was not half sensitive enough , and would not tolerate the idea of a war , consequently not a warspirit , on any extreme grounds . What then ? The grounds were , of course , to he moderated . If then a war-cry could he skillfully manufactured , little danger , much popularity , might come of it . Accordingly , the compromise was offered of yielding nearly half of the region of which the whole had , without reservation , been so loudly claimed . This the British Minister most unwisely rejected . It ought to have been accepted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to expect , and its rejection gave the party in power just the opportunity they were waiting for . The strong statement of Mr. Buchanan came out ; thoughtless , ambitious men , in and out of Congress , talked blusteringly , and endeavored to draw party lines upon the question . But intelligent men on all sides took American ground , yet denounced war ; business was hindered , the public mind depressed . While the Administration were finding it impossible to fill their sails with this wind , came the proposal for arbitration . It was rejected- " reason not given . " True , a reason was offered , hut of what worth , or reality , we have seen . Yet the truth is evident . From the Oregon Question ,  --  unfortunately Americanized-they had gained hut little power ; from the war cry , nothing but rebuke . And now  --  to arbitrate ! - It would take , as they express it , " the great interests of the Republic out of the control of the United States : " - " out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What particular eclat would attend their permission for others to settle a great national question ? what loss of reputation not ensue , that they had not been able to settle it themselves ? what of the power that should belong to executive energy ? to diplomatic skill ? The country had looked to them to finish the dispu*e ; the country must be obeyed ! It w* clear , that " the great interests of th' Republic " must not go out of the hands of the Administration . But these personal considerations , though undoubtedly of wonderful weight , were , in our opinion , by no means the controlling reason for this rejection . There was , in our belief , a new ' and secret policy -- as suddenly conceived as it was firmly adopted-which had been for some time influencing the movements of Government , and which now at once decided this matter . And it is to this point , chiefly , that we ask the attention of the country . We have not space to dwell upon it , and shall content ourselves at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed that the Administration or the party wanted war , so much as they wanted the war-spirit . They wished to gamble with the terrible chances of this excited state of things , to increase their power . But when , as we have shown , the " signs of the times " so signally failed them , soon after the opening of Congress , they were forced to seek another resource . We have said that the President and his Cabinet dared not contemplate any immediate change in the tariff of 1842 . Yet , notwithstand // ing his swindling professions during the canvass , Mr. Polk always designed tha the Tariff of 42 should be altered . Some time in the course of his four years ' usurpation he hoped to do thus much evil . Suddenly began to come the startling train of news from England . The destruction of crops , the prophecy of famine , the resignation of the Ministry , the failure of the new one , the return of the old , the announcement of the fall of the corn-laws , of the reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in all the commercial policy of the nation , followed each other faster than successive packets and steamers could bring them . It had already been significantly hinted , that England 's commercial relations were so important , her estimation of the excellence of her manufactures and of the beauty of reduced duties in foreign ports so high , that , if her honor were not touched , it would not " he difficult to arrange the Oregon question . " These hints were not lost on this side of the waters . And when this new and surprising combination of circumstances referred to took place , a " monstrous clever " design struck the Administration . That it might partially have dawned upon them before is possible , as it could not have been difficult for Mr. Walker to fall pretty early on so ingenious and evil an expedient . It was resolved to make the Oregon dispute and rumors of war , which in themselves were now shorn of political effect , the immediate means of breaking down the Tariff . For this purpose the war panic was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , and general uncertainty as to all future results maintained , while a bill should be prepared which -- bad enough to create , in quiet times , universal alarm - should , in this state of suspense , he accepted for the sake of -- PEAcE . That Eno-land has had any understanding with tl*s government on the scheme , or has acted with reference to it , need not he asserted . She was obliged to change her financial policy for home reasons , and her military preparations are , beyond question , necessary for many future contingencies . But everything has happened as well as if designed for the end required . Great Britain maintains a calm , prepared aspect ; her statesmen talk with dignity , in Parliament , of English rights and English honor , but also of the extraordinary and reciprocal benefits of trade between the two countries ; her public journals present the same oppos ing views , but with more breadth and freedom . On this side , hasty-minded military orators are permitted to make war-speeches in the dark ; a bill of reduced duties i8 constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party papers are left to talk blindly , now of the necessity of standing for all Oregon , now of the blessings of free trade . England , however , fearing that such an Administration , or such a party thrusting them on , might force the question into inextricable difficulties , and dreading a war , in the present state of her social elements , more than she could value any commercial concessions whateverbesides doubting , it is probable , whether she could really obtain from the United States any important or permanent concessions of the kind-most wisely proposed to submit the Oregon dispute to arbitration . That proposal was , of course , rejected . For it would not do to " take our great interests out of the control of the Republic ! " In other words , it would not do to throw away the only question that could be made subservient to their political designs . Arbitration agreed to , public excitement would sink at once , and they might hope in vain to persuade the people to throw down the Tariff . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indefinitely kept up , that the government may take advantage of the anxiety and patriotism of the country , of the public sense of honor and dishonor , of the dread of the evils of war , the love of the blessings of peace , to aid them in forcing upon the people 's reluctant acceptance a ruinous reductj.on of duties -- an evil only less than war . The nat ion is called upon to watch their action . They may succeed for a timefor a time only . They shall be hurled from power ns suddenly , and as much to their surprise , as corrupted Fortune first raised them to it . The desert in the case will be infinitely greater . The merits for which they were elevated to the government of a great Republic-one of the four chief powers of the world-were , in any point of view , undoubtedly small . But if they continue this covert , uncertain and utterly seltish policy , from which , as yet , they seem never to have departed except to throw dust in the public eye , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the Administration for a people whose true dignity , interest and honor , they are not only unwilling to subserve but unable to appreciate.
