txt OUR modern lord of song , Shelley , has said that " naught may endure but mutability . " Paradoxical as the expression appears , it may , nevertheless , be considered literally true . On all sides the world presents one vast scene of incessant mutation . Nothing abideth in one stay . Night alternates with day , and seed-time with harvest . Moons wax and wane , and the ebb of the str*ani follows its *1ow . The grass grows up , is cut down and withereth . Mighty oaks fall and acorns sprout . The myriad forms of animal life spring forth into being , enjoy their ephemeral existence , perish and pass away . One generation of men pursues another to the grave , and the father descends to the tomb , that his place may be filled by one who was but a short time before an infant prattling on his knee . The breath of the destroyer , Time , blows upon the monuments of human power and skill , and they crumble into dust . Seas are sweeping where once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert is all that marks where the princes of the earth reared their stateliest palaces . Empires have risen and grown till the nations quailed before them , when they have been suddenly swept away by the might of some newer power . Dynasties have fallen , customs have become obsolete , laws have perished , even religions have vanished away like a tale that is told . On all hands we behold the same wild career of change , of mingled dissolution and reproduction , of vigor and decay . Everything we see is hastening to its destruction , that new forms* may arise upon its ruins , and run the same rapid course toward the goal of death . Is this , then , one is naturally led to ask , indeed a chaos ? Is it no more than a lawless tumult of conflicting principles , without object or system ? Does it tend to no results ? Must the human race , like a blind mill-horse , travel for ever the same unvarying round , grinding out hopelessly the self-same evil products ? Far from it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there exists harmonious order . Where we can see no plan , every element fulfils the mission assigned it by omniscience . Look out upon the hosts of shining worlds that crowd the arch of heaven . r* he mind is bewildered , lost , in contemplation of the countless throng , and all seem scattered there by the wildness of accident , yet each rolls swiftly and surely on its predestined circle , departing no iota from it , in its course through infinity and eternity . So is it with the history of mankind . Through all its strange vicissitudes , the reflecting mind can observe the operation of one mighty principle , leading on to the accomplishment of as mighty purposes . On all is written the great law of Progress . This is indeed the distinguishing mark of our species , obviously dividing it from // 68 July , the beasts that perish . One after another the generations may pass from the stage of action , in solemn array , going down to the deadempires may sink in ruin  --  and whole nations be swept from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pestilence , but the course of the whole race is still onward . Every age takes some one step in advance of its predecessors . Science goes calmly on , adding little by little to its ever-accumulating store , and evolving one important principle after another , while philosophy from time to time throws some new ray of light upon the mysteries of the universe . A great truth once known and uttered never wholly dies , but continues to exert its appropriate influence in urging the family of man on to its high destiny in the perfection of human civilization . To trace the progress thus effected as succinctly as possible , or at least to show its existence , is the object of the present paper . But first let us glance at the signification of a term we constantly employ , but which will be the better for a more specific definition . Civilization includes two elements. * The first of these is the developement of the faculties and powers of the individual . The breast of the savage is a sealed casket of precious jewels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , he has no opportunity of displaying them , and is unconscious of their existence . They lie smothered and buried beneath a mass of low cares , sordid appetites , and stormy passions . Exercise and discipline these faculties , train them till their full extent is developed , and you will have before you a perfect man ; then , and then only , will he stand erect in the image of his Maker , This developement , in a greater or less degree , will be effected in the progress of civilization . Much has been done toward it already , for the man of the present day is a very different being from him of five centuries ago . He is made to partake of a much greater amount of knowledge , is educated to greater mental vigor and activity , and taught to employ his powers upon a much more extended circle of objects . The second element is the improvement of society , of the relation of men , one to another . In all the ruder conditions of mankind , the individual is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his birth-right ; each trenches upon some privilege of his neighbor , and is in turn encroached upon by him , while both are made to suffer by the power of their superiors . The best state of society would therefore be that in which each member is left to the guidance of his own enlightened will , as far as is possible compatibly with the right and liberties of his associates . the perfection of civilization will be found in that state where each member , after the greatest possible amount of moral and intellectual cultivation , enjoys the greatest possible amount of personal freedom . That we are rapidly advancing toward such a condition will be abundantly // proved by a reference to the history of the world , for we will find that society has never retrograded but temporarily ; and that no real and important improvement or amelioration once made , has ever been lost , but still endures in the immortality of truth . The knowledge of special facts may have been lost , certain processes of art may have been forgotten , but a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enjoys unfading life , and exerts an undecaying energy . Let us then look for a moment at the steps by which society has reached its present position , in the hope that we may derive from the survey some useful lesson , and perhaps infer the character of its future progress . Mankind never could have existed but in society . This is the only " state of nature . " Even admitting , with certain writers , that men were not originally above the level of the brute creation , they must at least have been gregarious and to some extent mutually dependent . Association in tribes would be imperiously demanded by the comparativ. weakness of the female , by the long dependence of the infant upon its parents , so different from what occurs among animals generally , and especially by the exposure of the human frame to danger from the adverse action of the elements . This last circumstance would lead to mental exertion in the discovery of expedients for protection , and thus provoke the first efforts at civilization , which is virtually the exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in producing a conformity of the external world and man 's own nature with his numerous wants and capacities . What their first efforts were we do not know , for they are lost in the remoteness of antiquity . As regards society , however , it is natural to suppose that its first idea arose from the constitution of the family , or rather that society was originally but an extension of the family . As his progeny increased in number the good old father sate in their midst as ruler , and old and young alike submitted to an authority tempered by love . In all the difficulties incident to their simple condition , the patriarch was their counsellor and friend ; he encouraged the good , rebuked the wayward , and punished the wicked . But as population became still more numerous , this primitive government was subverted or modified . Might asserted its authority , and it was too often admitted . Superstitioa poisoned the minds of men , and the designing took advantage of its influence to extend their own power . The regal and priestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The masses sank into greater or less dependence , particularly upon the priesthood , as the representative of a superhuman power . Absolutism in some form was for the most part established , although some rude attempts were made to found a community based upon the idea of equality . Examples of this earliest or incipient civilization may be found amongbarbarians generally . It is marked principally by a strong feeling of personal independence , of the essential nobility of the simple man , and his // equality with his fellows . It would be well to remark this fact , for we will find the same principle , after being disregarded or hidden for long ages* of crime and sorrow , reappearing as the grand idea of the last great stage of civilization . The savnge possessed this idea , but still he was refusedThe birth-right of his being , knowledge , power , The skill which wields the elements ) the thought Which pierces the dim universe like light , Selt-empire , and the majesty of love . It was necessary that the principle of equality should for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it is again proclaimed , and must soon be established , forming the crowning stone of the glorious edifice erected by human genius in the long progress of society . The earli*est civilization of which we have any knowledge , begins with the beginning of history , for what is history , rightly considered , but the record of man 's efforts at progress ? - blind , uncertain , wavering , it may be , but still in the main onward . In considering this progress some writers have endeavored to divide it into successive stages , bounded by important epochs , and marked by peculiar characteristics . The ablest of these is probably Professor Cousin , who conceives that history may be properly regarded in three grand divi sions. * It would occupy too much space to enter into a detailed consideration of these stages ; and it will therefore be enough to state , that he considers the first of them , extending from the creation to the rise of Greece , as essentially religious , and busied with the developement of ideas of infinite existences ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the developement of the human mind and body , together with all natural objects ; and the third , which still exists , as intended for the harmonizing of the former two , which being effected , developement will be complete . Such divisions as this must necessarily be , in a great measure , general and arbitrary , particularly from the fact , that the state of mankind throughout the world is never uniform , and different trains of action may be going on in different parts at the same time . Hence we may see different stages co-existing in regions separated only by a few leagues of desert or a narrow sea . In the present article , the following arrangement will be observed , as presenting several advantages , and in which it will be remarked that of the separate stages , instead of ending where another begins , each runs into the time allotted to its successor . The first period may be regarded as extending from the creation to the age of Socrates . At this latter date , the second or Grecian civilization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had reached its culminating point , and thence continued to decline till its termination by the establishment of Christianity as a state religion , under Constantine . The third extends from the promulgation // of the glad tidings of the Gospel by the Saviour to the American Revolution , which events may be deemed the two most important in the history of the world . With the latter commences a new and more glorious era , of which the one immediately preceding may be considered as little more than formative . In each of these periods some great idea was predominant , and fixed its character-some leading principle was established which has not been and never will be lost , but will exert its influence while the world endures . It is not pretended that these positions are invariably applicable , and that no form of society , properly referred to either of these heads , has existed except during the years to which such form has been assigned . rllhis division applies only to those regions in which has taken place the progress of that civilization amid which we exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal . The first civilization took its rise in that cradle of our race , the fertile and prolific East . Examples of it may be seen in Egypt , Assyria , and Persia , and some such nations as Ilindoostan and China still stand in their sombre magnificence , as they have stood for centuries . This society is characterized by an iron despotism , both physical and spiritual . The masses were mere hewers of wood and drawers of water to the privileged few , and generation after generation plodded its weary way from the cradle to the grave in aimless toil and hopeless degradation . This result was very much promoted by the division of the people into castes , each child adopting the calling and following implicitly in the footsteps of his father , without daring to aspire to a higher than the parental condition . Hence arose another peculiarity of this society-its stationary character . Progress never extended in it beyond a certain point , when the whole stood still and retained the same complexion from age to age . Nations formed upon this model were rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fell only by the attacks of an external foe , or the encroachments of a more advanced state of civilization placed an their vicinity . For proof of this we have but to refer to those Asiatic empires which have stood from remotest ages in their gloomy immobility , and are only now beginning to totter before the might of European intellect . The dominant castes were the clerical and military , and between these the power was divided . One held an undisputed sway over the bodies and properties of men , while the other assumed the far more dreadful despotism over their spirits , which should be free as the wind of heaven , that blows where it lists . The mind of the people was oppressed and smothered by these twin incubi , till we could almost doubt its existence . The king , who may be regarded as the head and representative of the military class , exercised an authority absolute except as limited by that of the priesthood . The clergy , claiming the divine sanction for all their acts , lived in pomp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead of feeding their flocks with as much of the manna of life as had been granted them , they still farther wronged them by the inculcation of a gross idolatry , very different from the sublimer faith reserved for the initiated . They were the depositories of all the learning and philosophy of their time , and it is not to be supposed that they would neglect the use of an instrument of such tremendous power . All the literature of this period , of which any traces have descended to us , partakes of a religious character . Indeed theology was almost their only study , for in this all others centred and were merged . It is remarkable that in the midst of their general darkness , there were entertained religious tenets the most abstruse and profound . It would seem as though they had arrived at ultimate truths without taking the intermediate steps , or that there still lingered among them the fading glories of some primeval revelation . When we condemn the extravagant superstition of Egypt , We should recollect that what were received by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship , were but mysterious symbols , shadowing forth some abstruse dogma , and that in all their distorted images and wild fables the learned could perceive the teachings of a deep philosophy . Considerable light has been thrown upon this subject by the researches of late British writers into the literature of India , which has strong points of resemblance with that of ancient Egypt . In one of the Hindoo religious books , to cite an example , two armies are represented as drawn up in the array of battle , composed of kinsmen , once friends . Between them stands a youthful warrior , anxious and distressed , reluctant to imbrue his hands in paternal blood , and scarce knowing to which band of brothers he shall give his aid . The incarnate god Crishna stands by his side , and , ridiculing his agitation , tells him that this conflict is the doom of destiny ; that , after the carnage , the sun will smile as brightly and all the undisturbed harmony of the universe go on as before ; that as one of the warrior-caste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty is to do his part as though he did it not , with his eye fixed on this great principle , and regardless of the result. * Here we have the darkest fatalism combined , in its remoter tendency , with optimism , a philosophy which , when divested of its oriental dress , somewhat modified and contemplated in the light of Christianity , does not appear so entirely absurd . Before its terrible import as here stated , however , th ? e human mind shrinks into utter nothingness , and the deluded victim rushes darkling on his ruin , as the blind and involuntary instrument of an unknown power . Why should he trouble himself about his poor agency when he obeys the behests of that destiny which rolls on its unfaltering course , like the car of Juggernath , crushing bleeding myriads beneath its mighty wheels ? - when he is but an atom in that univers* which the plastic // hand of omnipotence is constantly moulding ifito new and ever-varying shapes . The practical effect of such opinions is obvious . Under them the mind of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will is extinguished , and he becomes the ready and willing slave of those whom he believes to be the immediate representatives of the Deity . His spirit is bound in chains of adamant , and all his powers are resigned *o the control of another . Sunk in abject ignorance , he transfers his adoration from the great being of his creed to the types which have been invented to express his attributes or the laws whereby he regulates the universe . He departs still farther and farther from the image of his Maker , and the temple of the living God in his soul is destroyed , arch , dome , column , and altar fallen in one undistinguishable ruin . Herein we have the source of the unbounded spiritual despotism which existed during the first civilization , for these opinions* with little variation , were entertained throughout its whole extent and duration . Under their operation , we may see the whole of a vast population without a will of their own , laboring as one man to pamper the lusts or gratify the whims of a privileged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this era , which bears its impress . Vast , solid , gloomy , and covered with mystical hieroglyphs whose signification is lost , many specimens of it still stand , defying alike the decaying hand of time , and the fury of ! the elements . This period at length drew near its close . Its mission was fulfilled* and it faded away from the shores ef the Mediterranean like a dream of the night , thus making room for the developement of a better state . But , though long departed , its traces yet remain . They are not to be sought in the ruins that speak of its former pomp ; and mark where it held sway . True , the gigantic pyramids still rear their vast bulk over the sands of the deserts : some massive column or flowered capital still tells the adventurous traveller where stood Balbec and Palmyra ; the sphinx still gazes on the ever-flowing Nile with the same chilling expression of deep and mournful thoughtfulness ; the mighty obelisk , removed from its x*ative site to a strange proximity to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Peter 's , and points the spectator to the skies , while from its sides look out the mysterious symbols which no one is left to interpret . Yet it is not here that we must look for the evidences of its power and influence . We must look for them in the impulse given by it to the young and fiery genius of Greece , and through her transmitted to us . We may see them in the direction given by it to her studies and the character impressed upon her theology and philosophy , which have had a mighty influence upon our own . Here we can discover what it has done for mankind ; here we can see proof of the assertion that progress once effected is never lost , though for the season it may pause and waver . Before leaving this period we must direct our attention for a moment E2 // to a particular people , who , though of little political importance , have played a part of vast moment in the drama of history . They are the Hebrews , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to in their efforts at theocratic government , in the restriction of their priesthood to a single family , and in the joint action of this and the throne in the exercise of a power almost unlimited . They differed widely from them , however , in the possession of an austerely simple and sublime faith , which was kept pure by its very simplicity , never degenerating into the adoration of symbols . Whatever idolatry we find among the Jews , was borrowed from their recollections of the Egyptian worship or their intimacy with neighboring countries . Ruled in all their actions by the comprehensive and minute code of Moses , they preserved their peculiar character through many vicissitudes and misfortunes , as they do in a measure at the present day . Carried into captivity , and their temple razed to the ground , they sat by the rivers of Babylon and wept , hanging their harps upon the willows , until the Lord should call them back to build Jerusalem again . One after another the floods of conquering foes rolled over their ill-fated city , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies struggling and beating among the shoals . The Assyrian , the Persian , the Macedqnian , and the Roman in turn came down upon them like the wolves on the fold , but they clung with unyielding constancy to their faith and their law . But this law was merely ceremonial , and typical of better things yet unrevealed . It prescribed a ritual of worship , and contained many wise police and sanatory regulations , well adapted to the people for whom it was intended . The Levitical priesthood , created for the purpose of carrying it into operation , was like itself but temporary , and must in the fulness of time be abrogated . The moment for this great event at length arrived , but not amid the pomp and circumstance of war , or the terrible convulsions of revolution . No-while gentle angel voices hymned peace on earth , there emerged from the broad bosom of Humanity a simple , humble Man , but also a true High Priest , made after the primeval order of Melchizedeck , not by the imposition of human hands or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spirit , and so abiding a priest continually . He appeared among men a messenger of mercy , preaching the gospel to the poor , denouncing the pride of hypocrisy , and teaching a sublimely pur6 and spiritual morality . When his ministry was finished in martyrdon* , the veil of the temple was rent in twain , the Holy of Holies , where the divine presence is made manifest , was established from thenceforth in the breast of the believer , the priesthood under the law was abolished , and the legions of Titus , sweeping the city and its temple from the earth , scattered the remnant of Israel like chaff before the north wind . But , though conquered and dispersed , this people has left an inestimable legacy to mankind in that faith which is spreading it // genial light over us even now , thus fulfilling the promise given to their great progenitor , that in him should all the families of the earth be blessed . Their dispersion may be regarded as the final extinction of the first civilization in all those regions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimportance , it was now extinguished . In the southern and eastern portions of Asia it still retained its pristine grandeur , but these people have exerted no influence in the formation of our forms of society . Let us now go back some centuries to regard a newer civilization , which had long before dawned , had reached its noon-day splendor , and at the date of this memorable event was verging to its decline . The rude Pelasgi , inhabiting the rugged shores of Attica , had early made considerable amelioration in their original condition , deriving much from their more advanced neighbors of Egypt and Phmnicia . No vast spiritual power existing to bind them together in one wide empire , numerous states were formed , each city governing the surrounding country . Soon afterward , the hardy tribes of Italy , stimulated probably by the Greek colonies in Sicily and Magna Gr*ecia , commenced that progress which was destined to lead to such astounding results . Its states were impressed with the same character as those of Greece , and in these two countries was developed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was everywhere exhibited a strong tendency to a republican constitution . r* his was displayed earliest and most strongly by the Athenians , for it is remarkable that Homer applies the term people to them alone of all the cities concerned in the Trojan war . A pure republican form was , however , never attained , for in all cases th' highest authority was lodged in the hands of some privileged individual or class , generally in a monarch , sorfietimes in a wealthy aristocracy , as at Athens and Rome . This authority was ' occasionally limited , and in a measure controlled , by direct representatives of the lower classes , as the Ephori at Sparta , and the Tribunes of the People at Rome , but the most odious distinctions always existed . These nations are frequently mentioned as democratic , yet we must not suppose that even in their best condition any of them deserved this title as at present understood , for in none was there recognised the equality of human rights or the importance of the individual . Men were made for governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been there , but the simple humble Man is nowhere to be perceived . The individual was lost in the state . This was indeed the leading idea of this society , and it involves a despotism almost as intolerable as that of the preceding . There , the property , life , and honor of the subject were *nt the mercy of a human tyrant ; here , the citizen owed all to a hypothetical despot , the State , the only alleviation of the latter 's lot being , that he felt his own honor exalted and interest promoted in those of his country . We may see an example of this in Rome , and more strikingly still in Sparta , where , under the // iron laws of Lycurgus , the free action of the private citizen was repressed by an equable distribution of property , enforced poverty , the exclusion of ornamental arts , common meals , and interruption of the domestic relations . Such a state must be essentially warlike , for it is by military achievements that the glory of the republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it advisable to draw off the attention of the people from too close a scrutiny of internal affairs by foreign conflict and conquest  --  a lesson which the rulers of the earth have not yet forgotten . In Athens , much greater scope was given to the energy of individual action than elsewhere , and hence we find here more popular commotion , together with a much more rapid and extended prograss in the arts , sciences , and philosophy . This civilization differs widely from the other in a religious aspect also . Although the theology of Greece , and , throtigh her , of Rome , was derived mainly from Egypt , it departed considerably from its model , and never was able to assume the same mysterious sway over the minds of the people . This latter fact may perhaps be accounted for by its foreign origin . The priesthood never obtained an influence comparable with that which they possessed in eastern nations . They were universally subject to the state . The Roman senate could create or dethrone divinities at pleasure , and while it displayed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placing in the crowded Pantheon the grotesque images of their gods , it could also exert as high an authority in a contrary direction . The impure orgies of Bacchus having been introduced at Rome , the senate , justly alarmed , suppressed them by an edict , and banished all who participated in them from Italy . The more enlightened individuals were not backward in displaying their contempt of the prevalent Worship . Socrates refused to be initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries , although admission to them was generally considered a high privilege . The lofty scepticism of Lucretius was also the faith of a numerous and powerful sect , and the " Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas , " even of Virgil , will suggest itself at once to every classic re*ider . Cicero speaks without reserve of the folly of auguries ; and Cato the Censor informs us that in his day no two soothsayers could look each other in the face without laughing . Yet , by a strange inconsistency , these very persons contended for a strict observance of the ordinary forms . The general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocking the superstitious feelings of his soldiers , causing himself to be shut up in a litter while upon a march , lest he might be obliged to halt by the sinister flight of birds , should he see them . Cicero , even while ridiculing the art of divination , blames those who neglect the auspices , conceiving it proper to respect the general faith and popular prejudice . But it is not only in the comparative want of respect and influence on the part of the clergy that this discrepancy exists . The religion // of the second civilization was much less abstruse and mystical than that of the first . This may be perceived in their respective objects . of worship . The gods of Egypt and the East were mythological and astronomical symbols , and forms of animals or arbitrary figures used to represent some power or principle . Hence they were grotesque and strongly composite in shape . Those of Greece and Rome were deified heroes , or personations of some single virtue , sentiment , or passion . They assumed almost exclusively the human form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attribute by some superadded symbol , and hence we have those exquisite specimens of statuary which still are objects of wonder and delighted admiration . The mythology of Egypt was the highest philosophy of its day , shadowing forth the most profound dogmas in strange fables or occult hieroglyphics . That of Greece was mainly composed of poetic narratives , the actors in whose dances displayed all the feelings and even the worst passions of men , and where the original mystical signification was no longer distinguishable . Under these circumstances the priests ceased to be the sole depositories of learning and teachers of the people , thus losing the power proper to superior knowledge . A literature was demanded more in accordance with the prevailing character of mind and the spirit of the age , and teachers soon arose from among the mass of the people . The voice of the bard was heard in princely hall and peasant 's hut , singing the exploits of heroism , the charms of beauty , *nd the praise of virtue . Admiring crowds gathered around the Thespian cart , and soon after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceptions of the dramatist . Cities poured out their shouting population to welcome and lead back in triumph the poet or rhetorician who had borne off the olive-wreath from the Olympic games . Orators contended in the noble strife who should most enlist the attention and direct the councils of an assembled people . Historians recorded the spirit-stirring narrative of battle , and the mighty deeds of their heroes . Beneath the pencil there glowed brighter hues and shapes more lovely than those of earth . The breathing marble was wrought into forms as beauteous as poet 's dream . Science investigated the varied phenomena with which she found herself surrounded , and sought on all sides to penetrate this all-enshrouding mystery wherein we dwell and labor . Divine philosophy arose and shone brightly amid the general gloom . Socrates taught men how to think , and his successors employed the process in the elucidation of the laws which regulate the external world , and the wondrous microcosm of man 's body , with its still more wondrous tenant . An impulse was given to thought everywhere , and these ensured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world had not yet witnessed . Mathematics , physics , poetry , the drama , oratory and moral and mental philosophy , were cultivated with eager enthusiasm , and consequently with success . Wisdom was reverenced // 78 July , for its own sake . The philosopher was honored as much in the beggar 's mantle as in the royal purple or the priestly robes . Diogenes , contented in his tub , was sought and visited by Alexander . Thus was shown and recognised the inborn dignity of a man , true to his better nature , independent of all external accidents . This activity of mind led , as an inevitable consequence , to another peculiarity of this civilization , social instability and frequent fluctuations of popular sentiment and opinion . Numerous philosophical sects arose , having for the most part sufficient general resemblance to mark their original derivation from the banks of the Nile , but presenting wide discrepancies . The views of the people were subject to frequent and violent revulsions , and innovations upon existing institutions became common . Ardent , restless , ever looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enterprise , they commenced the boldest undertakings , and prosecuted them with vigor . Impelled by the thirst of conquest , and led on by ambitious generals , Rome went abroad in conscious strength to the conquest of the known world . But in this unceasing activity there were the seeds of decay . Greece sank almost as suddenly as she had risen , for the brightness of her glory had scarcely shone in full effulgence over the marble city of Minerva before it began to fade . Leaving their native seats , philosophy and the arts rallied for a little season on the banks of the Tiber , but it was at the time when Rome presented the singular spectacle of the highest intellectual cultivation , combined with a moral developement hardly superior to that of the savages of the wilderness . Her greatest crime was her greatest punishment , for her military spirit extinguished her liberties , and on the ruins of the stern republic arose the gorgeous empire . No page of history displays a tithe of the unprovoked crime and unmerited suffering that blackens that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind turns with loathing horror from its perusal . Everything was done for the imperial city that the disruption of all natural ties , and the defiance of every law , human and divine , could do , and she rushed headlong to destruction . Her fall may be dated at the accession of Constantine and the removal of the seat of empire to Byzantium , for her subsequent history is but a part of the social chaos that ensued , These events were attended by another of signal importance  --  the recognition of the religion of the meek and lowly Jesus as that of the haughty rulers of the earth . The Christian church , after many long and bloody persecutions , was now at length enthroned in imperial state and invested with the royal purple . To herself the change was fraught with manifold evils , but she was enabled to play an important part in the reorganization of society , as will appear directly . Although more than a century elapsed between these events and the final extinction of the Empire of the West under Augustulus , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for // all that intervenes between them and the developement of the third is a wild scene of tumult and anarchy . A dark and threatening cloud which had long hung upon the northern border of the Roman empire soon afterward burst upon it in all his fury . The imperial out-posts were driven in , and hordes of fierce barbarians , swarming from the savage north , filled the provinces , and regardless of the barrier presented by the frozen Alps , poured down resistlessly upon the smiling plains of Italy . The outer provinces of the empire were occupied by numerous tribes , who were scarcely in possession of their prey , befoie they were driven farther south by new crowds of conquering warriors . Rome itself was at last taken , and a Goth sate upon the throne of the Ctesars . After numerous furious contests among themselves , the barbarians settled in their new seats in comparative peace , and the scattered elements of society began to reunite in something like order . Now it was that the church came upon the stage of action and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate from the people , and formed a society or body of themselves . The bishops , very different from the original heads of the churches , had been invested by the emperors with municipal authority , as they saw the civil constitution everywhere dissolving while the ecclesiastical remained firm , and now presented a singular combination of the noble and prelate . The church , thus organized , could not stem the torrent that flowed in upon it from the north , but it could preve*it some of its devastating effects by making proselytes. of the conquerors . With this view it bent all its energies to the task of converting the barbarians , and the gigantic enterprise was accomplished successfully throughout Europe , so that , while a new society was established , it had the principle of Christianity infused into it in its very infancy . Receiving numerous important privileges from the zeal of its new converts , the church increased rapidly in power , and , at the period of the greatest prosperity of the Lombard kingdom in Italy , was , with the exception of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dominion of the Roman see , Gregory the Great assuming the title of Pope . From this time it formed politically one of the greatest powers of Europe , while socially it kept alive what little of learning and philosophy remained ; acted as an intermediate estate between the people and their masters ; and presented to the lower classes the only path whereby any of their number could hope to reach eminence or authority . Its immense influence is proved by the bold interference of haughty prelates in the plans of monarchs , and by the innumerable hosts which , under its command , left their bones to bleach on the plains of Asia Minor in the mad crusades for the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre . It is difficult to decide which presents the more striking and peculiar picture of its sway-the wild crowd of ragged enthusiasts that followed in the train of Peter the Hermit , or that scene of the humiliation of Barbarossa , where thc // proud Kaiser was obliged to prostrate himself before the pontiff whom he alone in his day had been bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of a wondering multitude . The constitution of society , meanwhile , was of barbarian origin and essentially feudal . The only points in this system we have space to notice , or which , indeed , are important to us here , are , that it maintained a warlike spirit , privileges being generally granted on condition of military service ; that it removed the greater amount of power from the cities to the country , each lord living on his own domain in the midst of his vassals ; and that it kept up a considerable degree of personal independence . The peasants and artisans were slaves in the strictest sense of the term , but the number of persons holding possessions in their own right was very considerable , and among them existed a high sense of personal liberty . True , the baron owed allegiance to some higher noble and to his king , but he rendered it under the principle of loyalty , and this he regarded as not less noble and undebasing than his homage to his lady-love . This leads us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sexes . In former ages woman had never risen to be more than the slave of man 's passions , and thus we perceive that all the erotic poetry of the ancients is entirely sensual , however refined it may be . Here , however , woman rises nearer to her true rank , and assumes a more equal station-sentiment takes the place of appetite  --  and we have at once produced the poetry of love . " Love became a religion , the idols of whose worship were evev present. *** Fanciful , and even absurd , as frequently was the devotion painted by the Trouveurs and Minnesiingers of those days they yet clothed the dull realities of men 's daily walks with poetic life and beauty , and raised them from sensuality to the pure regions of spiritual love .

Such was feudal society , and the only exceptions to it existed in the free corporate cities , examples of which we may see in most parts of Europe , but especially among the commercial towns of Italy and on the shores of the German Ocean . These were in effect attempts to reorganize the second civilization in the midst of an entirely different society . Although acting in their external relations as lords and vassals , rendering and receiving feudal servic* , their internal arrangement was modelled upon the republican forms of antiquity . they did not obtain any great importance until the twelfth century , although originating much earlier . * Shelley .

What little learning existed previously was confined to the cloister of the monks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this by the knowledge of the East derived from the crusades , but it was of little practical utility . The first impetus give a to the revival was by the Moors of Spain . Learning and all the accomplishments of civilized life were encouraged at the brilliantcourt of Granada to an extent that should have put all Christendom to the blush The study of astrology and alchemy was carried hence into all parts of Europe , and cultivated assiduously , because promising the discovery of means for the prediction of human events , the creation of gold at pleasure , and even the indefinite prolongation of human life . About this time also occurred the capture of Constantinople by the Turks , and the final overthrow of the Eastern Empire , when many learned Greeks sought refuge in Western Europe , carrying with them their language and the inestimable volumes of their ancestors . A taste for classical studies was excited , and they were prosecuted with ardor . A strong impulse was given to thought in every direction , and it seemed as though the mind of man had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From this time , social progress was rapid beyond parallel . A higher philosophy was substituted for the windy logic of the schoolmen . Science advanced with rapid strides , adding to its stores of knowledge , and aiding the powers of man with numerous useful arts and inventions . Reading and thinking men multiplied on all hands , and the discovery of the art of printing presented the means of multiplying books in an equal ratio . Commercial enterprises increased in boldness and extent , and the voyagers returned laden with " barbaric pearl and gold , " and relating wondrous stories of distant climes . These circumstances all combined to lead to the Reformation , an event for which Europe had long been preparing by a growing dissatisfaction on the part of the people and purer clergy with the pomp and licentiousness of the Papal establishment . At this period the triple crown had been placed upon the brow of Atheism in the peison of that true descendant of the talented , graceful , and luxurious Medici , Leo the Tenth . Pressed for means to complete his magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke . The standard of revolt was raised by Luther , and many of the wisest and best of his day gathered round him . The new doctrines spread over Europe like fire among the dry grass on the prairie . This revolution , for such in fact it was , was based upon the principle that each individual is his own best interpreter , the only judge of his own faith . This was its cardinal idea , and although its leaders may not have recognised nor acted out this principle to its full extent , the people did it for them . The public mind was excited vOL . VIII . NO . XXXI. - JIJLY , 1S40 . F // to its highest pitch ; theological questions were everywhero agitated ; and each asserted the correctness of his own opinions while he criticised those of his neighbors , so that the reformed church was soon divided into numerous sects . These feelings were carried to their greatest height in England , where the wars of the commonwealth , although involving numerous other considerations , were essentially religious , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worshipping God according to the dictates of their conscience . With the theological tenets of these sects we have nothing to do at present , but it may be observed of their political tendencies , that the Prelatists displayed an inclination to preserve the old forms and policy of government , while those advocating a Presbyterian church constitution generally looked for the establishment of religious commonwealths , upon the plan of the ancient republics . This was so obvious that James I. perceived it , with all his folly ; and in the celebrate&amp; conference at Hampton Court , remarked , that " a Scottish Presbytery agreed as xveil with monarchy as God and the Devil . " The English Puritans had similar views , and endeavored to carry them into effect in their settlements in New England . The Fifth Monarchy men and other enthusiasts wished to reject all human authority , looking for the second comipg of the Messiah as immediately at hand . The excitement throughout Christendom was intense , and the order of society was shaken to its very foundation . The doctrinal warfare was carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perse- ' cution was not infrequently called in to enforce conviction where argument had failed . Tranquillity was at length restored , however , and the excitement subsided , but not till after many had been drawn into exile , to seek a realization of their desires in the wilds of America ; and thither we must follow them as the founders of a new empire and form of society . The great discoveries of Columbus and his associates occurred at a most propitious moment for both continents . Had it taken place a century sooner , the first settlers - on these shores might have been like the bloody and rapacious Spaniards , and our fair plains might have presented the same melancholy aspect as do those of South America* But they were made just before the time when numbers of the not blest hearts of England , worn by oppression and persecution , or wearied with struggling against spiritual wickedness in high places determined to leave the home of their childhood , with all its endeam ing recollections , in search of a situation where they might sit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy the smiles of an approving conscience . A door was opened to them in America , and hither they came . The standard of equal rights was planted upon Plymouth Rock , and - the first settlement in New England was established upon the broad ground of human equality before God and man . It is true that the majority could not reach so far as the principle f // toleration , much less of religious liberty , but we must recollect that when the fathers of the Bay Colony persecuted the Quakers and Hutchinsonians , they did it , not in order to enforce uniformity of belief , but to drive out those that disagreed with them from the province which they had purchased , and reclaimed from the wilderness , as an asylum for themselves and their faith . When the colonies took higher ground , Massachusetts was not long in coming up to them . A great similarity of views and feelings was produced throughout all the English settlements , although composed originally of very dissimilar materials . The principal peculiarities of colonial society were general equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that cheapness of land and value of labor caused most persons to have their own portion of soil for cultivation . Hence arose a manly and independent spirit , a distaste for the gradations in transatlantic society , and a jealous watchfulness over their own liberties . When these were encroached upon in the slightest degree , the public attention was aroused and resistance was offered . The war of the Revolution was one of principle . " No taxation without representation , " had become an axiom in colonial politics , and rather than submit to its violation , our fathers took up arms against their rulers . The rights of the colonies were trampled upon , and their liberties endangered , by that mother country which shouhil have been their chief protector , and spurning the yoke , they declared themselves free and independent in that glorious instrument which must descend to the latest posterity as the epitome of political philosophy and great charter of humanity . It introduced a new principle into the science of government , that of the paramount importance of individual freedom and happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to be legitimate . It has been said that this was a new principle . It was new among civilized nations ; yet it was no new creation , for it is a portion of that eternal , absolute truth , which would have existed , and been truth , quite as much had society never been called into being . We have already seen it in action , as the cardinal idea of the primitive community . After this it disappears for ages . We see no traces of it in the first civilization , where the rights of the individual are lost in a gloomy despotism , based upon the assumption of divine authority . Neither do we find it in the second , where the citizen loses his individuality in his connexion with a common body whose glory is his chief duty and greatest good . In the third , we have a representative of the first in the Church , aiming at the establishment of a so-called theocratic rule ; and of the second in the free cities , together with a new element , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his own domain , and all confederated in a national form by common interests under the sentiments of loyalty and knightly honor . In the free spirit of the numerous aristocracy of this period we see some approach to the great principle just laid down , but no one drea*ied of // extending it to the mass of the people . Yet it had long before been asserted in its fullest extent . Although unseen by sage or sophist , it had been taught among the humble fishermen of Judea , and received by them as manna from heaven . One had appeared of gentle worth by the shores of the Sea of Gallilee , proclaiming that the spirit of the Lord was upon him , because he had anointed him to preach the Gospel to the poor , denouncing wo upon the pride of sinful power , and teaching men to call no one master upon earth , while standing fast in their allegiance to their Master and Father in heaven . Although the dim eye of that age could not perceive the full import of these glorious precepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beneficial effect upon society through the church . They kept its offices open to the son of the humblest peasant , if endowed with the talents and energy to attain them ; and no heresy could conceal the sublime doctrine that the Creator is no respecter of persons , and that before his bar prince and beggar must stand upon the same level-that there , if not before , will be asserted the common equality of mankind . These truths , however , were seen but obscurely , in broken glimpses , for many weary centuries . They shone out in partial splendor at the Reformation , but after some convulsive throes , the current of feeling returned in a great measure to its former channels , and old feudal Europe prepared again to run her wonted course amid the gray decrepitude of her institutions . Yet at this very period they were again asserted in their native purity , and as before- ( and , indeed , as they ever must be ) - first among the oppressed and down-trodden of our race , upon whom the forms of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christendom to its centre , as wild a conflict was waging in the breast of a poor English shoemaker . Hemmed in on all sides by multiform evil , bound down by the straps and bandages of formality and custom , looking for light and unable to find it , his spirit was torn by terrible agitation . Anxious and tempesttossed , he sought everywhere advice and consolation , but found nothing to reach his case , till in the midst of his distress it came to him that he too was a child of God , the work of his hands , and that in his breast also was the fitting temple , where the promised Comforter might come and abide with him , leading him into all truth . Impressed with this conviction , which came to his soul as though noon-day splendor had suddenly burst forth amid thick darkness , George Fox went abroad to preach his doctrines , saying " thee and thou ' * to all men , and forbidden by the spirit to doff his hat to king or kaiser . Of the correctness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formation of our political creed is undeniable . They led at once to the denial of all human authority in spiritual matters , as well as of degrees of rank and social distinction ; and their beneficial tendencies were early displayed in the settlement of Pennsylvania . Lord Baltimore had previously provided that no settler in his colony should be disturbed on account of his religious tenets , and Roger Williams had // yarned out the same idea even more fully ; but William Penn established his little band upon the banks of the Delaware on a principle not to be expressed by that weak word , toleration , but the fullest religious liberty , no man daring to step in between the soul of his brother and Him who made it , and to whom alone it is accountable . This principle almost insensibly extended itself over the continent , and united with others that were floating through the minds of men , in the formation of that social creed , which , long held in greater or less clearness , was finally embodied in the Declaration of Independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the qualities of the statesman , the philosopher , and the philanthropist  --  the immortal Jefferson . The publication of this document was one of the most important events in the history of the world . Wherever it has gone it has called forth a quick response from the deep heart of man , sounding to the slave of ages like the voice of home to the captive exile , and to tyrants , like the trump of an archangel pronouncing their doom . Its influence , past , present , and future , is incalculable . Its doctrines were received with rapturous avidity by the friends of humanity throughout the earth . Its effects have been displayed in a long-continued struggle for social improvement and constitutional reform . They were seen in France , in a revolution in which the people , shaking off their immemorial chains , made a desperate , frantic , and , alas ! fruitless effort to realize a state of society for which they were unprepared . They failed , and fell beneath the sway of a despot who has been well denominated " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations , making a similar attempt , have like them failed . The first heat of enthusiasm over , Europe after long disorder has settled down in comparative quiet , in a singular truce between her ancient feudalism and the principles of American freedom . These latter have now become the prevalent philosophy of the day , and are taught in the universities of Germany and from the professorial chairs of Paris , with a boldness which many on this side the Atlantic might profit by imitating . Meanwhile we have carried them into successful operation in our various governments , and are happy beneath a rule more mild and salutary ' than any yet known . The unquiet elements which produce incessant change may still be at work , but covertly and with little disturbance , so that peace reigns over the world . Where will the storm burst next ? Who can tell ? Such is a concise and necessarily a very imperfect sketch of the history of our race . When regarding this , who can doubt its progress ? Who can believe that the history of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill-wheel , that emerges into the light of day , only to be buried again in the depths of the stream . If a comparison of this character is at all allowable , it should be made-not to the millwheel which , impelled by the current , revolves for ever with ceaseless din , while remaining in one place  --  but to that which bore the Olym // pic charioteer , which , if it did go round , yet described its rapid course over the sand , as it hastened him to the goal of his ardent desire . Standing where we do , we can look back through the dark vista of antiquity , and see the founders of the second civilization , stiinulated and aided by the first , commencing its course on higher ground , and prosecuting it with greater success . We can see the third begin its career , guided by the experience , and enriched with much of the learning and arts of the preceding , while we enjoy the fruits of all their labors . We have as deep a sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterized the first civilization , expressed in a purer faith and without its melancholy results . We have all the mental energy and activity of the second , with much of its polity , without the despotism of the state . We have a spirit of sturdy independence derived in a great measure from the third , with much of its domestic and social relations , without its feudal slavery , and superadded to all , we have the full expression of that great doctrine of human rights which lies at the bottom of Christianity , regarded in its social aspect . We enjoy manifold advantages granted as yet to no other people , and stand at a height to which those of past ages dared scarcely to aspire . Truly the lines have fallen to us in pleasant places , and our cups of blessing have been filled to overflowing . But the question naturally arises-must the course of society stop here ? Shall we , because the hand of an overruling Providence has placed our lots at this particular point of time , venture to turn our eyes away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past , say to the ever-swelling tide of human progress-thus far shalt thou come and no farther ? Why should we deny to our posterity the ability to press as far in advance of us as we have gone beyond our predecessors ? It can not be . Even now the forecast shadow of enming events falls upon us . Let us but look around us , and , although the smoke of battle does not obscure the sky , and the tumult of revolution does nowhere fill the air , we may yet see all the causes productive of change silently but surely at work . The principle of progress is in unimpeded operation . The elements of society are in restless fermentation throughout Europe , foreshadowing some impending commotion . We may see this in the outbreakings of the German students , the hot impetuosity of youth drinking too deeply of liberal and classic lore . We may see it in France , in the fierce ebullitions of popular fury which indicate on how insecure a basis rests the throne of Louis Philippe . We may see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other *igns which show that the mighty mind of the English people is aroused to demand an amelioration in their condition and must be obeyed . We may see it on our own northern frontier in the movements which give fresh proof of the fact that a new American coipmunity can not long remain satisfied with the antiquated forms of feudal Europe . We may see the same spirit // displayed in our own country in the numberless schemes , both feasible and absurd , for social improvements-in the loud demand for universal education-in the increasing associations for the diffusion of light and knowledge-in the devoted heroism of the missionaries of the Cross , who take their lives in their hands , and go to bear the Gospel , with its accompanying liberty and*civili*ation , to the distant heathen . Here are many and prominent signs ; and if they mean anything , they must indicate that some new change in the aspect of the world is approaching . When and what shall it be ? There are many who believe that the good yet in store for our race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to enter the happy precincts of the promised land , yet we have gained a Pisgah height from whence we may gain some glimpses of its silver streamlets , fertile valleys , and plains laughing under the load of abounding harvests  --  and that the day when admission to it shall end man 's weary pilgrimage through this wilderness of thorns is not far off . God grant it may be so ! In the meantime the eyes of the world are fixed upon the citizens of this young republic . To us much has been given , and much will be required of us . We have been placed in the forefront of the battle , in the cause of Man against the powers of evil which have so long crushed him to the dust . The problem of his capacity for selfgovernment is to be solved here . Our mission is to elevate him to a sense of his native dignity , and to prove that in the great social interest of religion , and , to a much greater extent than has been believed , in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of his own will and conscience . Let us but establish this , and the race will have made an advance from which nothing short of the hand of Omnipotence can force it to recede. rro no other has been committed the ark of man 's hopes , and it remains to be seen whether we will faint by the way or bear it on in triumph . Surely we can not fail of success in such a cause ! Surely we can not falter when so much depends upon our perseverance to the end ! Yet it may be possible . We may prove false to our trust . We may fail of the high mission that has been assigned us . If so , then the same mysterious hand that affrighted Belshazzar amid the gorgeous magnificence of his impious feast will write upon our dishonored institutions , " the glory hat/i departed ; " our place will be taken from among the nations ; our portion will be given to strangers ; and our name will be recorded in the history of eternity on the same page with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had called him out of darkness into his marvellous light .

Its nominal author is entitled to be held guiltless of the slightest comprehension of the bearing of any political question whatever . His professional education and previous pursuits equally unfitted him for any such investigations . He was , of course , compelled in the concoction of his book to place reliance upon the representations of those persons by whom he was hospitably entertained , without evincing the slightest misgiving as to their fairness and accuracy . Our readers were doubtless apprized at the time , by the singular publications in the newspapers under his sign manual , that our country was favored with the presence of this individual during the years 1837 and 1838 . He arrived here in the midst of a disastrous revulsion , which was made the instrument of great political excitement . He was received with open arms by that portion of our community who are peculiarly vigilant in hunting up and patronizing foreign adventurers who do not intend to become citizens . The honest emigrant who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the intention of exercising his industry and talents with the enjoyment of freedom here , invariably finds this class of our society to manifest the most unrelenting hostility to his permanent interests .

It may be urged that Captain Marryatt has not been authorized to express the opinions of any body of politicians among us , and therefore they are not to be considered responsible for any of the doctrines in his book . We freely admit his want of express authority . But we appeal to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transactions throughout the whole warfare waged by the partizans of the Bank of the United States against the productive interests of the country , for the clearest internal proof of the real paternity of many views , which had lost their immediate interest , some of them years before he arrived in this country . That he abused the hospitality of his friends , and violated the confidence with which he was treated , is not unlikely . They are somewhat remarkable* for explanations not intended to be made public . Many indiscreet disclosures doubtless were made during those convivial periods of exultation which were so frequent at one period of his visit . We recollect that some of his associates became nearly frantic with joy at the result of the elections in several of the States , during the suspension of 1837-1838 . But we can perceive no reason why the people of the United States may not avail themselves of expositions made during that period , especially when the party to which these individuals belong are organizing for a most violent struggle to obtain the command of the governrnent-refusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their principles or intentions to the people , in order that private representations to suit every shade of feeling may be made , and on the other sparing neither exertions or expenditures to bring the whole organization of our government under subjection to their plans . The statements of Capt . Marryatt receive peculiar value and authenticity from the fact , that some of the cooler and more sagacious lenders of the party manifested at the time of those rejoicings evident apprehensions as to the untoward consequences of pouring forth their designs , which had occurred on previous occasions . At their crowning triumph over the democracy , at the Astor House , individuals of their own party-even those who had paid the ten dollars demanded for their tickets-.were rigorously excluded , unless previously // 115 approved as capable of carrying themselves with discretion . This ap* peared at the time , from sundry discussions on the subject in their newspapers . We are willing that all proper allowances should be made for the exaggerations incident to the inspiration habitual to all victories of that party , whether celebrated in anticipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be just to charge the whole party with such extravagances . But it should be borne in mind that the party has always been controlled by such leaders . At no period of our history has their influence been more conspicuous than at this moment . The developements of this book are , therefore , quite as instructive to every lover of his country , as though they had been mac1e* by partizans of more sagacity , and upon more sober occasions . It is only necessary in estimating them to overlook those exuberant statements of matters of fact , to which such individuals are prone . The doctrines they are intended to illustrate may probably be gathered more fully under such circumstances , than any other-since " out of the abundance of the heart , the mouth speaketh , " besides the classical adage , " in , vino veritas . " On page 156 may be found a summary of the doctrines which are interspersed throughout the volume in these terms : " The fact is that an aristocracy is absolutely necessary for America , both politically and morally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for if some stop is not put to the rapidly advancing power of the people , anarchy must be ' the result . I do not mean an aristocracy of title . I mean such an aristocracy of talent and power which wealth will give-an aristocracy which shall lead society and purify it . Howls this to be obtained in a democracy ? - simply by purchase . In a country where the suffrage is confined to certain classes , as in England , such purchase is not to be obtained , as the people who have the right of suffrage are not poor enough to be bought . But in a country like America , where suffrage is universal , the people will eventually sell their birth-right ; and if by such means an aristocratical government is elected , it will be able to amend the constitution , and pass what laws it pleases . This may appear visionary , but it has been proved already that it can be done , and if it can be done now , how much more easily will it be accomplished when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich and poor . I say it has been done already , for it was done at the last New York election . The democratic party made sure of success ; but a large sum of money was brought into play , and the whole of the committees of the democratic party were bought over , and the whigs carried the day . " " The greatest security for the duration of the present institutions of the TYnit*d States , is an establishment of an aristocracy . It is the third power which was intended to act , but which has been destroyed and is now wanting . Let the Senate be aristocratical-let the Congress be partially so , and then what would be the American Government of President , Senate and Congress , but , mutato comma , King , Lords and Commons ? " No evidence could more conclusively show Captain Marryatt 's ig. norance of all political principles and history , so far as regards his independent acquisitions , than these allusions to his own country . Can there be found another Englishman who has reached the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even seats in Parliament are purchased with as little ceremony in England , as any other co*nmo // dity ? The truth is , his sea-going education placed him at the mercy of the representations of others , on that subject as entirely , as with regard to the trafficking of the New York committees . This was doubtless among the exploits recounted to the Captain , and was implicitely believed , because he relied upon the narrators , and , it was perfectly conaistent with their avowed policy in other respects . But our main business is with the theory of government which , upon the same authority , he pronounces to be that which is alone fitted for this country . It is identical with that promulgated by Hamilton , John Adams , Fisher Ames , and the leaders of the party during the reign of terror . Not only the doctrines , but the mode of operation , are the same with those of Hamilton 's speech in the Convention which framed the Constitution , the report of which has been published in the Madison Papers , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this scheme of government resulted from the political meditations of the rattle-brained sailor * It would be the most extraordinary exhibition in the same individual , of silliness and sagacity ever made public . The plan originated at an early period of our history with individuals whose self-important vanity *led them to under-rate the intelligbnce of the people at large . It has since been cherished in the hearts of numerous persons who have been successful in schemes of pecuniary gain , drawn from the labor of others by cunning devices , for whom they entertain that hatred and distrust which is inevitable in grovelling minds towards the victims of their unworthy passions . Of late years this plan has never been publicly advocated excepting in period of public calamity . During the embargo and the subsequent war , it was zealously promulgated , simultaneously with the treasonable negociations with England charged upon the party by one of its principal leaders , John Quincy Adams . When this contest had triumphantly ended , then came the " era of good feelings " and all traces of the secret designs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to re-appear under the guises with which craft so well knows how to shroud its projects , when the deep financial embarrassments into which the whole country had been plunged by the banks convulsed the Union . Then c4me the articles of " Sidney " endorsed by the solemn resolutions of the Great Whig Meeting at New York , held a short time before the arrival of Captain Marryatt , at which , for the first time in the history of mankind , it was made a portion of a political creed , that " wealth is the test of merit . " Where all political power is made , by the laws and moral standard of any community , the subject of pecuniary purchase , this principle may be practically true . It therefore coincides precisely with the doctrines we have quoted . But unfortanately , when the security of wealth depends wholly upon the movement of paper currency , controlled by a few gambling speculators , " merit " under this deflaition becomes an evanescent quality . The only standard of character is to be found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // of merit " depends upon the rise and fall of fancy stocks . Finally , many of those who were originally most vociferous in its support now find themselves , from unlucky speculations and unavailable debts , unable to face their creditors without the protection of a law which , under the specious title of a bankrupt law , is intended for the sole advantage of debtors . Having been stripped without remorse of all their property by the managers of a false and delusive currency , thousands of them are now imploring Congress for an absolute exemption from their debts , by the extinguishment of all pre-existing contracts at the option of debtors ! To this complexion has " the test of merit " come at last . The individuals who were mainly accessory to the ruin of these dupes of the system , now endeavor to retain their ascendency over them by affecting to advocate the destruction at once of the securities on which legitimate credit is founded .

Is any one so stupid as to suppose that our present bubblearistocracy will " lead society and purify it V ' - Not until public feeling in this country has become insensible to the distinctions between virtue and vice , honesty and swindling . The ephemeral insects who display during a brief existence their gaudy brilliancy in the sunshine , are quite as permanent as most of this class .

By holding out hopes of gain as the reward of political subserviency , and apprehensions of loss by pursuing the path of independent integrity , they have been able on several occasions to infuse into the minds of great numbers of citizens a devoted zeal in support of their schemes . A few desperate speculators with or without property  --  and under the management of this system it is impossible to distinguish the one from the otherare empowered by the forms of law , not only to dupe and defraud the // honest and industrious classes , but to undermine and impair the sectirity of every estate in the country .

' They inflict upon society all the worst evils which the exclusive privileges of any body of aristocracy ever visited upon a nation , without a particle of redeeming benefit . The aristocracy of Europe is as different in its origin and design from this mushroom progeny of paper money , as an ancient feudal castle is from the preposterous architecture , which , under the name of a country seat , so frequently and appropriately represents the taste and permanency of its stock-jobbing owner . The foundations of the aristocratic principle , in those countries where it has exercised its most conservative powers , were laid during the general confusion of society which prevailed in the Dark Ages . Its history in France , whence this institution was carried to England by the conquest of William the Norman , may be briefly stated , and is not without instructio.n . Either the military leaders of those warlike barbarians who subverted the Roman Empire , and enslaved the bulk of the population , or other individuals distinguished for their talents and courage during that period of anarchy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maturity of the feudal system , this authority became hereditary . The right of commanding in war , of governing in peacej and of determining all civil and criminal controversies , became vested in the head of the family , and descended by primogeniture . Each was surrounded by his feudal dependants , while the mass of the people were villeins , ' enjoying no privileges but those possessed at this day by the serfs of Russia , or even the plantation slaves of the South . The power of the nobility was such , that they were generally able to set their nominal superior , the king , at defiance , whenever it suited their views , and on important occasions to resist his authority by open hostilities . Century after century , the restraint of this inordinate ascendancy of the aristocracy was the principal object of royal policy . By slow degrees during the bloody wars with England , carried on in the bosom of France , this great point was advanced . It made further progress during the half century of civil wars of which religion was either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the historian of that period , published by John Adams , indicate how perfectly his mind was imbued with all the maxims of the aristocracy of France during that turbulent period . The overreaching and suicidal rivalry of individual nobles during these vicissitudes had so much distracted and weakened the authority of their order , that Cardinal Richelien was able to accomplish the overthrow of their political power , previous to the accession of Louis XIV . In his reign the whole authority of the state was concentrated in the king . The only remaining vestiges of the former // political importance of the aristocracy , were the privileges of enjoying all the civil and military offices of the crown , . and being exempted from all taxes and public burdens . From independent sovereigns , exercising absolute power over their vassals , and waging war at their pleasure , against any who might infringe upon their security or their pride , the great nobility were humbled to mere courtiers , wholly destitute of consequence excepting from royal favor . The prodigal expenditures caused by the profuse magnificence of Loins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe , plunged the finances of France into such disorder , that during the reign of his successor , the paper money schemes of John Law were embraced with avidity as the only mode of relief In our number for March , 1839 , a full account of the origin , progress , and result of these schemes was given from the highest authority . The system produced such a general overthrow of property and confidence , as still further to derange the public finances . Finally , the war in which France embarked , by making common cause with this country in her struggle for independence , brought on a crisis . Every expedient within the control of the ministry for carrying on the public service was exhausted . Only the power of taxing the property of the aristocracy was adequate for the emergency . This could be given by the States General alone , which by the fundamental usages of the kingdom represented each order of the monarchy . Such an assembly had not been convened since the reign of Louis XIII . But the necessity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a century and a half , in 1789 . Many of the individuals who composed the aristocracy of France at that period , possessed liberal and enlarged minds . They clearly understood that the public prosperity , equally with private security , had been impaired by the social degradation of the great mass of the community . They had become convinced that the restoration of man to his rights as man , was the only effectual and permanent mode of retrieving the exhausted energies of the state . The people at large had been prostrated and trampled upon in the pursuit of schemes of aggrandizement , as fallacious as they had proved ruinous . To elevate their character and protect their interests , was the indispensable basis of all real improvement . Another portion of the nobility , actuated by various views of personal ambition , professed a great hypocritical regard for the people , in the hope of being able by popular clamor , to compel the crown to reinvest their order with a portion of the political power extorted from their ancestors during the . sixteenth and seventeenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dependents* determined that the property of the privileged class should be placed within reach of taxation , were anxious to gain the popular support of this leading projeet for which the States General were assembled . These various views and interests combined to inflame a nation which // had been oppressed to the lowest pitch of national degradation . In addition to so many causes of excitement operating at once upon a mercurial people , they were at the period in question almost infuriated by scarcity . It ought not to appear marvellous at the present day , that the portion of the aristocracy who proposed to use the people as mere instruments of terror , to compel the crown to share its power with them by increasing their authority , should have seized upon such a crisis for stirring up the populace by demoralizing expedients . We have not only seen the distress of our citizens attempted to be employed with a similar design by our mock aristocracy , but have witnessed their deliberate , premeditated maneuvres to produce such distress , by means of their control over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sufferings of the people as a conclusive argument against their responsible government . The conduct of a very numerous portion of the French aristocracy on the occasion referred to was equally suicidal . They discovered , when it was too late to repair the evil , , that the exasperated passions of great masses of needy individuals , though it may seem a stroke of refined policy to put them in motion , require something more powerful than politicians usually possess , to guide the extrava ; gant exhibitions which are inevitable from the influence of such deep and universal sympathy . The result of their short-sighted management is too well known to need recital . That great nation was precipitated into the most deplorable excesses which lasted for ten long and bloody years . From this state of anarchy France was at last rescued by the stern despotism of Napoleon . The result has been the obliteration of the ancient aristocratic principles from the actual government of the nation . The condition of society has doubtless been ameliorated by the Revolution . Property in the soil , which before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church , has become more generally distributed than in any other country in Europe . The fundamental security of social order , the diffusion of means of subsistence , which makes it the interest of every individual to protect the rights of the whole , has in a great degree removed the great sources of demoralization which led to such lamentable consequences . Poverty is the prolific motive ofcrime in every state of society . But contentment is not to be immediately expected after the excitement of the last half century . A brief calm is not sufficient to allay the waves of ocean agitated by long continued storms . The thirst of glory , inflamed to the highest pitch by the victories of Napoleon , became as ungovernable a passion as the appetite for pecuniary gain , infused into all classes in this country by the achievements of the Great Financier . A long period of successful war is precisely like a period of paper money speculation in this respect . It creates a large class of individuals whose minds have been continually agitated by deep excitement , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diligence demanded by the // pursuits of ordinary life . We can easily imagine the internal difficulties of France , when we call to mind the fermentation which has so frequently convulsed our community by the suddea fluctuation of pricesthe marvellous tales of immense fortunes acquired without either capital or labor  --  the thousands who have been seduced from the walks of industry , and have abandoned all regard to fair dealing and the principles ofjustice , in the ardent pursuit of wealth . It has been an ordinary artifice of the ener*iies of equal rights to ascribe all popular excesses to the asceniency of democratic principles . In point of fact , wherever the people themselves exercise the real power of self government , no opportunity can exist for such excesses . They can at once change the whole policy of the state by substituting new agents in the ordinary course , to carry out their views . There can be no Occasion for rebellion under such a system of government . But where the whole authority of our state is vested in an aristocracy , should the people feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only be kept in subjection to the laws by a mercenary force , as in England and Ireland at this moment . The two classes of the community are placed in a hostile attitude merely by the relation of irresponsible rulers on the one hand , and the condition of vassalage on the other , without hope of redress except by operating on the fears of their real masters . Where the people themselves constitute the defence of the country by an organized militia , called into service only when required by public exigencies , no power of subjugation exists , like that so often exerted in Europe by mercenary standing armies . Such a militia is an essential element of the system of self government . The attempt to confound its efficient organization for purposes of public defence , with the creation of a mercenary army , is precisely similar to the pretexts under which mobs have occasionally been excited in this country by the enemies of popular rights-such as the Post Office mob at Boston , the currency mobs at New York , the election mobs at Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late mob at St. Louis excited for the purpose of compelling the State Bank to suspend specie payments . They all spring from a common origin  --  a misguided desire to advance individual profit at the expense of the general welfare . The industrious classes of society are composed of men of like passions with the rest of humanity . They are exposed to seductions and liable to be misled by impulses . Whenever they have been artfully excited into the perpetration of excesses , by the mock aristocracy who are to " lead society and to purify it , " their extravagances are invariably charged upon the doctrines of equal rights . Capt . Marryatt ' . s whole design is conceived in this spirit . The demoralization produced by the wholesale swindling of the banks is coolly charged upon the " Jackson dynasty " and it is taunted with regarding " a breach of trust towards it as not of any consequence , " while , in fact , th*whole course of the administration has been a struggle 112 // against the enormities introduced and protected by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extracts from page 143 , are repeated in various shapes throughout the book : " I have before observed that whatever society permits , men will do and not consider to be wrong ; and if Government considers a breach of trust towards it as not of any consequence , and defaulters are permitted to escape , it will of course become no crime in the eyes of the majority . Such is unfortunately the case at present . It may be said to have commenced with the Jackson dynasty , and it is but a few years since this dreadful demoralization has become so apparent and so shamelessly avowed . " It may indeed he fairly said that nothing is disgraceful with the majority in America , which the law can not lay hold5 of . You are either in or out of the penetentiary . If you are once in , you are lost forever , but keep out , and you are as good as your neighbor . " This picture , evidently drawn from life around him , requires no comment . Its practical doctrines have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as the only class who can " lead society and purify it . " . Instead of elevating the tone of moral feeling and advancing the welfare of the community at large , many of them seem determined , as far as can be judged by their measures , to degrade society into a band of marauders upon each other , where the weak are plundered with impunity by the powerful . To return to our account of the origin and design of Europe*tn aristocracy . We have seen that in France it sprang from the overthrow off the previously settled order of things , which required the interposifion of powerful individuals for the common protection . Like all power without limitation for which the possessors are not responsible , it finally run into extravagant excesses , and ruined itself . Its course in England from the period of the Conquest was similar in most respects to that of France until the fifteenth century , when the whole order was nearly extirpated by the Wars of the Roses , as the conflict between the rival families of York and Lancaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called . This destruction of the ancient aristocracy of England , not only paved the way for the introduction of the Reformation in the next century , but effected at once a great social revolution . Previously to these *vars , a great majority of the population were predial slaves of the nobility . During the century which this conflict lasted , villeinage disappeared , without leaving any distinct trace of the mode in which the relation of master and slave were dissolved . When civil dissensions had arrayed the whole physical force of the nation in arms , it was probably effected by the free consent of all parties . It is * In a note to this passage , the subject of the investment of English Capital in State Stocks and public works is discussed at length . The identity of his views with those promulgated by some of the leadinr authorities of Wall-street will be under stood by quoting the following sentence , which concludes the essay . " The only ultimate chance of recovering the money is by this country ( England ) compelling the payment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact in connexion with the Norman aristocracy , that the feudal system never was tolerated in Norway , whence most of these families derived their origin . Villeinage prevailed throughout the rest of* Europe , and the Normans were mainly instrumental in imposing it upon other nations  --  but never permitted it to exist in their native country . That enterprising race were not only vigilant in resisting all attempts against their domestic liberty , but in securing great equality of property among themselves , with a degree of general intelligence quite extraordinary during the most benighted periods of European history . One of the most interesting publications we have recently met with , is Mr. Laing 's account of his residence in Norway for several years , describing the present state of society there , which appears to be substantially the same as that which prevailed a thousand years ago . The aristocracy originally established in England by the Conqueror having been greatly reduced in numbers , and the few surviving families having been stripped of most of their property and efficient power in the course of the long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were first extensively recruited by the most conceited , mercenary and pusillanimous of her monarchs . Few of the English aristocracy of the present day enjoy titles granted anterior to the accession of James I. With the efflux of titular honors showered upon England by his mean-spirited favoritism , a tide of royal monopolies arose for the gratification of his courtiers . This was an abuse of commerce wholly destructive of its great objects , which was more pardonable at that time , than at the present day , when every man of intelligence perceives that equal justice is the soul of nfl commercial interchanges . Exclusive privileges are radically hostile to fair and honest dealings . When the list of royal charters granted by James was read in the House of Coinrnons , one of the members inquired whether the exclusive right of making bread had not been given by the king to some of his dependents * This question was asked only to express an opinion of the character of these monopolies . It was reserved for the ingenuity of the present age to contrive and execute a scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supply of food necessary for the subsistence of a whole people . With a few illustrious exceptions , the body of the hereditary lawgivers of England , whose nobility dates previous to the rise of the paper money system , owe their rank to the weakness of James I. , the arbitrary designs of his son and successor , and to the profligate tyranny of his two grandsons . rf he whole period since the abdication of James II . may be regarded as a single reign  --  the rule of public debt and paper money . Accessions have been made to the nobility from all quarters , both domestic and foreign-for all kinds of services , public and private , personal and political . The tide of corruption has swept away all land marks . Only two classes of society in fact now exist in England , tax payers and tax consumers ,  --  the latter including // those whose overgrown revenues are inflated by corn laws , and other schemes of plunder , devised for the purpose of upholding a paper system , which has entailed upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public debt amounting to within a fraction of four thousand millions of dollars . The tax-consumers exercise absolute power over the whole machinery of the state . Some idea of the processes employed may be understood by those who have contemplated the influence of debt and paper money upon our legislative bodies . While the theory of the English constitution  --  the prerogative of the crown , the authority of the hierarchy , and the privileges of the aristocracy-is the same as at the accession of the Stuart family , in practice the whole have been s*vallowed up by pecuniary influence . For more than a century England has been ruled with exclusive regard , not to the welfare of the people , but to the profit of the few who have obtained the command of Parliament . The House of Commons , which in theory represents the people , has degenerated into a mere private corporation ; the majority of whose members are elected like a board of bank directors , either by themselves , or by a few wealthy individuals whose dictation they arti obliged to obey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made subservient to the mercenary schemes of irresponsible persons who exercise the power of the state . The crown has become substantially dependent upon them . Measures which have involved the whole empire , flowed from their views of personal aggrandizement . The American Revolution was brought on by their determination to put their hands into our pockets without our consent . The wars for the subjugation of Asia were waged for plunder , as was amply proved by Burke . The crusade against France was solely undertaken and carried on to prevent the productive classes in England from participating in the hopes of ameliorating their condition , which had been excited by the prostration of the power of the privileged orders in the former country . In our article on the " Credit System , " which may be found in the Number for November , 1838 , the immediate profits of this enterprize to its managers was succinctly shown . By the public burdens occasioned by these measures , the population of the British Empire have been sunk in the scale of comfort to a relative condition even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one can contemplate the course of policy which has led to these results , without being deeply impressed by the contrast between the views of individuals belonging to the remaining families , who retain the property and honors derived from their remote ancestors , and those politicians who have puffed themselves into importance by paper money , public debt , government contracts , East and West India jobs , and by stock-gambling  --  a class which , in all countries where it has arisen to consequence , has been invariably opposed to the welfare of the people at large , and has always endeavore4 to restrict their political rights . While the remnant // of the ancient aristocracy have evinced their sincere conviction that public and private security can only be permanently promoted by enabling those who are compelled to maintain the burdens of government to participate in its functions , the parvenu dignities which have owed their elevation to traffic , trickery , and corrupt legislation , manifest the most deep rooted distrust of the people , and a settled hostility to the welfare and comfort of those classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident , or servility . In the speech of Sir James Mackintosh upon the bill for reforming the House of Commons , delivered in that House on the 4th of July , 1831 , that great ornament of literature and philosophy expressed himself on this point with great force . A single passage will serve to show the character of his views : " Those among the nobility distinguished by ample possessions , by historical names , by hereditary fame , interwoven with the glory of their country , have on this occasion been the foremost to show their confidence in the people , their unsuspecting liberality in the enlargement of popular privileges , their reliance on the sense and honesty of their fellow-citizens , as the best safeguard of property and of order , as well as of the other interests of society . " The tendency of our legislation towards the same channels which has led to the degradation of the bulk of the people of England and Ireland , has not sufficiently attracted the notice of our citizens . Denunciations of the swinish multitude as their own worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obey them , have indeed gone out of fashion of late . But is not the same hostility to the high est , *interests of the community displayed in plausible schemes for misleading the people by specious advantages-by hollow appeals to their cupidity ? Is not that affectation of liberality , humanity , and condescension , which is to be gratified by levying taxes upon the people , even more insulting than the strongest epithets of contumely ? During the discussions in Parliament upon the B eform Bill , it was admitted that one-third patt of the property in England had been created by corrupt legislation out of nonentity and was merely a dead weight upon the industry of that country . The most powerful objection urged against new modelling the House of Commons was that the security of this description of property might be hazarded whenever that House should represent the real interests of the people . It was estimated , on that occasion , that the whole value of the land , agricultural stock , and the capital employed in the production of food , amounted to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , timber , &amp;c. , to about two hundred and fifty millions  --  the dwelling houses , man ufactories , warehouses , shipping , &amp;c. , capital employed in commerce and manufactures , to five hundred and nine millions-making a grand total a little short of ten thousand millions of dollars . Upon this aggregate of property , the national debt o eight hundred millions sterling , somewhat more than three thousand six hundred mitl*ons of dollars is a perpetual mortgage , amounting // to more than one-third of its actual value , and requiring an annual payment of interest of one hundred and fifty millions of dollars from the earnings of the people , besides the maintainance of the royal dignity , the army and navy , and the cost of the vast public establishments at home and abroad . The operation of the taxes imposed upon the people for the purpose of meeting this annual exp*nditure was exhibited in a striking light , and fully explains the spectacle which the enormous wealth of the few , and the squalid poverty of the many , present to every observer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodities by taxation , the price was enhanced at least six pounds in the hands of the intermediate dealers , who required not only to be repaid the original advances made to the public revenue , but each demanded his ratio of profit in a regularly increasing progression from the consumers . The forty millions sterling collected by the excise and assessed taxes , were shown to have increased , the expenses of living to the people at least two hundred and forty millions . We may understand this process by reflecting that we often pay twenty dollars for a coat , the prime cost of which , to the importer , did not exceed twelve or fifteen shillings , though cloths do not necessarily pass through so many hands in this country , as exciseable commodities in England , before they reach the consumer . It is this vast enhancement of prices , so little understood by the people at large , which , in a free and equal government , constitutes the greatest objection to indirect taxation . Some of the most patriotic statesmen of England have earnestly advocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the pressure of this unequal burden , by paying off at once the national debt . This would reduce the nominal amount of property as we have seen about one-third , while the real wealth of the kingdom would be increased by enabling industry to enjoy its appropriate reward . Property would not be disturbed , any further than that the holders of the existing mortgage would be paid off . They are justly entitled to the portion of the capital of the country for which they hold security . But while industry can be compelled to pay the interest from its earnings , it can hardly be expected that the property holders who enjoy the whole control of legislation , will submit to this equitable exchange . In creating this enormous debt for their own advantage , they did not intend to assume its burden , so long as they were able to compel the laboring classes to bear it , who comprise more than three-fourths of the people . This is the true origin of the popular disturbances which have from time to time occasioned so much alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot . Chartism , Socialism , and all kinds of agrarian combinations , will inevitably flourish and increase among the industrious classes , wherever such an iniquitous system prevails . The law of force is alone sufficient to sustain it . By depriving the people of arms , by prohibiting them from meeting together , and by a rigid system of police which has recently been extended over // the whole kingdom , the public expression of their real feelings may be repressed for a brief period . But it is the invariable course of irresponsible power , to multiply its oppressions until they exceed human endurance . There is no probability that any alleviation of the burdens imposed upon the people of England by the paper system , will be voluntarily conceded by those who revel in power and wealth , by compelling the industrious classes to sustain the burdens* while they enjoy none of the benefits of government . Nothing is so precious to the privileged class of community as a vested right , however unjust and onerous to the people at large . If purchased by the corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either by direct pecuniary temptation , or by agreeing that each may participate in the plunder of the people , it becomes more valuable . But where are the great securities of government , public confidence and equal justice ? In 1831 the question came distinctly before the people of England , in the shape of Reform or Revolution . The corruptionists quailed upon this issue , and gave way to the adoption of the measure which it was fondly hoped would lead to a more equitable distribution of the public burdens , and secure the public tranquillity in all future time . No amelioration has taken place , artifices of the tax consumers are as potent as ever , and the desperation of the masses has grown deeper and more dangerous . They feel that they have been cheated in addition to being robbed . The internal condition of England at this time furnishes a lesson full of instruction , to all who desire to enrich themselves at the expense of the common *velfare by special legislation and conclusive privileges . No commentary which we might be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long cherished schemes of the party in this country who have endeavored to erect themselves into a tax-consuming aristocracy , would throw so much light upon the consequences of this policy as an attentive examination of the history of England for the last ten years , comprehending the agitation growing out of the question of Parliamentary Reform . We have now taken a hasty glance at the aristocracy of the two most enlightened nations of Europe . Our readers will be able to clothe the mere skeleton we have drawn . We have seen that the ancient nobility enjoyed great power , but they were coupled with corresponding duties . The abuse of these powers and the neglect of the duties , in the pursuit of vain schemes of personal ambition , destroyed the original ascendency of the order in England and France . In both countries the paper money power erected itself upon the ruins of the nobility . In France it rapidly ran *o the crisis which sooner or later is inevitable to its nature , and produced a train of social and financial disorders which resulted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on The pages of human history . In England the paper money power still retains its ascendency by means of-its control over all the functions of the government . Its progeny and supporter , the national debt , is princi // pally owned by its subjects , and it merely interferes with the domestic distribution of the earnings of industry . It takes from the poor his pittance to increase the superfluity of the rich , but nothing is abstracted from the general wealth of the nation . The power of corruption remains not only unimpaired , but appears to be increasing with the general poverty and dependence of the mass of the people . When it becanve necessary to organize a new form of government for this country in consequence of the relaxation of the sanctions of property arising from local rivalry , stimulated by the abuse of paper money , some of the individuals who had distinguished themselves in the Revolutionary contest , both in the cabinet and the field , manifested great distrust of the people , and professed to regard them a incapable of self-government . An aristocracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indispensable to the public security . They were foiled in the attempt to engraft this principle into the fundamental law of the new government , and indeed nothing could be more absurd than the enterprise . The equality which had prevailed in this country from its original settlement , the laws of distribution which secured the continuance of this equality in most of the States , as well as the spirit of the people and the character of their institutions happily coincided with the interests of humanity . The population of the United States , wholly different in this respect from that of the nations of Europe , had not been prepared for the ascendency of a privileged order by centuries of de-. grading dependcnce . The only aristocracy which it was possible to exert in this country until the customs and institutions of society should be wholly overturned and new modelled , could be only " lords of six weeks . " This title of nobility during the ascendency of the great coininercial republic over the commerce of the world , was habitually applied at Amsterdam to those who profusely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were encouraged to dissipate their means in order to keep them in dependence to the great corporation which controlled the trade of Asia at that time . The same kind of nobility flourishes in many of our cities , though our languages does not enable us to designate them in a word so significant as the Dutch phrase . The example of England in the creation of a paper money power , led the projectors of an aristocratical class , notwithstanding the disastrous experience of this country in the evils of paper money , to organize a system in avowed imitation of that of the mother country . The machinery of a national debt , in connexion with paper money banking , was established under the forms of law . The supporters and advocates of this system have urbdoubtedly been disappointed in the intelligence and capacity of the people of this country . The world has seen that crafty and sagacious men , in attempting to overreach the whole community like ours , may succeed for a time , but eventually will be duped by a blind confidence in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time inflicted enormous // losses and sufferings upon the community , but the contrivers and managers have not always escaped their full proportion of the afflictions prepared for others . The foundation of these schemes was laid in creating corporations under the irresponsible control of a few individuals , with power to issue , without personal liability , the representative of the universal standard of value . The charter of such a corporation was held to be a vested right which could not be annulled by the power which created it , though exercised by representative agents in defiance of the wishes and interests of their principals . When once obtained , by whatever means , it was absolute and irresponsible . It enabled its managers to control the whole property of the country . A dollar belonging to them was as valuable for all the purposes of active life as ten or even twenty times the amount in the hands of any body else ; for this dollar might be represented by paper ten or twenty times over at their option . Such a currency among an enterprizing people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambling . The security of property and the means of subsistence , continually fluctuated with the vibrations of a pyramid standing upon its apex , instead of its base . The state of constant alarm and apprehension into which all commercial men have been thrown by this system , has afforded its managers a never failing fund of plausible reasons for urging them to embark in political intrigues for the purpose of increasing its power over the people . They have been compelled to withdraw their attention from their pursuits , in order to study the possible consequence of some scheme of special legislation . How many instances might be mentioned of measures adopted within the last forty years which produced results directly the reverse of those contemplated by the contrivers ? One of the most striking and familiar cases is the deposite law of 1836 . The managers and dependents of the banks in all parts of the country were clamorous for this measure . They doubtless believed it would increase and confirm the prosperity , with which the speculations of that and the preceding year , stimulated by enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercantile community . It was plausibly urged , that many millions of money belonging to the people were locked up in a few banks , and kept from the use of its true owners . The secret design undoubtedly was , to require this public money which had been loaned to the customers of these banks , to be called for at once by law , which must destroy the credit of the banks in consequence of their inability to refund it , the Government become bankrupt , and Congress compelled to recharter the Bank of the United States in order to carry on the public service . No clearer proof of this intention can be required than is found in the terms of this law . Its leading enactment prohibits any bank from holding an amount of monet on deposite , exceeding three-fourths of its capital stock . It was notorious to every body who had seen the Treasury reports , that the *most important deVOL . VIII . NO . XXXI1. - AUGUST , 1840 . I // posite banks , held at the date of this law , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be lawfully permitted to remain for a single day after its passage . This money had been loaned to the mercantile community and invested . To compel the collection of this money at once , for the purpose in the first place of depositing it in other banks , and six months afterwards with the States , was requiring both banks and merchants to make sacrifices ruinous to both . The most marvellous circumstance connected with this measure was , that it was mainly advocated by those who professed peculiar-nay almost exclusive attachment both to the banks and the merchants . Though this measure was obviously designed to bring the Bank of the United States again into power , it is difficult to foresee the final operation of such schemes . To prevent the alarming progress of the exchange of the public domain for bank credits so deeply jeopardied by this measure , President Jackson had ordered the famous specie circular to be issued . At the following session Mr. Rives followed up the game , by his bill requiring bank notes to be received into the Treasury . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be wholly ignorant of its intended operation . At the present period , with three more years of experience in regard to currency , probably few individuals can be found who can not perceive the object of that measure to have been , to place the whole productive interests of the Union within the control of the most profligately managed banks . Those whose currency was of the least value would alone furnish the currency to be paid into the Treasury . Whatever limitation was made as to their notes being payable in specie , will now be regarded as mere superfluity , if not intended to deceive the unwary . In a short time the Treasury would have been filled with paper currency wholly unavailable . Then the same necessity would arise for the charter of the Bank of the United States as existed in 1816 . Whenever the public Treasury can command nothing but paper currency , depreciated at the pleasure of the speculators who manufacture it , there seems to be no other mode of carrying on the functions of government . It was doubtless to avert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patriotic Jackson refused to sign this bill . Happily for the country , the recent passage of the law organizing a public Treasury independent of the banks , wholly obviates all such schemes for the future , unless the speculators may hereafter find a Congress and President sufficiently corrupt to be willing to sell the welfare of the people , without any possible pretext of public necessity or prosperity to justify such an outrage upon the Constitution . That is their only hope . And it is the secret of the present struggle . The holders of the hundreds of millions of state stocks and corporation debts in every part of the United States which are now depressed in value , and many of them unsaleable at any price , have been led to believe that this property will at once be enhanced from ten to fifty per cent . by a // change of administration . Influential politicians , undoubtedly from the suggestions of the stock-jobbers of London , have taken unwearied pains to impress these opinions upon interested parties , in order to induce them to contribute money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such guides , which the last ten years have furnished , it would seem to be a wise conclusion that the people of this country are not yet prepared for the fate of those of England . Reflecting men , of each political party , in every quarter of the country , have generally made up their minds that the system of paper banking , as heretofore managed , is not only one of the greatest frauds ever inflicted upon the prosperity and security of property in any country , but that it has been the source of most of the imposture and extravagance which has been visited upon society . If an aristocratical order of privileged individuals is to be maintained for the purpose of expelling honesty , industry , and the just principles of commercial interchange from the transactions of the whole community , it may be founded upon paper money banking . This system would he peculiarly fitted for the establishment of such an order , since its power is wholly dependent on ignorance and credulity , on the part of its victims , with a corresponding extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital required is the privilege of controlling and collecting exorbitant taxes . When charters refer to the amount of capital , the debts of the managers is meant . Property is not required in the outset , for that is intended to be acquired from the earnings of others , by interest and exchange on paper currency , supported by taxation . As long as the industry of the community can be compelled to contribute one-half or three-fourths of the profits of labor to sustain such a paper system , we may gradually approximate to the condition of the English aristocracy , until from the tenuity of the bubble , or some rude shock , an explosion is produced . The principal sufferers will he those who refused confidence in the system . The managers have either nothing to lose , or have succeeded in deriving sufficient property from its operations to qualify them to administer consolation in the shape of homilies to the ruined dependents of the system , upon commercial integrity , and the necessity of maintaining the credit of our institutions abroad . For a country like ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which find a ready demand in the great markets of the commercial world-favored with political institutions as free as is consistent with the preservation of property and good order-inhabited by people of plain manners and simple habits , to tolerate a factitious currency in the ordinary transactions of life , is not less absurd than it would be to imitate the example of the citizens of London in spending the daylight in slumber , and depend upon artificial illumination for business or amusement . A whole community may , by degrees , be brought to believe sunshine is not so convenient as gas-light . In a great , compactly built city , fashion and custom may induce its citizens to carry on the // bulk of their most important business during the hours of natural darkness . The explosion of all the gas-pipes of London would not produce so much suffering and distress , as artificial currency controlled by a few individuals has repeatedly brought upon our citizens . Lamps and candles are much more readily provided than sound currency , when all the channels of circulation have been filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . Those who choose to employ artificial light , or factitious money , may follow their tastes or convenience . But to compel the whole community to adopt either , by employing it in all public transactions , by the authority of law , for the advantage of a few speculators , seems the highest degree of infatuation . An agricultural community has , or ought to have , other employments besides watching the gasometer , or pursuing the tricks of bank directors and stock-jobbers . The property of the American farmer has not been acquired by the dark manoeuvres of financiering . It has been wrought from the soil by hard labor in the face of day . Nothing can be more grossly unjust , than to bind him hand and foot to a combination of irresponsible persons enabled by law to control the currency , and to wield the consequent monopoly of the market . The discordant values of this artificial currency in the several sections of the Union , have not been less destructive to the true interests of those who manufacture and distribute the products of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is employed to pay debts in one State , is regarded with contempt in another . This can not be cured by an additional flood of paper currency , but by adhering to the universal standard of value , established by the Constitution as a remedy for these evils . This has been strenuously resisted in our legislative bodies by those who profess to be the peculiar supporters of commerce and manufactures . So striking has their disregard of these important interests become , that one of the most distinguished statesmen of the country stated in the Senate , while the bill for preventing smuggling was under discussion , that the members who had usually advocated the interests of the merchants had totally abandoned them in support of the Banks . It is upon their exclusive privileges that the upholders of the aristocratic principle have taken their position . In point of fact , none other has been found tenable-because upon other questions than the complex one of currency , it has generally been found impossible to grant exclusive privileges to any favored body of individuals . Upon this men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has accordingly been the salient point of all assaults upon the public security , and the order , tranquillity and comfort of social life . Having suggested that Captain Marryatt derived his ideas in regard to the defects of our political system from the leaders of the Opposition , as well as his remedy for these evils , it is but just to show by some further extracts the servility with which he follows their track throughout his book . The respect and regard with which he invariably al // ludes to them , and the vitipuration he misses no opportunity of visiting upon the Administration , indicate the extent of his obligations . For instance , Mr. Clay , according to the Captain , " invariably leads the van in everything which is liberal and gentleman-like , " p. 71 ,  --  while " that the morals of the nation have retrograded from the total destruction of the aristocracy , both in the government and in society , which has taken place within the last ten years , is most certain . " " The power has fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under government have been chiefly filled up by their favorites , either being poor and needy men from their own class , or base and dishonest men who have sacrificed their principles and consciences for place . I shall enter more fully into this subject hereafter ; it is quite sufficient at present to say , that during Mr. Adams 's Presidency , a Mr. Benjamin Walker was a defaulter to the amount of $18,000 , and was in consequence incarcerated for two years . Since the democratic party have come into power the quantity of defeulters and the sums which have been embezzled of government money are enormous , and no punishment of any kind has been attempted . They say it is only a breach of trust , and that a breach of trust is not punishable except by a civil action ; which certainly in the United States is of little avail , as the payment of the money can always be evaded . The consequence is , that you meet with defaulters , I will not say in the very best society generally , but in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have myself sat down to a dinner party , to which I had been invited , with a defaulter to government on each side of me . I knew one that was setting up for Congress , and strange to say , his delinquency was not considered by the people as an objection . An American author states , on 17th June , 1838 , the United States ' Treasurer reported to Congress sixty-three defaulters ; the total sums embezzled amounting to one million , twenty thousand and odd dollars ! " ' This specimen of charging upon the democracy the sins of its opponents with which the book abounds , affords us an insight of the grounds upon which the stock-jobbers of London have based their expect ? *tion of controlling the enactment of laws for this country . Taking this representation of our people , and their habitual disregard to personal in - tegrity in the choice of their political agents to be accurate , nothing could be more natural than the belief that we had already reached the point of corruption which saddled its immense national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but a breach of trust , and not a pe*na1 offence , is no fault of the democracy . From the first message of President Van Buren to Congress up to the present session unremitting efforts have been made to apply the only effectual remedy to this evil . But the party who hold that banks and bank-officers have a right to employ the money raised by the taxation of the people for their individual profit , have uniformly resisted the enactment of provisions which might involve personal liability in the perpetration of such abuses . It will be borne in mind that the writer of the following concentrated essence of the federal doctrine did not visit the United States until 1837 , when the authority of the executive and the dominion of the laws were prostrated at once by the measures pursued by the banks and their supporters . // At this eventful period could a stranger from abroad perceive in the position taken by the national executive in support of the public faith , only personal ambition , corruption , love of expediency , and conz ! empt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vices of the Americans are chiefly to he attributed to their present form of government . The example of the Executive is most injurious . It is insatiable in its ambition , regardless of its faith , corrupt in the highest degree , never legislating for morality , but always for expediency . This is the first cause of the low standard of morals ; the second is the want of an aristocracy to set an example and give a tone to society . These are followed by the errors incident to the voluntary system of religion , and a democratic education . To these must be superadded the want of moral courage , arising from the dread of public opinion , and the natural tendency of a democratic form of government to excite the spirit of gain as the main spring of action , and the summum bonum of existence . " The following is a mild specimen of the manner in which Captain Marryatt was taught to mention the present head of the government , page 120 : " Let us examine what Mr. Van Buren says in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A National Bank , he tells them , would impair the rightful supremacy of the popular will . ' " And this he follows up with that most delicate species of flattery , that of praising them for the very virtue they are most deficient in ; telling them they are a people to whom the truth , however unpromising , can be always told with safety . ' " At the very time when they were defying all law and all government , he says , It was reserved for the American Union to test the advantage of a government entirely dependent on the continual exercise of the popular will , and our experience has shown that it is beneficent in practice as well as it is just in theory . ' " At the very time when nearly the whole Union were assisting the insurrection in Canada with men and money , he tells them , that temptations to interfere in the intestine commotions of neighboring countries have been thus far successfully resisted . ' " This is quite enough ; Mr. Van Buren 's motives are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his part ; but how can you expect a people to improve who never hear the truth ? " His remarks upon the newspaper press of this country are too copious for quotation . As might be expected , he mentions Webb , Noah , and Prentice , with unqualifled approbation . But it will be perceived by the following extract , that he is hardly complimentary to their readers : * Every man in America reads his newspaper , and hardly anything else ; and while he considers that he is assisting to govern the nation , he is in fact , the dupe of those who pull the strings in secret , and by flattering his vanity , and exciting his worst feelings , make him a poor tool in their hands . People are too apt to imagine that the newspapers echo their own feelings ; when the fact is , that by taking in a paper which upholds certain opinions , the readers are by daily repetition become so impressed with these opinions , that they have become slaves to them . I have before // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , and but too often is the occasion of the demoralization of those who might have been more virtuous and happy in their ignorance. ** We now close our notice of Capt . Marryatt 's book with the following curious passage from page 121 . It seems to be a reqitiem or lament over such of his friends as have flinched , and a description of the chivalry which is now waging battle in support of his doctrines : " It appears that the more respectable portions of its citizens have retired , leaving the arena open to those who are best worthy ; that the majority dictate and scarcely any one ventures to oppose them ; if any one does he is immediately sacrificed ; the press , obedient to its masters , pours out its virulence , and it is incredible how rapidly a man , unless he be of a superior mind , falls into nothingness in the United States , when once he has dared to oppose the popular will .

The idea of an American wasting his time in unprofitable recollections of half a century ago-still more , that of his writing and publishing them-is indeed a flat contradiction of the wise king 's dictum , that there is nothing new under * Reminiscences of the Last Sixty-Five Years , commencing with the Battle of Lexington .

At least under the sun that has illumined our half of this mundane spheroid , since we have started on our young career as a nation , so extraordinary a phenomenon has never to our knowledge been witnessed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasanter kind of writing than personal reminiscences . True too , that in the infinite variety of adventurous enterprise and curious incident afforded by our early history and growth-in the vast numbers of men of original and remarkable character which such times and such circumstances must have createdin the close connexion which has subsisted between the personal occurrences of private biography , and the general progress of public history , elevating the former to a participation in the interest and importance of the latter  --  and in the incredible contrasts between the past and the present which , from the rapidity of our national movement and developement , the memories of thousands among us must present-no people , it would seem , could boast a more abundant store of materials from which to derive rich entertainment in this most agreeable department of literature . The fact remains , however , unquestionable , that the American genius is adverse to Reminiscences ; none of us write them-few of us would probably read them . The truth is , that our attention is so completely absorbed by the present and the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past . Our eyes are ever bent forward , and rarely cast behind us . Not only are our thoughts and energies engrossed by the unresting activity to which we devote our present ; but of the future toward which this unparalleled national movement is bearing us on , such grand though shadowy anticipations are for ever vaguely present before our minds , that the things of the past have but little interest or value for us . Progress-indefinite , unpausing progress-is our primary law ; a great truth which Crockett most unconsciously shadowed forth in the well known maxim which he has bequeathed to us , and which has come already to be regarded almost universally as our national motto- " Go ahead ! " Hence doubtless the reason that history is so little read among us , in comparison with the attention it receives in an European course of study-under an order of things of which conservatism is the primary idea , and where the pervading interest of all those classes to whom it has bequeathed rank , wealth , and power , is that the future should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the past . Hence , too , may we perhaps add , the singular want of public interest prevailing among us with regard to historical monuments . How few of our cities can boast any even of the humblest kind . The largest of them possesses absolutely none . Pages might be filled with the list of the abortive attempts that have been set on foot , in various places , with a view to the erection of statues of Washington , profoundly and devotedly as his memory is and will always be revered . And if one of our large cities should // be cited in disproof of the remark , the very fact that the construct ion of two monuments- ( the one in commemoration of its defence against the threatened sack and pillage of an invading army , and the other in honor of the Father of his Country ) - should suffice to procure for it par excellence the distinguishing title of " the Monumental City , " only serves to convert the single exception into a more striking illustration of the rule . While on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our cities the most abounding in private wealth , liberality and public spirit , itself the birth-place of the Revolution , and bound by the strongest obligations both of local and national patriotism not to leave the honorable duty unperformed-have we not seen in Boston the project of the monument on Bunker Hill dragging its slow length along for years , languishing with seeming hopelessness of accomplishment for the want of a few thousand dollars ? And at last , after having so long shamed with the aspect of its unfinished mass , not only the city which it overlooks , but the whole surrounding country which owes to the blood there shed all the teeming blessings of liberty in which it is for ever rejoicing and exulting , if it appears now at last about to rise to the completion of its design , it is only by means which do as little credit to the patriotic liberality of the men , as they do honor to the spirit and energy of the women , of New England . But we are wandering very far from Mr. Thomas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train of reflection . His personal history may be briefly told . He " entered upon the threshold of existence , " as himself informs us , soon after the earliest military movements of the Revolution , at West Cambridge , in the neighborhood of Boston . In 1788 he went to live with his uncle , Isaiah Thomas , at Worcester , at the solicitation of the latter , to learn the art of printing . Of Isaiah Thomas an interesting account is given , chiefly extracted from " Lincoln 's History of Worcester . " He was a zealous patriot preceding and during the Revolutionary War , and as a political writer , and editor of the " Massachusetts Spy , " had made himself so obnoxious to the British that he had the honor of being included with John Hancock and Samuel Adams in a list of twelve persons who were to be summarily executed when ta*en . He became an extensive publisher , and a man of distinguished mark . Among other literary productions , he was the author of a History of Masonry , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and value . He was the first man , as his nephew tells us , that ever read the Declaration of Independence in Massachusetts ; the express on his way from Philadelphia to Boston having stopped at Worcester on the 14th of July , 1776 , and waited until he read it from the steps of the meeting-house to the listening citizens , who received it with every demonstration of rejoicing . In 1792 Mr. Thomas left his uncle , with whom he describes his apprenticeship as having been an ordeal of pretty severe service , and removed to Bos // ton , where he spent two years at the book-binding business  --  and a couple more in a dry goods store-when in May , 1795 , he proceeded to Charleston , South Carolina , in true independent Yankee style , in quest of his fortune , with decent clothes on his back , ( for which he had given his " note , " ) and in his pocket the life of Franklin , and a dollar and a half . Not long after his arrival in Charleston , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance the Reminiscences which he has lived to the year 1840 to record . " On the first of October " - such is the laconic quaintness with which lie records the event- " I was taken with the yellow fever . On the fifth a coffin was made for me . On the 10th I walked out . " He soon after opened . a stationery and book store , in connexion with Mr. Caleb Cushing , from Boston-whose ancestral propinquity we are left to conjecture to the present not undistinguished possessor of the same name . His partner , however , having been attacked with the yellow fever in the following summer , was less fortunate than himself had been , having , instead of " walking out , " been " carried off , " as we are told , after an illness of six days . He was very suc* cessful in his business , which led him to make a number of voyages to Europe . After a residence of twelve years he removed to Providence , R. I. , where he had before , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earliest established in the United States . In this he was soon induced to sell out his share by the persuasions of the family of his wife , who resided in Baltimore ; and he established himself on a farm in the vicinity of the latter city . The long embargo soon intervened in 1808 , bringing produce down to less than half the usual prices ; and in the fall of 1809 , he purchased the " City Gazette " in Charleston , selling a portion of his farm at a sacrifice , and returned to Charleston , and assumed the editorial charge of his paper on the first of January , 1810 . He continued it for six years , receiving from it so large an income as to be enabled to retire again to his farm in Maryland , in 1817 , with a liberal independence . He became a scientific agriculturist , and went to the Legislature of the State . He was a zealous partisan of General Jackson . By the year 1827 he found himself , through a series of misfortunes growing out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that period , an utterly ruined man . He removed to the Ohio with his family , andinthebeginningof 1829 , establishedat Cincinnati a paper under the title of " The Commercial Daily Advertiser . " Having abandoned the support of General Jackson toward the close of his first term of office , he was the author of the abortive nomination of Judge McLean . He soon afterward found himself compelled again to sell out his paper , for which , as he informs us , he has never yet received the first cent of payment . In May , 1835 , he commenced another , the " Daily Evening Post , " which he devoted very zealously to the support of General Harrison . In December *ast the want of support compelled him to // discontinue it-since which time he has occupied himself with the publication of the present volumes , and in a tour which has extended above three thousand miles , into half the States of the Union , in which , he informs us , he has addressed the people fifteen times on the coming Presidential Election  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before that event . If , therefore , such a calamity should be in store for the country as the possible election of the candidate in whose behalf Mr. Thomas is thus zealous and eloquent , we cheerfully give him the benefit of the humble influence we shall possess in the councils of a Whig administration , by sincerely recommending him as a very fitting person for some comfortable appointment , which shall afford a consolation to his advanced age for the misfortunes which have cast their shadows over its decline . So much for the life of which these volumes present the Reminiscences . Being apparently a man of intelligence , cultivation , and enterprise , and having filled for so many years the influential position of a leading political editor , Mr. Thomas 's associations have been a good deal cast among men of whom it is highly interesting to read his personal sketches . If we were disposed to be fastidious , we might indeed complain that his volumes are very far from what such opportunities as he has enjoyed might have rendered them  --  and might even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there enters a very considerable infusion of the element for which there is no more polite name than the expressive one of humbug . ' This is especially true of the second volume , the greater part of which appears to be eked out with long extracts from various books and newspapers , together with random political articles from the columns of his late newspaper . Of these we can only say that they bear very little relation to the title under which the volumes recommend themselves to sale ; and that if the unconscious pride of paternity has persuaded their author that they were worth rescuing from the oblivion of his dust-buried files , to be thus resuscitated in the expanded and embellished glory of the double-leaded and hot-pressed pages before us , it is an innocent illusion in which he certainly must be content to stand " solitary and alone . " But in the matter of Americim Reminiscences we are not , and have no right to be , fastidious . We receive thankfully what we can get ; and for the sake of the many grains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can not fill a few of our own pages more agreeably than by the quotation of a few of the interesting passages of personal reminiscence of distinguished men from which we have derived no little entertainment . There is a good deal of interesting gossip about the antiquities of Boston , which we commend especially to our Eastern brethren . The following is the picture which he presents of Charleston in 1795 , in which the Southern reader will be struck with many points of marked contrast with the Charleston of the present day : // " On the 10th of June , we arrived at Charleston ; the appearance of which was so totally different from Boston , that I could scarcely realize the idea , that it was a part of the American Union , and under the same government . The city , as you approach it , with its numerous wharves crowded with shipping , ( bearing the flags of all nations , ) and covered with extensive blocks of well built ware-houses , with the lofty and splendid steeple of St. Michael 's , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising in the back ground , with the dead level of the city , and the surrounding country , far beyond where the eye can reach , presents to the view of the New Englander , or the European , a spectacle new and interesting , so totally unlike their father land , that their curiosity can not fail to be excited by it . " GENET , the first minister from the French Republic to the United States , landed in Charleston , where he made a liberal distribution of commissions for privateers , which were not suffered to remain useless , as might be distinctly seen , by the number of Dutch and other prize ships that were then laying at the wharves . Of the numerous vessels that crowded this then great commercial mart , scarcely one in five bore the stars and stripes . ' The flags of Hamburg , Bremen , Altona , and Lubeck , were the most numerous ; while the British , French , Dutch , and an occasional Spanish or Portuguese , made up the variety . A large portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as did the shipping in their colors . There were entire streets inhabited by the French , ( Union-street , for instance , with a slight sprinkling of Spanish and Portuguese , ) many of whom had fled from the massacre of St. Domin , , o , and others were brought there by the allurements of privateering ; among the latter was Boutelle , who had acquired great wealth by his numerous captures . Before I arrived there , this man gave a public entertainment , of which hundreds partook , and at which , the heads were taken from the wine casks placed in the street for the use of the multitude . At the close of the entertainment , a procession was formed , led by Boutelle , ( preceded by a band of music , ) arm and arm with Charles Coatsworth Pinckney , afterward ambassador to France , a Major General in the army of the United States , and twice the Federal candidate for the Presidency . In this style they marched to the theatre . " There was a regular established Jacobin Club in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I arrived there . The most noisy and active member of the club was a Frenchman , by the name of Davernett , between sixty and seventy years of age , who wore , instead of a hat , a red worsted cap upon his head , and could he heard , at all hours of the day , by personis walking in Broad-street , before they got within a hundred yards of him , promulgating his Jacobinical doctrines , in a style of vociferation known only to such men as he was , and the Billingsgate fish-women of London . About this time , Robert Goodloe Harper came from the interior to reside in Charleston ; he fought his way into notice by a duel with one of the Rutledges , who , I believe , escaped , as several of them have , by the hollowness of their hacks , not of their heads . Harper became a member , and I believe Vice-President of the club , wearing the bonnet roage , ' with grace and dignity . I leave my readers to judge as to the affinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his distinguished brother , Edward , were both living . John , who had been chosen Dictator in the Revolution , was , by Washington , appointed Chief Justice of the United States , and held one court in Philadelphia , before it was discovered that he was subject to fits of insanity . Edward succeeded Yanderhorst or Charles Pinckney , as Governor of the State , and died in that high office ; he was a most accomplished gentleman and eloquent orator . After John 's fits of insanity had increased upon him , he was elected a member of the State Legislature , upon the ground that if he had a lucid interval of a day , he would do more for the general good in that period , than any half dozen others could do during the session ; he had the lucid interval , and did do it . " At the period I have been speaking of , Charleston was the most aristocratit* city in the Union , notwithstanding her Jacobin club , with her red liberty caps , and // fraternal 1iug* . Thcre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a few with that appendage there were Pierce Butler , cousin of the Duke of Ormond , Sir John Nesbitt , Baronet , the Right Honourable Richard Beresford , if my memory serves , brother of Lord Beresford , with some others that do not occur to me at this moment ; also old lady Mary Middleton she was a smart business lady , although advanced in life ; she kept her own accounts , and attended to the business of her estates personally . The door of the St. Cecilia Society ' was shut to the plebeian and the man of business , with the two exceptions of Adam Tunno , king of her Scotch , and William Crafts , vice-king of the Yankees , under their legitimate head Nathaniel Russel , than whom there was no better man . A large portion of the most distinguished families of those days were descendants of the French ; who *ed at the revocation of the edict of Nantz , and took up their abode in South Carolina ; among them the Hugers , the Horrys , the Porchers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . The professions of her leading men in those days were of the Jefferson school , but their practice was aristocracy complete . But aristocracy can not long exist without hereditary estates and titles : as a proof of it , there is scarcely a distinguiahed man in their whole State now , who has descended from any of those ariatocratic families who then gave tone to society and laws to the State . The present Mayor of Charleston , the Honourable H. L. Pinckney , son of Charles , is a striking exception . The aristocracy of wealth and family have been compelled to give way to the aristocracy of mind ; all her most distinguished men of the present day are self-made ; for instance , Calhoun , McDuffie , Hayne , Hamilton , Pettigrew , Duncan , Cheves , Legare , R. Yeadon , jr. , and a host of others , forming all together an aggregate of talent not equalled by the population of any other State in the Union . " The aristocracy I have alluded to was carried to that extent that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; even the learned professions were admitted into the front rank in society only to a limited extent . All the merchants , with a very few exceptions , were from the Eastern States , or Europe . The commerce of Charleston , at the period I am speaking of , far exceeded anything of later years , as her exports were great , and her imports were equal not only to her own consumption , but to supply a large portion of Georgia on the one hand , and North Carolina on the other . The forced and smuggling trade to the then Spanish and Portuguese South American colonies , in British manufactures , was immense and extremely lucrative , bringing in return large quantities of specie , and innumerable cargoes of coffee , cocoa , and sugar , which were reshipped to Hamburg , Bremen , Amsterdam , &amp;c . Many of the merchants accumulated large fortunes , which enabled them to cope with the wealthiest planters in their style of living . Everything was imported , even to the birch twigs for sweeping vessels ' decks The great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tobacco . Cotton was so little known and cultivated , that Mr. Jay , in his famous treaty , made no provision for its introduction into England ; a circumstance which caused both him and the treaty to be spoken of with the most marked contempt by the citizens . I was present and heard the pourin , , s out of their wrath against it when it reached Charleston in July , 1795 . The excitement was great : a meeting was called at St. Michael 's Church , which was addressed by the Rutledges , and by John J. Priugle . In the midst of the proceedings , Charles Piuckney arrived from the country , and gave vent to his feelings in a most tremendous burst of indignant eloquence against the treaty . He was very great at a philipic , on the spur of the occasion ; besides he was an excellent political writer ; he was the author of the different series of numbers signed A Republican , ' in the City Gazette , ' between 1810 and 1816 . Joseph Alaton wrote The Mountaineer ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of ' Sidney , ' Junites , ' and Biampden , ' the latter pending the second election of Mr. Madison . It is a fact highly creditable to the distiu*uishel men of South Carolina , that in allcases of emergency they fly to the aid of the press , not leaving Editors , as in mos // places , to sustain the cause alone . In all such cases , the periodical press of South Carolina pours forth a torrent of intellect nowhere else to be met with . Truth compels me to admit , however , that the object of it is too often State , at the expense of National politics . " * * * * " Among the eminent men of Charleston in those days , besides the Rutledges and Pinckneys , already mentioned , were Generals Moultrie and Gadaden . Each of those veterans of the Revolution were , I should think , upward of seventy when I first saw them . Moultrie 's memoirs have been published since I left Charleston , but I have not seen them . He was the hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His gallant and successful defence of it on the 28th of June , 1776 , had he done nothing else , would have handed his name down to the remotest posterity . But he was not more celebrated for his bravery and skill in war , than for all those virtues that adorn the domestic circle in peace . He was the best company of any man I ever saw of his years , and could set the table in a roar whenever it suited him . The old loved , the young venerated and respected him . He was a great favorite with the ladies , whose faithful admirer and most chivalrous defender he had ever been . General Gadaden was his senior . I saw only enough of him to learn to appreciate him as a soldier of the Revolution , and a patriotic and most enterprising citizen . Governor Charles Pinckney used to relate the following excellent anecdote of the venerable patriot with great good humor , although it was at his ( Mr. Pinckney 's ) own expense . Mr. Piuckney inherited a fortune ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having had a finished education , his first object was to get elected to the Legislature , which then set in Charleston . It so happened that his overseer was appointed judge of the election , which was held a few miles from town . The day was very stormy : Mr. Piuckney went and voted , the judge voted , and none else went to vote ; consequently he wa* returned duly elected . When the Legislature met , and Mr. Piuckney had qualified , General Gadsdeu rose with great gravity , and said , Mr. Speaker , I congratulate the House upon having young gentlemen of talents and fortune come among us ; and , sir , what adds greatly to the interest upon this occasion , I understand the gentleman has the unanimoux vote of his constituents . ' This put the house in a roar. ** We have here a glimpse of the old Massachusetts bar in its parlor days-with a passing reference to the good old times of the Alien and Sedition Laws : " in August , or September , ( 1798 , ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded . The great Sprague cause was to he tried , in which , if my memory serves , one hundred and sixty thousand dollars were depending . The counsel engaged were probably the most powerful that ever were engaged in one cause , in this or any other country . When I name them , I think that all who knew them will admit the truth of my remark . There were Theophilus Parsons , Samuel Dexter , Fisher Ames , Laban Wheaton , George Richards Minot , Harrison Gray Otis , Rufus Gray Amory , and - Harrington . I was then reading law under the direction of the late Judge Johnson , of the United States Supreme Court , and the town being so full , my hostess requested me to take some of the gentlemen into my rooms . To this I made no objection , provided I made my own selection . I did so  --  and took Messrs . Dexter , Wheaton , and Harrington . We had a parlor and bed-room , in the former of which we ate , and in the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seasonable hour , it was one or two in the morning , before we slept , particularly if Mr. Dexter was in the vein ; for he abounded in anecdote , and while he talked , none could , nor wished to sleep . " * * * * * " Mr. Dexter and Mr. Parsons were pitted against each other . Mr. Amory had hunted up all the authorities and placed a mark at each . Mr. Dexter requested me 02 // to take a seat beside him , and hand him the authorities as he wanted them , which afforded me the best possible opportunity of hearing every word that escaped the lips of that great man . Placing one foot upon a chair , and folding his arms across his breast , he began ; and such a continued stream of reasoning , without noise and without effort , ( it was like pouring oil from a flask , ) as he poured out for hours , I never heard before , nor since . Mr. Parsons made several attempts to interrupt him . At last Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you have an overflow of wit , have the goodness to reserve it for the close : you have already driven several ideas out of my head . ' The Chief Justice remarked : never mind , Mr. Dexter ; if he should deprive you of as many more , you would still have enough left for Mr. Parsons . ' There were no more attempts at interruption . " Mr. Parsons ' style , it is in vain for me to attempt to designate by any other appellation than a sledge-hammer style , beating down all before it with such tremendous effect , as to make it very difficult to keep in view even a portion of what had been said by those who had preceded him . He was a great sloven ; wore a bandanna handkerchief tied carelessly about his neck , and his beard and his shirt a week sometimes , or he was slandered ; but if I were to judge from appearances , there was more truth than poetry in it . He was a man of mighty mind ; and as long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout New England as the giant of the law . ' " Mr. Wheaton was a graceless speaker , without eloquence in matter or manner , but his reasoning powers were only second to Mr. Dexter . " Mr. Otis was a man of fine face and perfect symmetry of person , remarkably neat in his dress , of the most engaging manners , an eloquent and fascinating speaker , though not a profound reasoner . " Mr. Ames was eloquence personified ; the silvery tones of his voice fell upon the ear like strains of sweetest music ; you could not choose but listen with delight , but when he had finished , the effect died away upon your mind , as the sound had done upon your ear ; the impression was not lasting ; he could not beat it into you , as Parsons , *Dexter , and Wheaton could . " I am not certain that Messrs . Minot , ( the American Sallust , ) Amory , and Harrington , spoke on the occasion ; if they did , it has escaped my memory : they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anecdote of Mr. Ames I must not omit , although it cost a hearty laugh at his expense . There lived in Dedham a laborer , a man of great natural wit and smartness of repartee , by the name of Kingsley . He had a great dislike to Mr. Ames , and never let pass an opportunity of showing it . A town meeting was held , at which Mr. Ames made an able and eloquent speech . Kingsley , in his dirty frock and trowsers , had taken a seat in the adjoining pew ; and no sooner had Mr. Ames finished , than he rose and said : Mr. Moderator , my brother Ames ' eloquence reminds me of nothing but the shining of a fire-fly , which gives just light enough to show its own insignificance ; ' and down he sat , having thus at a blow , by exciting the risibles of the audience , destroyed all the effect of Mr. Ames ' eloquence . " In August or September , 1 wrote Sidney , ' addressed to President Adams , and sent it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chronicle , published by Adams and Rhodes , who never knew who was the author . Two days after , I rode into Boston and found that Sidney was published , and made quite a stir upon cluinge ; ' and I was not a little flattered to learn that it was attributed to the celebrated Doctor Charles Jarvis , who declared to me he was not the author , nor did he know who was . All of this I could readily believe , as there was but one person , besides myself , in the secret . Mr. Russel came out in the Centinel ' very severe upon the Doctor ; and that there should be no mistake as to whom he took for the author , he said , The cabinet end jalap of the law would soon be administered to him . ' This satisfied me that they had no suspicion of my being the author . The // Sedition Law was then in the full tide of successful experiment , and I had no particular desire to come within the reach of its tender mercies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment of . Adams and Rhodes were prosecuted for the publication , and Mr. Adams died while the prosecution was pending . My friend to whom I had confided the authorship could not keep a secret , but must tell it to Doctor Ames , and it became known to some few others . The court met soon after , and the judge gave it in charge to the grand jury ; and so far as he had been able to get information on the subject , recommended me to their particular attention ; but it was too late ; the bird had flown ; I was then at Newport , on my way to Charleston . " The following personal sketches are well worth the space they oc-cupy : " JOHN RANDOLPH-On a bright sunny morning , early in Februray , 1796 , might have been seen entering my book-store , in Charleston , South Carolina , a fine looking , florid-complexioned old gentleman , with hair as white as snow ; which , contrasted with his complexion , showed him to have been a free liver , or hon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a tall , gauky-looking , flaxen-haired stripling , apparently of the age of from sixteen to eighteen , with a complexion of a good parchment color , beardless chin , and as much assumed self-consequence as any two-footed animal I ever saw : - this was JOHN RANnOryn . I handed him from the shelves volume after volume , which he tumbled carelessly over and handed back again ; at length he hit upon something that struck his fancy-my eye happened to be fixed upon his face at the moment , and never did I witness so sudden , so perfect a change of human countenance ; that which before was dull and heavy , in a moment became animated , and flashed with the brightest beams of intellect ; he stepped up to the old gray-headed gentleman , and , giving him a thundering slap on the shoulder , said , Jack , look at this ! ' I was youn0 then , but I never can forget the thought that rushed upon my mind at the moment , which was , that he was the most impudent youth I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend the races . There was then living in Charleston a Scotch baronet , by the name of Sir John Nesbit , with his younger brother , Alexander , of the ancient house of Nesbits , of Dean Hall , some fifteen miles from Edinburgh . Sir John was a very handsome man , and as gallant , gay Lothario , ' as could be found in the city . He and Randolph became intimate , which 1e4 to a banter between them for a race , in which each was to ride his own horse . The race came off during the race week , and Randolph won-some of the ladies exclaiming at the time , though Mr. Randolph had won the race , Sir John had won their hearts . ' This was not so much to he wondered at , when you contra*sted the elegant form and graceful style of riding of the baronet , with the uncouth and awkward manner of his competitor . " Some two or three years after this visit to Charleston , he was elected a member of Congress , and such was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Clerk 's table to qualify , that gentleman could not refrain from asking him his age : the answer was prompt , if not satisfactory- ' ask my constituents , sir , ' was the reply . John Adams was then President , and Mr. Randolph took a decided part against his administration . Congress was sitting in Philadelphia , and Mr. Adams ' hot water war with France ' being then on the tapis , the latitude Mr. Randolph gave his tongue in debate occasioned his being assaulted in the lobby of the theatre , by an officer of the army or navy , I do not recollect which , or who he was ; hut Mr. Randolph made a formal complaint , which , to the best of my memory , met with but a cold reception . Party runs high enough now , and much too high for the good of the country ; but he who supposes it never rose higher , knows nothing of the period to which I allude . // " Among the members of Congress , Mr. Randolph ' had but few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart with hooks of steel . ' Among them was the Honorable Mr. Bryan , from Georgia ; the late Governor David B .. Williams , of South Carolina , and the still later venerable Nathaniel Macon , of North Carolina . At the close of a session , soon after the removal of Congress to Washington , the former of these gentlemen ( Mr. Bryan ) married a daughter of General Foreman , of Maryand , and with her and her sister spent some days in Cha rleston , when on their way to his estate in Georgia . On this occasion , Mr. Bryan showed me a letter which he had just received from Mr. Randolph , congratulating him upon his marriage . A letter of more beautiful simplicity and feeling , I never read . I recollect that , while the writer dwelt upon the happiness and advantages to be expected from a wedded life , he spoke feelingly of never expecting to enjoy them himself . " The Yazoo fraud , a greater than which never disgraced the annals of a state or nation , came before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nefarious transactions which gave rise to this stupendous villany . In 1794 , a number of men in Georgia , joined by some in South Carolina , calling themselves the Yazoo Company , applied to the Legislature of Georgia , in 1795 , for a grant of an immense tract of territory , to which she had no right , and over which she had no jurisdiction : but the men who formed this company were not to be easily put off , and a title from some Legislature was indispensable to the success of their scheme . They effected by bribery the accomplishment of their object ; - it became a matter of common notoriety that the whole , or nearly the whole , Legislature were bribed to grant the title asked for , but which they had no right to grant . The manner in which it had been obtained was bruited in the newspapers of the day , and none could plead ignorance . The grant being thus obtained , agents were immediately sent through the States to dispose of the stolen goods ? * They visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The New England Mississippi Land Company , ' who purchased to the extent of some millions of dollars of these lands , knowing them to have been fraudulently obtained . " I was in Georgia the next year , 1796 , when the new Legislature , who had been elected with a direct view to this object , having assembled at the seat of government , and taking the necessary preliminary steps , went in grand procession , with their respective officers at their head , and burnt , by the hands of the common hangman , the records of the infamous proceedings of their immediate predecessors , and with them the infamous grant itself . " The Yazoo claim was , by the New England Mississippi Land Company , to recover from Congress the value of the lands so obtained ; and it was in opposition to this application , that Mr ; Randolph immortalized himself , in speeches that will stand ' ' the test of time , of scretiny , and of talent . ' It was regularly brought forward at every session , and as regularly defeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Brien Smith , were both elected to Congress with a sole view to the carrying through this unrighteous measure ; and it was during its discussion one day , when they were in the House , that Mr. Randolph made the withering remark , which rung through the Union at the time . Shaking his long , lank finger at Mr. Hampton , he exclaimed , at the top of his voice , Mr. Speeker , I hope , sir , to see the day when a Yazoo claimant and a villain will lie synonymous terms . ' On the evening following , Mr. Hampton bundled up his papers and waited on Mr. Randolph , whose first salutation on the occasion was , have yoe come for peace , or for war ? ' For peace , ' was the reply , or I should not bring these papers . ' In an evil hour Mr. Randolph was left out , and before his re-election the bill was passed , and the robbery consummated , to the amount of five millions of dollars-an event which never could have taken place while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randolph was always eccentric , and in the latter part of his life , at times , insane . I witnessed an ' instance of it in Baltimore , in the spring of 1820 , when he // rode in an open chair , with a double barrel gun beside him , to make a morning call , and made his faithful Juba take the gun into the house after him . " A few days after he took passage on a steamboat at Baltimore , for Norfolk : here his insanity showed itself in a manner none could doubt . There was a French gentleman passenger on board , to whom he took a great dislike , and calling for his gun , he took possession of the cabin door , and would not allow the passenger , who was on deck , to re-enter the cabin . " His insanity at this time was known , and spoken of , by many . No man of a great and sane mind , such as Mr. Randolph 's had been , could , while in a sane state , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his short embassy to Russia . " It was generally understood that he was disappointed many years ago , in not receiving the appointment of minister to England ; and that from this disappointment , and the chagrin consequent upon it , sprung all those eccentricities which marked his erratic course in after life . This was his misfortune , not his fault . " He was a republican in theory , but an aristocrat in practice , as his whole life abundantly proved . He possessed a mind fertilized by every stream of literature , but the use he made of his great acquirements were rather calculated to make enemies than friends ; and yet , as he once said , no man was ever blessed with such constituents '  --  a fact , which , of itself , speaks volumes in his praise . If he originated no great national good , he prevented many evils ; and in doing so , he became the benefactor of his country , although not to the extent he otherwise might have been . " * * * * " GENERAL RoaEaT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of November , 1791 , and having first received a good school education , in the city of Charleston , at about the age of seventeen , he commenced reading law with Langdon Cheves , Esq. , and before he was quite twenty-one , was admitted to the bar ; when , Mr. Cheves being called into public life , he transferred his great and lucrative practice to Mr. Hayne , who at once found himself involved in a practice as great as , or greater than , any other gentleman at the bar . He was young and diffident ; but whatever untiring industry and close application could perform , he felt confident that it was in him to accomplish . His mind now began to expand , and in proportion to that expansion , his want of confidence wore oW and he took rank among the first of his profession , at an age when very few have even gained admission to it . It was just before he was of age , that I addressed a note to him one day , inviting him to become a candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . His reply was expressed in terms of the greatest gratitude for my friendly feelings toward him , which I had always felt , and then strongly expressed , and regretted he was not of an age to become a candidate . I had watched him from childhood , and saw the opening blossoms of a parent 's hope expanding as his youth advanced . The seeds of goodness and greatness which were sown in him at his birth , grew with his growth and strengthened with his strength ; and young though he was when he left us , his country had reaped the harvest in a well-spent life , which had been devoted to her interest , as he conscientiously believed ; and if at any time he was mistaken in that belief , it was the mistake of an honest man and a Christian , who had devoted his soul to his God and his life to his country. : " In September , 1814 , 1 again called upon him to become a candidate . There was no longer any impediment , and he was elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket . He had served but two terms when he was elected Speaker of the House . The term for which he was elected to this high office had not expired , when the two Houses elected him Attorney-General of the State , in which office he continued until 1823 , when he was elected to the Senate of the Tjnit3d States , ' although then but thirty-two years of age ! Here his great mind had its full scope , and his amiable disposition , with his unequalled suavity of manners , alike secured to him the respect and esteem of all . From my knowledge of // him through life , I have no hesitation in saying , that the man who knew and did not respect Robert Y. Hayne , had a heart and feelings not to be envied . " In DecemL , cr , 1832 , he was elected Governor of the State  --  a situation , as things then stood , in which he had everything to fear and nothing to hope . " As Governor of the State , Mr. Hayne was very soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , issued on the 10th of December , in relation to the proceedings of South Carolina , reached Columbia in a very few days , and was met by a counter proclamation from Governor Hayne , expressed in terms of lofty defiance , on the 20th of the same month . The warlike aspect of these two documents , exhibiting on the one hand , a determination to put down South Carolina by force , and on the other , a resolution to resist unto death , very naturally excited an alarm for the safety of the Union , in all parts of the United States , which pre-disposed a majority of the people in favor of conciliatory measures . In South Carolina , pre . parations of the most vigorous and efficient kind were everywhere made for the defence of the State ; and in these arrangements the Governor took an active and conspicuous part . The proceedings which took place in Congress , on the 2d of March , 1833 , are too well known to need a recapitulation here . Suffice it to say , that the simultaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to enforce the collection of the revenue , put an end to the apprehensions of an approaching conflict between the Federal Government and the State of South Carolina , which induced the Convention , on the 15th of March , to enact an ordinance , repealing the previous one of the 24th of November . Of this Convention General Hayne was elected President at its second session , which commenced on the 11th of March , and closed on the 18th-General Hamilton having previously resigned . " From this memorable epoch until the month of December , 1834 , Governor Hayne continued in the Executive chair , though not without having subjects of exciting interest to demand his solicitude . The spirit of party in South Carolina had not been appeased by the settlement of the dispute with the Government at Washington . The predominant party were desirous of enforcing obedience to the State , in all future conflicts , by demanding an oath of allegiance , while the minority threatened resistance to any law which should be designed to exact it . In casting oil upon these troubled waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proclamation enjoining obedience to the decision of the Court of Appeals , which pronounced unconstitutional a military oath enjoined by the Legislature , in opposition to the decided opinion entertained by the party in power . Perhaps to this wise and prudent course of the Governor may be traced that gradual relaxation of the spirit that urged the enforcement of an oath of allegiance , which subsequently terminated in the reconciliation of the two parties in the Legislature , commemorated by the almcst unanimous election of Mr. MclDuffie as Governor of the State , and the abandonment of the bill designed to exact an oath of allegiance . " On the fourth of July , 1836 , he was elected President of the great Railroad Convention , then assembled at Knoxville , Tennessee , consisting of four hundred members , whose deliberations he presided over for five days , with ease , dignity , and a great despatch of business . On the organization of the Railroad Company , he was elected a Director , and immediately after , by the unanimous vote of the board , he was elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , which happened at Ashville , North Carolina , on the 24th of September , 183* , in the fortyeighth year of his age . To this , my great enterprise , his death has put a stop , at least for many years to come , but it must and will be accomplished . " General Hayne had very extensive connexions , many of whom looked up to him for aid , and never looked in vain . " The great leading trait , in the character of this great man , has bean overlooked ; it was the wonderful talent of controlling the actions of others , unfelt and unseen . They knew not the eye that directed , nor the hand that led them , but felt and fol // lowed the unseen guide , as if it were an act of their own volition . His death has made a chasm in South Carolina which they have no man to fill ; there is no treading in his footsteps-not but what they have the talent , but the people have not the confidence . No man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the unequalled pageant that spoke their griefs , but it was the pouring out of their hearts upon the grave of their great and good friend , that told their tale of wo . " For myself , I lost in him a long and tried friend , who was near and dear tome ; but as he was gathered to his fathers full of honors , and in the midst of his fame , he died as the great should ever wish to die . Let us not be deceived ; it is for ourselves we mourn and not for him . " * * * * " WILLIAM LowNeEs-It often happens that men pre-eminent for talent and for the possession and exercise of every manly and social virtue sink into their graves with scarcely a passing ? iotice . The fate of the great and good man whose name heads this article is , incomparably , the most striking instance I ever knew of the kind . " William Lowndes was the third son of Rawlins Lowndes , by Sarah , his third wife , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1782 . He went with his mother to England , at the age of seven years , where he had the benefit of the English Grammar Schools for three years , and then returned with his mother to Charleston , and commenced a classical education with the Rev. Dr. Simon Felix Gallagher , of the Roman Catholic Church , a man alike renowned for great learning , and the happy talent of communicating it to others ; who onee said , speaking of Lowndes , when a student , that his mind drank up knowledge , as the dry earth did the rain from Heaven . ' Under the tuition of this eminent teacher ; he continued until he entered the office of that distinguished lawyer and jurist , the late venerable Chancellor Des Saussure , to study law . " In September , 1802 , he married Elizabeth , eldest daughter of Major General Thomas Piuckney . " In 1804 , he made overtures to John S. Cogdell , Esq. , ( who was just rising into notice at the bar , having then , recently been appointed City Attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ) to join him in the practice of the law , to which Mr. Cogdell readily assented , until Mr. Lo* ndes , in the most delicate manner possible , gave him to understand that he would not receive any portion of the income of the office ; that his object was , to serve Mr. C. To this the pure and highminded Cogdell promptly refused to assent , and would hear to no terms , but a perfect equality . Mr. Lowndes yielded to his wishes , and they commenced practice together under the firm of Cogdell and Lowndes . This was in March , 1840 . The last week in September , or the first in October , the same year , there was a very destructive storm , which did much damage to the plantations , and Mr. Lowndes , whose planting interest was extensive , suffered severely , so much 50 , as to make his permanent residence in the country necessary for some time . He took leave of Mr Cogdell and the office , remarking , that he feared he had not been of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Lowndes ' death . Mr. Cogdell still lives , in the full enjoyment of health , vigor , and usefulness , as the President of the South Carolina Bank . ' There are few better men , or more useful citizens , anywhere . " In 1806 , Mr. Lowndes was elected to the Legislature of his native State , in which he served two or three terms , of two years each . It was there that the great powers of his clear ciceronian mind , so conspicuous in all his after life , first began to display themselves in all their wisdom and beauty . " In October , 1810 , he was elected to the eleventh Congress , from Beaufort district , and continued in Congress until 1822 , when the want of health compelled him to resign his seat in that body . When there , he spoke comparatively but seldom ; but when he did speak , he was listened to as the oracle of truth . There was nothing of the partisan about him ; his language was so pure , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none pretended to dispute them . His sole object was his country , his whole country , and nothing but his country . " In 1818 , or 19,1 can not say which , he went to Europe for the recovery of his health . I was there in 1820 , and followed directly in his path . The first question put to me upon almost all occasions , was , do you know Mr. Lowudes 3 ' 1 took pleasure in answering that I not only knew him , but had known him intimately from his boyhood . His greatness and goodness were the theme of every tongue . Mr. Roscoe related to me the following anecdote : Mr. Lowndes was a very early riser , and so arranged matters with the porter of the AthenHum , that he could have ad .. mission at an early hour-it was here that he whiled away the time until breakfast . One morning when he was thus engaged , another gentleman entered , and from attraction , or some other cause , they soon came in contact , and got into conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They forgot their breakfasts , and were not awkre how time had passed , until they found the great room , in which they were , rapidly filling up , when they separated still ignorant of each other 's names . Upon change , some hours after , the Englishman met Mr. *oscoe , and related to him his morning interview with the great unknown , ' and observed that he was the tallest man , and the most unassuming man he ever saw , and a man of the greatest intellect he ever hear ( l speak . Mr. Roscoe immediately replied , it is the great American , Lowndes , you have been conversing with ; come and dine with me to.morrow , and I will introduce you to him . ' " Immediately after his resignation in 1822 , he again embarked for Europe , accompanied by his wife and daughter , and died at sea , October 27th , 1822 , in the 41st year of his age . Thus died a man who certainly left no superior , and very few , if any , equals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excelled all his contemporaries , was wisdom . It was the same trait of character , in a greater extent , which distinguished the Father of his Country from all other men , in all times . When Mr. Lowndes was applied to , to become a candidate for the Presidency , his reply was worthy of a Washington , and should be engraven upon the heart of every American : IT 15 AN OFFICE NEITHER TO BE SOUGHT FOR , NOR DEcLINED . ' The answer shows him as he was-among the wise , the wisest ; among the good , the best . " The following anecdote of Washington and Gonverneur Morris we have not met before : " It has often been asserted by his intimate friends , and even by some of his biographers , that few men had the nerve to approach him with familiarity . The following anecdote , illustrative of this fact , I have often heard repeated , and its truth was confirmed to me by gentlemen in New York , who had the best opportunity of knowing . " The late Gouverneur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day , when Congress sat in New York , and Washington occupied the house then in front of the " Bowling Green , " denied the correctness of this opinion , and offered to test the truth of it at once , by joining him in the garden , where Washington was walking , alone and in thek view . A bet was made , and Mr. Morris went itnmediately into the garden to decide it . He approached the President in the rear , and as he came up alongside gave him a familiar tap on the shoulder , at the same time addressing him familiarly with " how do you do , sir 3 " Washington turned his head and echoed back the question , with all that dignity which distinguished him from all other men . Morris was petrified ; and returning to his friends , declared that notlling would tempt him to repeat the experiment . Although he had been for years in almost daily intercourse with this wonderful man , and supposed he might be approached like other men under similar circumstances , he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of voice with which his question was answered . // " For myself , I can only say , that I have stood in the presence of kings , and sat at table with princes , without any of those feelings of awe and reverence , which came over me like a summer cloud when in his presence , although then in the recklessness of boyhood . * * * * * " Washington 's style of travelling comported with the marked dignity of his character ; on the occasion above-mentioned it was as follows - It was his general practice to enter a town in his chariot , and leave it on horseback . His post-chariot was drawn by four beautiful bay horses , and driven by postillions in blanket coat , liveries , jockey caps , buckskins and boots ; while upon his right , on horseback , rode Colonel Lear , and on his left , Major Jackson : next came a light baggage wagon , drawn by two fine bay horses , driven hy a white man in a round corduroy jacket , glazed hat , buckskins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted on a fine blood horse , and leading the general 's white charger , presented him by Charles the Fourth , of Spain . It was precisely in this style that I saw him enter Worcester , followed by a cavalcade of gentlemen on horseback . When he left it , the only change was that he mounted his charger and rode between his two secretaries , Lear and Jackson ; while the empty chariot and the remainder of his equipage followed after , with troops of horse and cavalcades of horsemen , increasing as they went , until they arrived at Boston . " But can it be possible that living man ever addressed to him the expression related in the following ? - " It is an extraordinary fact , that the life of no man , of any age or nation , who has risen to greatness , ever afforded so few anecdotes as his . " One , however , I well remember to have heard frequently spoken of soon after it occurred ; it was this : Directly after the British were compelled to quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ward second in command , General Ward resigned his commission , which circumstance was thus spoken of by Washington , in a letter to Congress : no sooner is the seat of war removed from beyond the smoke of his own chimneys , than General Ward resigns his command . ' " About the ti , ne of the organization of the government under the Constitution , General Ward was informed of this remark , and being elected to the second congress , soon after his arrival at the seat of government , ( then New York , ) he took a friend with him and called upon Washington , and asked him if it was true , that he had made use of such language . The president replied that he did not know ; but he kept copies of all his letters , and would take an opportunity of examining them , and give him an answer at the next session . Accordingly , at the next session General Ward called again with his friend , and received for answer , that he ( Washington ) had written to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no gentleman , turned on his heel and left him , and here , of course , the matter ended . " I have recently met with the confirmation of an important fact I had heard mentioned nearly half a century ago ; but I do not know that it has found its way into any biography of Washington . It is this : that Governor Johnson , of Maryland , requested Mr. John Adams to nominate Washington for commander-in-chief ; that Adams seemed to decline , and Johnson made the nomination . At a previous meeting of the New England delegation , to consult upon this subject , General Ward was agreed upon with the consent of every man present , but Mr. Adams , who dissented , and declared himself in favor of Washington . Great God , how often was the fate of this country suspended by a single hair This was one of the numerous instances . " When Ramasy wrote his biography , he sought in vain among the friends and neighbors of the illustrious dead , for those little incidents which so often enliven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NO . XXXIII. - SEPTEMBER , 1840 . P // " In 1797 , Lord Erskine wrote a book , in which he introduced the name of Washington , and sent him a copy , with a note to this effect , written upon a blank leaf of it : - It has been my good fortune , through life , to be associated with the most talented and distinguished men of Europe ; but you , sir , are the only human being for whom I ever felt a reverential awe , totally unlike anything I ever felt toward any other of the human race. * * The following reminiscences of Hancock and old Samuel Adams are not to be omitted " JOHN HANcOcK-The memory of this great patriot , statesman , and orator has been most grossly neglected . While hundreds , whose services in the cause of Independence were not a tythe of his , have been eulogized to the skies , and live on canvass and in marble , this great patriot 's name but seldom finds a place even when celebrating that freedom he was among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life in obtaining . I have , for years , noticed this neglect , with feelings of unfeigned regret . " Never was a man more beloved by any people , than Hancock was by the people of Massachusetts . With the exception of a single year , when Bowdoin was put in , he was , for sixteen successive years , elected their governor , and closed his patriotic and illustrious life in that high station . Hundreds of times have I seen him , when so worn out , and crippled by disease , that he could not stand , taken from his carriage into the arms of two faithful servants , ( who regularly attend*id for the purpose , ) and carried up to the council chamber , a distance of nearly fifty yards from the street . The last time he addressed his fellow-citizens , was the most impressive scene I ever witnessed . A town meeting was called , upon a question of great excitement . Old Faneuil Hall could not contain the people , and an adjournment took place to the Old South Meeting-house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front gallery , where the Hon. Benjamin Austin supported him on the right , and the celebrated Dr. Charles Jarvis upon the left , while he addressed the multitude . The governor commenced , by stating to his fellow-citizens , that he felt , ' it was the last time he should ever address them-that the seeds of mortaLity were growing fast within him . ' The fall of a pi* might have been heard , such a deathlike silence pervaded the listening crowd , during the whole of his animated and soul-stirring speech , while tears ran down the cheeks of thousands . " The meeting ended , he was conveyed to his carriage , and taken home , but never again appeared in public-his death followed soon after . The corpse was embowelled , and kept for eight days , to give an opportunity to the citizens , from the most distant parts of the State , to render the last tribute of respect to his memory . They came by thousands and tens of thousands  --  the procession was an hour and a half in passing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to the Concord Light Infantry , under Captain Davis , the same who commanded them on the ever memorable nineteenth of April , 75 . It was the most solemn , and interesting , and incomparably the longest funeral procession I ever saw . Samuel Adams , who was lieutenant-governor , became governor , ez-officio , by the death of Hancock , and followed the bier , ( there were no hearses , with nodding plumes , in those days , ) as chief mourner , but the venerable patriot could not endure the fatigue , and was compelled to retire from the procession . " Hancock , as an orator , had no equal . He seized upon the passions of his hearers , and led them captive at his pleasure ; none could resist . A gentleman who heard him deliver his great oration , commemorative of the massacre of the fifth of March , seventeen hundred and seventy , told me that the multitude who listened to it were wrought up to such a pitch of phrenzy , that a single sentence from the orator , calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their town* would have been at once carried into effect . Such was . his control over them // many could not keep their seats , from indignation . I read this oration in my youth ; it abounds In thoughts that breathe , and words that burn . ' It made my young blood run coursing through my veins , and the hair on my head to stand erect , as I read it . I said to myself , with the old Roman , if such is the effect from reading , what would it have been to have heard him deliver it P His form was elegant ; his face beautiful , manly , and expressive ; his eye piercing ; his voice , flexible . He could raise his hearers to the highest pitch of phrenzy , or sooth them into tears , at pleasure . " It was THI5 ORATiON which first prepared the minds of men to resist the oppression of the British government . From the day it was delivered , it was the determination of thousands , that at the first opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and abide the consequences . Four years after , the opportunity was presented , at Lexington , and our nations Independence was the result. * " Hancock , before the Revolution , was a man of vast fortune ; and although he permitted it to flow , in the cause of his country , like water , he had still enough left to support a splendid establishment , and lived and entertained like a prince . His generosity was unbounded . I well remember that one evening in each week , * The following addition to the above anecdote appears on a subsequent page : " The venerable and learned Doctor JNOAR WEBSTER , in a letter of July , 1840 , received too late to be inserted in their proper place , and too interesting to be omitted , has favored me with the two following anecdotes , for which he will please accept my thanks . The first , in relation to Hancock , I have known for more than half a century ; and know , farther , who wrete the oration ; it was written by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ever heard Hancock address a public assembly , as 1 have , could not for a moment doubt his ebilitij to write such an oration ; the object was , to get him committed beyond the hope of pardon , and that oration did it completely . " New Haven , July 29 , 1840 . " Ma . THOMAs : " I see in the sheets of your Reminiscences , which you have been so good as to send for my perusal , that you have mentioned the electric effect which the oration of Mr. Hancock , March 5 , 1774 , had upon the audience . This reminds me of an anecdote related to me by the late Judge Trumbull , of this State . " In the year 1774 , Mr. Trumbull was a student of law in the office of John Adams . Mr. Hancock was , at that time , a wavering character ; at least he was so considered by the leading whigs of that day . It was a matter of no small importance to bring him to a decision , as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching . To effect this object the more stanch leading whigs contrived to procure Mr. Hancock to be appointed to deliver an oration on the anniversary of the Massacre ; and some of them wrote his oration for him , or a considerable part of it . This policy succeeded , and Mr. Hancock became a firm supporter of the American cause . Judge Trumbull related to me these facts , as from his personal knowledge ; and no person will question his veracity . " I have another anecdote , derived from the late Rev. Nathan Strong , of Hartford , and coming to me through the Hon. Elizur Goodrich . " When the question of taking arms to resist the claims of Great Britain was to be de cided in Connecticut , the Legislature held a secret session , and debated the question a whole day . The result was in favor of resistance ; and it is said the most iafiuen*ial character in deciding the question was the Hon. Titus Hosmer , the father of the late Chief Justice Hosmer , of Middletown . " I give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you deem them of any value , they are at your service . " I am , Sir , with respect , " Your obedient servant , " E. S. TMOMAS , ESQ . N. WBBSTER. " // Samuel Adams . September , during summer , a full band of music , at his own expense , attended in front of his venerable stone mansion , at the head of the Common , to entertain the citizens who were promenading on the mall . He seldom left Boston to visit at any distance ; but when he did , he was always escorted by a volunteer troop of cavalry , who held themselves in readiness for that purpose . He was very fond of joke and repartee , so much so , that a worthy citizen of Boston , Nathaniel Balch , Esq. , a hatter , who never failed to appear among the invited guests at his hospitable board , obtained the unenvied appellation of the Governor 's Jester . ' The celebrated Brissot , in his travels in the United States , speaks of his meeting this gentleman at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the governor and Mr. Balch , that if the former ' was called away , no matter what distance , Squire Balch attended him , like his shadow , which the following circumstance most happily illustrates . Governor Hancock was called on to visit the then province of Maine , on which occasion he travelled in state , and was attended by the Hon. Col. Orne , one of the Executive council , and Nathaniel Balch , Esq . Their arrival at Portsmouth , New Hampshire , was thus humotously announced : - On Thursday last , arrived in this town , Nathaniel Belch , Esq. , accompanied by his Excellency , John Hancock , end the Hon. Azor Orne , Esq . ' " * * * * * " SAMUEL ADAMS-I have taken for my subject on this occasion , recollections of SAMUEL ADAMS , who , though not a hero without example , ' was a patriot without reproach . ' In speaking of circumstances so long passed , I shall speak only of what I know ; never having read the Biography of the Signers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account may there be given of any of them . I never saw Mr. Adams until the year 1792 ; he was then far in the vale of years , with a constitution which was , judging from his appearance , naturally strong , but then nearly worn out , not with toil , but care . He still continued to use all the exercise his strength would admit , by visiting , almost daily , a Mr. Hughs , a constable , a respectable calling in Boston in those days , whatever it may be now . They had been friends from early life , and the same intimacy was common between their respective ladies . Mr. Adams was then lieutenant.governor , a place of honor , with but little profit , and no duty at all , except in case of the death of the governor , when , ex-officio , the duties of the executive devolved upon the lieutenant . Mr. Adams lived in a large old fashioned frame house , on Winter-street , which had once been painted yellow , but , like its venerable owner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertained little or no company , having neither the means nor the inclination to do it . He was poor . " On the death of Governor Hancock , he walked as chief mourner , preceded only by the Hancock piece of artillery . ( It is proper here to remark , that the first cannon taken from the British in the war of the Revolution , were two brass four pounders , on one of which was engraven , by order of the State , the name of John Hancock , and on the other , Samuel Adams , with appropriate devices . ) Before the almost interminable procession had reached State-street , Mr. Adams ' strength failed him , and he retired He had then become ex-officie Governor of the State , and at the next election was confirmed in his high office by the votes of the people . The then salary of the Governor of Massachusetts , if my memory serves , was a thousand pounds currency , or $3,333  --  but a very small sum toward enabling the incuihbent of the Gubernatorial chair , to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hancock , who lived and entertained like a prince . Mr. Adams possessed neither carriage nor horses ; but he had been elected Governor but a few weeks , when some gentlemen of Boston presented the venerable patriot with a new and handsome chariot , and a pair of as fine horses as there were in the city . The first use he made of his new equipage , shows the man in a point of view too rare not to be admired ; seating himself beside his venerable lady , they drove to Constable Hughs ' , where the governor alighted , and handing Mrs. Hughs into his seat , the // two old ladies drove off together , while he staid and talked with his old friend , and I stood by devouring their discourse . " in 1793 , theatrical entertainments were first introduced into Boston after the Revolution . There was an express law against them . Application was made to the legislature to repeal the law , and it passed both houses ; but Mr. Adams was theis governor and refused to sign it ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . " It is recorded of Mr. Adams , that a large sum was offered him by agents of the British government , to take sides with it against his native land , but it was indignantly spurned , and on a subsequent occasion , when a similar circumstance was alluded to , he exclsirhed , they well know that a guinea never glistened in my eyes . ' It was well for our country , and for mankind , that there were such men , in whose eyes guineas did not glisten ; they appear to have been raised up for the occasion , and having accomplished the great work given them to do , have disappeared from the face of the earth , and there have arisen in their stead , a race of men so unlike them , that it seems scarcely possible they can be the descendants of such sires . The contrast is striking , and well calculated to make us tremble for the future . " The two following extracts will have an agreeable historical interest for our friends in Wall and Chestnut streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important , after the obtainment of our independence , was the formation of the Constitution ; in fact , we were not independent until the Constitution was made and adopted ; and although it is not what it ought to be , in my estimation , still , the wonder is , among so many contending interests , not that it is no better , but that it is no worse . What kind of a Constitution would a convention produce now After the Constitution was formed and submitted to the States for their adoption or rejection , the plundering of the poor soldiers was effected . The knowing ones had little or no doubt of the Constit*tion being adopted by a sufficient number of States , ( nine , ) and that , being adopted , Congress would fund the public debt . Then commenced a scene of legal robbery , such a the history of civilized nations can scarcely produce a parallel to . Even mechanics quit their business , to speculate in soldiers ' notes , which were bought up , in great quantities , for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among others , I recollect a large , lazy , journeyman carpenter , by the name of Patch , who threw off his leather apron , and appeared a gentleman at large , and dressed in the most fashionable style . Another was a Lynn shoemaker . Fortunes were made , from a few hundred dollars , in a few weeks ; and from this arose the aristocracy of wealth in the United States . Words can scarcely convey an idea of the excitement that was kept up , for several years , in Boston , New York , and Philadelphia . There were mail-stages in those days , but their snail-like pace did not answer the views of the speculators ; they kept expresses continually on the road . " When the State of New York adopted the Constitution , it was an event calculated to have a very great effect upon the stock market , and Captain Levi Pease , of Boston , was kept in waiting for the result , with a relay of horses every ten miles , from there to Boston , by the then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished in forty-eight hours , a performance , then , altogether unprecedented . An express once arrived in Boston on a Sunday , when the streets were all alive with people going to church . Instantly the church was lost sight of by hundreds of men , who left their families to find the way without them , while they went upon change , and bought and sold to the amount of hundreds of thousands . " There was but one bank in Boston in those days , the old Massachusetts*in fact , there were but two in the United States , the one already mentioned , and one in Philadelphia  --  and as a sample of the niode of conducting banking business then , the son of the president of the bank in Boston , and two other gentlemen , were permitted to draw en the funds of the institution to such an extent as to compel it to // stop discounting for six or eight weeks , while the three gentlemen alluded to went to New York , and there set speculation on foot to an immense extent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public securities , at auction , as was then the custorn . " The celebrated Colonel Duer was then a great operator upon the stock exchange in New York , with a good supply of ready money , and high credit , which he used to its full extent , borrowing from oystermen and draymen their little hoardings , and totally unsuspicious of the trick the three Yankees were playing him , they having got the stocks up to a price considerably above par , by sham buying and selling . Then it was that the Bostonians threw into market the immense amount they had taken with them , and Duer became the purchaser . The stocks fell twenty or thirty per cent . the next day , and he was compelled to take refuge from his exasperated , and in many instances ruined , creditors , within the walls of the jail , from whence he was never liberated . During the first excitement against him , it became necessary to protect him ( by calling out the military ) from the exasperated people , who had surrounded the prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Col. Duer , by remaining in prison , enabled his family to retain a sufficiency of property to live genteelly , his lady visiting him almost daily in her carriage . * * * * * " There was no United States Bank then , ( 1816 . ) It was incorporated in February of that year , and went into operation on the first of January following . The charter provided that the capital should be paid in , in specie and six per cent . stock of the United States , in portions of twenty or twenty-five per cent . ( I have forgotten which ) every six months . I had provided myself with the means of taking fifty thousand dollars of the stock , but when I found specie at twenty-eight per cent . advance , in Baltimore bank notes , and six per cents . of the United States above par , I presumed that before the second instalment was due , they would both advance in price , as a natural consequence . Under those circumstances , I concluded it was best not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , instead of the requirements of the charter being complied with , it would be violated at the first meeting of the Board , I might as well have taken a hundred thousand dollars of the stock , as let it alone . Those who went deeply into it , knew they could elect the Board of Directors , and understood things better . When the second instalment became due , the small dealers paid in conformity to the charter , but the large ones had their first instalment discounted to pay their second with . The bank then went into operation . The stock rose rapidly , and never ceased rising , until it reached one hundred and fiftysix dollars per share , for full paid shares , in Baltimore . That day the Cashier of one of the banks gave a large dinner party , and I was among the guests . He held a considerable amount of stock , and I advised him to sell it that afternoon , deliverable the next morning , as business hours were passed ; but he declined , assigning for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no knowing at what point it would stop . The next day it began to decline , and n.ever ceased falling until it was down to seventy-five dollars per share In the praise of the fair " Queen of the West , " Cincinnati , Mr. Thomas is unmeasured in his enthusiasm . " It is not , " he exclaims , " in the number and architectural beauty of her private dwellings andpublic buildings , that Cincinnati alone excels ; it is in all that constitutes refinement and taste . It is her literature , her authors , her arts , her artists , and her numerous literary , scientific , and benevolent institutions , that have already given her a name , not only among the cities of the Great Valley , but of the civilized world , that will go down to the most remote posterity ! " Nor does he confine his admiration to general expressions of eulogy . He devotes a number of his pages to // particulars of her commerce , her manufactures , her arts , and her public institutions , in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It thus appears that , notwithstanding the jaundiced eye with which pecuniary disappointment caused Mrs. Trollope to regard everything around her in the same place , the ill success which seems to have attended Mr. Thomas 's efforts there , to retrieve his broken fortunes , does not prevent his seeing the same objects through a medium glowing with the couleur de rose . We have no disposition to soften any of his tints . The citizens of Cincinnati are certainly bound by the most imperative obligation of gratitude to purchase liberally Mr. Thomas 's volumes , to bequeath them as valuable " m6-moirespour . *ervir " to her future historians of Sixty-Five Years henceand we trust they will not be insensible to the obligation . But there are one or two errors to which he has allowed a place in his account of the Sculpture of Cincinnati , which we take too great an interest in the subject to allow to pass uncorrected . It is as follows " About a year ago , ( written June 1836 , ) I noticed , in passing a stone-cutter 's shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grave-stone , which had cut upon it a tomb , with a cherub hovering over , and dropping roses upon it ; I was struck with the drawing and execution of the work , and inquired , who did it 2  --  a young man , one of the proprietors of the shop , answered , that he did . I remarked to him that he could do better , and advised him to exert himself for that purpose ; he took my advice , and every subsequent piece of his work was better than the preceding . At the time above alluded to , I told him that he could model a bust , if he was to try . He said he would try , if I would sit to him , which was agreed to ; and he produced one that was instantly known by all who saw it , that knew the original . He then determined to try his chisel upon a piece of statuary marble , by transferring his model to that more durable material , but there was none to be had here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could net procure any . I advised him to study anatomy , and he attended to the anatomical course of the Ohio Medical College the following winter . " Despairing of being able to procure marble to suit his purpose , he came to the determination of trying what he could accomplish upon the hardest free stone . The result is a bust , which came out like magic from under his chisel , and is pronounced by the many who have seen it , and know the original , to be a good likeness . It is the first ever executed in the Mississippi Valley . He invites his friends , and the friends of the Arts , to call and see it . " The artist is CLEVENCER , the future Canova of this country , who adds to modesty and talent the most untiring industry . Mr. Clevenger is a native of Ha*nilton county , and has never been any distance from it . " Having succeeded so well in the first instance , business poured in upon him ; and in the course of a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hard free stone . The lastone before he left the city , was of that excellent man and eminent physician , Doctor Eberle , since deceased . On this he spent much time , and took uncommon pains ; and a more perfect likeness , or a more finished piece of work , I have not seen . Had the material been marble , I should not have known where to find its equal . He then went to Lexington , and took Mr. Clay 's and Governor Poindexter 's , with many others in New York and Philadelphia , and lately Mr. Webster 's . The latter is very highly spoken of ; so was Mr. Clay 's , who gave him a certificate to the correctness of the likeness . He is now gone , or is about going , to Italy , where he has been preceded by PowERs , another Cincinnati artist , who has already acquired great fame by a bust of the Grand Duke of Floren*e* // which is pronounced to be superior to any produced by their own artists , since Canova . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deserved success in the Southern States . Then there is WHETSTONE , scarcely out of his teens , who only wants encouragement to compete with the others ; he designs well . BROWN , both a sculptor and a painter , who has lately been selling off his productions , at Boston , preparatory to a voyage to Italy . I have not seen him , nor any of his works , for two or three years . There is one yet to speak of , who came a sculptor from the hand of nature ; it is BRACKErT . He began where others leave off , an artist ; his first production could not be found fault with , and he was not then twenty . " The following tribute to merit , upon his part , and of compliment to me , is.from the Louisville News Letter , ' a paper since discontinued . " He ( Brackett ) was in a small room , in the third story of a house , on an obscure street , when that high-priest of art , the venerable editor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first heard of and visited him . Mr. T. , during several European tours , has seen the renowned productions of the old masters and the most beautiful specimens of modern statuary , and I am fully borne out in saying , that he is one of the most discri*ninating and genuine amateurs in America . It was he who first discovered and encouraged Powers , Clevenger , Beard , and Frankenstein ; and to him belongs the honor of fostering the dawning genius of the young and highly gifted Brackett . " At the time of which I speak , Mr. B. had seen but two or three pieces of statuary , and had only used his chisel during a few brief leisure days , in tracing the bust of a lovely sister : the face is remarkably beautiful , and I am told is a very true portraiture . In the space of a little better than three months  --  a part of which his chisel was idle-he has executed several admirable busts , among which is one of his early friend , Mr. Thomas , and has nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mississippi . It is the statue of Nydia , the blind girl of Thessaly , around whom Bulwer has thrown such magical interest in his Last Days of Pompeii , ' and during a brief exhibition in his studio , it has excited the admiration of connoisseurs , who have wafted most acceptable incense to the genius of the gifted sculptor . ' We do not question Mr. Thomas 's title to the designation of " the high-priest of art . ' But it is a mistake which he ought not to have thus endorsed , to include Powers . with the promising young artists whose genius he was the first to discover and encourage . Mr. Thomas , we believe , never saw Powers , and it is evident that he knows but little of his works . So brilliant is the present promise of the cultivation which this noblest of the arts of design is destined to receive in this country- ( an effect of the influence of freedom , analogous to that exhibited by the glorious example of the Grecian republics , in stimulating the developement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the liberal hand of nature , ) - that , without the slightest disparagement to the real merits of the artist to whom he has assigned that honor , the credit of the authorship of " the first statue ever modelled in the Valley of the Mississippi , " ought not to be diverted from its rightful owner . Powers , obeying only the untaught and spontaneous instinct within him , is well known to have modelled a number , of great merit , which he cast in wax . This was not less than eight or ten years ago . Of these we need specify but two . The one was a full length statue of an actor named Drake , a great favorite on the Cincinnati boards , to the life-like fidelity of which he obtained // a testimony scarcely less signal than that of the birds in the famous trial of skill between the two Grecian painters . The figure was represented in the attitude in which Drake was accustomed to appear on the rising of the curtain , when about to begin a particular comic song , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love and Sausages . " To test its effect on the audience , the actor on one occasion substituted the image in his own stead . It did not fail to be greeted with the wonted round of applause-which , however , after some moments of impatient delay , became gradually converted into violent tokens of displeasure , with a hissing and booting with which the popular actor had never before been assailed , when the audience perceived the contemptuous indifference which he seemed to exhibit to their applause , and the dogged silence which he showed himself determined to maintain , without even the grateful acknowledgment of a bow to the pit . The curtain fell amid a great uproar . The tumult which succeeded , of an opposite character , when it rose again , and exhibited the explanation of the mystery , in the appearance of the original side by side with his mute and motionless alter ego , was a triumph , than which the artist , whatever may be the future eminence of fame which he seems destined to attain , can never know a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently deceased , the proprietor of the " Western Museum , " in Cincinnati , Mr. Dorfeuille . There was a particular individual well known in the circles of literature and art in Cincinnati-whose name we suppress , though the story we cannot-who had associated with his name a rather ridiculous reputation , as a critic whose vanity was equalled only by his severity , while both were exceeded by the ignorance and incapacity which he brought to this vocation-in a word , a worthy scion of the Fadladeen family . The statue being destined for the Museum ( where , we presume , it is still to be seen ) was placed in a glass case . Our critic was once invited to a close inspection of it , as a work of art . He was as usual very unsparing in abusing the many faults he was very sharp iA detecting . It squinted abotninably  --  the nose was most unnaturally awry  --  and the legs were beneath criticism . The case being open , he happened to approach the candle which he held in his hand too closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and terror he unconsciously repeated the miracle of Prometheus , eliciting from it , in tones of very earthly and living emphasis , the exclamation , " D-n it , do n't burn my nose off ! " Mr. Dorfenille , reversing the former experiment , had substituted himself for the image , and had thus extorted as signal a tribute , to the talent of the artist , as he administered a just punishment for the critical seventies of former occasions . Clevenger also , as could not have been unknown to Mr. Thomas , both modelled and catved a statue at Cincinnati several years before P 2 // that which he has designated as the first . It was of his own child represented as a Cupid . Of its merit we are unable to speak , though from the evidence of his powers in his art , immature as they are , developed in his other works , we are very sure that it was not unentitied to remembrance . Mr. Clevenger is , we understand , on the point of embarking for a residence of ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his realization there , in the midst of the exampies and the inspirations of the sunny land of Art , of the fine promise of the performances which have already issued from his hand , - an anticipation which Mr. Thomas well embodies in the designation which he applies to him , as " the future CANOvA of his country. ** That he has it in him , we have no doubt ; nor , we are well assured , will the resolute devotion and application requisite to bring it forth he wanting , in the generous emulation to which he is committed with his brother artists and townsmen who are in like manner starting with him , in early youth , in their noble career of art . His successive busts have thus far exhibited a marked and rapid progress in the developement of his powers . It is difficult to conceive a higher excellence than that characterizing his bust of Webster-*  --  the only worthy likeness of the man that has yet been produced , with the full embodiment of that Ideal which it is the highest object of Sculpture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine bust of Chanchellor Kent , for the bar of New York ; and one of the late Samuel Ward , Esq. , ( modelled from a portrait and from the hints of friends , ) in which he has admirably combined , with a very correct likencss of features , the transparent expression of a character which has endeared to so many hearts the memory of a man of rare though unassuming worth-of whom no other eulogy need be , nor higher can be pronounced , than the fact of his having devoted the greater portion of a princely fortune to purposes of pious and generous liberality , made known only since his decease by the examination of his papers . But neither Power nor Clevenger was the author of " the first sta* tue ever modelled in the Valley of the Mississippi . " Not less than about sixteen years ago , a man whose name deserves to be rescued from the oblivion which has settled upon it removed from Wheeling to Cincinnati-JOHN Amy , English by birth , though from early boyhood an adopted American citizen .
