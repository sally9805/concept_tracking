txt THE mission to the Armenians of the Turkish empire , sustained by the American Board , is likely to be the object of the most intense interest . The seat of this mission is at Constantinople . First the ancient Byzantium , then the city of Constantine , and now the Ottoman es Stamboul , it ever has been and ever * Vindication ofthe Rev. Horatio Southgate .

It was selected by Constantine as of all others the place marked out to be the capital of the Europeo-Asiatic empire , and the natural center of the Roman dominion . An evangelical mission to any class of its varied population would promise extensive and permanent results . But of the hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the Armenians are far the most interesting , and to the Christian , present the brightest promise . They are the commercial nation of the east-of course intelligent , enterprising and influen // tial . They are found every where in the dominions of the Sultan , extending along the great lines of travel and commerce , and planted in all the important cities . They constitute the life-blood that slowly circulates in the body of this once frightful and furious giant . Two hundred thousand of this people reside at Constantinople , including the most wealthy and influential of the race . Here are found the political , the comrnercial , the ecclesiastical and the social influences that move and regulate the entire nation . This field was occupied by the American Board of Foreign Missions in 1831 . The presence of those influences of preparation , which are full of promise to the Christian mis*sionary , were soon discerned . There had been desires for a purer Christianity , and grop. ings after light , which were encouraged by the teacher of the High School of the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gospel in their hands had consecrated " their bodies , themselves , their ideas , and every thing pertaining to them , to the Lord Jesus Christ , " not knowing that there were any in the wide world , who had such views of Christianity . At one of their secret and stolen interviews , the question was raised , " will it ever be that twenty or thirty individuals will know the Gospel , and will be of one heart and one soul-all being one in Christ , and being always found in him and he in us ? * Some months afterwards they heard of the American missionaries , made their acquaintance , and found to their joy that they were such Christians as they sought for . This was the beginning of the religious awakening at Constantinople , which has steadily advanced from that time to the present . From the metropolis it has been transmitted to other important points through the empire . Nor is this all . About the time that Constantinople was occupied , an exploring mission was despatched to the ancient Armenia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncovered to the Christian world . Soon afterwards the plain of Or6omiah was occupied , with what promise of successful issue we need not say . Later , the mountains of the Independent Nestorians were traversed by that gallant adventurer who is so well known to American Christians . The occupation of these fields was ordered by Christian sagacity ; and our most sanguine hopes and ardent prayers , have seemed more and more likely to be answered ; to be answered with power , and to be answered soon . The eyes of the most intelligent Christians were beginning to be fastened on these eastern churches , with a breathless interest , and they looked for the sudden breaking forth of the morning . The Armenian church revived , was to be the hope and joy of the East , an example of light and beauty in the eyes of the Turk , who had so long despised the name of Christ in the persons of his degenerate disciples ; while from the plains of Or6omiah and the mountains west , were again as of old , to issue new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia . It was expected , that to this good work there would be opposition . The ecclesiastical authorities would of course array themselves against these movements . Perhaps they might arouse the old fury of the mosque , or at least unsheathe the Turkish sword , under color of protecting the peace and order of those recognized as theirChristian subjects . It was certainly known that the Pope would be in the field , by his emissaries , for it has ever been his favorite scheme to gain over the heads of these eastern communions* to his more comprehensive and sufficient Catholicity . The power of France too , to further its political game , has never been backward to use itself for the protection of these 1845.1 245 // neophytes to the Catholic faith . But it was not expected that the new zeal for Catholicity that has been so active in England and America , would transport itself to these scenes and become so exceedingly mad against these noiseless efforts for the truth . In this we have been disappointed . For a few years we have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort has been experienced by our missionaries , and the general notoriety of the matter , with the appearance of the pamphlets , the titles of which we have given , have invested this subject with the gravest interest . Before we look at the particulars of the case , it seems necessary to say a word in respect to the situation of the Armenian church , and the policy which has been pursued by our missionaries . The papal and oriental churches , that are subject to the Sultan , are represented each by their patriarch , under the old law of the Mohammedan faith , of toleration to the Christian , on the two conditions of subjection and tribute . The patriarch is accountable to the government for the good behavior of his Christian subjects . The government is pledged to the patriarch to preserve the peace and enforce the discipline of the church . If an individual leaves one of the recognized or tolerated churches for another , it is all the same with the government. * But if he is a disorderly member of one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a schismatic , he need only to be presented to the civil power as such , by his constituted masters , and he is fined , imprisoned , or banished . This engine of discipline has often been attempted to be used against the most active of the evangelical Armenians , and with partial success . The fear of it has been a test of their sincerity and zeal . For the missionaries to have attempted at the outset to set up a separate communion , would have been to proclaim themselves enemies of the civil order of the empire . To convert an Armenian from his church , in the eye of Turkish law , would be the same as to convert a Mohammedan from the mosque , and would bring down upon the converter and the converted the extremest wrath of the law . That this law would not now be executed , is probable , and perhaps certain . That it would have been in all cases fifteen years since , is as certain . In such circumstances , it is a sound rule of Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that if you can not do all the good which you would , it is your ditty to do all that you can . Admitting that it was desirable to organize a new sect , it could not be done . But it has never been admitted , that it was desirable by the Board and its missionaries , and no effort has been made to bring this to pass . But it has been esteemed by them their great and sufficient work to preach the Gospel , as Christ our Righteousness and Sanctification , and to gain the hearts of these ceremonial Christians to the knowledge and love of the Gospel , as spiritual truth . Questions concerning the church , its government , the order of worship , and the lawfulness of particular ceremonies , have not been made prominent . These have been thought to be of less consequence than the proclamation of vital truth . The vanity of all ceremonies , compared with the realities which they symbolize , has been faithfully urged . The success of this policy has been a testimony to its correctness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his apostles with the converts who were still members of the synagogue , has well nigh given it a divine sanction . Who could say , * A firman was issued against such a change a few years since , but has not been executed . // that in this way the little life that was faintly beating in the shriveled heart of these old churches , might not rally in full strength , and the heart begin to beat with natural force , and life and health go out through the entire body ? If a new sect were desirable and necessary , it would arise of itself , in the providence of God , and the schism attending it would , as in the Reformation , lie at the door of the churches who should thrust out the faithful . We have spoken of the success of this mission . It has been great and wonderful . Its actual results are occasion for gratitude . Its future promise opened wide the most glorious prospects . True , it has not been without opposition . The higher ecclesiastics have watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive to its progress , and have more than once sought to arrest and turn it back . That they have not succeeded , has been owing in part , under God , to the weakness of the Turkish arm , and its entire subjection to European influence . But not to this alone . A conviction has pervaded many of the nation from the first , that the missionaries were good and true men , that their designs were honest , and that their object was not to divide their church , but to save their souls , and that the Gospel , as they preached it , was indeed the truth . Such was the state of the Armenian mission when the Episcopal interference commenced . Such has it been during its progress . We have described it , in order that the status in quo might be distinctly known by our readers . It is only as these peculiar circumstances are clearly and freshly seen , that justice can be done to the parties , and the true enormity of this intermeddling can be realized . With this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we now introduce Mr. Badger and Bishop Southgate , as the principal actors in this matter . Who then is Mr. Southgate ? His parents were Congregationalists . He was baptized by Dr. Payson in Portland , and ratified his baptismal consecration by joining a Congregational church . While at the Theological Seminary at Andover , his thoughts were directed to the Episcopal church , as the scene of his future labors , for the alledged reason , as many bear testimony , of carrying into it more of an evangelical and missionary spirit. * After receiving deacon 's orders , he went to Turkey in 1836 , and returned in 1838 , making , the meanwhile , an exploring tour in Armenia , &amp;c. , of which he published a narrative . He went to Turkey again in 1840 , as a missionary to the Greeks , and resided in Constantinople most of the time , till his return to this country in May , 1844 . Not long before his return , a proposal was agitated by his Board of Missions , to remove him to Mesopotamia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an order to this effect reached Mr. Southgate , at which he was so chagrined as to offer himself to the service of the English " Society for the Propagation of the Gospel , " of which more anon ; but he was not accepted . Upon his return , he strongly urged the continuance of the mission at Constantinople , the concentration of the whole rurkish mission there , and the enlargement of it , so as to include all the oriental churches , and last , though not least , the appointment of a missionary bishop . These suggestions were sanctioned by the Foreign Committee , in their report to the Episcopal Board , * The fact here referred to , if taken in connection with Mr. Southgates career , and with the present prospect of his usefulness within and without the Episcopal church , may serve as an illustration of the wisdom of that sort of policy in young men , and of the sagacity of that style of teaching in regard to ecclesiastical questions , which converts poor Congregationalists into worse Episcopalians. // except the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not feel themselves justified in proposing any action on their part favorable to such a measure . " Of several good reasons for this opinion , they give " the apprehension , that , if appointed , a bishop could not exercise within his appointed sphere , any of the functions peculiar to the episcopal office . " The Board of Missions , it would seem , were likely to be of the same opinion . Forthwith we trace the occurrence of the following facts . First , a report of the committee appointed to investigate the conduct of the mission at Constantinople , which was favorable . Of this committee tBishop Whittingham was chairman . Then the delivery of three lectures by Mr. Southgate upon the state of the oriental churches . On motion of the Bishop of Ohio , it was moved and carried , that it be recommended to appoint missionary bishops to China and Africa only . The next day it was moved to amend the report concerning missionary bishops , so as to include the recommendation of a bishop for Constantinople , and it is gravely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rev. Mr. Southgate , by request of the Board , gave his views in relation to the proposed measure . " The next day , the tBishop of New Jersey , ( better known as George the Lord Bishop , ) moved in form the recommendation , with pecuniary provision for the establishment and for two assistants . The next day it was taken up , the ayes and noes were called for , and it was carried by a vote of 22 to 17 . The House of Bishops recommended the Rev. Mr. Southgate to this office . He was chosen and consecrated in due form , and is now " written down " as " Right Reverend Horatio Southgate , Missionary Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States , to the dominions and dependencies of the Sultan of Turkey . " Who is Mr. Badger ? He was well known at Malta , as a zealous Wesleyan Methodist . He was afterwards in the service of the American Board in Syria , as a printer . He is now under a commission from the Bishop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1842 , he came to Constantinople on this business , resided in the family of Mr. Southgate several months , and in the autumn went to Mosul . He was ignorant of the language of the Armenians , and yet communicated with them freely . Who was his interpreter ? An assistant is not alledged ; but he was in Mr. Southgate 's family , and it was while he was there , that Mr. S. read to an Armenian certain passages from the Missionary Herald . The immediate consequences of that act were most alarming , and the remoter results of it are not yet developed . While at Mr. Southgate 's , Mr. Badger " showed himself determined to have no fellowship " with the missionaries , not even social intercourse . ' ' He remarked publicly , that " a blow is preparing for the American missionaries , which shall cause them to repent of having ever come out here to disturb the peace of these churches . " He said also that the American bishops ought to unite with the English bishops " in making such representations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead them to drive all the missionaries out of the country . " " Then the Christians here could say to them , Your own people bear testimony against you , proving you to be bad men . " His hostility to all dissenting missionaries is notorious at the East . Mr. Southgate himself most freely allows and confirms it . All these missionaries , in his view , teach without the authority of Christ , and against his will . To put them down is to do Christ service . Their labors tend to schism , to the rending of the seamless robe of his church ; therefore the heads of these churches // which they would divide , should result . We have before us exarise in his name , and call to their tracts from letters of the missionaaid the Turkish sword , and drive ries , written in the midst of the out . them from the land .

To this Dr. Anderson replied as courteously , giving a correct version of what he had said , hut declining to impart farther information , as follows : " You will perceive , dear sir , that mere newspaper reports can not make it proper for us , as a missionary society , to go into a formal inculpation to your society of one of its missionaries , because , in the progress of our discussions , it was necessary for us to say somewhat to his disadvantage . We regretted the necessity , as much as it is possible for any one to do , while we believed in its existence. ** When the news of this affair reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Boards , Mr. Southgate addressed a letter to the missionaries , which resulted in some farther correspondence between them . Soon after , he published " a Letter to the members of the Protestant Episcopal Church , &amp;c. " with an appendix , which was extensively circulated as the " Vindication of the Rev. LI . Southgate . " " The letter , " besides the vindication , was occupied with grave charges upon the Board and the missionaries . The letter , without the appendix , was sent forthwith to Constantinople by the overland mail . To the charge against themselves the missionaries replied , in a letter to the Secretary . This letter was published at Boston , in November , 1844 , and , at the request of the missionaries , was accompanied by extracts from their previous correspondence . To this " Reply of the Missionaries** Mr. Southgate has replied in " A letter to a friend , &amp;c. , by the Right Reverend Horatio Southgate . " We do not propose to go into all the details of this controversy . Those who would sift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are however , certain grave questions connected with it , which we deem it needful to examine . Some of them are startling questions , and may well make a man look about him . They give a fearful aspect to the prospects of our missions . They place the Episcopal church before us , and its missionary movements in an alarming attitude . To the right under . standing and settlement of these questions , the history which we have given was thought to be necessary . 1 . Has Mr. Southgate vindicated himself from the charges which lie against him ? This we think an important question . It is more than a question concerning the strifes of individual men . The missionaries at Constantinople have hitherto had the confidence of the churches which support them . They have been honored and loved in no common degree . That they should continue thus to be honored , an intelligent and fair conclusion must be attained , as to the uprightness and truth with which they have dealt with one counted as an opponent . It is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though these pamphlets give ample materials for a right conclusion , there are those who will not study them for this end  --  but will conclude , that it is aways safe ( for their own reputed sagacity ) to suppose that there have been faults on both sides , and will propound this as the proof of their own wisdom , which is only the confession of their own shallowness . There are others , " who like to fly against the wind**-that think it argues a special elevation above sectarian narrowness and popular prejudice not to he strongly moved , especially against so respectable a body of men as the Episcopal church , and so set down to the credit of their liberality , what belongs to an ignoble indifference to truth . There are others who conclude that out of three pamphlets , two against one , there must be some material from which to construct so long a defense , being utterly unconscious // of the fact , that the truest story is clearly and quickly told , and needs not to be repeated , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to be explained and mended . To decide this question we must go to Constantinople . Unless we go there , the acts alleged can not be understood . He that reasons about these actions without seeing them in the place and circumstances where they were done , reasons as wrongly as a man standing at New York , where the shadows are all northward , might discourse of the landscape at Cape Town , where at noon they all point southward . It may be a very harmless thing to throw a fire-brand into a keg of powdered charcoal , and not so much so , to apply even a spark to a keg of gunpowder . To judge of the act , one must first know what the keg contains . Let us go then to Constantinople . There are the Armenians and Mr. Southgate , ( we will forget that Mr. Badger is in his family , ) and the " Congregational " missionaries as Mr. Southgate calls them . Who are the Armenians ? As men they are intelligent , shrewd and gentlemanly  --  but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the church , the Armenian church . Its patriarch , its bishops , its priests , its deacons , its fasts , its feasts , its rites of worship-these all are to him the Gospel . lie not only holds with Bishop Doane , to the Gospel in the church , but he holds that the Gospel is the church , the Armenian church . Religion is a matter of form and rites , not of the heart and the life . Salvation is attained by a faithful compliance with certain external requisitions ; to which the Savior and judge of all has attached the supreme importance . He contends with the Papist and the Greek , as to what these things are  --  and which is the church ; being utterly ignorant , for all practical purposes utterly ig norant , that the worship of the heart is the end and purpose of the temple . To his church he is thus wedded , because he thinks it will save him . All the influences of education , of custom , perhaps of suffering for his I*ith , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him cleave to it as to his life . Among these men is a family of Christian teachers , who avow it as their highest and sole object , to teach them what religion is-what all churches were designed to promote ; what true worship is ; what all rites were intended to illustrate and secure ; in fine , whose business it is , to do what Christ and his Apostles did , to explain that Pharisaism is not the way of salvation . To accomplish this object , they do not attack the Armenian church or ceremonies , but they appeal to what that very church in its standards teaches of pardon by faith , and of the need of inward renovation . They converse with individuals as they meet them . They reiterate and enforce the simple elements of the religion of the heart . The conscience responds , the intellect is Convinced , the contest between prejudice and conviction is slow but progressive . Light breaks in , but it is as the rising of a gray and broken morning . The tidings of these things spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaven . Those who hear are prejudiced . The ecclesiastics are bitter and jealous . If these things are true , they must alter and remodel the convictions , the feelings and the lives of the nation , and perhaps destroy their church . To those who know of no way of propagating religion , except by teaching notions about ceremonies and metaphysical dogmas ; who hold that there is but one true church , i. e. the Armenian , these men are subtle emissaries , whose only design is to divide the church , to " change the customs which Moses hath delivered . " They attempt // to put the movement down . They vex and banish one and another of the friends of these strangers . Butthey are seen to be so simple in purpose , so strong in their appeals to their own standards and the higher standard , the New Testament , that they can find little to urge against them . They feel too that this new faith is every where advancing ; quietly but surely advancing in its progress . At the request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday to meet those who are inclined to unite with him in prayer , in the study of the Scriptures , and the preaching of the Gospel ; not at the hour of the Armenian service , nor to interfere with any ceremonial of the church . This is viewed with new prejudice . It will certainly lead to schism . In a free communication with their friends at home , these teachers give account of the suggestion of a priest , that there ought to he a secession from the church , and a new sect formed . Upon this they give their own comments . What they wrote is entirely consistent with the instructions of the Board , with what was kno vn of their plans by the merest schoolboy in America that reads the Herald ; and gives no evidence of any new plan recently hatched , or any old plot to promote schism , now first brought to light . It is however , just what false witnesses would find most convenient to gix*e color to their testimony ; " we have heard him say that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs which Moses delivered us . " This passage Mr. Southgate confesses That he translated to a * Armenian , and that it was the oecasiGn of an excitement , in which Mr. Dwight 's service was suspended . This then is a fact . The question in regard to it is , has he vindicated himself from all blame in the matter ? Let us take his own account of it ; of the occa2ion , the circumstances , his own motives and feelings . He says , that he accidentally met with the passage , but that he read it with " mingled grief and astonishment ; " with " astonishment , " as he explains himself , that the missionaries should prove themselves at last , so untrue to their oft repeated protestations , that they did not design a schism , and so untrue to the instructions of the Prudential Committee ,  --  " with grief " that they should contemplate a result , which in his view " would be the most severe blow to the interests of real piety , to the good of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be devised . " " I believed and still believe that if such a sect were formed , it would not be the most evangelical , ' but the most idle , the most useless , and the most unstable spirits which would enlist under its banners , " &amp;c. having these feelings himself , might he not infer what would be those of the Armenians ? If these plans filled him with " grief and astonishment , " how much more would they offend the bigoted and prejudiced Orientals . If Mr. Southgate had been a stranger in Constantinople , he might know how they would view an avowal , which was so offensive to himself . But he was not a stranger . He had lived in that city more than two years , had known not by conjecture , but by fact , how jealous they were upon this very point . What then is a fair inference even from his own words ? What is a fair inference ? The same which we draw when a man applies a match to any explosive mixture , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , not caring if it *1oes . But he tells us he read it to but one . Who does not know that one in such a case , is the same as a thousand , and a thousand the same as one ? A man might as well say , who fires a train that leads to a magazine , that he but applied one spark to but one kernel : to only one kernel of powder . But this man // " still professed to be kindly disposed towards the missionaries , though disapproving the meeting . " What more perfect definition can be given of a possible traitor ? " Profissed to be kindly disposed , though disapproving the meeting I " Common sense would tell any man , that an Armenian , even if he were their bosom friend , was not to be approached by such a development of their secret plans , as Mr. Southgate thought this was , and on a point on which they would be most sensitive . Common sense , it would seem , should have taught Mr. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , by talking about revealing such a matter to one who merely " professed to be their friend , though he disapproved of the meeting . " The man is excited . He asks leave to mention it to another . Consent is at last reluctantly given . And why is all this ? What reason does Mr. S. give to do away with the one conclusion that suggests itself as quick as thought that the design could not be Innocent ? Why it was , that this man might tell him if this were the design of the missionaries . Ask an Armenian what was the secret plan of the missionaries in respect to a matter which the Board had committed themselves to the public by aa open and solemn disavo*val ! Expect that he should know of himself , or by asking from the missionaries , a thing in regard to which they would be most reserved ! ! Oh , rara simplicitas-which freely translated is , " To expect this to be believed , surpasses the average simplicity of bishops . " Take too his own account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mischief . He went to these three Armenians concerned , and to induce them to make allowance for the article , mentioned the circumstances under which it was written , and conveyed to them the solemn declarations of the missionaries , that their intentions were innocent . They faithfully promised to believe this declaration of their intentions , and not to make the article the basis of any proceedings in regard to the meeting . But added they , the meeting must be put down . To this Mr. S. replies , that this was no business of his-that all that he had to do was to protest against their basing their action on this information . While reading this , Mr. S. 's own story , we could not hut be reminded of lago  --  and turning to our Shakspeare , we read the following : logo-I am to pray you , not to strain my speech To grosser issues , nor to larger reach Than to suspicion . Othello-I will not . logo-Should you do so , my lord , My speech . should fall into such vile success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woR . THY FRIEND. * Such is Mr. Southgate 's own story , and such the obvious inferences to which it would lead any unbiased man . We shrink from the conclusions to which he himself would lead us , but we are botind in truth to say , that if Mr. S. had killed a man , and should tell such a story as this to show that his intentions did not go in a line with his action , the story itse*f would hang him . He might be innocent , but all the principles of evidence are a mockery , if he were not convicted . When we turn from Mr. S. 's own story , we learn that Mr. Badger was all this while at Mr. S. 's house , employed abroad in active influences against the missions , and at home , as is reasonable to suppose , in conversations with Mr. S. , in respect to the present and future evils which would result from their labors . The Jacobite bishop of Mosul is in their family . One day in the bazaar , * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why , if his inientions were evil , he did not show the pamphlet to the heads of the Armenian church , and thus obstruct and overthrow the missions . To this we reply , by asking-why did not lago go to Othello with the open and direct charge against Cassio ? He wished the thing done , but did not dare himsetf to appear to do it . // he is seen in company with a Frank , who addresses an Armenian thus " There are some Americans who have come here and opened a meeting for the Armenians and are going to divide the Armenian church ; why do n't you rise up and drive them out of the country ? " Of this Bishop S. says , in his last , " It was not I. " We do not understand the missionaries to imply that it was . If now , such a man as Mr. B. was at Mr. S. 's house-that house must have been full of talk like this , in regard to these unauthorized teachers and promoters of schism . Mr. S. says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did , it would not greatly alter the case , as we have seen . But the missionaries say that this very passage had been the subject of complaint , by Dr. Robertson , on the ground of its inconsistency with their professions , at a conference called for , by Dr. R. and Mr. S. , at which Mr. S. was present , and that it had been the matter of conversation in his hearing . They say , also , that it had been referred to , in a letter of Mr. Vaughan , which Mr. S. must have seen . Of this , Mr. S. says , ( Reply , p. 36 , ) that the missionaries forget to add , that he distinctly stated in their presence at the conference held during the excitement , that he did not believe it , and certainly was not listening if it were read . In an unpublished letter , of October 10 , 1844 , it is again stated , as distinctly remembered by all who were present , that it was the subject of complaint and conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Armenians , that Mr. Southgate is hostile to them , ( the missionaries , ) and has been the cause of these prejudices among their former friends . This impression did not originate with them . It is not confined to their friends , but comes from the mere lookers on . Mr. S. may say , and does say , they are credulous , and indiscriminating , in trusting the natives . But surely , if long residence and much experience , and wariness taught by repeated imposition , and the fact that there are many to advise and assist each other , can not enable them to judge aright whom to believe and whom to distrust , then Mr. S. can not . *corr*ct them for credulous trust . The judgment of seven on such a point , is at least as good as that of one . rfhey say too , that he translated disjointed extracts , and gave a false impression to the Armenians . This he denies . It is certain that false impressions were received , and were corrected by a reading of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an incorrect impression of it in Turkish , or not ; one thing is certain , that he has done so in English . He represents them to say , ( Vind. p. 29 , ) that such a separation would be " a desirable consummation ; " whereas , it was written at a time of active persecution , and at a time when it was likely to continue ; when such a separation might well be called **desirable. *** They say , also , that the two Armenians who , as he says , had been so opposed to the meeting for fear of " schism , " had left for fear of " persecution , " and to avoid " persecution " had been most urgent to commit the " schism " of seeking Frank protection ; that all this talk * " The true explanation of the passage was given him at the time as follows . It was written after there had been a most unjust and outrageous persecution of innocent persons in the Armenian church , for no other crime than that of desiring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practice . The Bible in a language intelligible to the people , was still a prohibited book , and condemned to the flames , and all who should read it , or have any intercourse with those who had come to teach it , were threatened with excommunication and severe bodily punishment . If this state of things should continue , would not a separation from such a church be a most desirable consummation PLette ! r of Oct. 10. // about schism and the history of the church , and of division in it growing out of such assemblies , was new knowledge strangely learned , and never possessed before the reading of this article . He speaks of these men as pious and sober-minded . ' ' They speak of them as raging and passionate men , using vile and illtempered language against the missionaries and their friends . But says Mr. S. , the missionaries expressed themselves satisfied with my explanations of innocence at the conference , and we forever buried the matter . This he tells us in his vindication . This he tells the missionaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against him at Rochester  --  and this he reiterates in his reply , with many words of forgiveness under injury , which would all be very well , provided the case were first clearly proved on which side the injury lay . Of this , the missionaries say , that they might have said that they were satisfied that he did not do the thing from personal malice , but with the reasons of his doing such a thing they never were satisfied . This they say to him and the publicand they say farther , that they have ever ascribed this and every other hostile act , to his peculiar views of duty , growing out of his views of the church and of the evil of an unauthorized ministry , &amp;c. ; to all which he replies , that to reason from a man's principles , is very impertinent and unjust , and that for him to define his principles would be to turn his reply into a theological essay ! They are so kind as to believe that his principles were not so exclusive in 1836-38 , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very courteously saying , that neither at the one time nor the other , did he believe them of the authorized ministry . They tell him that he received the sacrament from the hands of such as they at first , but would not afterwards . He replies , that he longed so much for the grace of the sacraments , after being deprived for two years , that he took for once the sacrament from hands which could give no sacramental grace ; and adds , that he was then a deacon and could not consecrate , and afterwards was a priest and had no occasion ,  --  to do what ? Why , to receive from hands that were not even deacon 's and could not consecrate at all ! If these considerations be added to Mr. S. 's own story , which of itself condemned him , they leave him in a most unenviable position . He has not , and he can not justify himself . He may be innocent , but he has not proved his innocence . Protestations and readiness to forgive his opposers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not supply the want of arguments , but in such want , are themselves an argument against the man who uses them . The missionaries not only are justified in their charges , but they could not avoid the obligation to urge them . Our limits will not allow us to remark upon Mr. S. 's vindication from the charges of " co-operating with Mr. Badger , " and " of coinciding with Papists , in their opposition to evangelical religion . " The first he denies , but without a fact or an argument . The second he does not " understand . " Our readers will easily understand and believe both , from the statements already given . Mr. S. endeavors to produce the impression , that the consequences of this interference were very slight , that the closing the meeting was a very insignificant thing , and that as this is all that has been alledged against him , it is a great ado about nothing . The reply to this is obvious-if they were slight in fact , that does not prove that serious and even terrific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which refuses to be discharged , is guilty of all the lives which would have been destroyed . These Armenians might , as he well // knows , have presented the paper to the Patriarch and he to the Sultan , and the Turkish sword might have leaped from its scabbard  --  and Mr. S. either in rashness or crime risked all this . For it he is guilty . If thoughtlessness is his excuse , let that be urged . If his duty to his church and his horror of schism , let him hug these to his heart , and get all the comfort which they can give . But on this point , we quote from an unpublished letter , written in answer to Mr. S. 's appendix , and dated at Constantinople , Oct. 10 , 1844 . " And now we are prepared to answer the questions-was Mr. Southgate responsible for the suspension of our Armenian service ? The object of his appendix seems to be , to make the impression that this was the chief charge brought against him , and that it is entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we have never referred to the suspension of our meeting , as the most disastrous result that has followed his unfavorable representations to the Armenians , in connection with showing them the Herald . That it was one result , however , is certain , and all Mr. Southgate 's ingenuity can not show it to be otherwise . It is true , as we have said , that we closed our meeting voluntarily , and not by any compulsion , and yet it was a choice between two evils , and we were placed in that dilemma by Mr. Southgate 's course . The most mischievous consequences of that course , however , were not the suspension of the service , but the diverting of men 's minds from things spiritual to things formal ; and starting among them questions , that lead to contention about external things , and thus creating animosities and divisions , and drawing them away from the great object of seeking the salvation of the soul . It is impossible to estimate the magnitude and duration of these evils . The evil consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively slight in their nature , and temporary in their duration ; but the consequences of thus interrupting the progress of religious enquiry , even in a few minds , and diverting the thoughts from that which is fundamental and eternal , to'that which is external and comparatively trifling , are fearful indeed ; and it is impossible to tell when and where they will end . We have no fears for the work which God has begun among the Armenian people , but we have seen enough to convince us , that many who might otherwise have sought and found the truth , and renouncing all confidence in forms and ceremonies , have rested upon Christ alone for salvation , will , in consequence of the efforts of the two or three disaffected individuals alluded to , live and die under the grossest error and delusion . And we regard Mr. Southgate , as bearing no small share in the responsibility of all these results . Itis vain for him to attempt to shake off the responsibility on the plea that the minds of those upon whom he directly operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iu hostility to the preaching service , and to our other labors , or that what he did in the matter , was just the performance of one single act , in which he had no intention of producing all the results that have followed . It would be a poor excuse for a man who had set a city on fire , to say that he found a house in it already filled with combustible materials , by somebody who evidently intended to fire the city , and all he did was to communicate a mere spark to the tinder , and that without the intention of making such devastation . We do not suppose that Mr. Southgate had all the results of this one act in full view before him at the time he did it , nor do we suppose that he , or any other human being , can even now tell what all its fearful consequences will be ; but it is nevertheless true , that he is , in a // very important sense , responsible for them all . That city might never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reckless man never struck the spark into the tinder ; and that preaching service might never have been suspended , nor these wavering friends become decided and virulent enemies , nor those other minds have been prejudiced and confirmed in error , had it not been for Mr. South . gate 's one act of translating the passage in the Herald , which he has quoted ; and his comments upon it . We do by no means allow however , that this is his only attempt to prejudice the minds of the people against us , and interfere with our work . We have satisfactory evidence that he has done this in repeated instances . " 2 . Has Mr. Southgate made good the charge which he urges against the American Board ? Mr. S. 's way of conducting a vindication is a little anomalous . He does not seek to show that the charges can not be true , which is the ordinary and approved method with honest men ; but he strives to prove that those who made them were influenced by bad motives . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his first was " styled u ? *fortunateiy by a friend  --  a Vindication , " and that in a letter to the Church Chronicle he has the grace to acknowledge that the greater part of it is directed against the American Board itself . The charge is , that the American Board has from the first been hostile to Episcopal missions at the East . In this hostility he finds the solution of the readiness to believe and magnify the charges made against himself . This charge , in the form which he brings it , we affirm to be false , and we can not see how Mr. S. could fail to see it to be false . To one method of conducting Episcopal missions it is opposed , and must be opposed . To another method of conducting these missions it is most cordial , and to Episcopal missions and Episcopal missionaries it was most friendlylong before Mr. S. conceived the idea of carrying into that church the missionary spirit to which he has been so untrue . The quotations which Mr. S . gives from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the one class of Episcopal missions , and to quote them as applying to the other , is deceitful in fact  --  and if done with knowledge on the part of the writer , is deceitful in design . In England , these two classes of missions are conducted by different societies . In the American branch of the Episcopal church , differences are not acknowledged to exist , and hence Mr. S. must not allow that he has changed his views upon catholicity , and Bishops Mcllvaine and Doane are alike responsible for such a man as Bishop Southgate . Hence too , remarks and efforts by the friends of the Board , directed against missions after the highest style of catholicity-missions which are to theirs what that of Saul on his way to Damascus was to the apostolic church-are quoted by Mr. Southgate as proving hostility to all Episcopal missions . The facts are these . In England there is on one side , " The Society for promoting Christian Knowledge " and " The Venerable Society for propagating the Gospel , " and on the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first two was started as a conventicle or prayer-meeting , among the Methodistical portion of the church of England about the year 1700 , and the latter was never an organ or branch of the church . Recently they have been cried up as the only societies that can be consistently patronized by the true churchman . Their motto is Catholicity . The Church Missionary Society on the other hand , though of the church of England , believes // more in " propagating the gospel " and " Christian knowledge , " than in propagating " the church . " With the missionaries of this last society and those like them from this country , the American Board has been most cordial . It has indeed held from the first , that for two societies of different denominations to occupy the same field of labor , must occasion inquiry , perplexity , and dispute among the natives ; and for one to thrust itself in where another was already planted , was " an interference . " For the agents of the Oxford party in England to thrust themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minds of the bigoted natives , and to destroy their confidence in their missionaries as " unauthorized " and " unordained " - they have held to be more , and have looked upon them as in effect " coinciding with the papists " and riveting the bonds of formalism . Of their efforts it has spoken freely  --  and against them , its friends lift up their prayers to God . Mr. S. must have known all this for aught that we can see . If he did know it , he has spoken " deceitfully for God . " Besides these quotations which he has thus abused , he has endeavored to fasten the report of " the Nestorian massacre " on the Board and its friends . He says distinctly in his last pamphlet , that , as brought about by Mr. Badger , was " invented " by the friends of the Board , and the solution of it is its hostility to Episcopal missions . The massacre was reported by a letter writer , for a leading London paper , who was residing at Constantinople . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Badger 's fiery and hostile spirit. * It was made the subject of a spirited rebuke by a leading writer of the day , and an ardent Episcopalian , and through these channels it came to this country . It was credited to Mr. Badger here , as there ; but not by the Board at all , nor by its friends exclusively . More than all , the first and most satisfactory account of the transaction , which vindicated Mr. Badger from any charge of the kind , was from an American missionary , Dr. Grant , a missionary of the American Board . The only agency of the Board or its missionaries in respect to this rumor , was first , effectually and finally to put it to rest . Mr. Southgate knew all this . Why then does he speak of it at length in his Vindication , as coming from hostility to Episcopal missions , felt by the American Board ? And why with more audacity still , in his Reply , does he say it was " invented " by its friends for the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missionaries and their friends-all , or some , or one , have had the presumption to put the natural construction on parts of certain letters to the heads of the Eastern churches , and instructions to Episcopal missionaries . The missionaries and their friends have given to these passages their true meaning , as intended and fitted to make invidious comparisons between the American Episcopal church and those of non-Episcopal churches , as adapted to aggravate prejudices already existing , and to rouse these prejudices to a bigoted and fanatical rage . They have thought that though not understood at home ; in their operation abroad , they would be the same influences in kind , if not in degree , with the line all the English papers in which it is remembered that the matter was noticed , were Episcopalian . The Record had severe strictures on Mr. 1*adger about that time , showing that they thought him not too good for deeds of rashness and folly . " * " The letter attributing the massacre to Mr. Badger was written to the London Morning Chronicle , was copied into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the leading Episcopal paper in London The writer of the letter , and // of conduct pursued by Mr. Badger . Mr. S. is not content to stand on the defensive and give a milder construction to these passages . He leaps by a hound upon the enemies ' cannon and imagines them wheeled at once against them , himself astride , with hat in hand . He brings the just construction of the passages as a proof of hostility to the Episcopal church . His language is-would you believe it-these men would have the presumption to quote the language of the excellent Bishop Griswold in its honest import . But what are these passages . The first is from the instructions of the presiding Bishop* " You may farther state to them , the bishops and other ecclesiastical authorities of the Eastern churches , that many of those called Protestants have rejected , and are still so opposed to , episcopacy and confirmation , and the use of liturgies , that an intimate fellowship and connection with them , is at present impracticable . " Mr. Southgate says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are episcopacy , confirmation , the use of a litur*y , fasts and feasts , &amp;c . A communion without these marks is not known , nor can it he conceived of , as a church . The Episcopal church has these signs , and ought to make use of them , and it is for using these advantages , not possessed by us , that he has excited our jealousy . The missionaries say , and their friends , why not represent your own church , and not take upon you also to represent the churches that are non-Episcopal ? Why did not your church bid you to do this , and not also bid you to tell them , * Of this , Mr. Southgate says : " A common onset is made upon the Episcopal church and its missions . Old instructions re raked up and made to lire again zn new meanings . " The missionaries say that they were noticed by themselves and complained of to Messrs . Robertson and Southgate , at the time they first appeared . The reply was , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to non-communion with these dissenting bodies , you have the honor to imitate in some bumble manner , the exclusive and excommunicating spirit of the most apostolic Greek patriarch , &amp;c. &amp;c . It was in obedience to those instructions we suppose , that Dr. Robertson , when some Armenians ventured to say that the missionaries of the Board were regularly ordained , raised his hands in horror , saying , " They are no priests ; they are no priests . I am a priest-but they are no priests . " But says Mr. S. , is not this a plain matter of fact  --  and why object to have it known ? We reply by asking , is it not a plain matter of f*ct , that two bishops of the most important dioceses in the American Episcopal church , have recently been convicted of disgraceful immoralities-and what if the fact should be used to nggravate and inflame the prejudices of these onentals against their co-Bishop Southgate . The ground of compluint is not that the Episcopal church seeks to represent itself with all its advantages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeals to a fanatical bigotry that is now stolid and stupid enough , it should use the same bigotry to the disadvanlage of others . The next extract is from the Bishops ' letter to the Syrian patriarch . " He ( Mr. S. ) will make it clearly understood that the American church has no ecclesiastical connection with the followers of Luther and Calvin , and takes no part in their plans or operations to diffuse the principles of their sects . " This Mr. S. says was intended to guard against the application to ourselves of the epithets , " follower of Luther or Calyin , " by which is understood at the East , " an infidel , a man destitute of all religion , " &amp;c . " The missionaries earnestly evade the application of it to themselves , and why should we be less so . " But why Mr. S. should the term " ecclesiastical " be used , if the I // passage means that the Episcopal church has no connection with " infidels , " &amp;c. ? Why say , that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffuse the principles of their sects ? " The application of all this is so plain , that the attempt to argue against it only brings out more fully its meaning and design , and gives a aexv illustration of what Mr. S. means by " simply representing his own church . " We think our second question has not only answered itself , but cast some light on others which are yet to be asked . 3 . Has Mr. S. proved his charge against the missionaries , of a dishonorable and dishonest concealment of their real character . This charge is closely connected with the one of hostility against Episcopal missions , in the following way . " The reason is that they conceive every such *dvantage arisin* , from Episcop* cy to place them at a disadvantage . If we are known distinctly as an Episcopal church , they must of necessity be known as Congregationalists . But this they have ever endeavored to conceal . Congregationalism is a root which will not thrive on an Eastern soil . It is natural then that they should wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propriety of yielding to such a temptation . Nevertheless it has been so far concealed , that in this city , where their mission has been established some thirteen years , the impression still prevails generally among the Armenians , that the Congregational missionaries arc clergymen of the English church , and I am well assured , that till within two or three years , they were all supposed to be bishops . The impression has been strengthened by their adopting our clerical dress , using the Prayer-book , making the sign of the cross in baptism , and other such like practices unknown to Congregationalists at home . " When we read this passage , we confess ourselves somewhat singularly affected . We should admire its ingenuity , did we not wonder at the audacity which would set it forth as expressing the truth , and were we not struck with horror at its deliberate coolness . It deserves a direct and pointed answer-that answer has been furnished us in a private letter from a friend in that mission , which has come to our hands , unsolicited and unexpected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We insert an extract on our own responsibility , premising that the friend knew not what impressions these amazing statements of Mr. S. had made on the public , and was moved to write after seem the charge which we have quoted , affirmed by Mr. S. in the Chronicle of the Church , after the explicit denial of Drs . Anderson and Hawes . " I wish to repeat to you under my ova hand , that for all the intents and pUrposes for which Mr. S. wrote that charge of concealment , and the proofs of it , as found in the passages of his Vindication in capitals , he has put his hand to what is totally untrue . Not one Armenian or Greek of our acquaintances , in hundreds , knows that we have ever used printed prayers or worn gowns , or supposes that we are bishops , or that we are of the English ( Episcopal ) church . In no religious exercise with natives did we ever depart from our Presbyterian or Congregational customs . What then have you done , that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth , and so unflinchingly reiterated ? ' Why ! just such things as this . At funerals of embassadors and others we wear gowns , as we would in America . Not knoxving French and Italian well , we *et what good written prayers of any orthodox sect we can , or write our own , to perform baptismal and other ceremonies for foreign Protestants . The French and German churches have short liturgies : sometimes we // use them , for French and Germans . Those churches and the Scotch i'squiregownstobeused ; sodosome churches at home desire it . But whathas all this to do with the natives , wit whom we never use written prayers ? But supposing I should ? Would not all the church praise me , i4 not yet knowing the language of the people well enough to extemporize , I should write a prayer so as to lead in devotions ? As for the sign of the cross , ' compare his accusation with his own retraction in the appendix , where he says , that'aflwhogowiththemis. sionaries do not use the sign of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a German Lutheran , in which church the sign of the cross is customary , if not obligatory , that it has been used twice or thrice in the history of the mission-still Mr. Bouthgate never saw it done , never heard of it but from a missibnary telling him , and therefore , as found in his accusation , it is an untruth . But I hope and believe that no missionary has ever preached against an Armenian 's making that sign . We do preach on its having no went , but we have higher work than to spend hours in trying to prove to a mind darkened by soul-destroying errors , that this most ancient and not heretical custom is in itself sinful . The consequences of our course are shown on page 32 of the Vindication , ' where Mr. S. charges , as he has to me , that persons taught by us ' do not make the sign of the cross , and rebuke those who do . The whole gist of Mr. S. 's accusation is , in saying that we do all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thst is the untruth second . We do none of these things , any more than would any American clergyman whose lot is cast in any foreign city of mixed Protestant sects , languages and customs , would be obliged to do . " This familiar and frank statement , and the more formalonointhepub .. lished reply ' of the missionaries , are triumphantly satisfactory , so far as the facts and motives of our brethren are concerned , and give us ample room for conclusions in. respect to the truth and honor of Mr. Southgate 's charge . But the charge has such an air of " cool atrocity " about it , as well as manifest absurdity , that it deserves analysis , as a " psychological " phenomenon . Upon the mind of an Episcopalian , it would and could make but one impression . The members of any sect naturally think themselves well known abroad , as the naked African prince , with a court of a half-dozen negroes4 very naturally asked what was said of him at Paris . Far be it from us to intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infirmity than others , or would be less inclined to suppose their church not familiarly known in its dress and usages at the city of the Sublime Porte . They would very naturally suppose that things look to the eyes of the oriental Christians as to their own , and that a plain Congregationalist might be under very strong temptations to pass himself as an Episcopalian , and would dread to have the concealment exposed . They might be excused for not knowing , even if Mr. Southgate could not , that the robe , the liturgy , the sign of the cross , are none of them Episcopal peculiarities , and would innocently receive the charge as probable and true , and shrink with horror at this deceitful trifling with the " ark of the Lord . " For such this charge was written ; tosuchitwasaddress. ed ; upon such it has produced its effects . But we wonder greatly , Mr. Soutbgate bitterlyoonaplainu , that he wa not introduced to the oriental . by the misuionaric. , suaclergymnan of the Epianpyd church . We hope our reader. , ifthey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not thrust to add , that he is from " the celestial em-*11 // that this letter should have been deemed so altogether triumphant by the traveled and intelligent men , who make up the House of Bishops and Missionary Board , that they should back it up and give it so tremendous a sanction , as to invest its author with a bishop 's robes , even before an answer appeared . So much for the intent of the charge , and the impression which it was fitted to produce . Mr. S. seems to have been rather alarmed at the fire of his own gun . He did not think the charge was so heavy , the report would be so loud , and the recoil so tremendous . " As guns well aimed at duck and plover , Be* r wide and kick their owners over , " so was it with Mr. Southgate 's . Forthwith he begins to soften the charge . In his original letter he plainly implies the intent to deceive . in his letter in the " Church Chronicle , " after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirms the fact of the concealment , with the saving clause , " whether so intended or not . " In his " Reply " to the reply of the missionaries , he also says : " What I meant to say in my pamphlet , of the use of these signs by the missionaries , was , not that they wish to appear to be clergymen of our church distinctively , for our church is not in general distinctively known , but that they wish to appear as possessing the prinzafacie evidences of a clerical character , as they are understood at the East . Now when an Eastern Christian draws the inference that a man is a clergyman because he is wearing a clerical dress , what does this inference amount to ? Why , that he is an Episcopalian  --  a clergyman of an Episcopal church-for they know of no other kind of clergymen or churches . " " What I meant to say , " - why did you not say it ? Such an explanation will hardly do , in a case where " the meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are so wide asunder . But what is it that Mr. Southgate meant to say ? Simply this-that if a man , by word or act , sets himself forth as having a " clerical character , " he must , by the ignorance of the people , be considered an Episcopal clergyman , or belonging to some church in which there are bishops . So that a Congregationalist or Lutheran must never appear as a clergyman , for fear of doing the very dishonest thing of concealing their character ! and to avoid the concealment , they must be content modestly to waive their claims to be cler*ymen ! The American or Prussian embassador may not have a clerical resident in his family , of the Congregational or Lutheran church , because the deceit will be committed of passing them off as Episcopalians . If this is all Mr. Southgate " meant to say , " then has he committed an insult upon his church and the American public , by giving a very different impression . That impression was such , that the Episcopal editor to whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed in " staring capitals , " as being the most damning proof against the mission , for which Mr. S. apologizes , as " extra wadding , " that made his gun go off too hard . In the very act of charging concealment on the missionaries , he masks and conceals his own meaning , so that the words as they should " meet the ear , " should excite amazing wonder , even with Episcopalians , that they could be true . The answer to all this , whatever the meaning may be , is this . The Frank population at Constantinople either do not know or care enough about the Episcopal church to be deceived , or they know too much . Mr. Southgate says , and the missionaries say , and common sense says , that Englishman , American , Infidel , Lutheran , are with them equivalent and unchangeable terms . How absurd to talk of deceiving such men , by members of one sect assuming the badge of another ! It // would be just as reasonable as if two English noblemen , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow ribbon , should be traveling in the heart of Brazil or at Timbuctoo . All at once , the court of St. James is astounded by the intelligence , that the knight of the blue ribbon has stooped to the base and uncourtly act of attempting to pass himself off with a yellow ribbon , knowing the passion of the African for the latter color , to the great scandal of his majesty 's liege subjects , and the injury of the peace of the realm. * But what is supremely amusing is this : " The impression has been strengthened by their adopting our clerical dress , using the Prayer-book , making the sign of the cross in baptism , and other such like practices unknown to Congregationalists at home . " Not one of these badges or signs is peculiar to Episcopalians . Not one of them is Episcopal ; and we have in these words the assertion that our brethren have sought to pass themselves off as Episcopalians , by signs which are no signs of an Episcopalian . Oh , Mr. Southgate ! Having been deacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could you have been so serenely unconscious , that there are Protestant liturgies in use besides " the Book of Common Prayer , " - that the sign of the cross is used in churches non-Episcopal , and that the gown is not " our clerical dress ? " How could you have been ignorant that John Davenport , that most radical of Independents , is painted in a gown , as truly as Rich- * Within a few months , the newspapers told us that some silly New Yorkers were sporting the " royal scarlet , " which in England is the exclusive livery of the " princes of the blood . " XVe think it will be hardly complained of at Washington . In this case there is no deceit because , ifthe New Yorkers kiiow any thing about the matter , they know too much to be imposed on , and if they know nothing , there is no deceit possible . ard Hookei- , that most conservative of all churchmen ; - that the Scotch , the French and German churches require the gown ; and that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all usages , this usage is not esteemed antiPuritanic , but in that city Dr. Beecher was once amazed to find a gown upon his own shoulders ? Above all , how could you be so ignorant of the progress of " church principles , " as not to know , that it has been decided at last , by high Episcopal authority in England , that the gown , so far from being an Episcopal , is not even an ecclesiastical habit , and that henceforth every true Episcopalian must preach in the surplice ? But again , Mr. S. speaks of " other such like practices . " The missionaries ask what he means ; to which he replies , " they are in the habit of keeping , and that by public services for the occasion , Christmas , Good Friday , and Easter . " But are these practices purely Episcopal ? Ask a Lutheran , and he will tell you , No ; that these " fasts and feasts " are kept , " and by public services , " in his church . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the examination of a candidate even for the episcopate , is somewhat indulgent , else Mr. S. might have failed even in his knowledge of what is and what is not the glorious excellence of his own church . " Walk about Zion , and go round about her : Mark ye well her bulwarks , consider her palaces . " We need not ask whether Mr. Southgate has sustained this charge . 4 . What is to be the character and influence of the Episcopal mission at Constantinople ? Upon what principles is it to be prosecuted ? What attitude does it hold towards the dead and corrupt oriental churches ? What will be its relation to the missionaries and the missions of the American Board ? These questions and others like // 264 Bishop Souihgate and Episcopal Missions* them throng in upon us with a fearful interest . We can not avoid the attempt to answer them . It is from its relation to this point , that this controversy presents a higher than any personal interest . It is important indeed , that our missionaries should be understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be vindicated . But it is more important that we should know , and that the Episcopal church should know , what we are to expect from them on the missionary field . Our questions may be answered in a word . This mission was planned , and is to be conducted by Mr. Southgate , whose history and principles have been somewhat illustrated by the facts adduced ; which history and principles may be summed up in the remark of a friend , somewhat witty and somewhat true , " that Mr. Southgate went to Turkey to convert the Greeks , and the Greeks converted him . " This Mr. S. is now a bishop , and as such , is sufficiently irresponsible to give him the largest liberty to " represent his own church " after his own fashion , which church must very patiently submit to the operation . But let us look at our questions more closely . What is the Gospel , what the Christianity , which this mission is to preach ? The answer is , it is not the Gospel which it preaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " Catholicity . " When it meets man in his sin and ruin , and declares to him salvation by Christit does not bid him know his sin , then go directly to Christ and receive a free pardon and divine assistanceand tell him that if he thus believes , he shall be saved , and if he does it not he shall be damned-whether in the church or out of the church . It tells him that to be saved in the appointed way , a man must be united to Christ , by belonging to the church - that he is a member of the church by being baptized-that the grace of Christ is dispensed through the sacraments , and a man is to grow in grace , by a due and believing participation of these sacramentsthat the sinner is justified by faith it is true , but it is by faith in Christ , as approached by the ordinances and prayers of the church , rather than as approached by the sinner alone . This , let it be understood , is the Gospel which Bishop Southgate will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preach through him . We care not to describe it by a name  --  but this is the thing-this the doctrine-these the principles which Bishops Whittiagham and Mellvaine-Bishops Doane and Eastburn , and Doctors Seabury and Milnor must proclaim , and for which they must solicit the contributions of their flocks . It is true that in words Bishop Southgate professes " the doctrine of justification by faith alone , " and declares it to be " the very basis and foundation of all sound theology . " It is also true that he holds that it is through the church and by the sacraments , a man receives from Christ , pardon and eternal life-if he receives him in the way appointed , and that the Gospel which reveals Christ , reveals also , that he is effectually to be received* by union with " the church . " Our authority for this assertion is Mr* Southgate himself . We are well aware that he has given no explicit avowal of his " church principles "  --  and we are well aware of the reason why . We know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's principles on church matters , to what his conduct is likely to ha ; and that he refuses to define his views , lest he make his " reply " " a theological essay . " We are as well aware as he himselfthough not perhaps as sensitively , that there may be other reasons why an explicit avowal of these principles might not tend to unity at home or abroad . His recent work on the Syrian church , however , gives ample satisfaction , that he adopts a very high , if not the very highest // style of Catholicity  --  and that he ivill represent it abroad . But is Catholicity the Gospel which is " the power of God unto salvation ? " Is this what Paul preached with such triumphant power ? Are Dr. Milnor and Bishop Mcllvaine willing to preach this Gospel by proxy to the oriental churches , that are now drunken even to death , with this very Catholicity ? Do they expect that it will awaken them from their sleep ? These questions we will not answer . Let those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give account " as stewards of the mysteries of God . " But let us suppose this Gospel preached . How will it operate ? What is the process of declaring it ? What will be the result ? We are a little curious to watch the working of this doctrine among the eastern Christians . Let us take it for granted , that Bishop Southgate makes good the claims of " the American church , " to be truly Christian and apostolic , notwithstanding , that as he " freely acknowledges " on p. 229 of his last book , " some things are wanting , " e. g. " unction in baptism , the sign of the cross in consecrating the eucharist , and especially prayers for the faithful dead . " Let us suppose that he convinces the Greek and Armenian patriarchs that his presence within their dioceses as a bishop is not against " Can . 22 , of the council of Antioch , A. D. 341 , confirmed by the council of Chalcedon , A. D. 451 , Can . 1 , " * which orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not belonging to his jurisdiction , to ordain any one , or to constitute priests or deacons for places subject to another bishop , " &amp;c . Let us suppose that he gets the sanction of the Greek patriarch , to teach his people , after promising not to teach " heresy or schism , " as the Patriarch understands them , who is the only judge for his people , and especially after having promised according to his avowed principles , t not to distribute the translation of 1840 , from the Hebrew into the Greek , published by the British and Foreign Bible Society , and prohibited by the Patriarch 's bull of July 9 , 1844 . After all these preliminaries , he is allowed to teach the people , and what does he tell them ? After this fashion . " My dear friend , you are a member of the body of Christ by baptism , and have the means of growth in grace by the valid sacraments . In some respects your church is superior to her younger sister , ' holding the Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadfastness ; but in other respects , you will allow me to say , somewhat her inferior , having neither knowledge nor piety . I have come to you , by leave of your superiors , to tell you what you must do to be saved . You must have faith in Christ and the spirit of primitive love and good works , and seek the gift of the Holy Ghost . " " But my worthy friend , how shall I get this faith , and love and piety ? " " You are already baptized , and a member of the body of Christ . You have only to pray and receive the sacraments in the right spirit . " " But what is the right spirit ? " " It is to feel that all this was designed to make you a good man , and to fast and pray and partake , desiring to be a good man at heart , and you shall grow in grace . " " Then the more fasts and feasts and ceremonies of the church I observe the bet . ter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , certainly . " " But all this is nothing new ; our bishops and priests have always taught this . And I have supposed myself growing in grace . When I have sinned , I have done penance , as the church prescribes . I have gone a pilgrim- Visit to the Syrian church , &amp;c. pp. 179 , 180. * See Southgate 's visit to the Syrian church , &amp;c. p. 1137. // age to the Holy Sepulcher , and caught the holy fire , to make myself better . What shall I do more " Nothing , only do all this with the heart . " " But am I not a sinner ? and must I not believe in Christ as my Savior ? And must I not be renewed in the inner man to enter heaven , as Messrs . Dwight and Goodell tell me ? " " Oh yes , but Christ died to provide for the pardon of those who should be united to his church by baptism , and the eucharist ; and to believe in Christ , is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As to regeneration , you were born again when you were baptized  --  and to grow in grace , you must receive the sacraments , knowing that they are designed to make you a better man , praying that they may do it , and believing that they will ; so shall you receive grace and be fitted for heaven . " The Greek , or Armenian , goes away rejoicing , that the learned and pious foreigner has pronounced him in the way to heaven , as he always thought he was , and resolving to redouble his ceremonies , as every Pharisee does , " in a better spirit , " but , trusting to the sacraments , and not to Christ-to his own good works in receiving them , and not to a free and full pardon offered to a guilty sinner . This may be the Gospel , and this may be the way to preach the Gospel . We do not make our paper " a theological essay " to affirm or deny , but we do affirm that to a Greek , or Armenian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blind way . Its little light , and its partial truth , will be perverted to more confirmed formalism , and more certain death . This is not what the missionaries of the American Board are sent to proclaim , or what they teach . They preach Christ , the Savior of those who believe in him for themselves , and for those only . They preach Christ made a Savior-not as the man is united to him by baptism-but , by his own personal act ; himself repenting , and himself believing . The growth in grace , which they reveal , is to be attained not mainly by a mysterious union to him in the eurachist , but by strife against sin and an inward self-watchfulness , in which grace assists and triumphs . Ofceremonies , they teach that they are rotten and offensive , deceitful and damning , except when the heart is prepared to use them , and the heart goes with them ; that they are affecting and powerful symbols , when an intelligent faith looks through them to Christ ; but as vehicles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are workers of death . If a Greek , or Armenian , asks Bishop Southgate , what is the standard of faith ; he must answer , the Scriptures and the first councils . If he asks the missionary of the Board ; he replies , the Scriptures alone . If the Greek or Armenian asks the former , whether this or that ceremony is right , he must do one of four things-he must say it is right , because the church commands it , and you must obey your head in all things , image worship , holy fire , and all , or be guilty of schism ; or you must find out for yourself , by studying the Scriptures , and the decrees of the councils , and if you think it wrong , you must be guilty of heresy and schism , " from which , good Lord deliver us , " and I must be a disturber of the peace . Or he must say outright , it is wrong , and thus be guilty of " schism , " which is to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must practice the " doctrine of reserve , " or double dealing , in which his two pamphlets may turn out to be very important as an apprenticeship . If an Armenian goes to a missionary of the Board with such a question , he instructs him , if it be of any import ; and bids him act by his conscience , and if his church punish him for non-compliance , to plead the Bible . He tells him that if he // remains in his church because it is a church to him , and its indifferent ceremonies are spiritual to him , he must do it " of faith "  --  but if he is thrust out or persecuted , he is not guilty of schism , but his church . We ask another question . What is the attitude which " the American church " holds to the oriental churches ? This question should have come sooner , we are well aware , for to talk of " the church , " or its delegate , as holding any relation to the people of these churches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impertinence . " Before we answer it , we will raise another . What attitude do the missionaries of the Board , hold to these churches , or their organs ? We reply in a word-it is an attitude of entire indifference . Their mission is nof to the heads of these churches , but to the people . They ask their countenance , if it will further their own purposes to secure it , but they do not wait for their permission to begin , nor regard their command to cease . In the Nestorian and Armenian churches , they are present as teachers of religion , in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ , and on the authority of his word . They would convert the whole body as it is , so that the integrity of these churches may be preserved . If " the heads " shall oppose and persecute and divide , it is not their doing . The Episcopal church pursues a very different policy . It recognizes these churches , as true churches ; and their heads as Christ 's ministers . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , we deny it , but if they did , it is a very different thing for them to do it , from what it is for the Episcopal church to do the same . In the view of the one , a church is a church as far as it fulfills the objects of a church . With the other , it can give authority to vanity arid superstition , and convey the sacramental " grace , that bringeth salvation , " through anointed hypo crites and debauchees . The theory of its missions is to secure the friendship of the heads of the churches ; to convert the Greek patriarch , and lo , you have the church ! a plan , which reminds us of the recipe to dress a hare- " first catch a hare . " We wonder that they have not tried the same plan with the Pope , for if that old gentleman could be brought over to the primitive faith , what a splendid operation it would be , and what manifest advantages the Episcopal church has with the aforesaid Episcopal church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fasts and feasts ! To these Eastern churches seven of its bishops did address a letter , introducing Mr. Southgate , inviting to intercourse preliminary to mutual recognition and communion . In this letter several things are noticeable . First . it was not sent by the General Convention , nor the I-louse of Bishops , and yet it represents the American church , and speaks in its name concerning a matter so significant as a union with the Greek patriarch , who sanctions image worship and issues bulls against the Bible . Here have we an illustration of " the reserved rights " of a bishop and his " Episcopal prerogative , " by virtue of the apostolic succession . Second . Its pleasant management of a difficult case . It inquires , " whether a mutual recognitio acan be effected as members of the catholic church of Christ on the basis of the Holy Scriptures and the first councils , including the Apostles ' and Nicene creed , " &amp;c . Of this a competent critic remarks : " I am disposed at once to ask , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to know , how many of the first councils the Episcopal bishops are ready to subscribe to , as being of equal authority with the Holy Scriptures ? Do they go for the first seven , with the Greeks ? Then they approve of image wor // ship and a multitude of other abominable things . Do they mean only the first four ? But the Jacobites and Armenians reject the fourth , and of course would reject our American Episcopalians for receiving it . And if the latter declare that they receive only the first three , then surely they can expect *o receive no quarter from the Greeks , who would anathematize them with the Jacobite and all the other Mono. physite heretics . " Third . The following : " lie will make it clearly understood that the American church has no ecclesiastical connection with the followers of Luther and Calvin , and takes no part in their plans and operations to diffuse the *rrinciples of their sects . " To interpret this passage in its natural signification , Mr. Southgate argues to be a sad sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it be an alternative to retain and use our common sense , or to be reputed hostile to Episcopal missions , we shall prefer the latter alternative , sad as it may be . Fourth . These bishops dare to recognize as branches of the church catholic  --  the Monopbysites , who were excommunicated by the fourth general council , viz , the Nestorians , Armenians and Jacobites , contrary to Palmer and " the catholic " doctrine . Let it be looked to at Oxford . Again . The presiding bishop , in his instructions to Mr. Southgate in 1840 , says : " You may further state to them , that many of those called Protestants , have rejected , and are still so opposed to Episcopacy and confirmation and the use of liturgies , that an intimate fellowship and connection with them is at present impracticable . " Of this Mr. Southgate says , ( Reply , p. 17 , ) that this has been understood to warn the oriental churches against fellowship with non-Episcopal missionaries . We have never so understood it  --  but always in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him take the office of imparting them ? Will he ? What do they love the church for ? Is it not for power and place and money ? And will they by a new version put on the ceremonies and the sacraments , be persuaded that , though members of Christ 's body , they are dead or but just alive ? And will they meekly submit to receive life from this newfledged bishop from their " younger sister of the west , " with two assistants , and an establishment of only one thousand pounds per annum ? It will be a new chapter in the history of conversions when this happens , and rich and powerful Pharisees are seen to be converted by the semi-Pharisaism of Catholicity . And what if they will not be converted ? What if the Greek patriarch should add to his bull of July last against the Bible , another against Bishop Southgate ?  --  or what if , understanding the game better , he should keep him in waiting on fair promises , and like a skillful coquette , should appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will Mr. Southgate do ? Do ? XVhy , he must do nothing , or commit the " sin of schism . " Such is the attitude of the American Episcopal church in respect to the oriental churches . Is it understood at home ? It seems to be understood differently , according to the different optics of the observer . " The Episcopal Protestant " speaks of this mission as follows : " Our own opinion is , that the Episcopal church from similar organization , does possess peculiar advantages in her efforts among oriental Christian bodies , and that if a missionary bishop and his presbyters , understanding and appreciating the Gospel and imbued with its spirit , should approach with trust in and prayer to Christ these benighted souls , they might be , with the divine blessing , most of all likely to enJist the sym pathies of dignitaries , obtain a favorable hearing , win them to the truth , and ensure a co-operation in the work . " This we suppose to have been and still to be the opinion of the great body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the missionary work . To this view of the matter we have no objection  --  and if they will select a field for such operations in which they shall not conflict with missions already established , and which they love as well as we  --  and send to it a bishop and presbyters " understanding and appreciating the Gospel and imbued with its spirit , " we should be very glad to see the experiment of " their advantages " fairly put to the proof . Mr. Southgate says , this well expresses his own idea . We will not dispute with him . XVe only remark , that there may be considerable latitude of interpreting the phrase , " understanding and appreciating the Gospel . " For instance , the way in which " The Churchman " " understands and appreciates the Gospel , " is as follows : " We have never favored the sending of a missionary , in the proper sense of the word , to the Eastern churches ; but we have always thought that it would be of mutual advantage to the pure Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might establish a good understanding between them and us , and pave the way to the restoration of communion . We regard Mr. Southgate as occupying this position , and are therefore interested in his labors . We are under the impression that these churches bear on many points a more faithful and united testimony than ours to ancient Catholic truth , and that consequently an intercourse with them , may be beneficial to us as well as to them . " " This is manifestly the . case as respects the constitution of the church and the ministry  --  a subject *n which the loosest notions // and most pernicious errors are rife among us . Probably if Mr. Southgate 's lectures were published , we should find he had given like testimony on other matters of doctrine and discipline . In the points of pictures , relics , and invocation of saints , we are left to infer that their churches are theoretically sound , since Mr. Southgate speaks only of practical corruption . We are brought to the same conclusion that they are theoretically sound respecting the doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the want of a just appreciation of this doctrine as their great internal defect , yet he gives us no reason to think that they are tainted , or that he is the man to taint them with the Lutheran perversions which are widely disseminated among us , and are the source of most of our d*fflculties . " We might quote from another Episcopal paper in a strain most opposite to this , and most discouragingly of Mr. Southgate and deprecatory of his influence. * But we will not-discord at home is unison with an emphasis abroad , and all these various and inharmonious tones will sweetly blend together in a clear and silvery note , for Mr. Southgate is Bishop , and is the mouth of his church to the orientals . Drs . Milnor and Tyng and Seabury , and Bishops McLlvaine and Hopkins and Whittingham , may speak to each other at home in the dialect of Babel ; but heard at Constantinople , the voice shall be " one and indivisi * Bishop Hopkins says : " I have been obliged to express in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreign missionary bishop to Constantinople , and can not allow that he is sent forth to do apostotic work ' at all , for the simple reason , that I do not believe the apostles would have connived , or appeared to connive , at the corruptions of the Greek and other oriental churches , in the face of the people , under the vague and delusive hope of converting the priesthood , en masse , by friendly private conversation at some future day . ' ble , " for Bishop Southgate interprets it as he pleases . We ask again , and last of all , What will be the relation of this mission to the mission and missionaries of the American Board ? First of all , the Episcopal church has thrust this mission upon ground occupied , and for nearly fifteen years , by the representatives of our churches . They began in weakness and fear , arid God has blessed their labors ; their presence and influence is felt throughout the Armenian church , as the earth in the springtime ferments with its wondrous processes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and death . Their hold on the people is strong . All at once , a messenger comes in , who understands their position , their aims , their hopes , and their strong reliances , for he himself was once a brother in the same school of Christ . At first he resides near them as a friend ; then he proposes to establish a mission to the Greeks . To this they reply , that it would be inexpedient to have a mission from another church on the same ground , yet , as they have never labored among the Greeks , they shall not object , and if the mission is to be established , they hope that he will conduct it . He comes out again , a missionary to the Greeks , and conducts himself as we have seen . He now goes out a missionary bishop , and to the Armenian church also , and the only reason that has the shadow of courtesy to them is , that the Armenian is in communion with the Syrian church , to which he had also before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports of the progress of their work and its hopeful tokens. * He talks Let the following serve as an example . " It is such reports as this , and others less erroneous , but generally conveying a false impression , that fill the pages of the Herald , and make it , to persons reading it in Turkey , little better than a romance . It is such reports as these // with contempt of their prospects , and slanders the character of their converts . He says that to churchmen , and to churchmen alone , " does he believe that the work of restoring and strengthening those churches to be committed , and they alone are able to perform it . " The primitive character of his own church he contends to be its passport and guarantee , and says that her proper lot is to maintain it among the Eastern Christians , and to present herself to them in this character alone . " This is the first condition of our usefulness , and every missionary operation which does not respect it , will be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor , and as the smoke out of the chimney . " He thinks that in the Greek church " there are many , even among the higher clergy , who long for better things , and their influence will be the more felt , the work of restoration will be sooner and better done , if we of the West do not , by our hasty zeal , hurry it into a rank and premature growth . If there has been on the one hand much of painful opposition , there has been which have created the impression that the missionaries of ' the American Board are doing a great work among the Armenians ; reports which , I confidently affirm , there can not be foond five Arinenians in Constantinople who would not read with utter astonishment . " " To report these things as indications of the prosperity of a mission ; to allow them to go forth as if they were connected with missionary operations ; to put down men as ' inquirers , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , as if it were in consequence of the labors of missionaries , when this same state of mind existed long before there was a missionary in the land , nay , always existed as a part of the life of Christianity at the East , is , however interesting it may he to people at home , an unsafe and deceptive mode of sustaining the missionary work . It will come to naught among the Armenians , as it has among the Greeks . " - Mr . Southgate 's letter in the Banner of the Gross , . dug . 31 , 1844. on the other much of injudicious action . " Throughout his volume recently published , there is manifest the most thorough contempt for non-Episcopal missions , and even for Episcopal missions not conducted on his own principles , and towards them the most decided though guarded hostility is expressed . Need we ask what will be the conduct of such a man , and of the mission controlled by such a man , towards these missions ? Will he not labor to counteract their teachings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against them the lawful heads of these churches , and profess that he is doing God service ? How can he do otherwise , if he act according to his professed principles ? And as he thus labors , does not the Episcopal church labor through him against this mission ? Yes , even Dr. Milnor , who with one hand puts tracts into the hands of Messrs . Dwight and Goodell , and with the other sends out Bishop Southgate to be glad if they are burned ! But we are not left to conjecture what Mr. Southgate will do . He tells us that his friendly fQrbearance has been so abused , and his non-interference so misconstrued , that he shall take no care in future what are the results of his labors upon these missions . " They have placed me in a position which otherwise might never have been occupied . It is not a position of hostility , but of indifference . My work will go on , as if their own did not exist . No one is to be avoided because he is their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such reason . The full agency of my church will be carried out , as if they were not in the field . Controversy must cease here . My appropriate work must be done , without any reference to theirs . I have hitherto worked in chains , from an over-sensitive desire to avoid even the appearance of offense. 1 have now no such de // sire , nor do I desire to give of . fense . " Need we here inquire , If Mr. Southgate 's friendship has been so hostile , and productive of such issues , what will not be his indifference , reckless of consequences ? If Mr. Southgate , " working in chains , " can feel and act as he has done , what will he not do when he is Unchained ? But he tells us that " kindness and gentleness , forbearance and love , will , I hope , mark its course . " Yes , and so do certain other " gentle and affectionate sons of the church , " as they give over their victims to the torture for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern for their souls ' welfare ; and , as they consign the hopeless and unreclaimable to the civil power , for the rack and the stake , they do it beseeching them not " to hurt a hair of their heads . " And if Mr. Southgate should happen to rouse the Patriarch and the Sultan , " the bull and the scimitar " both against " the Armenian schismatics , " he would doubtless be very sorry , but would gravely say , that his own church " shall do its own work , with its own means and in its own way . "
