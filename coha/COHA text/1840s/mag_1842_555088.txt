txt FEW subjects , that are really of great importance and general interest , are less frequently discussed in this country , than that of college education and the proper conduct of the establishments in which it is dispensed . Politicians and legislators are not willing to waste much breath in advocating the claims of institutions , the effects of which on the whole body of the people are not immediately visible . Common schools are eminently democratic in their nature . They constitute , after all , the only great engine for the elevation of the laboring classes . For this end laws are comparatively powerless ; and the fair-weather promises of aspirants after office , about a more equal apportionment of wealth and taxation , are found to be wearisome in their repetition and nugatory in their results . Public schools tend to equalize social advantages , because they enable all men to start fair in the race . Instruction in them is felt to be a help in the acquisition , and an ornament in the enjoyment , of riches . The schoolmaster is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a republican cause . Accordingly , when it was ascertained a few years since , that some monarchical governments in the old world had actually got the start of us in improved and enlarged means of primary instruction , the zeal of many was quickened , and a vigorous effort made at least to copy the improvements , which we had lost the honor of inventing and first bringing into practice . In many parts of // the country we can already see the good results of this movemen t . But the higher institutions , which dispense what the French call secondary instruction , do not profit hy this newly awakened ardor in the cause of learning . The number of persons , who expect to reap advantages from these establishments , is comparatively small . The nature and conduct of such seminaries is seemingly aristocratic . Few are concerned in their management , hecause few are competent to the task . The acquisition of several languages and of the higher branches of science , and the thorough culture of the mind in all its faculties , preparatory to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amount of time and money , which most persons can not or will not afford for their children . The immediate advantages of a good system of college education affect but a small part of the community , though its more remote and equally certain results are felt throughout the social and political system . These touch the welfare of men , who never heard the lecture of a professor , and who hardly know what a University means . In the colleges is determined the character of most of the persons , who are to fill the professions , teach the schools , write the hooks , and do most of the business of legislation , for the whole body of the people . The general direction of literature and politics , the prevailing habits and modes of tl ) ought throughout the country , are in the hands of men , whose social position and early advantages have given them an influence , of the magnitude and permanency of which the possessors themselves are hardly conscious . How much , for instance , of the present aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the actual direction of the wealth and power of the mother country , is to be ascribed to the influences at work within the walls of the two great universities of England , and to the nature of the education which is there given . We do not refer merely to the number of authors , politicians , and public men , who were educated at Oxford and Cambridge . It is rather the great body of the English gentry , the wealthy , influential , and intelligent classes , who really hold the reins of power in the country , and to whom hooks and speeches are addressed who hear what authors , politicians , and reformers have to say , and then decide upon the character of what they have // heard . The tendency of national literature , the tone of public sentiment , is rather determined by people who read books , than by those who write them ; by men who vote , rather than by those who speak in Parliament or Congress . The nature of the supply will always be directed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by attending only to the alleged fact , that the graduates of colleges do not , after all , monopolize the prizes in science , literature , and public life , that men are led to underrate the influence of the great seminaries of learning . A cultivated taste , a fine appreciation of scholarship , a regard for scientific pursuits , a nice sense of honor , an attachment to existing institutions , are some of the qualities which English gentlemen acquire in these venerable establishments ; and , though the education there given is far from being the best possible one , though the alumni may often win less distinction in after life , than men of ardent temperaments and brilliant talents , but of irregular training , who start forth from the mass of the people , yet these last would find their progress impeded and their efforts fruitless , if they were not understood , encouraged , and supported by the wealthy graduates of the universities . A century ago , the aid , thus given , assumed the offensive form of individual patronage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for literary and scientific pursuits has spread through a larger number , and manifests itself in a more delicate and effectual way . In this country , the want of an influential and highly educated class , able to appreciate the studies and productions of scholars , discoverers in science , and laborers in the less popular departments of literature , is likely to be felt in a serious degree . Such a body of men can be trained only in colleges deserving of the name , where a large and generous scheme of instruction is prosecuted with ample means and lofty aims . An institution , which is intended to be popular in the lowest sense of the term , which is dependent for support on the majority of the people , and must therefore flatter the prejudices and follow the guidance of that majority , can not send forth graduates , whose acquirements , tastes , and opinions will tend to elevate and refine the feelings and judgments of the community . The utmost they can do will be to preserve the standard of taste and learning where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for // workers in the lighter and more pleasing branches of literature and science . In proportion to the population , we have probably more readers of hooks than any country in the world . Works intended to make science popular and intelligible , treatises on its elements , schoolbooks , works of imagination and fancy , poetry , and novels , - of these we have a good share , and the stock is daily increasing . The English works , which are selected for republication in this country , indicate the taste and inclination of the community more clearly than the books written on this side of the water ; for publishers and booksellers , in reference to these works , blindly follow the public demand , with less regard to local causes , which sometimes give to American books a factitious and ephemeral popularity . English novels are most in request . Elementary treatises on science are in some demand for the use of schools . Biographies and works of travellers are sometimes , though more rarely , appropriated by American publishers . Nearly all the reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not one scientific journal . More elaborate works of recent date are out of the question . It would be a sacrifice of labor and money to attempt their republication . Older publications of this character , the reputation of which has long been established , occasionally appear , but the risk is too great for modern productions . And , if the public taste does not require such books , when they are of foreign origin , and can be had here at cheap cost , there is surely no call for those of domestic manufacture . The power of appreciating these things will appear in due time , it is said ; it will increase with the natural growth of the country . So it will , if due attention be paid to the institutions , whose business is to foster it ; - to the higher seminaries of learning , that are now forming the taste and judgment of the next generation . But , if colleges are neglected and badly managed , and common schools absorb all the attention of the public , we must always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellect of the old world . If we look only at the number of establishments in this country , which bear the name of colleges and universities , it may seem that any fears on this head are very unnecessary . We are better provided with them than the inhabitants of any other region in the world . The last number of the " American Almanac " contains the names of one hundred // and three American colleges , in which there are 765 instructers and 9,936 students . Even this enumeration is not complete , embracing only those institutions which are of some note . According to the census of 1840 , there are in the United States 173 colleges , containing 16,233 students . According to a table , which is copied from a German journal into the " American Almanac , " it appears , that there are hut one hundred and seventeen universities in all Europe , and they contain 94,600 students . New York , with a population of two millions and a half , has twelve colleges or universities ,  --  the names in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prussia , with a population of fourteen millions , has seven universities , and 5,220 students . That is , the former has a college for every 200,000 inhabitants , and every 107 students ; the latter has one for 2,000,000 inhabitants and 373 students . In Prussia , one out of 2,682 inhabitants is a university student ; in New York , one out of 1,946 . It is hardly necessary to say , that the universities of Prussia are among the best in the world ; those of New York are better than most other American colleges . If we take other countries in Europe , the disproportion is quite as striking . France has fourteen colleges and 12,180 students for a population of thirty-five millions ; Pennsylvania has twenty colleges and 2,034 students for a population considerably less than two millions . The New England States , with a population of ahout two millions and a quarter , have nineteen colleges , and 2,857 students ; Great Britain , with a population of twenty-seven millions , has nine universities and 17,750 students . The importande of these statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will appear sufficiently obvious , when we remind our readers of one evident fact ; that , if the money , which has been distributed by legislative grants and private donations among the one hundred and seventy-three colleges in this country , had been divided among only twenty of these institutions , we should still have a larger number of universities in proportion to the population , than any country in Europe , and they would be as wealthy , as well provided with buildings , apparatus , libraries , and all the means of instruction , and as able to command the services of the most eminent professors , as any of the noble // establishments of the old world , excepting perhaps Oxford and Cambridge . As matters now stand , it is melancholy to compare the scanty endowments and insufficient means of the best of our colleges with the least flourishing of those , which exist in Great Britain , France , and Germany . Take the single particular of libraries . There is but one college library in the United States , which contains more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thirty thousand ; fifteen have from ten to twenty thousand and far the larger portion of the other hundred and fifty colleges have less than five thousand . All the college libraries in the country , so far as we have ascertained , present an aggregate of about five hundred and twenty thousand volumes , - not quite so many as those contained in the Biblioth*que du Roi at Paris , or in the royal library at Munich . But the disproportion becomes more glaring , when we consider , that , as the aggregate here is made up of so many different collections , there are probably not more than seventy thousand volumes of distinct works to be found on the shelves of all the colleges in the country . But if the money already appropriated to this object , had been given to a few institutions , instead of being scattered among nearly two hundred , we might now possess five noble collections each of more than a hundred thousand volumes . How much the efficiency of a college depends on the stores in its libiary , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions , or have given any reflection to the subject . Among all the wants of these seminaries , that of books is the most evident and the most pressing . Till ampler proviston is made of these indispensable materials , it is vain to hope for any great improvement in the system of scholastic education in the United States , or for any great progress in the higher departments of literature and science . Some recent English publications painfully remind one of our deficiencies in this respect . Hailam 's " Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth , Sixteenth , and Seventeenth Centuries , " one of the most valuable works that have appeared in Great Britain during the l ) resent century , may be cited as an instance . There is not a library in the country , by the aid of which this work could have been written ; there is not one , which will enable the reader to verify the numerous quotations and references , which it contains . // This is a small matter , it may be thought , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no occasion to retrace the ground . But the power of appreciating such works , the taste for reading them , the ability to understand them , can exist in those communities only , where a relish for literary pursuits is created and kept alive by vast repositories of intellectual wealth designed for public use . Mr. Hallam 's hook will not excite half the interest , which it might create in many minds , if there were means at hand to follow his progress step by step , to review his judgments , criticize his opinions , and examine the correctness of his statements . Great libraries do not merely supply the seed for future products , but they form the atmosphere in which alone the plants will grow , and the fruits ripen to full maturity . They do more . They create the appetite , besides affording the means for its gratification . We have sj ) spoken of the higher ends which colleges subserve , because they are too often founded and supported in this country on wrong considerations . They are patronized with mistaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prO ( luCe . The great evil is the multiplication of colleges and their number will continue to increase , because they are established not to promote the higher interests of learning and science , but to assist the growth of a city , to favor the population of a particular region , or to help the progress of a party or a religious denomination . A spirit of rivalry in this respect exists between the several States , aided by a natural desire of parents to have their children educated near home , and by the importunities of teachers who can not find employment in the older institutions . Universities are established on speculation , to increase the value of house-lots in their immediate neighbourhood . They form part of the machinery by which each religious sect endeavours to strengthen its position and increase its numbers . They are built as subjects of experiment for theorists in the science of instruction , whose plans and opinions the established seminaries obstinately refuse to adopt . The charter of an institution , it is said , is a small boon for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairness to permit all parties , sects , and districts to share alike , and to have a college of their own . Thus the liberality of the public , which is enough to insure success , if it were concentrated on a few objects , is wasted // and rendered fruitless by excessive division . We have a multitude of poor and inefficient establishments , but hardly one of such ample endowments and liberal means of instruction , as to merit the name of a University . There is not one , that occupies such a commanding position , that it can establish a standard of liberal education , to which the others may be obliged by public opinion to conform . In searching after the causes of the low state of the cob leges and of college education in the United States , we are at once struck with the fact , that it is not the disposition of the public in general , which is in fault . There is no insensibility on the part of the community to the claims of these institutions . The statistics just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth here seek the advantages of what is called a liberal education , than in the most enlightened countries of the old world . And there is no lack of money . In this respect a liberal , even a munificent spirit exists . if the whole sum could be ascertained , which our countrymen have contributed for the support of colleges , especially during the last fifty years , it would probably exceed the aggregate funds appropriated to similar institutions in the same time in any country of Europe . The greater age of the establishments in the old world can not be the sole cause of their evident superiority . Colleges do not grow like oaks ; every year does not necessarily add to the stoutness of their trunks , and the breadth of their foliage . Rather , like common dwellinghouses , the older they are , the more inconvenient and uncomfortable they are likely to become . Harvard College can not advantageously he compared with the University of Berlin , nor can Yale he put beside that of Gottingen ; yet age , we believe , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time or another , perhaps quite as much money has been expended upon them as upon their German sisters . The cause of their inferiority in numbets , equipments , and efficiency , must be found in their mismanagement , not by the authorities , who have the immediate charge of them , but by the community , which should have fostered them with more care and discretion . American legislatures are far more willing to found new colleges , than to make any attempt to improve the condition of old ones . Public aid is loudly invoked in the outset but , as soon as the institution is fairly under way , any cen // sorship , any criticism on its management , any suggestion for its improvement , is apt to be resented as officious intermeddling with the concerns of a Corporation or a Board of Trustees . The establishment ceases to be a public one . Commonly it is in the hands of a sect , or a party . It is supported by their donations , and filled by their children , and any efforts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always , that the public cver makes the effort , which it is not likely to do , because no pecuniary or political gain can be expected from the interferer*ce . A German university , on the other hand , is the child of the slate . It is a great public institution , in the welfare of which the government and the people are as deeply interested , as in the good condition of the finances , the laws , the schools , or the roads . A constant oversight is maintained , and such changes are made in the constitution of the seminary , and such persons al ) pointed to office in it , as the altered circumstances of the times , and the public voice , may require . Though the creature of a despotic government , the institution is eminently a popular one , and as such is controlled by public opinion for there are no politics in learning and science , and the interests of the constituted authorities , in regard to such establishments , must coincide with the views and feelings of that portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide upon such matters . Thus the prosperity and the sphere of action of the university are coextensive with the liberal spirit , the enlightened mind , and the powerful resources of the nation to which it belongs . American colleges are generally close , private corporations . Each institution is controlled entirely by its private board of trustees or other officers , and this board is responsible only to the clique , the district of country , the political party , or the religious sect , which called it into being . The interests of this party or denomination form the leading object of effort , and to this end the more general and lofty aims of a university are sacrificed . No wonder , that the institution 's sphere of usefulness is contracted , its management wavering , and its influence small . But in this country , it is said , there would be danger in committing the direction of a college to the public authorities , among whom the mutations of party , the eagerness to obtain office , the restless spirit of innovation , and occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniformity of // management . Nothing could be more fatal to the welfare of a seminary , than to convert its offices , w*bich should be the rewards of scientific activity and thorough scholarship , into the prizes of political ambition . We confess , that there is hazard of this kind under a popular government , to which the more stable institutions of the old world ale not subject . But , in avoiding this danger , there is no need of rushing into the opposite extreme , and regarding all interference on the part of the conmunity as an encroachment on private right . rllhe people can have no sympathy with an institution , in the management of which their voice is of no weigl ) t . Uniformly to repel their criticisms , and reject their suggestions , is to convert them into lukewarm friends or open enemies . The sorest evil of the whole system , the vast multiplication of colleges , may , among others , be traced to this cause . Men , who were indignant that tl ) eir voice sl ) ould never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sought to carry their views into effect by creating new ones . Parties and sects , whose attempts at interference have been too hastily rebuffed , have revenged themselves by starting an opposition . What should be a generous emulation in promoting the great ends for which all colleges are endowed , thus degenerates into a narrow exclusiveness in the dispensation of favors generally , and especially of appointments to office , and a petty contest in obtaining the largest number of students . The duty of all managers of colleges , in respect to maintaining them on a broad foundation and with a public charactei ' , coincides exactly with their true policy . They may be private establishments in regard to the ( lirecting power , but they were endowed for public uses . The funds were given in trust to increase the means of public instruction ; and there is , therefore , no member of the community , however humble , who does not suffer positive wrong , when these funds are perverted to other uses , or ill applied , or the benefit of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trustees are properly accountable to the public , as to the body for whose benefit they were bound to act , and any attenpt to avoid this responsibility by shunning public discussion , or acting without reference to the public voice , is a direct violation of the confidence reposed in them . Publicity of action and accounts , as the only mode of acknowledging this // responsibility , is the first duty of their office . We should not insist on this point so strongly , if it were not for a firm conviction , that in this respect the directors of colleges have mistaken their true interests , and that , by too great shyness in their conduct , and a morbid dread of legislative interference , they have essentially injured the authority , influence , and claims of the institutions , of which they have charge . It is impolitic even to restrict this accountability to a stnaller body , considered as the representatives of the community at large ; - to their own alunmi , for instance , or the inhabitants of their own vicinity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the whole people , - to every youth , who may be desirous of a good education , and to every parent , who would secure the most liberal opportunities of instruction for his son . As these affairs are now directed , the community very seldom hear any thing about the management of a college , except wheti they are called upon to contribute something to its funds . There is no cause to wonder , that the application should very frequently be unsuccessful . Full illustration and proof of these remarks may be found in tl ) e early history of Harvard College . During the first eighty years of its existence , it was in every sense a public institution , closely united with the government of the colony , and established in the respect and affections of the people . It was the child of the legislature , the pride of the clergy , and the venerated " school of the prophets " for the mass of the community . All ranks were interested in its management and its fortunes , as all had contributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasury a tithe of their harvests , and householders gave their few articles of plate , their silver spoons and jugs , for the same end . These offerings , small in amotnt , but strongly indicative of the good-will of the donors , swelled the slender capital , which had been created by the liberality of the General Cotirt , and the munificence of him , whose name is perpetuated , though lie left no child , and the spot of his burial is unknown . And , though the means of the College were still very small , and the education given by it was defective in many respects , yet they probably bore a higher proportion to the wealth of the cornmtnity , and the general state of letters and science , than they have done at any subsequent period . The instructers , the Corporation , the Overseers , and the General Court , acted in // perfect harmony with each other , except when the pressing necessities of the College caused demands to be made for assistance , which the colony was too poor to grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dearly beloved , of the colony , and the whole people regarded its interests as identical with their own . Honorable , in many respects , as the progress of the institution has been in later times , never was its growth so rapid , its efficiency , when compared with its means , so great , or its popularity so universal , as during the first eighty years of its existence . About the year 1720 , a great change became manifest . The child had grown to man 's estate , and repudiated the authority of its parent . The College having increased so much in means and power , a contest for its management arose between the Corporation on the one band , and the Overseers and the General Court on the other . The former , a small , resolute , and energetic body , having the entire command of the funds , and the exclusive privilege of nominating to office , and being thus , as it were , in possession of the ground , proved more than a match for the unwieldy strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and General Court . After a long struggle , the Corporation established its independence , and reduced the visitatorial power over them to the mere shadow , which it has ever since remained . It is no part of ours , to trace out the theological or other causes , besides the love of power , which led to this contest , or to determine which party was in the right . We are only concerned with the results of the change , which were such as might have been expected . The College fell entirely into the hands of seven men , filling the vacancies in their own body , holding offices for life , awl placed under only a nominal accountability . The legislature ceased to cherish an institution , which it could no longer control . It gave a cold approval to the measures of the Corporation , or disregarded its proceedings altogether , or began an active opposition by *vithholding money , which it was bound to furnish , or by chartering new colleges . In these measures the legislature acted in strict accordance with the feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A small class , composed of the graduates , the immediate friends of the officers , the parents in the vicinity , who had children to be educated , and a few far-sighted observers of the progress of letters and science in the country , // continued to wish well to the College , and by all feasible means to aid in its advancement . But the body of the community lost all interest in the progress of the institution , and not a few , in the contests of parties and sects , learned to regard it with suspicion and positive dislike . The College soon assumed too much of the character of a private establishment . It has partaken of the improvements of the age it has rendered noble services to tl ) e cause of learning . But , relatively to the means of the country and the demands of the times , it has declined . It was far beyond what could reasonably be expected of it in the seventeenth century ; it falls short of the impatient spirit and lofty expectations of the ni net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " President Quincy alludes to the fact , that " the general policy of our community at the present day is , to bestow the whole amount of public bounty on the means of common elementary education , and to leave the greater seminaries dependent almost entirely on private munificence . " He observes , and we cordially agree with him , that " no policy could be more mistaken ; for , although it is true , that it is a great interest of a state to distribute far and wide the streams of knowledge over the lower grounds , it is no less its duty to open and enlarge the fountains in the upper country . " But the cause of this unequal and unwise distribution of public favor is not mentioned , though it is equally evident with the fact itself . The people patronize , because they control , the common schools ; every dollar appropriated to this object , is spent utider their eyes and their direction . But the money bestowed upon colleges passes away from their view entirely , and seems only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No wonder that it is reluctantly given . The peculiar constitution of American colleges , by which the whole directing power is placed in the hands of a few men , and those not the persons who do the work within the walls , is the cause of another evil that is frequent in the application of the funds . As the Trustees or Corporation are not directly responsible for the character of the instruction given , that care resting entirely with the Professors and Tutors , they are naturally anxious to leave some token of their active and successful management in the outward appurtenances of the college . The buildings , books , and appa // ratus , form their peculiar province , and the additions made are tangible proofs of their contributions to the prosperity of the seminary . Unluckily , a given sum of money will buy more bricks and mortar , than books and telescopes ; and it will make more show , too , if expended on the former articles , for to unlearned eyes the utility of the latter is not very apparent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the college funds will be appropriated . An architectural mania appears to have seized all the college trustees in the country . Huge dormitories are erected , even when the institution is situated in the midst of a city , for students who would be far better accommodated in boarding-houses and private families . A building is constructed , in dimensions and external ornaments like a palace , to furnish recitation rooms , of which the furniture consists only of pine tables and benches , and the sole occupants are a teacher and a small class of boys . This mistake is no less common , than it is striking . We know of very few colleges , in the country , in which the disproportion between the size of its public rooms and the number of persons who occupy them , is not extreme . At least a hundred and fifty , out of the hundred and seventy-three colleges in the United States , might find ample accommodation each in a single dwellinghouse . We are tempted to hope that no legislature will ever grant a charter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foot of ground or erecting a single edifice . Let them lease one or two private buildings for a term of years , and then , if the movement of the population , or other causes , should ever make a change of site advisable , the institution will not be fast anchored to one spot by the possession of edifices , which have cost a vast sum , but which are found inconvenient for its own objects , and wholly unfit for any other purposes whatever . With admirable prudence and foresight , the founder of the Lowell Institute in Boston inserted a proviso of this character in his will , and , excellent as his other arrangements were , this one is superior to them all , for it guaranties the long-continued usefulness of his princely gift . To show the magnitude of the evil , against which this establishment is effectually preserved , we have only to mention the name of the Girard College . It is instructive to look at the several steps , by which a new // college is usually established at the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant or private donation , the whole is at once expended , and very often a large debt is contracted , in erecting one or more buildings . A high-sounding name is adopted , and a president and professors are appointed , whose salaries are to be paid out of the fees to be received for tuition . Thus far , all is well . The university is a very good university , only it has no students . The measures which are next taken are most injurious to the cause of sound learning and the whole system of college education in the United States . Students must be had at all risks ; and every gain , that the new institution makes in this respect , involves a loss of honor and profit to the older seminaries . The most flattering proposals are made , and every temptation is held out , both by private and public means , to call recruits round the new standard . Old abuses in instruction and discipline are to be done away , and the best possible scholars are to be manufactured in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity and quality , will be of the highest character , and it is offered on the lowest terms . We are sorry to use these commercial metaphors , but no other language will give a correct idea of the proceedings . Certain qualifications are required for entrance , but the examination is a nominal one , and pupils are really admitted to matriculation on any terms . The course of studies , and the mode of pursuing them , are modified in all possible ways , so as to suit the tastes and wishes of every individual . Popularity is the great object sought , and the institution thus blindly follows , without attempting to guide , public opinion . In consequence , a college degree falls in value every day , and the course of liberal studies necessary to obtain it is quite as limited and unsettled , as that which is pursued in the seminaries of humbler pretensions . This picture may appear overcharged , but it is strictly applicable to a great majority of the colleges in the country and the course of the older institutions is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much longer any exceptions to its truth . With such a number of rivals , and with the impression , which exists very generally in the community , that a college education is the same thing , wherever it may be obtained , it is vain to hope , that the course of any one establishment will long continue to differ widely from the rest . They // are all more or less dependent for support on the fees received for tuition ; and the reliance which each might have on its immediate neighbourhood for a supply of pupils , with whom proximity to their homes is always a great consideration , is constantly lessened by the appearance of a nearer competitor . The number of instructors required in so many institutions is immense , and the continual increase makes it necessary every day to lower the standard of qualification , and thus to lessen the dignity of the office . The teachers employed in ninety-four colleges , from which we have accounts , amount to seven hundred and seventy-six ; which makes a little more than an average of eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportionate number , there would be an aggregate of one thousand four hundred and twenty-seven college instructors in the country . But as those from which we have accounts are far the most considerable in respect to the means of instruction , it is probable that the institutions not reported employ a much smaller number , and the aggregate is therefore considerably diminished . The best appointed have one instructor for every ten students ; others have not more than one for every thirty . This comparison alone shows how unequal must be the tuition given in the several colleges . If we had the means of comparing the number of branches of science and letters professed to be taught , with the number of professors , the inequality would be yet more n ) anifest . But it is plain enough already , that the fact of having graduated at a college supplies a very insufficient test , not merely of the scholarly attainments of an individual , for that must be the case everywhere , but of the degree of instruction to which he has had access . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required before one can be admitted to practise certain professions . But , in many instances this qualification is not requisite ; and it can hardly be expected , that a diploma will be of use much longer in this , or in any other case . During the infancy of the college system in this country , the presidents and professors , for the most part , were graduates of the English universities ; and they brought with them the idea of what constitutes a liberal education , and the standard of scholarship which existed in those great seminaries . The course of studies , which they introduced , was // very limited , but it was pursued with an exactitude and thoroughness , to which no pretension is made at the present day . It was complete , so far as it professed to go . Classical learning , of course , was the chief object of pursuit and we presume the graduates of those days were better scholars in the languages than any of their successors . On the accession of one of the English monarchs , Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Oxford and Cambridge ; and the Latin and Greek odes were thought to compare not unfavorably with those which came from the parent institutions . Sapphics and hexameters are not in fashion under our present college system , and whether we regret their obsoleteness , or not , yet when they did appear , they afforded honorable proof , that the instruction professed to be given in these seminaries was complete , accurate , and profound . After the first generation passed away , American graduates were elected to fill the chairs in their respective institutions , and the love of general scholarship was somewhat modified by their zeal for theological learning . When the ecclesiastical contests lost their vigor and general interest , colleges had multiplied , and rivalship sprung up among them , not in respect to the efficiency and completeness of their respective systems , but in regard to popular favor , on which they were all dependent . The graduates of one generation became the teachers of the next , and the rapidly increasing demand for instructors precluded any great nicety in the selection . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the classes successively passed off the stage , and as each new college came into being . Each institution entertains a natural preference for its own children , and the range of selection by this means is still more diminished . Under these circumstances , college instruction must necessarily and continually deteriorate , and a knowledge of this fact has led , in a few instances , to the choice of a foreigner of distinguished attainments to fill a professor 's chair . The precedent would he more generally followed , if the choice were not naturally an unpopular one . When the University of Virginia was first established , a large proportion of its first hoard of instructors were foreigners . But this course did not add to the prosperity of the institution , and the vacancies have since been filled by American scholars . // The preceding remarks had been prepared , when Dr. Wayland 's little book came into our hands ; and we were glad to find , that the views which we have advanced are in substance confirmed by his authority . The work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former publications . He has bestowed much thought upon the subject , and has brought to it the fruits of careful observation and long experience . Being himself the President of a college of high standing , which owes its present prosperity in great part to his able teaching and skilful management , and having studied carefully the university systems of the old world , during a visit to Europe , he is probably as well qualified as any person in the country , to make known the errors and defects in our own institutions , and to suggest the proper remedies . And he has the rare merit of speaking his sentiments on a delicate subject without fear or reservation , though in no harsh or offensive spirit . The tone of the work is singularly bold and uncompromising . He has probed every part of the college system in the United States , showing its general weakness and inefficiency , laying the fault where it is due , and calling for reform and improvement with the ardor of a generous mind , but at the same time with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thoughts " are not designed to set forth a new theory of education , to recommend an untried scheme of instruction or discipline , from which the most brilliant results are prophesied . There are enough of such ingenious and sweeping speculations already before the public . Dr. Wayland 's views , founded on a close and comprehensive examination of the system as it is , and as it ought to be , are extremely practical ; and , if they fall into right hands , and are considered in a proper spirit , they can not fail to produce immediate and highly important improvements . In the remainder of what we have to offer , we shall follow the course of nis remarks . Our author 's opinion of the college system in its present state may be inferred from the following extract . " From the preceding facts , I think we are warranted in coming to the following conclusions . First , that there is in this country a very general willingness both in the public and on the part of individuals to furnish all the necessary means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present system // of collegiate education does not meet the wants of the public . The evidence of this is seen in the fact , that change after change has been suggested in the system without however any decided result , and still more from the fact , that although this kind of education is afforded at a lower price than any other , we can not support our present institutions without giving a large portion of our education away . Third , that this state of things is neither owing to the poverty of our people nor to their indifference to the subject of education . Our citizens seem really more willing to educate other men 's sons than their own , to provide the means of education rather than to avail themselves of them after they have been provided . Now , do not these facts indicate the necessity of some change in our education system ? " - pp. 16 , 17 . Among the experiments that have recently been tried , Dr. Wayland notices the one on which we had occasion to offer some remarks in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he regards the scheme as a total failure . " It has been said , that the course of study in our colleges was formed in a remote age , and that it is adapted only to a state of society very different from our own . Specially has it been urged that the study of the classics is at best but useless , that it has no relation to our present duties and every day engagements , and that the time devoted to it had much better be employed upon the study of the Modern Languages . Besides , it has been said , that our collegiate course should extend its benefits to merchants , manufacturers , and every class of citizens . These persons desire the honors of a degree as much as others . They do not , however , wish to waste their time in the study of the classics , and therefore the studies required of the candidate for a degree should be accommodated so as to meet these their reasonable wishes . It was predicted , that as soon as this change should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were anxious to avail themselves of these advantages and to obtain the honor of a degree . " In obedience with these suggestions a change was made some years since in the studies of some of our colleges . Both a classical and scientific course were established , the first requiring the study of the Learned and the other substituting in their room the Modern languages . Teachers were engaged , classes were divided , each student had his option , and all who wished were invited to become candidates for a degree upon these modified conditions . But what was the result ? No one came to accept of what was thus freely offered . The system // dragged for a few years , and then perished from mere inanition . " Very much the same course has been pursued in regard to the higher mathematics . The same objections were made to this branch of a liberal education , and it has been proposed to substitute in their place the study of history or of natural science . To a considerable degree this experiment has been combined with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The colleges so far as I know , which have obeyed the suggestions of the public , have failed to find themselves sustained by the public . The means , which it was supposed would increase the number of students in fact diminished it , and thus things gradually , after every variety of trial , have generally tended to their original constitution . So much easier is it to discover faults than to amend them ; to point out evils than to remove them . And thus have we been taught , that the public does not always know what it wants , and that it is not always wise to take it at its word . " - pp. 12 , 13 . In reviewing the whole plan of college education in the United States , the first topic that attracts notice is the constitution and mode of action of that board , apart from the body of the instructors , which has the general direction of the institution . They are variously denominated the Trustees , Directors , or Corporation of the college ; but as a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an English college , Dr. Wayland calls them the " visitorial ( ? ) power . " They form the most powerful , but the least active part of the government . They hold the property , appoint and remove the officers , confer the degrees , and determine the course of studies and the general plan of instruction . Thus , if the practice coincided with the theory , they alone would be responsible for the success of the institution . But usually they form a very large and inert body , which meets only once or twice a year , and then only for the purpose of listening to the advice , or ratifying the measures , of one or two active members , or of the president and professors . In a few instances , however , their number is very small , and they really exercise all the powers confided to them , without being obliged to consult the officers of instruction , or to render any thing more than a nominal account of their proceedings . It is difficult to say , which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant queries respecting the conduct and efficiency of these boards of management and visitation . // " 1 . Are the boards of colleges chosen simply in view of their qualifications , for this peculiar office ? Are they , in general , capable of judging of the qualifications of the persons whom they appoint , or of their success after they have been appointed . Are they specially interested in the subject of education ? Do they , in consequence of their appointment to this office , make the subject of education their particular study ? Do they as a matter of duty devote any portion of their time to this particular labor ? Are they chosen for political , or sectarian , or other reasons , instead of those which have been here suggested ? The answer to these questions it is not necessary that I should suggest . Every one acquainted with the practical working of our collegiate system , can answer them as well as I. " By these remarks I hope it will not be supposed that I am capable of the least feeling of disrespect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know them to be frequently chosen from the best men in the land ; and I believe that they will be the last to take offence at any suggestions which are necessary to a full discussion of this subject . I speak not of the men but of the system . They have rarely if ever sought the places which they occupy ; and have generally accepted them at the wish of the friends of the institutions which they represent . They were not expected to perform any labor , and they have not supposed that it was their duty to perform any . It is the error not merely of boards of visitors , but of the community . The importance of the subject has been forgotten , and hence every one of its departments has suffered the effects of that forgetfulness. - pp. 53 , 54 . It is vain to hope for any great improvement in our system of college education , till the constitution of these boards is entirely changed . They are clothed with powers , which they are wholly incompetent to exercise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have as few opportunities of becoming acquainted , as any other persons in the community . If imbued with an active and innovating spirit , innumerable experiments are tried , the course of the institution is vacillating , and the officers of instruction are reduced to a state of dependence upon them , to which no able and high-minded man will submit . They prescribe the text* books and the general plan of instruction for a professor , when , very frequently , they are hardly qualified to become his pupils . An able and diligent teacher is hampered in all his movements by their regulations ; a feeble and incompetent one is freed from all responsibility by referring his ill // success to their bad management and positive injunctions . If , on the other hand , the board is indolent and dilatory , the college languishes , evils of all kinds become inveterate , and still the instructors receive no blame , because nominally they have not the power to act . The institution quietly drops far behind the age , and the public complain without knowing whom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Wayland suggests , that the members should be chosen for a term of years , and not for life , should be few in number , and be " elected by some body out of themselves . " The reasons for these changes are obvious . When office is permanent , the holders of it become remiss , especially if their duties are not continuous , and occupy but little of their time ; and a single inefficient colleague , whom it is impossible to remove , forms a clog on all their proceedings . But , as experience is a necessary qualification , and time is required to show the effects of new measures in the administration of the college , the period of office ought not to be a short one , and the members should be eligible for a second term , if their conduct merits approval . Fewness of numbers is absolutely essential to keep alive the feeling of responsibility , and to insure energy and despatch in action . The evil of allowing such a board to fill its own vacancies is , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clique or a sect , and to preserve for a long period the same principles of management . The members naturally prefer those persons , who agree with them in opinion , and the body , by every fresh appointment , erects new intrenebments against the improvements of the age , and fortifies itself in error . We lay no stress on the fact , that a close corporation perpetuating itself , while it has the sole direction of a great public interest , is not consonant with the genius of our republican institutions ; for establishments of learning have nothing to do with politics , and democratic principles are as much out of place in the board of mana * ement , as in the interior of a schoolroom . But catholic principles , and facilities for introducing improvements , are essential to the welfare of all institutions , whether of government or education ; and in a republican country , it is surely no objection to any measure for securing these ends , that it conforms to the general policy of th state , and acknowledges the authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes recommended by Dr. Wayland , we think the constitution of the visitatorial power would still be radically defective , unless the powers and duties of the office were lessened , or the qualifications for it increased . The management of the funds might properly remain with this board , for the members are often chosen with special reference to this end , and their financial measures have frequently been very successful . But the great abuse on which we have commented above is a sufficient reason for restricting the board from purchasing any land , or erecting any huilding , without special permission from the legislature , or some other numerous and popular body . That the course of studies and the general plan of instruction should be under the control of this body , we consider as a great evil , and even as a violation , in most instances , of the spirit of the charter . The chief objects of this board are the management of the college property , and the appointment of the teachers . The officers of instruction are thus entirely in the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body is active and chooses to assume its authority , it has entire control over the discipline , the choice of text-books , and the whole plan of education . In some cases , the opinion of the instructors respecting a proposed alteration in the studies is never asked ; and , if they resist the change , they are turned out , and more compliant individuals are put into their places . It is surely a great anomaly , that persons , who have had no practical experience in instruction , who have never made a special study of the science of education , who meet but a few times in the course of a year , and who are usually distinguished rather by wealth , professional success , or high standing in society , than by great learning or scientific attainments , should arrange the general scheme and the details of the work to be done in a literary and scientific institution , without being obliged even to consult the men , who are to carry their arrangements into effect , who are constantly engaged in teaching , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the former are often most deficient . It is no sufficient palliation of this evil , that the visitatorial power is usually wise enough to wave this exercise of authority , and to rely wholly upon the judgment of the instructors . The responsibility should rest where the power is actually exercised . It is wrong that the Trustees should possess this authority , and // absurd that they should attempt to wield it The only excuse for putting it into their hands is the danger lest the teachers , if allowed to parcel out and regulate their own work , should consult their own convenience and love of ease , rather than the good of the pupils or the welfare of the seminary . There would he some force in this reasoning , if the professors in a college belonged to the same class , and were actuated by the same motives , as the day-laborers on a canal or a railroad . But they are commonly supposed to be influenced by higher and more disinterested motives , - to have some regard for their own reputation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficient in these important respects , the remedy is still an easy one , and wholly within the sphere of the legitimate duties of the visitors . Let them be at once removed from office , and more competent and faithful persons be elected to their place . The theory hitherto has been , that there can be no hope of efficient action on the part of the instructors , unless they are kept constantly under the supervision and control of the trustees or overseers . But the question naturally arises , Qais custodiet ipsos custodes ; - Who shall he answerable for the activity , the diligence , the faithfulness of the trustees themselves ? A body of men are more apt to perform their duty well , if it is their daily office , and their reputation depends upon it , than if they are required to act only at long intervals , while their constant attention is absorbed by other concerns . But put them under a supervision , which is only nominal nine tenths of the time , and vexatious the other tenth , and the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will surely be imperfectly and carelessly done . We quote a few remarks from Dr. Wayland on another and the most important function of the overseers or visitors , - the selection of proper persons for the offices of instruction . " And first , as to the mode of securing the best men for instructors . In order to accomplish this result , the appointing power should most properly reside with the visitorial corporation . They have no interest to subserve , and if they are able anil willing to perform their duty , all that is needful can be done . But supposing this he the case , how shall they ascertain the desert of the candidate . In Scotland , elections to professorships depend , I believe , mainly on family , or political , or ecclesiasti // cal interest . In England , professors are generally appointed by such persons as the statutes of the founder may have ordained , and their offices are generally bestowed as the reward of successful scholarship , and are not considered as a part of the working system of the university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the departments , are made to depend upon a rigorous and searching examination of the candidates by a competent board ; and on the examination , which the candidates conduct , of each other . In Germany , as every graduate may obtain a license to teach in the University , every one has an opportunity of showing to the public his ability , and of thus enforcing his claim to the honors of a vacant chair . What mode should be adopted with us I pretend not to decide ; but that it should be such as to secure the highest amount of talent and skill , is , I think , evident . It should therefore be such as to allow free competition , and it should involve such tests as would inevitably secure the public against imposition , and it should be conducted with perfect impartiality . Were professorships in all our colleges open to competition , and were every candidate sure that the election would be decided upon the merits of the case , the stimulus to intellectual cultivation in this country would be greatly increased , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Secondly . The tenure and the emoluments of office should , as far as possible , be made to depend upon the labor and the success of the incumbent . A small salary might properly be guarantied to him , and the rest should depend upon himself . This might be accomplished by authorizing him to receive payment for tickets . This would however be of no avail if every person were obliged to take a ticket who was a candidate for a degree , unless parallel professorships were appointed in case the regular incumbent failed to satisfy just expectation . Were professors appointed in the manner I have suggested , they would be placed under the same motives to labor as any other man . Every one knowing that his emolument and distinction would be increased in proportion to his exertion , would throw his whole soul into his work , and the public would thus derive the benefit of his full and concentrated mental effort . Were this the case also , there would be no difficulty in equalizing labor . Where labor brings its appropriate reward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in such a case , is desirous of doing all in his power , and of doing it as well as he can . In this most important point , therefore , the necessity of visitation is to a considerable degree removed , since the system is so arranged that it will go of itself . " - pp. 63-6*. // We can not agree with our author in the opinion , that the appointing power ought to remain with the visitors . The French and German method , as he explains it , seems to he far preferable , and we incline to think there is no insuperable difficulty in the way of its introduction into this country . And , if the appointment is to he the result of a fair trial open to all competitors , it is surely too much to suppose , that any one body of men , brought together mainly for other purposes , will he equally competent to act as judges in every case , whether the contest relates to philological , literary , or scientific attainments . We apprehend there are few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of superiority between half a dozen eminent mathematicians . It is not necessary , that they should be qualified for such emergencies . The umpires in each trial should he a committee specially appointed for this purpose , and naturally including the men most distinguished in the particular study , who did not choose to enter the lists themselves . This course would insure the utmost publicity and fairness in the proceedings . No disappointed candidate could impugn the decision of such a tribunal , though he might well question the judgment of men , who made no pretensions to extraordinary attainments in the science , which was the object of the trial . Dr. Wayland concedes , that the appointments to the professorships are now made in the most hurried and injudicious manner . The vacancies are always filled by the visitors , sometimes relying entirely on their own judgment , and sometimes yielding to the suggestions of the other instructors . But in no case is competition admitted , nor are the candidates examined , nor are any means taken to ascertain who is the most competent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies are usually so constituted , as to be open in the greatest degree to the influences of coteries , parties , and sects . They have enough confidence in their own judgment to appoint a man to office , but not to remove him from it , if he prove unworthy . The latter step , indeed , would evince their own want of discretion in making the appointment , and for this reason , if for no other , we would keep the power to elect distinct from the power to remove . Any body of men will he slow to displace those whom its own action has raised to office . On the evil of allowing an incompetent person to continue in the office of instructor , we again quote from Dr. Wayland. // " But suppose the ease to be reversed . Suppose that an unsuitable man has been appointed , and that he is unable from want of talent , learning , or industry to discharge with effect the duties of his office . His instruction is known to be almost worthless . He goes through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn is obliged to attend upon his appointed exercises . He performs the least possible amount of labor consistent with physical obedience to the law . The college suffers . The indolence originating in his department either spreads into all the others , or must be counteracted by the increased effort of his associates . In the mean time the number of students , in consequence of his inefficiency , diminishes , and the means of the institution are impaired . He is not only supported by his associates , but they are , by his failure , rendered less able to support either him or themselves . Suppose all this , and what , I ask , is the remedy ? " It may be said , that the corporation has the power of removal . True , but for what cause except incompetency ? And who does not know that this is one of the most difficult things to be proved ? Where is the standard of competency , and how is it to be applied in this case ? That he does not do his duty , everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no one doubts . But is he so incompetent that he must be dismissed , and his living taken away ? What can he do if he is removed ? These are the questions that would be asked at once , instead of the question whether it be right for a man to get his living by wasting the time and ruining the intellectual habits of all the young men who are so unfortunate as to come under his charge . " - pp. 70 , 71 . " But suppose all this to have been overcome , and the case to be honestly brought before the visitorial power . The incumbent is incompetent . But he was appointed without examination . Is he more incompetent than he was when appointed ? His sins are sins of omission , how shall these be proved . If , then , he be a man destitute of honor and public spirit , and determined to hold fast to the emoluments of an office while incompetent to the discharge of its duties , it may be very difficult to relieve the institution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is it remarkable if a Faculty bear for life an infliction of this sort , and see their labors rendered comparatively useless , and the young men committed to their charge wasting a large portion of their time , and look on in hopeless despondency , because they know of no practicable method of relief ? I have myself known of a case in which a gentleman utterly unfit for his office was // appointed to preside over a very important department of college education ; for more than twenty years he kept that department down under the intolerable pressure of his own inefficiency ; and thus more than twenty classes of young men were sent out into the world without any adequate instruction in one branch of their education ; without the mental discipline which this portion of study ought to have afforded ; by so much unfitted for the study of a profession , and prepared only to depress the standard of education whenever they were employed as instructors . I think that any sober man will agree with me , that this is a serious evil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collegiate system , shall we find the remedy ? And is it not time that a remedy be provided ? " - pp. 72 , 73 . The danger of injudicious and hurtful appointments is hardly lessened , when great weight is given to the recommendation of the Faculty of instructors . There are parties , and rivalships , and jealousies in the literary and scientific , as well as in the political world . The choice by the professors will also be influenced by those personal qualities of a candidate , which may , or may not , render him a pleasant colleague in office . Nepotism , moreover , is the easily besetting sin of a body , that is empowered to fill its own vacancies . Friends , sons , and relatives are to be provided for and the assent of one 's colleagues to their election is easily obtained by an intimation , that the favor will be reciprocated on the next occasion . Nothing can he more hurtful , than such jobbing , to the interests of the college . The appointing power ougl ) t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undue bias , and therefore the choice of one of their own number , however high may be his attainments and reputation , is always an injurious precedent . The disappointment of the unsuccessful candidate is embittered , his complaints find a ready hearing , and public confidence is greatly impaired . Under no temptation , therefore , ought a person who looks towards a future appointment in the college , ever to become a member of the electoral body . In answer to these objections to the common modes of appointment , an appeal may be made to experience , to prove that the system works well , and the professorships in our colleges are now filled , in many instances , by as eminent men as the country affords , and in most others by instructors quite as able as such an office could be expected to command . We acknowledge the fact , and readily endorse the // statement of Dr. Wayland , that our colleges " are in the main well officered , and the incumbents are generally able and industrious men . " There are exceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see their number diminished . But supposing that the offices were all well filled , are the teachers chosen in such a manner as to enhance the dignity and importance of the station , and to increase the number of those , who are willing to accept a similar post ? Does the situation gain or lose respectability from the circumstances under which it is occupied ? Are the public always satisfied , after each nomination , that the best person has been selected ? We think these questions must be answered in the negative . Many of the present incumbents , however well qualified , owe their appointments to some *ccident , which , on occasion of a vacancy , suggested their names to the electors . The range for selection is a very limited one ; no public announcement calls forth the applications of all who may wish for the place , and the success , which was unsonght , is little prized . As regards pecuniary emolument , the situation is not a tempting one for those who have already acquired eminence in the professions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept it when offered . The inferior offices of the college form a good school for training professors , but these posts are usually held by young men only for a short time , and the want of age and reputation makes a selection from them extremely hazardous . The effect of inviting all comers to an open competition would be to induce many persons to prepare themselves sedulously for this particular employment , and thus the offices would no longer be so often filled by those whom accident or caprice had caused to leave the professions , and who enter upon untried duties with all the rust and tarnish contracted by long exercise in very dissimilar pursuits . If this liberal system is found to work well in France and other countries of the old world , it certainly deserves a fair trial in republican America . It will be further objected , that , if a concurrence were pro* claimed under the present state of things , but very few would care to engage in the trial , - that the most competent persons would also be most reluctant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a result , and can only say , in reply , that the new mode of appointment must form only one link in a chain of improvements , the effect of which // would be to raise very high the character of our colleges , and to render a situation in them extremely desirable . Let the number of these institutions be greatly diminished , and their wealth and appurtenances for study proportionally increased ; let them assume more of a national character , and cease to be mere private establishments ; let the officers in them be freed from their humiliating dependence on bodies , who have only an occasional connexion with the college , and no f ) ermanent interest in its welfare ; and let them assume all the responsibility of their own acts ; finally , let . these offices , greatly increased in emolument and respectability , be thrown open to free and honorable competition , and they will be more coveted than the most distinguished and lucrative posts in the professions , or under the government . It is true , that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and important improvements . But this is no reason against holding them constantly in view , as objects that can and ought to be obtained , and which will be obtained , sooner or later , if henceforth every step taken be a step in advance . It is not too much to affirm , that nearly every important measure , adopted by the managers of colleges in this country for the last twenty years , has been , in reference to these ameliorations , of a retrograde character . The older and more distinguished institutions were reluctant for a time to enter on this backward course ; but lately they have begun to take the lead in it . The number of colleges is now much too great for our population ; and this evil is , of all others , the most far-reaching in its effects , and the most difficult to be remedied . But if a check be put upon the creation of new establishments , as our population increases , the evil will gradually cure itself . And farther , if public attention be drawn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and private donations will soon be confined to those of older date and ampler means , and the younger and feebler ones will be allowed to die out . The former will be placed on a more independent footing . They will be enabled to project and execute bold and generous measures for improving the quality of liberal education without being haunted with the dread of losing support , through a diminution of the number of their students . In view of the crowd of other colleges of recent origin , wavering character , and weak apVOL . LV. - NO. 117. 43 // pointments , their course is even now a plain one . Instead of entering into a petty rivalship to obtain more pupils by rendering the course of studies more limited , practical , and popular , lessening the requisitions for admission , and diminishing the expenses of residence , they ought to adopt measures in which the lesser institutions can not pretend to compete with them , - to aim at raising the standard of scholarship to the highest point , adopting tl ) e most comJ ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction exact , thorough , and profound . Make the difference between the two schemes of education as wide as possible . Let the standard for admission at one college be as high as that of graduation at another . The community will be apt to perceive the difference thus created , and the advantages of either plan , and the two classes of institutions will soon find their appropriate level . Those who have the means and the inclination to give their children a " liberal education , " properly so called , will send them to an establishment , that will merit the name of university . Those who prefer a cheap education , because they have not time or money for a better one , who are contented with a short course of practical studies , will attain their object at the smaller seminaries , which will gradually assume the office and the title of hiab schools or preparatory academies . No doubt there are more pupils to be found of the latter class , than of the former , just as there are more children in common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instituted for their benefit , since they can obtain all they require at institutions of a lower rank . If there is no reason , even in this practical and money-saving community , for changing the studies of all academies into those of common schools , there is quite as little cause for reducing the character of a college education to the high school or academy standard . Yet such has been the tendency of late years in this country . From the great number of institutions , which are empowered to grant degrees , and which are dependent for support on the fees received for tuition , they have sought to rob the high schools of their pupils by reducing the requisitions for admission , the expenses of residence , and the scheme of studies , to the measure of the inferior seminaries . The competition between the colleges has led in some instances to a great diminution of the severer studies , and a substittition for them of those which are more light , practical , // and agreeable . That this change , to a certain degree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it is carried to an inordinate and mischievous excess . Having argued at some length in a recent number of this Journal * in favor of retaining the Classics and the Mathematics as a chief object of attention in the college course , we shall not renew the discussion now , except by commenting on the number and variety of the studies , which are now taking the place of those solid branches of learning . The present question is , not whether a knowledge of Latin , Greek , Geometry , and Algebra , is or is not preferable to an acquaintance with any of the sciences that are now substituted for them , but whether that education can be called liberal , exact , and profound , in which thorough instruction in the old substantial elements of a college course is altogether , or in part , sacrificed for the sake of hurried and superficial study of a dozen or twenty different branches of learning , to he completed within the space of four years . Dr. Wayland tells us , that , when in conversation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of studies l ) ursued in American colleges , lie received the uniform reply , " The thing is impossible . You can not do that work in that time . " We copy from Dr. Wayland 's hook the enumeration of studies , which elicited this remark . " In order to illustrate the nature and amount of the studies pursued in a New England college , I here abridge from one of the catalogues published within the present year , 1841 -2 , the statutory course prescribed for a candidate for the degree of A. B. In Latin , select portions of Livy , Tacitus , Horace , Cicero de Oratore , Juvenal ; - In Greek , select portions of Xeno. phon 's Anabasis , Memorabilia , the Iliad , some of the tragedies of Sophocles and iEschylus , with Demosthenes ' Oration for the Crown ; - In Mathematics , Geometry , plane and solid , Algebra , Trigonometry , plane and spherical , and its applications to Practical Mathematics , and Analytical Geometry ; - In Natural Philosophy , Mechanics , Pneumatics , Hydrostatics , Optics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chemistry , Vegetable and Animal Physiology , and Geology ; - In Intellectual and Moral Science , Rhetoric , theoretical and practical , Logic , Intellectual and Moral Philosophy , Political Economy , Butler 's Analogy , and the American Constitution . Many of these studies , besides being pursued by means of a text.book , are illustrated by full courses of lectures and ample experiments . " - p. 35. * See North . /lmerican Review , Vol . L1V. pp. 35 et seq . // In Harvard College , in addition to the branches here enumerated , we may mention Electricity , Magnetism , and Acoustics , Ancient and Modern History , the Differential and Integral Calculus , Mineralogy , Anatomy , the Application of the Sciences to the Arts , and the Hebrew , French , Spanish , Italian , Portuguese , and German languages . Some of these subjects , however , are pursued only by lectures , and the study of some others is not obligatory , but the student may select those which are to his taste , and obtain time for them by abandoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the question is not , whether a knowledge of any one or all of these branches is not essential to a perfect education , but whether it is advisable to include all of them in an undergraduate course to be completed within four years . It should be remembered also , that the students are from twelve to twenty-two years of age , far the larger portion of them being under eighteen . It matters little , that these studies are not all obligatory , that the pupil has the option of pursuing a portion of them at the expense of the rest . The greater portion is absolutely required , and we conceive that the student himself is very incompetent to decide which of the others will do him the most good . The effect of the whole system on the intellectual well-being of the youth will be , it seems to us , what the effect on his bodily health would be , if he were taken away from a plain dinner of beef and pudding , and turned loose into a confectioner*s shop , to gratify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cakes , and sweetrneats . We like the beef and pudding fare best , - the Classics and the Mathematics as the substantial part of the dinner ; and , if need be , the course may be garnished with a few vegetables ,  --  with some of the physical sciences , and one or two modern languages . The result of cramming a boy in so short a space of time with all the abovementioned studies , or with only his own selection from them , can be nothing but a mental dyspepsia . Even if it were possible , within so brief a period , to become thoroughly acquainted with all these branches of learning , we should still say , that the system was radically vicious and unsound . It is not the sole object of college instruction to carry the pupil over the most ground , but to give him the power of travelling by himself . The true end of his undergraduate labors is not so much to acquire one or more languages // and sciences , as to learn the method and the habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much to put something into his mind , as to be able to draw something out of it . It is to strengthen his judgment , to sharpen his perceptions , to form his taste , to develope all his faculties , to fit himself " for all the offices , both public and private , of peace and war . " This end can not be obtained , while the memory is hurdened , and the attention distracted , hy ten or a dozen different objects of study . The pupil is hurried in rapid succession from one exercise to another of a totally different character , the effect of each being little more than to neutralize or dissipate the result of the one immediately preceding . He attends in the morning , perhaps , a recitation in physical science , and soon afterwards restores the tone of his mind by a copious dose of metaphysics . During the next hour , he recites a portion of a Greek tragedy , and then hurries away to a lecture on the useful arts . These exercises have occupied nearly all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to the Italian or German instructor . The remainder of the day and the evening he can devote to preparing himself for a series of quite as heterogeneous performances for the morrow . Any one can judge what habits , what mental discipline , what power of deep and continuous thought , he will derive from such employment of his time . Even if he acquired a kind of mechanical knowledge of the subjects studied , the labors of his college life would he worse than nugatory in their results . He might become a learned man , but never an able one . But even this lower purpose is not answered . It is perfectly evident , that , under such training , the pupil will only acquire a smattering of the different sciences ,  --  a feeble insight into them , which he will find it difficult to preserve , and impossible to use . The remembrance of one subject is banished by the study of another , and only confused and misty ideas are retained of both . The old system of including nothing but the learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , in the round of college studies , was certainly unwise and defective . But , in its general effects upon the student 's mind , we believe it to be far preferable to the preposterous variety and complication of mental exercises , which are in vogue at the present day . So far as the question can be decided by experience , a compari // son of the intellectual stature of the scholars of those days , with that of their successors in our own times , fully sustains this opinion . On this point , we again fortify ourselves with the authority of Dr. Wayland . " The question here forces itself upon us , are our colleges at the present day , better or worse instruments for effecting mental cultivation , than they were before the Revolution ? The circumstances of the community are so changed , that probably it would he difficult to form a correct opinion upon the subject . Yet if we suppose that the object of such institutions is to cultivate and develope to the highest perfection the best minds of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which this resuit has been attained , and compare this portion of the public mind before and during the Revolution with the same portion now , no one can contemplate the earlier literary institutions of this country without the most profound respect . Compare the pulpit for fifty years before the Revolution , as it appears in the press , with the pulpit fifty years after that event . Look at the bar in all the colonies , read the speeches and discussions , to which the revolutionary struggle gave occasion ; observe the ripe learning , the acuteness , the sagacity , the knowledge of law , of the philosophy of human rights , which is manifest on every page , and compare these with the discussions on many similar topics as they are found in the various conventions for constitution-making , with which our age abounds , and I must say that our fathers , if they blush , must blush for their descendants . Chatham declared , that nothing in Thucydides was to be compared to our revolutionary papers . There were giants in those days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nestor , who always referred to the period , three generations ago , when he was the friend and coadjutor of heroes and demigods . If these men are a true exponent of the character of the instruction given at our older colleges in the first period of their existence , these institutions have surely no reason to be ashamed of their alumni . " - pp. 79 , 80 . To remedy the evil , on which we have commented above , Dr. Wayland recommends that the college course should be extended , so as to include five or six years , or rather that an amount of knowledge , which a student of fair capacity might obtain within this period , should be required for a degree . He advises , that the requirements for a degree should be high , but that they should relate rather to the actual amount of knowledge and mental discipline , than to the number of // things to be individually learned . The old theory of a cob lege education required the pupil to spend seven years within the walls , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be required for an apprenticeship , if he were destined to one of the mechanical trades . This is the term fixed , even now , for proceeding to the second degree , though during the last three years the student is allowed to quit the college , and to choose and n*anage his own pursuits . But if general and liberal culture of mind he an object as important and as difficult to he obtained as the art of a silver-smith or a joiner , we see not why the same period of service should not he required for each . Let those , who are to go forth to the commnunity with the certificate of having completed a thorough course of education , spend the time required in order to merit the diploma . Those who are pressed for time may leave the college sooner , and be contented with inferior testimonials . But let the diploma of full standing become what it now falsely purports to be , - the proof that the person , whose name it bears , has received all the instruction , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and under the most favorable auspices . The change would not require the addition of a single study to the present course , or of one instructor to the present Faculty . Those who can remain in the institution hut four years , should he required to limit their attention to those substantial branches of learning , which they can thoroughly master during that period , and which form the best general preparation for the duties of a scholar or a professional man . Those who could stay out the whole period , would acquire something more than a pretended knowledge of the rich scheme of studies , in which the college now professes to give instruction . Dr. Wayland justly observes , that , under the present system , the endowment of new professorships in a college , beyond a limited number , is at least but " an ambiguous benefit . " All that a class of young men can learn thoroughly within four years , can be thoroughly taught by a few instructors . To add new members to the faculty of instruction is only to increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the capacity of the learners , to dimninish the accuracy with which the other branches are tauTht in order to add one more profitless study to the list . In the University of Edinburgh , where there are more than // two thousand students , there are but seven instructors , whose exercises the candidates for the first degree are obliged to attend , and five or six other professors , who give instruction to those who choose to receive it , and are paid only in proportion to the number of their volunteer pupils . In University College , London , recently established under the patronage of the most liberal and enlightened men in England , and which , we may therefore suppose , is not fettered by ancient customs and prejudices , but partakes of all the improvements of the age , about the same number of branches is taught by as small a body of teachers . On the other hand , Harvard College , with less than two hundred and fifty undergraduates , has fifteen instructors , attendance on each of whom is obligatory , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who wish to learn . Yale College has more students , and nearly as many instructors . It is quite evident , therefore , that there is no call for new professorships in these institutions . On the contrary , if the funds were not tied up by the will of the founders , it would he well to abolish several chairs , and to devote the money thus saved to the more pressing wants of the college . When the consent of the donor 's heirs at law can be obtained , we see not why , by the joint action of the college and the legislature , this change might not still be accomplished , due regard being had to the wishes and the fame of the founder , by devoting the money to purposes parallel with those contemplated in the original deed of gift , and connecting his name with the work that is achieved by his bounty . The object of a person in establishing a professorship is probably to promote the study of a particular science , and if this object can he better attained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called by the name of the founder , than by the instructions of a teacher , it may fairly be presumed that , if now living , he would consent to the alteration especially as it must be supposed , that the general welfare of the college was one of the ends contemplated in tuaking the gift . These remarks lead to the consideration of what we regard as the most pressing want in all our colleges - the establishment of scholarships , similar in character to those which exist at Oxford and Cambridge , and to the bursaries in the Scotch universities . Appeals to the public are made from time // to time for contributions to support indigent youth in their studies ; and they are seldom wholly unanswered , though it is to be feared , that the money is sometimes ill applied . Dr. XX*ayland justly observes , that , if a liberal education is worth any thing , it is worth paying for ; though , in fact , even to students who are not avowed beneficiaries , it is furnished at a price much below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should cdiicate , gratuitously , persons of no marked abilities , to fit them for entering professions , which are already too much crowded . It is quite notorious , that very many youths are supported by beneficiary funds at our colleges , whose talents give no promise that they will become useful and distinguished members of society . The charity is too indiscriminate . Mediocrity and indolence are maintained , as well as struggling talent and earnest endeavour . The truth is , the public are asked to contribute to the beneficiary funds , which are lavishly bestowed only to swell the fame and the income of the institution by increasing the number of students . Instruction is offered by so many rival establishments , that it can not be sold ; it must be given away . Instances are mentioned , wherein , one child out of a family appearing not remarkably well fitted for any thing , the parents , at a loss what else to do , have resolved to make a scholar of him , the great inducement to this course being , that his support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense is assumed by a generous public . It is difficult to see what return the public has for its money . There is surely no need of supporting two of the professions in this way , for they are overstocked already ; and it may well be doubted , whether this course is the most.judicious way of supplying the pulpit . As for the interests of general scholarship , and the standard of education in our colleges , it is evident , that the results of these measures are positively injurious . We would have careful discrimination exercised in applying the public bounty . It ought to relieve indigent talent to educate those , whose educated abilities would afterwards repay society a hundred fold for its munificence . Feebleness , and indolence , and waywardness should not be permitted to waste its stores , - to fatten on undeserved charity . It ought , moreover , to exercise a powerful influence in elevating the standard of learning , in awakening emulation , in fostering the true spirit of scholarship , in raising the character of our colVOL . LV. - NO. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the learned hives , but the working bees should have plenty of flowers . We would have all the beneficiary funds united for the support of scholarships , admission to which should be by open trial and examination , and the income of each should be enough , not merely to defray the most necessary expenses of the student , but to support him with ease and comfort . The office should be one of honor and emolument , - at once the fit reward of past exertion , and the stimulus to future effort . However early obtained , it might be held even to the end of the seven years ' course , which we still hope will be made the common term of residence at the University ; but , at the end of every year , the incumbent ought to renew his title by inviting all competitors into the ring , and proving to the satisfaction of the examiners , that his own claims are still superior to all others . The hope of wresting from others the honors and the profits of such offices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupil in the institution . The stimulus might be made to act upon the whole college , even on those whose circumstances did not require the pecuniary aid , by conferring the title and the honor of the scholarship on the individual most distinguished in the examination , while the emoluments might pass to the next highest competitor , who was really in need of them . The benefit of his exertions and success should be insured to him for as long a period as possible , by inserting in the annual and triennial catalogues the names of all present and past incumbents of the scholarships , and the period during which they maintained themselves in office . In this way , the distinction would soon be drawn between the poor students whom it was worth while to support at the college , and those whose inferior talents and industry ought rather to be directed to other pursuits . The former would be sure of soon obtaining an easy and honorable maintenance , for the first trial might take place at the end of one year 's residence , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw from the institution . Dr. Wayland remarks in strong language on the want of stimulants to exertion in our colleges , a want which we see no means of supplying , except by the method just proposed . The rich endowments of the English universities enable them to hold up numerous scholarships , fellowships , and sitnations // in the church , as the fit and even magnificent prizes , that await distinguished scholars ; and , defective in other respects as the system of these establishments is , the good actually accomplished hy them must he attributed almost entirely to these noble rewards of industry and talent . In France and Germany , numerous and honorable offices in the seminaries themselves and under government are the almost sure recompense of distinguished pupils . In the United States , we have nothing of the kind . A scale of rank , it is true , is kept in the interior of the college ; hut it becomes known beyond the walls only on Commencement day , when the high standing of a pupil at the completion of his course is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though it is productive of no solid or permanent results . Even the first honors of a class are perceived to he a flattering , rather than profitable distinction , and destined to be soon forgotten No wonder that many students of considerable ability decline to engage in such a fruitless race , and even refuse the honors when offered to them . But let a sufficient number of scholarships be endowed , and the spur would be felt hy every member of the institution . The cost of founding one would not be more than one fifth of the expense of establishing a professorship , and the name of the donor would he for ever connected with the most efficient means of promoting the welfare of the seminary , and advancing the interests of letters . To preserve the importance and respectability of the scholarships , they should be rather few in number , than small in profit ; hut the beneficial effects of their establishment would not be perceived to the full extent , till they were numerous enough to exert an influence through the whole body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular science , might confine the benefit of their funds to pupils distinguished only in their favorite study ; but the best interests of letters and education require , that the hulk of the prizes should be given for general scholarship . If this scheme could be carried into effect , we believe that a new spirit would be awakened among the students , and a new chapter commenced in the history of American colleges . The operose machinery of exhibitions and commencements , affording very insufficient proof of industry and learning , might be done away , and rigid examina // tions , closed by the formal award of the merited scholarships , be the only public , as they are the proper tests of the efficiency of the institution . Our remarks are already extended to such a length , that no space is left for the discussion of an important branch of the subject , - the discipline or internal regulations of our colleges . That the system calls loudly for reformation in this respect is manifest from some facts , that have lately appeared in the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole community . That one professor should be shot dead on his own doorstep , and another nearly blinded by nitric acid thrown into his face , and a room in a valuable public building be shattered at midnight by the explosion of a bomb , are events calculated to deter every judicious parent from sending his son to a seminary , where such fearful crimes are perpetrated , and followed by no punishment . It is high time , that the young men in these seminaries should be taught by striking examples , that college punishments are prepared only for ordinary college offences , for indolence , waywardness , and insubordination ; while there are courts of justice , and prisons , and even the gallows for crimes , that affect property and life . No consideration for youth , or respectable connexions , or momentary excitement , ought in such instances to screen the guilty from the vengeance of the outraged laws . The principle to be adopted is a perfectly obvious one ,  --  that every offence committed within the college walls , which is cognizable by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to the civil tribunal . The faculty of instruction have nothing to do with it , except to use their best efforts to aid the officers of justice in ferreting out the criminal . The public expect , and we are confident they will not expect in vain , that no fear for the good name of the institution shall prompt them to avoid giving publicity to the crime , or to wink at the perpetration of it by affixing only a nominal penalty , or not to use any clue for detection which may be in their hands . On the subject of discipline , as well as on most of the other points discussed in this article , we must refer our readers to Dr. Wayland 's book , with the assurance that , although they may not coincide with him in all his views , they can not but admire the candor and spirit with which they tire presented . We have deemed it a duty to speak with // equal freedom , believing that the time has come , when important reforms must be effected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of sound learning and to command the respect of the public . The remarks are general , applying not to one college , except by way of example , but to all , for essentially the same system of administration and instruction exists in all . The faults noticed belong to the system , and not to individuals , for , in most instances within our knowledge , the gentlemen having charge of these institutions , so far as they are able or are expected to act on the established plan , do honor to their trust . We believe they will be glad to have the public attention turned to the difficulties of their situation , and public discussion excited on the measures and changes , which many of them are desirous to effect . From their own connexion with the seminary , they can not speak out in all cases without suspicion of bias from fear , interest , or favor ; and this consideration ought to induce those , whose position is more independent , to write with the greater freedom . There is little need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nervous language of President Quincy ,  --  " is to yield nothing to any temporary excitement , nothing to the desire of popularity , nothing to the mere hope of increasing the numbers in a seminary , nothing to any vain imagination of possessing more wisdom than the Author of the human mind , as if we could exclude the influence of those motives and passions , which he implanted as aids and stimulants to man 's progress , and which it is the design of education to regulate , but not to extirpate .
