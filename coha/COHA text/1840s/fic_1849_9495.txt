" T is not vain or fabulous ,  --  Though so esteem 'd by shallow ignorance ,  --  What the sage Poets , taught by th ' heavenly Muse , Storied of old in high immortal verse , Of dire chimeras and enchanted isles , And rifted rocks . "  --  Milton . The first edition of " Atalantis " was published in 1832 . It has been subsequently revised , and , I trust , amended . I am not satisfied that the dramatic form was appropriately adopted , since it leads to expectations which the character of the poem will scarcely satisfy . The advantage of the dialogue consists simply in permitting that diversification of the descriptive portions , which , in a work so purely fanciful , would seem necessary to prevent monotony.  --  This poem , with those pieces which follow it , belongs to a class , the standards of which are almost entirely imaginative . The reader who looks here for the merely human sentiment , will find himself at fault . The province of poetry is too various for the application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who opens the pages of an author must always be prepared to ascend that mount of vision from which he has made his survey . The highest regions of the ideal , are unquestionably such as belong to the spiritual nature . To this nature , exclusively , verse which is solely imaginative must commend itself . It is not the less human , though it may be more remote and foreign , than that which simply appeals to mortal passions , and the more earthly purposes of man and life . PERSONS OF THE POEM .

Labor as thou mayst  --  Speak , like thy shell , in music  --  let thy words Be like the honey dews , that , on the rocks , Nursed in the hollows , nightly fall from heaven , A solace for the storm-bird and the gull ,  --  Yet art thou fatal to the spells thou hast , And bafflest thine own art .

I heed thee not  --  thy anger scorn , not fear ;  --  Thou art of those , being the foe to truth , That are , when friendliest , most inimical ,  --  And dost most harm in doing seeming good , And art most hateful , most injurious , When most professing love ! I fear thee not ,  --  Though by an active cunning  --  and yet less , By active cunning than mine own neglect ,  --  Gaining the advance upon us , thou hast made A prisoner and dire enemy of one , Who , in another chance , and other time , Had never made so little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Onesi .

In myself The means of freedom rest . Onesi . Onesi . Ha ! in herself ! I snatch 'd from her the powerful wand which made The elements do her bidding . What remains ? Atal . Atal .

This will resist them ! Into this , who comes , Not fitted like ourselves to meet its power , Blinded and shorn of strength , falls feebly down , And straight is thrall 'd forever . All around Our island limit , where the ocean breaks , This element is scattered ;  --  like a wall , Shutting out all invasion ,  --  closing all , Within , from commerce with the realm without !

So hadst thou shrunk away , scared by the blaze , Cowering , with backward terror , till the sun , Thy nature 's dread , thy great antipathy , Leaping from off his billowy bed at morn , No cloud about his brow , and strong from sleep , Drives thee , with glittering shafts that never fail , Blinded and bellowing to thy marshy gulfs .

Thou mayst o'ercome The sluggish monster , that , upon the deep , Slumbers at noonday ,  --  winning , with his life The useless glitter of his cumbrous shell ;  --  But , for becoming enemy , thou hast But little armament of serious force , Save , as I said , in fraud and stratagem .

There shalt thou see Rocks , in their own gifts marvellous , at stroke Of wondrous masters , spring to palaces ; And , at a word , as thou hast cause to know , Fair islands , flush with flowers , and rich in airs Of most persuasive odor , break the deeps , And gather in the sunlight .

The simple mariner who needs the barque , Which , in their reckless mood , the waves may wreck , And wanton winds destroy , affords , methinks , But little trophy , with his bleaching bones , On desert sands , and isles beyond thy gulf , To him who conquers thus , even by a will , Without the joy of conflict .

Thy sweetest song , my Nea.  --  Such as he sings , the spirit of the shell , That brooding in his billows never sleeps , For longing of his home , and still who hears Its voices , breathing ever sighs of love , In echo to his own , by ocean 's marge , Telling of purple islets in the deep , Where first he won his wings and whence his voice .

Not a stronger spirit rideth O'er the rolling waves than I ; Not a lovelier shape abideth ' Neath the tropic sky . Atal . Atal . Sweet is the air thou sing'st ! Ah ! would ' t were true !

Thou canst meetly sing Of bearded-white Ogrear , the giant king , Who , with the music of his magic horn , Subdued , and to his pastures midst the rocks , Guided the monster first , which , in itself , Is a huge mountain , rolling on the deeps , Unconscious of his load , though on his back , Rode the old wizard 's tribe  --  his giant sons And daughters , an unnumbered family , That sung in concert to the old man 's horn , Until the monster , drowsing in his path , Yielded himself , as fast fix 'd as an isle , Through the long summer 's day .

There is one strain Methinks might glad thine ear , of Coraline  --  One of those gentle damsels of the groves , Whom sometimes we see sporting on the isles , Amidst the flowers , when first upon the sky The moon 's bright sickle glows .

When the stars peer out in the blue deeps of even , When the crowd is at rest , and the moon soars apace , Silent and sad , through the watches of heaven , Be thou , beloved , at the love-hallow 'd place : Come in thy beauty and lightness , Bright-eyed and free-footed , oh ! dearest one , come , Filling the dark wood with brightness And crowning the green hill with bloom ;  --  Such bloom  --  the heart-chosen for thousand sweet groves , As is dear to the wood-nymphs and born of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewitchingly tender , Fly to my bosom , beloved of my heart ; Thy lip bearing sweetness , thine eye giving splendor , Thy smile shedding rapture wherever thou art ; And while the pale moonlight is round and above thee , While the leaves twinkle soft in the breeze o'er thyilleg .

Thy song delights me not  --  nay , not thy song That fails , the softness of thy linked words , Or melody of thy music ;  --  in my heart , Lies the defect of sweetness  --  which comes not To take the shadow from our prison-house .

We 've some range , Sweet mistress ! and I prithee wend with me , As near we may , the borders of the sea , Looking towards our province . Better airs Methinks , will come to cheer us into smiles , From waters that we loved ; and newer hopes , As we look out upon the waste beyond , Will freshen us with strength .

It is a gallant vessel , and it bends , To the new islet of Onesimarch ;  --  That bigot and most brutal arbiter Of eighty leagues of ocean . He hath rear 'd , In the past day , these undetected rocks , Whose subtle currents , by his strategy , Will suck the unconscious vessel to the snare ; Baffling the untutor 'd mariner , whose skill Might vainly hope escape , within the jaws Of this dread artifice .

And , to my wish Of swift concealment from his eager sight , A sudden cloud is spreading o'er yon heap Of crested waters . There will I imbed My many folds of form , while , with my voice , I frame a music for this mariner , Not to beguile him with fresh fantasies , But wake him to the peril in his path .

II . Thou hast dream 'd in thy boyhood of sea-circled bowers , Where all may be found that is joyous and bright ,  --  Where life is a frolic through fancies and flowers , And the soul lives in dreams of a lasting delight !

Now , as I live , I heard it Steal by me , as the murmurs of a lute From thy own lattice , Isabel . Isabel . Isabel . What heard'st ?  --  What is it that thou speak'st of ? Leon . Leon . A strain of song ,  --  That crept along the waters from afar , Softly at first , but growing as it came To an embodied strength of harmony , That spoke to all my joys .

Oh ! thou shouldst hear , To sadden with its sweetness . Isabel . Isabel . Thou hast dream 'd ! Whence should such music come ? Leon . Leon . Ay ! whence indeed , But from some green-hair 'd maiden of the deep , As still our legends tell us such there be , That , sitting on the edge of lonely rocks , Midway in ocean , loose their flowing locks , And , with strange songs , discoursing to the waves , Subdue their crests to service .

And their wild and mellow voices , Still to hear along the deep , Every brooding star rejoices , While the billow , on its pillow Lull 'd to silence , sinks to sleep . III . Yet they wake a song of sorrow , Those sweet voices of the night ; Still from grief a gift they borrow , And hearts shiver , as they quiver With a wild and sad delight . IV . ' T is the wail for life they waken By Samana 's lonely shore ; With the tempest it is shaken , The wide ocean is in motion , And the song is heard no more . V. But the gallant bark comes sailing , At her prow the chieftain stands ; He hath heard the tender wailing  --  It delights him  --  it invites him To the joys of other lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And , oh ! see , a picture lies In the yielding waves before him ,  --  Woman smiling , still beguiling From the depts of wondrous eyes .

Unhappy Nicuesa ! Isabel . Isabel . Such his song , And , with the ocean murmur in thy ears , Thy fancy , in thy dream , hath made it thine . Leon . Leon .

Leon . Leon . ' T was no dream ! It comes again ! Now hark thee , Isabel  --  It is no murmur of the deep thou hear'st !

Thou art too prone To these wild speculations . Leon . Leon . Hear it now ! My fancy trick 'd me not ,  --  my sense was true ,  --  It comes again , far off , and very fine , As the first birth ' twixt silence and his dame , The mother of the voice . Now , Isabel ,  --  Thine ears are traitors if they do not feel That music as it sweeps by us but now . Isabel . Isabel . I hear a murmur truly , but so slight  --  A breath of the wind might make it , or a sail Drawn suddenly . Leon . Leon . Art silenced ? It is there ! ZEPHYR-SPIRIT . ZEPHYR-SPIRIT .

Leon . Didst hear it , Isabel ? Isabel . Isabel . It spoke , methought , Of peril from the rocks that near us grow . Leon . Leon . It did , but idly ! Here can lurk no rocks For , by the chart which now before us lies , Thy own unpractised eye may well discern The wide extent of the ocean  --  shoreless all ; The land , for many a league , to th ' westward hangs , And not a point beside it . Isabel . Isabel . Wherefore then , Should come this voice of warning ? Leon . Leon . From the deep : It hath its demons as the earth and air , All tributaries to the master-fiend That sets their springs in motion . This is one , That , doubting to mislead us , plants this wile , So to divert our course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warn us from . Isabel . Isabel . A subtle sprite  --  and , now I think of it , Dost thou remember the old story told By Diaz Ortis , the lame mariner , Of an adventure in the Indian seas , Where he made one with John of Portugal ,  --  Touching a woman of the ocean wave That swam beside the barque and sang strange songs Of riches in the waters ;  --  with a speech So winning on the senses , that the crew Grew all infected with the melody , And , but for a good father of the church Who made the sign of the cross and offer 'd up Befitting prayer , which drove the fiend away , They had been tempted by her cunning voice To leap into the ocean . Leon . Leon . I do , I do ! And , at the time , I do remember me , I made much mirth of the extravagant tale , As a deceit of the reason ;  --  the old man Being in his second childhood , and at fits , As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabel . Isabel . I never more shall mock at marvellous things ; Such strange conceits hath after time found true , That once were themes for jest . I shall not smile At the most monstrous legend . Leon . Leon . Nor will I !  --  To any tale of foreign wonderment , I shall bestow mine ear nor wonder more ; And every image that my childhood bred , In vagrant dreams of fancy , I shall look , To find , without rebuke , my sense approve . Thus , like a little island of the deep , Girdled by perilous seas , and all unknown To prows of venture , may be yon same cloud Specking , with fleecy bosom , the blue sky , Lit by the rising moon . There , we may dream , And find no censure in an after day , Throng the assembled fairies , perch 'd on beams , And riding on their way triumphantly . There gather the coy spirits . Many a fay , Roving the silver sands of that same isle , Floating in azure ether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  While myriads like herself , do watch the chase  --  Some truant sylph , through the infinitude Of their uncircumscribed and rich domain . There sport they through the night , with mimicry Of strife and battle ,  --  striking their tiny shields And gathering into combat ; meeting fierce , With lip compress 'd , and spear aloft , and eye Glaring with desperate purpose in the fight ;  --  Then sudden  --  in a moment all their wrath Mellow 'd to friendly terms of courtesy  --  Throwing aside the dread array and link 'd , Each , in his foe 's embrace . Then comes the dance , The grateful route , the wild and musical pomp , The long procession o'er fantastic realms Of cloud and moonbeam , through th ' enamor 'd night , Making it all one revel . Thus , the eye Breathed on by fancy , with enlargd scope , Through the protracted and deep hush of night , May note the fairies , coursing the lazy hours , In various changes , and without fatigue . A fickle race , who tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have stars for lamps , And night-dews for ambrosia ; perch 'd on beams , Speeding through space , even with the scattering light On which they feed and frolic . Isabel . Isabel . A wild dream !  --  And yet , since this old tale of Diaz Ortis , That moved our laughter once , is thus made sooth , Perchance , not all a dream . Leon . Leon . Yet , may we doubt !  --  There may be something in this marvel still Of human practice . Man hath wondrous powers , Most like a God ;  --  that , with each hour of toil , Perfect themselves in actions strangely great . Some cunning seaman , having natural skill , As by the books we learn hath oft been done , Hath ' yond our vessel 's figure pitch 'd his voice ,  --  With gay deceit of unsuspected art , Leading us wantonly . Isabel . Isabel . It is not so ;  --  Or , does my sense deceive ? Look , where the wave A perch beyond our vessel , grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ? Leon . Leon . A marvellous shape that with the billow curls , In gambols of the deep , and yet is not Its wonted burden ; for , beneath the waves , I mark the elaborate windings of a form , That heaves and flashes with an antic play , As if to win our gaze . Isabel . Isabel . Again  --  it sings . ZEPHYR-SPIRIT ZEPHYR-SPIRIT I. By the planet at whose bid , I must close the heavy lid , Ere the hour that wings my flight I unfold me to your sight , That your wondering thoughts may find , Wherewith to awake the mind ;  --  To arouse ye with a fear , Do I sing and wanton here ; Sing with sorrow lest too late , Ye awaken to your fate : Hearken to my voice and fly , For the danger lurketh nigh . II . Deem me not a form of ill , Free to lure and injure still ;  --  Mine 's the gentler task to save From the perils of the wave . When thou feel'st the tempest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the ocean 's calm as death , From me comes the tradewind 's breath :  --  For my essence is not made Of the cold and gloomy shade , But of gentlest dews of night , And of purest rays of light . III . Heed me then , and turn thy prow From the rocks that wait thee now ;  --  Close beneath thee , do they sleep In the hollows of the deep ; And thy sail is truly prone Where the yellow sand is strown ; And no human power can save From the terrors of the wave , Smooth , and gently gliding , now , With a whisper , round thy prow ; In an hour and all is o'er  --  Thou wilt hear my voice no more . Leon . Leon . ' T is passing strange , and it were well to rouse The master to this marvel . What , ho ! there ! Hark ye , good Mendez Celer , lend awhile Your presence here on deck .

Leon . Leon . It may be ,  --  Yet there 's a marvel here to challenge well Thy old experience in these wizard seas . Here swam a voice that spoke to us in song Of most prevailing sweetness . There it rose  --  Even from yon heap of waters , which thou see'st Still stirring with an action not their own , Unlike the rest of the ocean . Thou mayst note Where the sea rises and the billows toss , Still swelling in strange folds .

No , in no wise !  --  the tones it used were soft , And the words gentle , and the music sweet , But yet it spoke no love and ask 'd for none .  --  It rather told of danger to our barque ;  --  Of rocks in certain and near neighborhood , And shoals and sands , that , close beneath our prow , Are lurking to ensnare . Men . Men . Bah ! good Don Leon ! ' T is , as we say in Palos , a poor devil That goes without his brimstone .  --  A dull cheat Who when he shows his hook forgets the bait .

Leon . Leon . It is strange That we should hear this music ! Men . Men . Not a whit . I 've oftentimes heard from the Portuguese  --  I 'm rather one myself , belike you know , My father having stray 'd , at a wrong time , From Lisbon to my mother 's house at Palos , And then it came about that I was born  --  ( Nothing ill-graced to Lady Isabel ; ) And , as I say , it is a standing tale With the old seamen , that a woman comes  --  Her lower parts being fishlike  --  in the wave ; Singing strange songs of love , that so inflame The blinded seamen , that they steal away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , Having her victim , she is seen no more .

Leon . Leon . And you then Think nothing of this warning ? Men . Men . By your grace , Surely , I hold it the wild lustful song Of this same woman .

Delay not now for me  --  bear off , bear off ,  --  I go in no new craft  --  my log 's complete . This is my ninetieth voyage , and the last , Though not the longest or most fortunate . I can not leave the ship  --  it is our creed  --  Till she leaves me . We 've sail 'd together long  --  And if I ' scaped the present , would not much Survive her reckoning . Bid me well at home , And say the manner of my death to all . Tell old Bertiaz , should you ever make The shore I never more shall touch again , ( He owns the vessel ) , that the " Arragon " ( Too fine a name for such a fate as this ) , Is Arragon no longer .

Fiercely , all at once , Mark you , Don Leon , how the waters leap , And the seas whiten . Here are ugly rocks . Leon . Leon . The billows rush on madly , as they were Some battling armies . These are cruel waves , That , fastening on our sides , still clamber high , More like the forms of demons , dark and dread , With fiend malignity and bent on wrath , Than billows of the ocean . We shall scarce  --  Unless good fortune and the blessed saints Look kindly on us  --  overcome the space , Growing as we o'erleap it , that , between , Now keeps us from yon islet , which I mark , Dim , in the distance , o'er the swell in front .

Give way , like men , And enter the deep darkness unafraid . The boat disappears . SCENE III .  --  The ocean waste . Zephyr-Spirit . Zephyr-Spirit . Now , terribly through the waters comes the form Of that fierce savage and malignant king , Onesimarch . Behind him gathering rush Clouds of his brutal followers , clad in wrath , Howling for prey . Beneath their vexing spells The deep boils like a whirlpool , and the waves , So lately still and placid , wrought to rage , Leap up about the poor ill-fated barque .

Onesimarch , himself , a hungry fiend , With darker powers endow 'd , with sulphur arm 'd , Hurls a perpetual lightning , which distracts And dazzles the weak eye . He shapes their course , And guides the tribute legions ; working new joys From out the wrongs he doth , for his own sense , And for that potentest of all the fiends , By whom his power is wrought . And now , they chant A song of terror in the drowning ears Of the wild seamen , cutting off all hope That manhood may achieve against its fate . SCENE IV .  --  The same . Storm .

Speed ! our mission , fierce and fatal , Is to spoil superior things ; For , at birth , our planets natal Crown 'd with blight our demon wings ! Oh ! the joy to rob the treasures , Hopes of soul and beauty given , From the race whose purer pleasures , Are the special care of Heaven ! Joy , that thus , still doom 'd to sorrow , We may happier fortunes blight , And from woe extremest borrow , Still the power that yields delight . To the terror , fiercely wending , Speed we , till our work is done , Still destroying , raging , rending , Till the shadow chokes the sun ! II .

From our homes of power and pleasaunce , Drove us forth in grief and shame ! Him we dare not face with battle , Now , as then , with fearless powers , But his race of God-mark 'd cattle , Yields the proper spoil for ours . In his likeness made , they languish , For the wings he hath not given ; And , in trampling on their anguish , Wage we still our war with Heaven ! III . Why , oh ! why , Breathing the sky Orisons still should they offer on high ; Why should they pray , Creatures of clay , Whose faith is a fable , whose life is a day ! Mock the mortals with your voices , Shouting death and hate and hell ; Fill their ears with horrid noises , Ring for every soul the knell ! Tell them , while the ocean smothers Life and hope , that , never more , Shall the loved ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ! Show them Death in grimmest aspect , Cold , corruption , worms , and night ; And depict the penal prospect Of the future world of blight , Endless , for the guilt-unshriven , Fetter 'd fast by tyrant powers , With no hope to be forgiven , And a doom more dread than ours !

Lo ! where in sight , Fierce as in fight , Rising from ocean , our monarch of might ; With the storm for his steed , He is here at our need , The dreadful in strife , and the matchless in speed . Full our legions ,  --  dread battalions , Sweep we now the ocean plain ; Cower the golden Spanish galleons , Cower and sink beneath the main ! Vain the skill and power to stay us , Vain the prayers that hope to spell ; Hate , alone , may soothe or sway us , And the power that conquers hell ! These we dread not in our mission , When the victim wrought of clay , Guilty grown , in his condition , Yields himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which had baffled else our hate ; And the doom of woe and weeping , Makes him subject to our fate ! CHORUS . From the regions south , and the regions north , Mount we , and speed we , and hurry we forth ; From where the sun fails , in the putrid gales , Launch we afloat on our shadowy sails : Darkening the sky , oh ! how we fly , Spirits of tumult and terror on high : The whirlwind we fling abroad on its wing , And the hurricane speeds to its work , as we sing ! Lo ! the skies how they stoop , and the stars how they droop , While the trailing storms follow our flight in a troop ; As downward we sweep , the black billows leap , To welcome our flight , with a roar from the deep ! We are here , we are there ; in the ocean , the air , With a breath that is death , and a song that 's despair ! Ho ! for the master ! The sulphur balls go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Ho ! for the master !

Horrible sounds are rushing through my ears , More like the cries of demons , mad for blood , Than the hoarse billows and the roaring winds . They dart into my brain , and seem to shout , Triumphant , oh , my brother , o'er our fate ;  --  Speak of the sorrow in our father 's halls , That , with an anguish , far too great for speech , Grows dumb and scorns expression . Could we live  --  But live to see him once !  --  oh , bear me up ;  --  Desert me not , dear Leon , but entwine , Closely , thy arm around ; nor let these waves , That seem impatient of their midnight feast , Suck me into their black and ravenous jaws .

' T is done ! The strife is over . Hope is none ! These cruel demons triumph , with a rage That mocks at mortal strength . Prone to the deep , I watch 'd that hungry slave , Calemmia , seize , Conceal 'd in a dense billow , on the prow ; And , all despite the seaman 's sturdy stroke , The helmsman 's firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which did grow , Upon the sight of land , into a hope , Drag her among the sharp rocks , while the surfs Beat her to pieces . She is scatter 'd far  --  A spar floats on the wave  --  a single oar , Cast high among the sands , alone has reach 'd The mocking shores that wreck 'd them . Yet , not so !  --  I mark a floating form that struggles still , With a most human love of life , afar . Him may I succor , and , with safety now ;  --  The legions of Onesimarch , being done Their toil of terror , have , for newer spoils , Wrapt in a gathering cloud , departed hence , Leaving all calm again . Curl 'd in this wave , I will beneath him glide , and bear him up ; Till , on the shore , beyond the ocean 's swell , He rests in safety . I can do no more  --  Since , in gross contact with the heavy earth , I lose the subtle power that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , The buoyant spirit that supplies its wing . ACT III . SCENE I. The islet of Onesimarchus . Atalantis , Nea . Atal . Atal . This islet hath no quality of joy , Fair to the sight , or fragrant to the sense ,  --  No beauty that upon its surface glows , No treasure that within its bosom sleeps ;  --  It is the foul'st deception  --  all is gross , And tainted with that sinborn leprousness That marks the soul who will 'd it into birth , And raised its treacherous rocks along the deep . No innocent beast hath dwelling in this clime , No valley blooms with verdure . Not a flower Gems the bleak sands , that , barrenly spread out , Pain the unsatisfied and wandering eye , That , seeing naught else , grows weary . Not a bird , But , as he flies above , subdues his voice , And , panting in his silence , quickens his wing , Having a nameless terror . The foul taint That poisons all things in this tyrant 's sway , Takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragrance to the breeze , whose whisper 'd plaint Would woo it still to fondness . Not an air Enters these bounds , but flags and settles down Clumsy and wingless ; and the very stars Do seem to leave their places in the heavens , Looking down on it . Even we , who are Of a tenacious temper , yielding naught ,  --  If that our hearts be pure and souls be firm To the capricious influence ,  --  we lose Something of that refined and subtler sense , Which gives us power to meet and match the sway Of his low cunning and detested art . How heavy is this silence ! What a spell Comes with the sullen muttering of the winds , Now sweeping from the waters ; and , how sad Are the faint murmurs of yon moaning sea , In the far distance chiding , as in grief , For some new stroke of sorrow ! All things yield  --  So it would seem  --  a something to the spell , That makes his power , and keeps us captive here ; Wrapping us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lest it undoes us . The shrill scream Of one poor gull , that , o'er the whiten 'd foam , Hung with gray wing suspended , breaks no more Fitfully on the ear ;  --  and all of life Seems resolute to pay its offering now To that dread silence , which , in human sense , Makes up the all of death ! Nea . Nea . Even as thou say'st !  --  ' T is a sad spot , fair mistress ; sad for us , That have been wont , in finer element , To drink the nurture of a better lot . Ah ! how unlike the sweet life of the light , Blessing the fair dominion thou hast lost ;  --  Lost for a season only ,  --  yet too long , Since such a dwelling as we find perforce , Subdues the heart to sorrows not its own , Which still must bide in memory . I feel How dreary is the labor of restraint , This watching , waiting ,  --  when my wonted use , Would have me winging an unlicensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deeps , Disparting their white billows night and morn , With no more pause than to adjust my plumes , Ruffled by zephyrs ; then , with fresh device , Soaring in wilder progress ,  --  sea and sky , Our ample field , and the delighted tribes , Their habitants , come forth to share the chase . Atal . Atal . And lack'st thou now all wonted qualities  --  Thy dance , thy song , whose melodies can make The mad seas sleep when wildest , while the winds Fold up their cloudy vans to hear thy lay ? Hast thou no strain to fit these drowsy hours With wings of light and fragrance , while the thought Grows wanton and forgetful of the grief That burden 'd it with gloom ? Methinks , my girl , ' T were in thy happy spells of verse to find Some carol of our own domain , to take The impatient soul , and in delicious dews Steep the fine sense to sweet forgetfulness . Sing me some ditty from our Mergevan , While every flower , in gardens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young page , Whose name is Memory , faithful to his task , Shall bring anew to joy us in our need . Give me the song the Flower-Spirit once framed , When through our gardens , far beneath the sea , Wall 'd in by wildest waters , we pursued , For the first time , the summer festival . SONG OF THE FLOWER-SPIRIT . I. I am the spirit that sleeps in the flower , Mine is the music of fragrance that flies , When silence and moonlight are dressing each bower That blooms in the favor of tropical skies : I win the bird with new melody glowing , To rise with the zephyr , and warble his strain ; And mine is the odor , in turn , that bestowing , The minstrel is paid for his music again . II . Sorrow comes never where I am abiding , The tempests are strangers , and far from us rove ; I woo the zephyrs too hurriedly riding , And gently they linger and fill us with love . They pause , and we glow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich with odor and song ; Then hurry away to their desolate places , And look for us hourly , and mourn for us long . III . We were born of the dews , and our destiny found us , Embraced by a sunbeam , all budding and bright ; On its wing , came from heaven the glory that crown 'd us , And the odor that makes us a living delight . And when the warm blessings of summer stream on us , Our winglets of silk we unfold to the air ; Leaping upward in joy to the spirit that won us , And made us the tenants of regions so fair . Atal . Atal . The ocean hath no calm like what is here  --  And , if the waters might unfold to us , There hath been fearful strife upon their waves . Here come its tokens . These are broken spars From some tall ship , that lately sped along , As oft-times I have seen them , with a grace And majesty becoming in a queen Ruling a thousand seas . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodly creatures that do dwell in them  --  Shaped like ourselves , though little taught to cope In knowledge with ourselves . Inferior things Of lower grade , who , when we have become The tenants and possessors of a realm Now far beyond our state , shall rise to ours , As we enjoy it now . But what is here , Grasping a shaft , and lifelessly spread out ? Seeing the body of Leon . Nea . Nea . One of the creatures of that goodly barque ,  --  Perchance , the only one of many men , That , from their distant homes , went forth in her , And here have perish 'd . Atal . Atal . There is life in him ;  --  His bosom swells , methinks , beneath my hand ,  --  With fitful pulse  --  most faint  --  now here  --  now gone ! Alas ! I fear it may not come again . How very young he is  --  how beautiful !  --  Made with a matchless sense of what is true In manly grace and mortal elegance ; And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , Nea . Nea . Nea . His eye unfolds . Atal . Atal . Ah ! Stand aside , girl , and let me look on him . I see not that he wakes . Nea . Nea . But now he did . Atal . Atal . Alas ! he sleeps in death ! How pitiful That one so young , and princely in his port , Should fall so soon a victim . He hath been , I doubt not , a great noble with his people . How should it be that such a form as this , So lovely and commanding in its aspect , Should rank below the people of our race ? Methinks he is a creature , that , in life , Might stand compared with any of our chiefs . Nea . Nea . At least , in outward seeming . Atal . Atal . And this speaks ,  --  Where still the brow is lofty , and the form Familiar , in erect and graceful carriage ,  --  For that which guides within . Nea . Nea . He looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming only , Wanting in all that higher sense of soul , Which makes the virtue of true excellence . Atal . Atal . Oh ! I am sure there is no want in him ; The spirit must be true , the sense supreme , The soul as far ascending , strong and bright , As is the form they do inhabit in . Breathe on him , Nea ; fan him with thy wing And rouse him , if thou canst . Oh ! could I bring The life into his cheek . Stay , yet awhile ;  --  Now , while his senses sleep , I 'll place my lip Upon his own  --  it is so beautiful ! Such lips should give forth music  --  such a sweet Should have been got in heaven ,  --  the produce there , Of never-blighted gardens . Kisses him . Leon , Leon , aside . Cling to me  --  Am I not with thee now , my Isabel ! Swoons again . Atal . Atal . Oh , gentle sounds  --  how sweetly did they fall , In broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting long on loving hearts , Had learn 'd to murmur like them . Wake again , Sweet stranger ! If my lips have wrought this spell , And won thee back to life , though but to sigh , And sleep again in death ,  --  they shall , once more , Wake and restore thee . Nea . Nea . You arouse him not . Atal . Atal . Alas ! should life 's string , overstrain 'd , be crack 'd , No more to be reknit , I forfeit peace Forever ,  --  never more to hope for joy In any life that follows . Nea . Nea . Oh ! my mistress , This passion of grief  --  Atal . Atal . Nea , now at last , I feel that I do love ! The sudden fire Kindles at last , where never yet before Its spark found nurture . If it be in vain !  --  I , that had scorn 'd the suppliant before , I too , must be the suppliant for a love That 's born without a hope . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weep o'er dreams That have no waking promise for the heart , And leave it but to tears . Alas ! Alas ! Throws herself upon Leon . Nea . Nea . Oh ! yield not thus , my mistress , to a passion That never can be blest . The best of love Still teaches sorrow as his natural gift , More sure than precious . Atal . Atal . Know you aught of Love ? Nea . Nea . As of a power that 's best esteemed in fancy , In which he more abides than in the heart . Love 's but an artful tyrant . He first wins By the most servile flatteries . He can stoop The better to ascend ; and pliant grows , When most the secret purpose in his soul , Makes him unyielding . Pleasant is his prayer ;  --  He will discourse you in the dove 's own note , Cooing and plaining , with such murmur 'd sweets , That pity learns to take the place of doubt , And paves the way for trust . But , wait awhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  Learns the new lesson his condition makes , As readily as the old ; and , sure of power , Firm , with free footing walks , where late he crept . Then , see you heed the master ;  --  who will now Claim , for his right , that which he lately sued , As the poor meed of charity ; and thus Step by step upward , with insidious art , And cunning most unequall 'd , doth he rise , Until you find your neck beneath his foot , And you become his slave , who once was yours . Atal . Atal . Oh ! terrible ,  --  where heard you this of Love ? Nea . Nea . From many teachers . Atal . Atal . Did they know him well ? They slander him , methinks . Nea . Nea . They suffer 'd first ! Our minstrels note him thus !  --  Our maidens , taught By many a hapless lesson , thus describe His art and empire . They do further tell , Beyond his tyrant habits , that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , Are even the creature 's pleasures , since they wake Such doubts and dread misgiving for their loss , As even their joys ca n't equal . The sick soul , That grieves with Love 's delusions , evermore dreams Dreading its losses . It forever makes A sombre cloud to gather in the sky , And glooms the spirit . Looking far beyond The glory in its gaze , it sadly sees Countless privations , and far-coming storms , Shrinking from what it conjures . Let them say Green youth and greener maidens , as they may , Of Love and of his raptures :  --  for my part , I hold him a disease  --  a very ache , And ague-fever , sore and troublesome ; Apt caller forth of tears , and wails , and plaints , And then of colds , and heats , and fantasies  --  Realities most mournful , and , forsooth , Imaginings , whose strange complexions be Not a whit kinder . Love 's a sorry slave , And a sad master . As a slave , he steals The jewel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart and its affections ;  --  which , having got , He straight assumes the master :  --  they , in turn , Being his willing instruments and doom 'd , When that the tyrant of his play grows sick , To be the creature 's victims at the last . Atal . Atal . I can not think this truly said of Love !  --  The minstrels do belie him , much , methinks , For envy of his conquests ; and , the maids  --  They only do complain , whom he doth slight . They never knew his nature . They , perchance  --  Since what is winning still hath counterfeits  --  Have seen some subtle semblance of his form , His true spirit all being wanting ; and were made , Haply , the victims of some wanton art , That hath betray 'd them . It were wisdom poor , And a most sad philosophy , to scorn The blessing , as in nature 's exigence , It might grow forfeit . Better , with this rule , Not live , since in the end we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may yet be lost , Still let me love ;  --  the very doubt but shows The worth of the possession . Not for me The sway of kingdoms only . In my heart There still hath been a void  --  a vacant place , That ever seem 'd to crave some image there , Set up for worship . Till this happy hour , The shrine hath been unoccupied and cold ; Now doth the warmth of a divinity Suffuse the reluctant nature , and I glow In the superior consciousness of hopes That fill me with devotion . Here is one Might teach me wherefore this . Nea . Nea . He breathes again ; There 's life within him yet .  --  His lips , they part In murmurs :  --  he will live . Shall we now leave him ? Atal . Atal . Leave him , dost thou ask ? alas ! my Nea , I can not if I would . His image takes Possession of the waste place in my soul , And fills me with himself . Whether I go , Or stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  And known , perchance , and loved too late , he still Hath grown to such a presence in my thought , That , though I lose him in the hour that finds , I lose him not from love . Now , let us call The life into his cheek . Some water bring , Scoop 'd out from yonder fountain near the sea . There , fan him with thy pinions . See , his lips ,  --  Again they part , how sweetly !  --  and again , I stoop to press them with my own that burn With a strange fervor never felt before . He wakes !  --  Ah me , he wakes ! His eyes unclose With a dim beauty . As they open , mine Sink to the sands . I feel his glances now , Stealing and searching through my throbbing heart , Until it hath no secret . Doth he speak ? What says he , my sweet Nea ? Leon , Leon , aside . Nay ,  --  no more !  --  Ah ! sister , is it thou ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ravenous sea , And the waves over thee ! I saw thee sink  --  Beheld thy outstretch 'd arms  --  heard thy wild cry For succor , that I strove in vain to give ,  --  And , struggling in the surf , ' gainst cruel hands , That kept me from thee in the fearful hour , I yielded thee as lost .  --  I have thee now  --  We shall not part again . Embracing Atalantis . Atal . Atal . Ah !  --  Leon , Leon , aside . Who art thou ? Where is my sister  --  give her to my arms ; Why dost thou keep her from me when I call ? Atal . Atal . Oh ! look not thus upon me , gentle youth : I have not done thee wrong . Leon . Leon . My sister ? Atal . Atal . She  --  I know not .  --  Leon . Leon . Alas ! alas ! for me !  --  I am alone .

Oh ! tell me , noble lady , tell me true , What is the shore we stand on  --  where the ship That bore us  --  the old master , and the men ,  --  And over all of these , the precious maid , My sister , whom I swore to save from harm , While strength was in my arms to strive for her . Alas ! that I am here , with life and strength , And she  --  thou look'st as thou hadst love and truth ,  --  Spare me these pangs  --  withhold her not from me ,  --  I shall not sink into an agony , Joy-troubled at her sight . I 'm strong to bear This happiness , if thou hast it to bestow , And take my blessing for it . Give her me ! Atal . Atal . Alas ! thou plead'st to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of the gentle maid you seek . Thou only , of the creatures of the ship , Hast found the refuge of the shore . Leon . Leon . She 's gone ,  --  And I survive her ! How can I survive ? With what a terror she entreated me , Never to leave her ; and I pledged my soul , If I had power to save , she should not sink , Or I should share her fate . My Isabel ! I could not save , and can not now survive ;  --  I come to thee ,  --  I come ! Rushes towards the sea . Atal . Atal . Forbear ! Forbear ! Oh ! be not thus the murderer of thyself , When heaven 's own voice hath order 'd thee to live . For my sake as for thine ! I kneel to thee . Do not this wrong unto thyself , I pray , Nor to the memory of the maid thou griev'st , Who , if she loved thee , never could be blest , At this , thy woeful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thy sister yet may live , Cast on some other isle , as thou on this . We 'll seek her hence together , with a hope That we may find her on the yellow sands , And win her back to life . Leon . Leon . Oh ! sweet thy words ! I will believe thee , lady , with a hope That comes on golden pinions ; for thine eye Tells of a true sense prompting thee to speak , In mercy , with a blessing won from truth ; While in thy voice a delicate music lies , Spelling all sympathies that fill the heart . Say , who art thou ? Atal . Atal . My name is Atalantis . I am a Princess of the ocean waste , But now a prisoner on this cruel isle , Which , raised by magic from the hidden deep , Wreck 'd thee and fetters me . I have the sway Of a large ocean empire which , in sight , Extends beyond the sight , and far beneath In winding ways and valleys of the sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pine In sight of my own kingdom , in the power Of a dread monarch of the demon race , A mighty potentate who keeps me here , Seeking my love . Leon . Leon . How fell you in his power ? Atal . Atal . ' T were a long speech to tell you of our realms , The sway that 's mine and his respectively , And the slight space betwixt us ; or to dwell On the opposing powers we each possess : It is enough , sweet youth , that yestermorn , I and this maiden , o'er the quiet sea , Idly disporting in our innocence , Pass 'd from our own dominions into his ; When , straightway he ,  --  being ever on the watch , And all unmatch 'd for cunning  --  raised this isle , At once , beneath us . In this sudden strait , Frighted , I cast aside my magic wand , Without which , I am nothing ; and , with joy , Knowing its powers , this monster seized it then , And keeps me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , circling all this isle , And having with our fine sense deadly hate , We may not pass , unless he wills it so , Or I regain my wand . Could that be done , Its power is such that I could sink this isle , And , with one stroke in air , undo the spells Of his foul-brew 'd enchantment . Leon . Leon . It is strange ! Methinks I wander in the Arabian tale , And wear the enchanted ring .  --  This demon king  --  Where is his castle where he harbors now ? I would behold him , and do battle for you . I am a knight of Spain , well known in arms , And wear the honors of the noblest courts , Shining in Christendie . Atal . Atal . The arms you wield , In fight with such as he , would nothing serve : He deals in subtlest magic , and receives Spells from gigantic spirits . ' T was his power Aroused the storm that overthrew your bark ; And now , on like employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a host Of most malignant followers in his train , Rank for destruction . Could I get my wand , In which a power of mightiest strength abides , I 'd battle him myself , and drive him back , And whelm the barren isle which keeps us now ! Nay , more than this ,  --  if that thy sister sleeps Beneath the waters ,  --  though I may not win Her spirit back to life  --  with that same wand , We both may penetrate the tumbling waves , Without or hurt or harm ,  --  with vision free , To find her gentle beauties where they rest On quiet beds of flowers beneath the deep . There , with our magic art may we enwrap Her fragile beauty in protecting spells , That still her eyes shall shine as when in life , Her cheeks still glow with love 's own red ,  --  her lips , Though they no more with many a tone of joy , Made soft by feeling , whisper in your ears ,  --  Still look the sweetness they have ever worn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first they grew to thine . This shall we do , And more , that nothing that thy sense may seek Shall lack to make her lovely . Leon . Leon .

If thou wilt love me , this will I perform ; Nay , though thou love me not , I still will do it , For love I have for thee . Nea , Nea , aside . No more a Queen ! How doth she yield herself unto this power , Forgetting her dominion . Leon . Leon . Gentle Princess , Shall we not get possession of this wand ? Methinks that I could do ' t . But let me hear ; Teach me the way !  --  I shall not fear to meet This monster , though with magic panoplied And all foul arts . Trust then the toil with me , I am a soldier of the holy cross , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atal . Atal . ' T is a brave spirit , but here can little do , Save to adventure .  --  This , indeed , is much !  --  Magic must baffle magic . ' T is for thee , Still to procure this wand , which thou canst win , When I have arm 'd thee with some little power ; Thou being of earthly essence , with no fear From contact with the all-infectious spell Girdling the island round . Within yon rock , That hangs precipitous above the deep  --  That should be far beneath it  --  by him raised , With sudden conjuration , at a word  --  Seal 'd in with spells , and in a curious vase , Itself a spell , the treasure lies enshrined . These charms , to me , were naught , could I but reach The chambers where they lie ; for , with this ring , Which now upon thy hand I place from mine , I may command all seals , and bid them break . Onesimarch knows this , and trusts them not ; But placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my footstep . Leon . Leon . Let me go  --  I will achieve the adventure , or will die . Atal . Atal . Not yet  --  it were in vain that you would pass , With your enfeebled strength , the threatening gulfs Of leaping waters , that , between this isle , And the high rocks you aim at , spread themselves . We must seek other aid  --  and , what are these , Auspiciously , that gather on the sands , In the fine haze of moonlight ? Nea . Nea . Fairy tribes , That , sporting in the moonbeams , saw below This new creation of Onesimarch , And straight came down , still glad in what is new , To keep their revels on it . Leon , Leon , aside . Wonders grow , Fruitful as things of nature . Atal . Atal . This is well ;  --  Meet to our purpose , at the needful hour , When they might succor us .

Alas ! sweet youth , thou look'st With such a sadness on me ! Leon . Leon . Not on thee ;  --  ' T is on my fate I look ! Atal . Atal . I am thy fate ! And thou wilt hate me for it ! Oh ! forgive !  --  If I have won thee now against thy will , To this wild venture , I do free thee from ' t ;  --  I would not have my freedom , did it bring A moment 's grief to thee . Leon .

This is a venture of my heart 's own choice , Too precious to be yielded ,  --  and , forgive ,  --  But little know'st thou of Spain 's chivalry , When thou believest that its valor shrinks From any odds with fortune . ' T is with me A pride to seek for peril ; and we hold , Taught in our schools of faith and courtesie , That , to the soul , no life is worth a care , Lock 'd up from noble deeds , lapsing away Like a scant brook , beneath a sunny sky , Scarce murmuring as it wanders to be lost , In the embrace of the o'erwhelming sea . Atal . Atal . Oh ! noble , brave philosophy ! Leon . Leon . We fight , That insolence should meet check and overthrow , The weak find succor , and the innocent Be always sure of shelter from the base ;  --  And , when the peril is sought for one so fair , Then do our masters teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down approvingly And the bright angels cheer .

Mark 'd in my face , is from the wretched fear , Now coursing through my brain , that she I seek , The gentle girl , companion of my youth , Bland as the moonlight , wooing as the shade , And sweet as fairy music , deeply lies Buried in these wild waters  --  never more , To bless me with the music of her voice  --  The magic of her smile  --  the calm delight Of her not troublesome , devoted love ! Atal . Atal . Oh ! I have tears to share with thee for her !  --  I may not give her back to thee , nor bid The voice to that young lip , where , like a bird , That had its life in music with the flowers , It lapsed in long and loving melodies ; But I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy bereavd heart and fever 'd brain , Most like to her thou grievest . I will strive , That thou shalt so esteem me .

Leon . Leon . Oh , sweetest maid  --  Thy form is kindred to thy purposes , And half restores me . Atal . Atal . All will I restore  --  All thou hast lost ,  --  and more . Believe me then  --  And stay thy sorrows . I will all replace , Of thy fond fancies , and , with love as true , Coupled with better power to serve its hope , I 'll be to thee far more than she thou grievest , Though her affection , from the innocent hour Of thy confiding childhood and pure dreams , Boundless as ocean , like the Mexique waves , Knew but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , dearest , thou shalt nothing lose Of the known raptures .

Leon . Leon . Thy words are queenliest , like thyself , sweet maid , And balsam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To soothe and stay its throbbing . Thou hast said , In sweet tones , sweetest words , that soften much The temper of my sorrows . Atal . Atal . I am glad , To offer to thy aid , to chide thy grief ,  --  Leon . Leon . Yet , for this sweet and undeservd love , If I look coldly , unbecomingly ,  --  As feeling not its ministry , nor yet , Beholding my own lack that makes it dear  --  Impute it not , I pray , a crime in me . I am not cold because my hope is so , Nor yet ungrateful that I do not joy ;  --  I shall learn better to requite thy love , In warmest language , when the pang is gone Of this sad trial  --  if it ever goes . Atal . Atal . What do they call thee ? Leon . Leon . Leon is my name . Atal . Atal . I 'll call thee Leon ;  --  call me Atalant ,  --  Thy Atalant ,  --  for shall I not be thine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ! Leon . Leon . Beautiful Atalant !  --  Atal . Atal . But here they come , Nea , and with her all the tricksy tribe , That ride on beams , and travel with the stars ; And sing in place of speech ; and fly to walk ; Now here , now gone ; garb 'd cunningly with flowers , They know to seem at pleasure ; and still bless 'd , With that which were our sorrow  --  constant change . SCENE II .  --  The Same . Enter Nea with Fairies Nea with Fairies . They circle the Princess and Leon singing . CHORUS OF FAIRIES . I. Lo , we come , we come , we come , On the glassy moonbeams riding , While no cloud , with eye of gloom , Looks down on us chiding  --  Where the silver sands spread out , Fit for spirits gayly moving ; Tossing fruits and flowers about , We are ever roving . II . Lo , we fly , we fly , we fly , All the world about us viewing , Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuing . Where the moon is shining clear , Where the winds are met together , Do we daily gather there , In the summer weather . III . Lo , we dance , we dance , we dance , On the land , and o'er the ocean ; Seizing on each happy chance , With a glad commotion . Where the summer 's leaves are green , Where the early birds are singing , And the flowers are soonest seen , We are with them springing . IV . Lo , we come , we come , we come , On our wings of light descending ; Wings that breathe , like flowers in bloom , Perfumes never ending . On the shining sands we meet , In the bright and gentle weather , Each with something new and sweet , Dancing all together . Atal . Atal . Oh ! ye are glad to-night , ye merry ones , With a fresh spirit , methinks . What pleasant hap , New privilege , or wild inheritance , Works on your wings such fine delirium ? I somewhat marvel at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dull To the extravagant rapture of your mirth , And your free song to-night . Nanita . Nanita . Extravagant ! Our mirth , fair Queen , is very soberness ; We are the modestest fairies of the wild , The gravest , quietest , best of little bodies , That ever made mischief in a neighbor 's fold , And laugh 'd to find our own . Why , people call us The very prudes of faerydom . We shake Our heads with gravity o'er state affairs , And sit in council with old Oberon , Who , when Titania wakes his jealousy , Will straight prefer our wisdom to his own ;  --  As , at such times , indeed , he wisely may . Atal . Atal . Oh ! pray you then forgive me ! Now I see That you are sober and quiet as you claim , Having but little mirth , and , at no season , Extravagant in its utterance . Your excess Lay only in my sadness . ' T was my grief That made your joy extreme . Your mood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That grows with my captivity , and glooms With the dread aspect of my prison-house . Loline . Loline . Yet is there much to gladden us to-night . Have we not newly added to our realms A goodly island , gracious in extent , Whose beauteous sands , drawn out in lavish scope , Persuades the moon 's best smile upon our revels . Atal . Atal . If you knew all ,  --  the story of this isle !  --  Yet is there something more , or I mistake ye , For which ye joy to-night . Careta . Careta . There is ! There is ! Rightly you spoke , fair Princess , when you deem 'd Our joy unwonted . We are bless 'd to-night , Beyond our usual measure . You shall hear . Perchance you know Zelina ,  --  of our tribe , The sweetest , merriest creature  --  full of fun ,  --  But glad to serve , and , with the happiest art , To make the service pleasant as the will , That prompts it to compliance . She is here  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sport , by some undreampt mischance , She smote Titania 's favorite nonpareil , And broke its gossamer wing . The angry Queen , For this , our little sister 's innocent deed , Doom 'd her a prisoner in the zephyr 's shell , Till the first flowers that blossom in the spring Should speak her into freedom . Till this time Her fate was pitiful :  --  to use no wing , Murmur no more , and mingle not , in song  --  See none to comfort  --  hear no voice of love  --  Dance no capricious revel on the sands , But , with an unresisting sense , to float On the tumultuous billows , night and morn , Until the birth of that same flower of spring ! Found on the pleasantest shore beneath the sun , Where first he soars in brightness from the seas , We hail 'd its presence , and have set her free ; And , from her prison , with delighted wing , She soars with us to-night . Lol . Lol . Nor is this all  --  Another captive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever to our sports . This wanton fairy , sporting in the breeze , Last moon , alone , was taken prisoner By that same tyrant-king , Onesimarch , That locks you in ; and , ' t were a fit revenge , That we should join with you , for these same wrongs , To punish him in turn . Within yon rock , He seal 'd her up in crystal . By some chance , Not yet discover 'd , all her bonds were broke , And she is here with us . Tinina !  --  here ! Behold the maiden . Princess . She knows all The secrets of this tyrant 's ocean-towers , And , for your wand 's recovery , will do Aught that will seem most needful . Atal . Atal . Fit a barque , And make thy wing its sail , to waft this Prince To the same rock that was thy prison late . Himself will do the rest . ' T is there , I learn , My sceptre is sealed up . Tinina . Tinina . The barque is here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready ; Will ' t please you go , my Prince ? Atal . Atal . Wilt thou go , Leon ? Leon . Leon . ' Twill please and make me proud . Lol . Lol . Tinina , hence ! I give thee winds , and waters , and a star ,  --  I spell thee with a talisman of safety ,  --  And crown thee with a will and wing of strength ; Go hence in courage , and be bless 'd in service ; And when thy task is done , regain our course , Which now we take toward the Hundred Isles , That smile in the Southern Cross . We wait thee there . Princess , we gladden that our offices Seem worth thy tasking , and shall find delight , If that they prosper ' neath thy hope and ours . Wings , be ye up and wheeling  --  up , I say ! FLIGHT OF FAIRIES , AND CHORUS . We are they who fly by night , When the maiden moon is bright , And the silver beach is spread , Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tread : When the air of heaven is balm , When the ocean waves are calm , And the flowers of earth grow bright ,  --  We are they who fly by night ! Exeunt Fairies . Atal . Atal . Now , Leon , if the task before thee seem Unsuited to thy human strength ,  --  Leon . Leon . No more ! Hold me , I pray thee , Princess , as a man That better loves the struggle that proves manhood , Than the base sleep that stagnates all his soul . I seek the adventure . Atal . Atal . Then , this sylph will guide ;  --  Will bear thee safely o'er these tumbling gulfs , To yon tall rock , now beetling black and vast Above the whiten 'd billows . Boldly speed , Nothing misdoubting , howsoever strange The thing that rises threatening in thy path . The mystic ring that wraps thy finger round , Hath , in itself , a wondrous faculty , To shield the wearer from the unlicensed power Of spirits of evil . Leon . Leon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety , In service which is noble , and in prayer To him who checks and may subdue all spirits , Than in this hoop of magic . See , this cross , Which crowns the mortal weapon that I wear , As life is over death !  --  this is my shield , As , in the blade , I find my ample sword ; With these I go unfearing . Atal . Atal . Would thou went'st With brow serene  --  with happier thought than now . Leon . Leon . Heed not the mood of this most heavy heart , That clouds the brow thou look'st on . Some few days Will hush the impatient grief that murmuring cries , Seeking a loved one lost . When I return , And thou hast led me where my sister lies , Though she beholds not as I weep beside her , Still will I strive to thank thee with a blessing , Whose eyes shall look but love ! Atal . Atal . Till then I live not ! Tinina Tinina sings . The wind is on the wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is the guide to the voyager is bright , But the fickle wind may change , should the voyager delay , And the star beneath the demon cloud may perish from the sight . The will , and the wing , are both ready while I sing  --  And the service that makes music as for love it labors still , Hath no murmur for the ear , though it whispers still of care , And implores that the season be not forfeit to the will . Then away , then away , ere we meet the coming day , For the dewy haze is rising like a curtain o'er the sea ;  --  I have winds and waves and star , but they serve us not in war , And the present bears the flower that 's most precious unto me . Leon . Leon . The delicate song is sung in my behalf , A counsel spoke in sweetness , as should be All counsel for the loved one ;  --  fairy , thanks !  --  I 'm with thee !  --  sweetest princess , fare thee well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , but if thou wilt , My heart has but one bidding  --  soon return . Exeunt Leon and Tinina . Nea . Nea . Sweet mistress !  --  Atal . Atal . Come with me to ocean 's edge ,  --  That we may soonest hail his coming back , Made happy in his safety . Nea . Nea . This is love ! Exeunt . SCENE III . The Rock and Tower of Onesimarchus . Ogr chained at the base . Ogr . Ogr . Shall I not have revenge  --  shall he not feel , This wanton wrong that he hath put on me , In his unmeasured wrath ? Must I submit To wear the chains about my limbs , as now ; Still fearing , that , for every erring deed , I may not ' scape the villain penalty , But bend my shrinking back to meet the scourge , When ' t suits a fellow-slave to place it there ! I 'll be revenged.  --  Already have I done Something towards it ; for , throughout the hour , When that his storms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dismember 'd rocks I hurl 'd into his secret halls above , And the repeated crash gave token sure Of a wild mischief  --  and I rest not here ! He can not punish me more than he has done , And , let the tyrant will it so or not , I leave his service when my limbs are free . Ha ! What are these ? How now ! What seek you here ? Enter Leon and Tinina . What is it that you lack ? Speak , ere I strike , And hurl you into pieces with this rock . Leon . Leon . Thou monstrous slave , what is it that thou sayst ? Dost threaten too ? Stand by , and let me pass , Or thus , I thrust my weapon to thy heart . Tinina . Tinina . Forbear ! Thou wert an infant in his grasp , And he would crush thee at a single stroke . Show him thy spell of power  --  but lift thy ring ! See , now , he trembles : keep it thus in sight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm ,  --  He can not hurt us now . They ascend and enter the rock . Ogr . Ogr . Terrible power ! How has it fetter 'd me , and taken away Each nerve once strung for action . Lo ! they come , And bearing off my master 's instruments .  --  Well , let them go ! I glad me he hath wrong ! I would that he were fetter 'd in my place , And I were free and had no master then ; How would I revel in all goodly things !  --  What lusts would I delight in ,  --  food and drink , Until my senses swim , and sleep i ' the sun , Doing no service more ! Ah ! here they come . Enter Leon and Tinina . Leon . Leon . Slave , wouldst thou have thy freedom , and escape The tyranny that tramples in this wise , Loading thy limbs with chains , while the salt sea , Enflames the galling tortures of the scourge ? Ogr . Ogr . That would I , mighty prince . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the chain thou wear'st and follow me . Ogr . Ogr . I 'll fling it in the sea . Shall I do more ? Bid me upheave this rocky battlement , Wherein he keeps his magic , I 'll not pause ;  --  Do thou but say the word . Leon . Leon . Nay , heed it not ! If she I serve do thus decree , thou mayst ,  --  Not else . Ogr . Ogr . How now ! you are no monarch then ? Whom serve you ? Leon . Leon . The fair princess , Atalantis . Ogr . Ogr . I do remember that she spoke for me , And would have saved me from this scourge and rock . A goodly princess  --  I will worship her . Tinina Tinina sings . The bark is on the sea , and the breeze is in the sail , And the star to guide us onward is now gleaming o'er the steep ; We have won the prize we sought , and the whisper of the gale Would counsel us , the treasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then away , ere the tyrant seeks his prey ,  --  There 's a murmur of the ocean that 's unfriendly to our flight ; And the cricket at mine ear has a chirrup full of fear , That but lately sung in music of a confident delight . Leon . Leon . Even as thou wilt , sweet maiden ; let us hence To her who waits in hope and innocence . SCENE IV . The Ocean between the rocks and the Islet . Atalantis , Leon , and Nea . Onesimarchus approaching with his Legions . Onesi . Onesi . Ha ! what is here  --  what fearful change is this ?  --  The rock of spells o'erthrown , and Atalant , Again with wand restored , and , at her side , The lowly instrument of her release . I did not guard against a thing of earth , And he hath wrought this ruin of my hopes . She smiles upon him too  --  perchance she loves  --  Hell !  --  that I can not blast her with a look , And him , the minion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not live , to triumph in that love , Enjoying raptures still denied to me . Rise waters  --  lift your heads  --  mount up and soar , Engulfing all that may not ride upon ye ; And thou , dismember 'd shore , again descend , Down to the oozy depths from whence thou cam'st  --  I need thee nothing farther  --  sink , I say . He waves his wand and the island descends . Atal . Atal . Now , Leon , place thy hand within mine own ; Fear not the billows  --  hearken not their roar ,  --  They can not harm thee , thus accompanied . Leon . Leon . And ye , fair skies , farewell . Thou fatal isle , Which robb 'd me of my best beloved , farewell ! I sorrow not to see thee downward go , Troubling no mariner hence . One long last look , Ye bright clouds , that remind me of my home  --  My country , all , farewell . Oh , never more Shall my eyes gladden with your glimpse again . Now Isabel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fear , Dear Leon , from this danger ? Leon . Leon . Little now , Since , in the wonders that are shown to me , I yield me to the fullest faith in all That thou hast promised me . Atal . Atal . Thou soon shalt see , How , as to me , these waters shall become Familiar to thy nature . Thou wilt glide Unharm 'd between their billows , which shall lift Thy form , with friendly succor , as thou will'st , Making their arms thy servants . Leon . Leon . I believe ,  --  And round thy waist , sweet Atalant , I twine , Fearless , my confident arm and murmur not . I would not look upon the skies again , That witness 'd my late ruin ; and the seas , That wrought it all , beget no terrors now .  --  We do not sink . Atal . Atal . Not yet !  --  Behold afar , Where , gathering , grow vast legions  --  angry forms , Gigantic , that in masses , or alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crests of ocean far and wide , While roll the constant thunders of the gong , That calls them still to rise . Leon . Leon . I see ! I see ! Atal . Atal . These are the armies of my own domain , Led by my gallant brothers . They go forth , To fight and conquer this Onesimarch , Who , strong in trick and artifice alone , Will never meet them in the open field . Already , see , he shrinks ;  --  his hosts retire , And his fierce rule departs . Leon . Leon . The land is gone ! Atal . Atal . Yes , down we sink , and thou art all mine own : I bear thee on the waters , for a while , To prove the power I have to succor thee . Now for the calm retreat , by ocean girt , And stormy waves protected  --  now with me ! There in the sunny hours that lapse away , Like angel messengers , and leave no pain , Thy heart shall grow to gladness . Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a pure estate , Beyond the strifes that trouble it with man :  --  Free from controlling crowds  --  free from the jar , The heat , the noise , the dust of human care . Nature shall blight thee never , nor disease Bind thee in loathsome sheets ; nor tempests rise To blasts thy fields , dispute thy fondest hope , And , from thy wearied and exhausted heart , Drink the sweet life-blood of thy innocent joy . The breeze shall rather soothe thee with a breath , Robb 'd from celestial gardens . The blue waves , Shall roll their tribute honors to thy feet ; Upon their bosom , many an offering placed , Of fruits , fresh wafted from far Indian isles Wooing thee with their fragrance . In the air , Nature shall cast her odors , and thine eye Shall never ope but to behold some new And most luxuriant freshness in her form ; And , I shall love thee too , and toil untired To give thee back the maiden whom thou seek'st . Leon . Leon . Ah ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is vain , And the wish idle . Yet the love thou givest , Might well compensate , to this baffled heart , The loss which still it weeps . Atal . Atal . Oh ! do not weep . I 'll love thee in all fortunes . At the morn , I 'll lead thee through our waters , ' mid our caves , Where , in unconscious brightness , cluster gems Had set your world on fire . There shall you mark Glad sea-maids that , attending on our steps , Fill their deep shells with song ; and , when the sun Shines burningly at noon , in coral groves , Thy head well pillow 'd on my happy breast , I 'll sit and watch thy slumbers , blest to soothe Thy ever beating pulse , and kiss thy lips , When , murmuring in thy sleep , thou speak'st the name , Of her thou still hast loved . Leon . Leon . No more of her . I go with thee , sweet Atalant.  --  We sink ! Chorus of Sea-Nymphs as the island descends. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
