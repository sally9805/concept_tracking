Taylor , Bayard , 1825-1878 : To Earth . from To Earth ( 1848 ) Arouse , old Earth ! thy sleep no more That fevered dream assuages , Which bound thee to the crumbling shore Of long and darkened ages . Rise , and the chains that ' round thee cling , Rend with a strong endeavor , Till with a sundering sound they spring From off thy limbs forever ! The faint , far light of coming dawn , Within thine eyelids creeping , Bids all the phantom fears be gone , Which filled thy heart with weeping ; And when the ever-mounting sun Shall bring at last the morrow , His eye of light shall look on none Whom thou hast born to sorrow . Forget the centuries of gloom , With that long slumber blending , When o'er thy breast an iron doom Seemed ceaselessly impending ! No more thy Titan soul may feel Oppression 's endless goading , For voices from the future steal , Fraught with a glad foreboding ! Hope yet , O Earth ! unfelt before , Truth steals her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The night that overarches ; The shadows move but slowly back , Chased by the radiance cheery , And thou must walk a twilight track Through many a cycle weary ! Yet , even now , within thy veins , The leaping blood rejoices ; And soon , a power that laughs at chains Shall fill thy breast with voices ! And better far , the woes which cried From thy great soul-unheeded , Shall find , despite of Wrong and Pride ; The solace which they needed ! Then lift thy solemn front on high , In earnest , mute appealing ; While up thy grand eternal sky , The morning-red is stealing ! Till Crime and Wrong and Slavery Shall leave thy martyred bosom , And , with God 's blessing , gloriously The flowers of Freedom blossom . KENNETT SQUARE , PENNSYLVANIA .
