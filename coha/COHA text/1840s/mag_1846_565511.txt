txt THIS *5 a very extraordinary book ; we think the most extraordinary book of the kind in the English language . It is an autobiography , which , if it reveal the real self of any man , is always curious and instructive . This , however , unveils to us the inward being of a man of superior intellect , and a heart gentle , sensitive and religious ; and reveals it too with a freedom and totality which is often distressing . His history was of romantic interest in its eventfulness and variety , while the anguish and sorrow of the sufferer , which are too often left to be imagined , are here uttered with a distinctness which seems to bring up again the very sighs and groans which each hour of bitterness wrung from him . But more than all , it is fraught with the highest moral and religious interest , as it illustrates the greatest of all matters , the first principles of all faith , and of the Christian faith especially , for it is the faithful record of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that was educated in the Romish faith , and breaking out from its iron barriers , passed through almost every variety of Christian belief in orderly succession , rejecting each in its order , and ending in a faith , or a no faith , which has no name , unless it might fitly be styled " the everlasting Nay . " In this state he died . Mr. White was horn at Seville , July 1 , 1775 , of Roman Catholic parents of Irish descent , their ancestors having fled from Protestant persecution to Spain . His father and mother seem to have been both bigoted and devout Romanists . He early expressed his inclination for * The Life of the Rev. Joseph Blanco White , written by himself , with portions of his correspondence ; edited by John Hamilton Thom . In 3 vols . London : John Chapman , 121 Newgate street , 1845. the church , which inclination was but a boyish desire to be rid of the irksome confinement of the counting house . He was educated for an ecclesiastic , in the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , by the Baconina method of reasoning , and a knowledge of modern literature and of rhetoric , all of which were studied voluntarily and almost by stealth . The path to promotion , in the schools and in the church , was early and readily opened to him . He was a fello*v in the college of Seville , competed with honor for a canonry in the cathedral of Cadiz , was appointed to a stall in the royal chapel of Ferdinand , and was esteemed as a scholar of high promise . Lie was ordained priest at the age of 25 , and soon became a favorite confessor , with brightening prospects before him for usefulness and eminence . At the age of 27 , " just at the period , " as he says , " when I was most seriously and conscientiously employed in the duties of my profession , " he admitted deliberately the fact that the church had erred . From that came at once the conclusion to which every sincere Roman Catholic in similar circumstances must arrive . " I concluded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly my own . The church of Rome had most assiduously prepared me to draw it . " By this conclusion he was thrown at once into a situation most perplexing and unhappy . His nature was too noble to play the hypocrite without revolting . To superadd to concealment , the animal sloth , the voluptuous self-indulgence , cloaked under priestly craft , which are the common accompaniments of ecclesiastic infidelity , was most abhorrent to his feelings . To relinquish his profession was impossible , " the law // of the country forbids it , and con. strues a voluntary relinquishment of all priestly offices into a proof of heresy , punishable with death . Unless I quitted the country , my acting as a priest was inevitable . " To expatriate himself would give the blow of death to his parents . His conclusion was to maintain an external conformity with the church , avoiding prominence and preferment , and inculcating the moral duties . Just before his final rejection of Christianity , he was appointed to preach before the brigade of royal carabineers at Seville . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scepticism . Soon after he is introduced to " a member of the upper clergy , a man of great reading , and secretly a most decided disbeliever in all religion . " Through him he was introduced to another dignitary , older and higher in preferment , who was a violent anti-christian , a bitter and passionate hater of the Gospel , who , as well as the younger acquaintance , had a secret library of infidel writings , to both of which collections White was made welcome . So valuable were these books , in their estimation , and so great their dread of the Inquisition , that the forbidden volumes were often conveyed to and fro in the sleeves of their canonicals . Le Syst*me de la Nature was thus saved more than once . Blanco White , still a priest , became at last a decided atheist , and such he remained for some four or five years , holding himself aloof from all clerical duties , whether as priest or confessor , by various expedients . In 1807 , he became interested in the public disturbances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After many reverses and disappointments , at the approach of a French army upon Seville , he took advantage of the general panic and disorder to leave his country for England , where he arrived March 10 , 1810 . He sought England as a land of freedom from his constrained hypocrisy , and free also from priestly domination and ignorance . It was with delirious joy that he broke away from his prison house , though that prison was his native land . It was with more sober feelings that he found himself alone in England , at the age of 35 , with a hundred pounds , a single recent acquaintance , and , above all , with his lips faltering and fettered through his imperfect knowledge of English . He had previously made the acquaintance of several Englishmen of rank and influence , among whom were Lord Holland and Lord John Russell , by whom he was greeted kindly , and who courteously rendered him important services . After sundry projects and beginnings , he became the editor of a Spanish journal , for the publication and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time were eminently favorable . Though this journal was never the organ of a political party , yet so valuable were its services that the government bestowed upon its editor a pension of two hundred and fifty pounds per annum when its publication was suspended . He was no sooner engaged in this labor , than with the enterprise and ardor characteristic of him till death , he commenced the study of Greek , which he soon discovered to be essential to the education of an English scholar . He also set himself to the study of the Christian religion . In 1812 he conformed to the church of England , having become convinced of the truth of Christianity and being sufficiently satisfied with the doctrines of the church . After studying its articles &amp;c. more carefully , for two additional years , he applied to the Bishop of London to be qualified , by subscribing the articles , for claiming the rites of ordination . About this time , having ceased from his editorial labors , he settled at Oxford , as a convenient position // for prosecuting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , on the examination of the question of inspiration as the foundation and essential truth of Protestant theology , that his peace was again disturhed , and the serenity of his recent faith was overcast . His residence at Oxford was not long continued . He received the offer of a residence at Holland louse , in the capacity of tutor to the son of its noble proprietor . This was accepted with reluctance , and the situation was a source of suffering and inorbid melancholy to his sensitive spirit , till he parted from his kind friends in 1819 , with many expressions of attachment on both sides . During this period his mind was agitated with doubts and disquietude in respect to the doctrine of the Trinity , as commonly received in the church of England . In a long confession of his faith , recorded Dee . 21 , 1818 , there appears very near approximation to some of the conclusions in which he died . He resolved to adhere to the established church however , though with many misgivings . After leaving Holland House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in separate lodgings ; till his return to Oxford in 1826 . During this interval , he was far from being inactive . In 1820 he wrote the well known " Doblado 's Letters from Spain , " which appeared in the New Monthly Magazine . His public reputation was now widening ; his correspondence with many of the leading writers of England dates from this period , in 1825 he published his " Evidence against Catholicism . " This was written in reply to Mr. Charles Butler 's " Book of the Catholic Church , " and as it appeared at a time when the Roman Catholic question was uppermost , it produced a marked effect . It was received with great applause , and no wonder . The authority of the writer , as one who spake from his own experience , the high culture , the gentlemanly bearing , the sweet Christian-like spirit , as well as the chastened allusions to his own personal sufferings , he hayirig seen his two sisters immolated by the barbarities of Romanism , and having himself been driven to the madness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations , added to the veracity of its testimonies , and the strength of its reasonings , gave an importance and authority to the book which fe*v books on the Romish controversy deserve or receive . this was followed by a smaller and more popular work , entitled " The Poor Man 's Preservation against Popery . " The reputation attending these works brought him as it would seem into closer contact with leading spirits in the church , and he became himself , as appears from his journals , more believing , at least more acquiescent in respect to its ritual and doctrines . His services had been so important , and his usefulness so unquestioned , that Oxford conferred on him the degree of M. A. by diploma , an honor rarely enough given , and , as it would seem , not giv ' *n in this case without a little of the growl which this eldest and best beloved daughter of John Bull seems to think the highest form of courtesy , inasmuch as it testifies to the very great value which the receiver should put upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for he records that if the opposition in the Convocation had been successful , he should certainly have left the country . After receiving this degree , he went to Oxford in 1826 , intending to reside there permanently . He carried with him excited hopes and a high ideal , expecting to find all that a Protestant university in free England might be supposed to furnish to one like himself . lie was adniitted to Oriel College , then " one of the most distinguished bodies of the university , and its common room united a set of men , who for talents and // 241 manners were most desirable as friends and daily companions . " But here , though he met with great kindness , he was chagrined to learn that his rank as an honorary Master was below that of the most recent Fellow , and the prospect very painful to his morbidly sensitive spirit of soon being the very oldest inmate and inferior to all , was keenly humiliating . Cold and perhaps insolent looks were turned upon him , as a foreigner and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oxford . He sympathized but little with the dominant spirit of bigotry in the High Church party . He found , however , a congenial spirit in Dr. Whately , then a Fellow , and managed to be quiet till 1829 . At that time occurred the contest between Sir Robert Peel and Sir R. H. Inglis for the election of the university , involving the question of Roman Catholic emancipation . The re-election of the present premier , was violently opposed by the High Church party . Blanco White had resolved not to give his vote , but it is worth noticing , was persuaded to do so by a letter from Mr. ( now Dr. ) Pusey . In giving his vote , he was not only publicly insulted at the poll , but incurred the bigoted wrath of Mr. J. H. Newman . We record here the following from his journal about this time . " Pusey , Wilberforce , Froude came in the evening to learn the order of the Roman Catholic service of the Breviary . " These are pregnant hints ; but more of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he took up his residence with Dr. Whately , now archbishop of Dublin , as tutor to his son . During his residence at Dublin , his mind was in the same vibrating state , verging more decidedly to fixed and avowed Unitarianism . It was while he was here that Dr. Neander dedicated the third volume of his General Church History to him . He also published an answer to T. Moore 's Travels of an Irish Gentleman , " &amp;c . Notwithstanding his opinions were now decidedly anti-trinitanan , he not only continued in the church , but thought it his duty to write to the Rev. George Armstrong , who had recently avowed Unitarian sentiments , to dissuade him from adhering to the separation . Mr. Armstrong replied in a letter which was too strong for poor Blanco , and the consequence was that he abruptly left the family of his friend in Jan. 1835 , and crossed the channel for Liverpool , where he was received by Unitarian friends , among whom he passed the remaining years of his life , and in whose connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 66th year of his age . He was at first delighted with the worship of the Unitarian chapels , but does not appear to have remained long in what is usually called Unitarian Christianity . We find him soon reading Paulus ' Leben Jesu , and soon after recommending the work of Strauss as more satisfactory , and finally , clearly and without reserve , standing strongly on the ground taken by the naturalists of Germany , that a supernatural revelation is impossible in natura rerum and unsustained in fact . The record of his speculations and of his strong emotions , is of thrilling interest ; his correspondence with a female *iev*e and the comments upon his reading posses* a high literary interest , and his correspondence with his newmade friends in America , especially with Drs . Norton and Channing , is interesting for its illustrations of the men and of their opinions . The sentiments which he uttered not long before his death , are most affecting : " I have no doubts-I came from God and I go to him . rphe guide , the light within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is , then , an infinite source of the rationality we know to be in us , who will receive us to himself . " " I am going , my dear friend-I am leaving you very fast . I have not // 242 The Autobiography of a Rationalist , formed such definite views of the nature of a future life as many have , but I trust him who has taken care of me thus far . I should trust a friend , and can I not trust him ? " At last , aware that the power of distinct utterance was failing , he added , " When the hour shall come , let it be said once for all , my soul will he concentrated in the feeling . My God , into thy hands I commend my spirit . ' God to me is Jesus , and Jesus is God-of course not in the sense of divines ! " He remained some days longer , chiefly as if asleep , till the morning of the 20th , when he woke up , and with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , " Now I die , " and soon it was as he had said . The sketch which we have given is the merest outline of this narrative of thrilling and painful interest . We have not attempted to give more than this dry outline , for to impart to our readers any idea of the man , would require more than the limits which we have assigned to a higher and more important object . We have said that the history of this individual casts light on the most important principles . This instruction we would gather up and set before our readers . Coleridge has recorded the very striking observation , that " it can not but be beneath a wise man to be an infidel on the score of what other men think fit to include in their Christianity . " This gives the key to what we would say of Blanco XVhite . We would consider the several systems of Christianity ( so.caIled ) with which he came in contact , and inquire as to the influence which they exerted to make him so sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he first received - which was identified with his infancy and childhood , he has described . His father was a man of pure life and of ardent devotedness to the church-his mother of equal faith and firmness . Indeed it was the tears of his mother , that at the age of eighteen confirmed his wavering decision , and bound him forever to the church . His education waswhat ? Was it that knowledge of history and geography , and of literature , which is esteemed with us the common basis of the culture of the humblest Protestant boy ? No , nothing like it ; but instead of these , a drill in logic and school divinity . At the age of fourteen , he was put upon an extended system of logic , and it was by accident and stealth that he became acquainted with any thing beside . At the age of eight , by the stealthy reading of Telemaque , boyish doubts of the truth of Christianity were excited , for which he felt obliged to excuse himself at the confessional ; and the significant inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " reveals a world of truth in regard to priestly power . From the age of fourteen , he was obliged on penalty of the guilt of mortal sin , to read aloud the daily service out of the Breviary , which requires at rapid reading an hour and a quarter ; and this was never omitted by him from fourteen to twenty-seven , except in serious illness . His confessor imposed upon him in addition , during most of his boyhood and youth , the task of employing an hour a day in reading and meditation , one half of the time on his knees , in efforts to move himself to hysteric tears . The spiritual exercises , which he describes with frightful power and truthfulness , bring all their terrific machinery to bear upon the youthful passions . We have never read any thing more h*rrible , than the account which he gives of the working of this tremendous enginery to move the sensibilities , by horrid scenes and more horrid imaginations , till nature is racked to her utmost capacity ; when she is gently lulled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Spiritual quackery is bad // enough in Protestant countries , but does not approximate to what it can become in the hands of an infallible church . These exercises continuing for five days or more , are followed by the general confessions , " Every thought , word and deednay , every doubt , every uncertainty of confession that can be called to remembrance , must be stated to the priest . " So debasing is this selfscrutiny and self-exposure respecting sins as venial or mortal to be decided by the confessor , that-it emaciates and destroys the conscience . her own independent action as herself responsible to God , is lost by lack of exercise , and she becomes used to all sin but sin against the will of him who is to her the voice of the church . During this noviciate of spiritual discipline , he is not encouraged to those manly and liberal studies which develope and refine the powers . Books of poetry and philosophy are known to him by accident , and are read with little encouragement and almost with fear . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having before been held under strict regime against his roving affections , he is now bound to celibacy , by an irrevocable vow ; and as no future transgression can ever result in marriage , he isno longer watched . Slowly but surely a pure-minded and religious youth discovers that from that moment the morality of a licentious life in the clergy is of little concern-that the cases are rare in which this celibacy is any thing but a covert and excuse for actual crime . His own observation convinces him , that by far the greater mass of his fellow clergy are degraded by lust , for which the church can provide ready penance and absolution . He sees his own dear friend , the director of his studies , the one who fostered his literary taste , his confessor , become degraded by habits of drunkenness and licentiousness . LIis acquaintance also with his fellows , reveals the fact that most of them are infidels , and many of them violent and passionate infidels . But this is not all . After these discoveries are made and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict . He had two sisters , both educated at the convent , to which the eldest adheres till he saw her die the victim of confinement and of a blighted and crushed spirit . The youngest had the courage to leave the convent at first , and to follow the dictates of a buoyant spirit and of filial affection , which guided her to her home . She should have been the light to a father 's lonely and darkened habitation , and the comfort to a mother 's declining and afflicted years . But she droops ; a misguided conscience , interpreted by a priestly voice , bids her become the bride of Christ . her brother would interpose , if he dared . Still more is he stung , even to the rage of anguish , when he learns that her confessor is a man of vicious life . " Yet this poor deluded man conceived that he was sure of heaven 's approbation and favor , by encouraging the enthusiastic feeling which had turned my sister 's eyes towards one of the gloomiest nunneries at Seville . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was observed with the greatest rigor - where the nuns were not allowed a bed , and were obliged to sleep on a few planks raised about a foot from the ground-where the use of linen near the body was forbiddenwhere the nuns wore coarse open sandals , through which the bare foot was exposed to cold and *vet-where the nearest relations were not allowed to see the face of the recluse , or to have any communication with her , except on certain days , when in the presence of another nun , and with a thick curtain , the parent , brother or sister exchanged a few unmeaning sentences with the dear relative whom they had lost forever . " To this lot this precious father would consign this sister of Blanco-when // in the presence of this confessor and in that of his mother , her brother ventures , priest though he was , to interpose ; he is answered by a threatening scowl , and bidden not aid the great tempter . This is not all . Her choice is made . She is to be immolated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the brother was forced to celebrate the high mass on the occasion , and his former friend and confessor wrote the greater part of the sermon in a state bordering on intoxication , in order to show that the carousal had not weakened his power at composition . " The ceremony of profession lasts three hours , during which the heart of the officiating priest was in a state which only the infinite mercy of Him who can distinguish the effects of anguish from those of wickedness could endure and forgive . " Is it strange that he retires to his chamber , to curse with open voice this system of fanatical deceit , and the country on which it was fastened by law ? Is it strange that the intelligent and cultivated man , under the pressure of such a religion , xviii slowly awake to the question , " Whether this religion is from God ? " and the more he understands its nature and operation , will put the question more strongly to himself , whether a religion from God could so blight and deform and degrade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sense of right , his wronged and outraged conscience , should force him to say , " If it be from God , then its God is my devil ? " His sense of truth , his feeling of honor , would prompt him to express his convictions , at least to throw off the bonds of a profession which he loathes as dishonest and base for itself ; but doubt is heresy , and heresy leads to the Inquisition , to the rack and the stake . Deeper and still deeper sinks the conclusion , that a system which binds to such baseness by such terror can not be from God . But in vain the chafed and struggling spirit rages . Its look of contemptuous or sneering unbelief , or of gloomy despair , or its hasty word , betrays his secret to another brother of his craft . Brothers in the same prison-house , they understand each other by signs which can not be mistaken . They unbosom their thoughts to each other . They learn that the system not only must be a farce , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more numerous portion of their own body . Impelled by all these instincts of honor and of truth , the inquirer ventures to scrutinize the arguments on which this religion founds its claim . He finds it in a nut-shell . A revelation from God needs an infallible interpreter . * revelation declares that to the church is committed this trust , in passages which this church infallibly interprets to impart to itself this trust of infallible interpretation . Indeed ! The question is then a question of fact . Has this infallible church never been known to err ? Slowly the evidence piles itself up towards this conclusion , till it frowns darkly over him like a gloomy cloud . More slowly does the mind yield to its weight , till at last the conviction is received . Rome has erred . Then comes , as quick as tl*ougl*t , the consequenceChristianity is a fable . So certain is this the case , that Blanco White declares that of all the Spaniards whom he ever knew , who had rejected Christianity , there was but one who did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from South America , who remained a pious Deist . A Protestant can with difficulty understand why this should he so . He asks , why does not the inquirer go to the Scriptures ? - why not inquire concerning the Protestant belief before rejecting all faith ? We answer , to the Romanist , especially in a country like Spain , where Protestantism is unknown , the church is identified with Christianity , and // 245 Christianity with the church . The conception of the one as existing without the other is never admitted to the mind . If Protestant sects are spoken of , they are described as infidels , and the very proverbs of the nursery make them such . Besides , Rome has denied the man the Scriptures ; or if she has not denied them , she has done far worse-she has spoiled them , imitating their sacred history , by her owa mawkish and extravagant legends , till the very name of a miracle is a loathing to the reason . The most sacred strains of inspired devotion too  --  the sublimest representations of Jehovah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so diluted by , or associated with , the thunders of the old man on the Tiber , or the leer of the sanctimonious infidel who has polluted them by his breath , that they have lost their capacity to move him to faith or reverence . If he learns perchance to receive them with faith , it is a life-long struggle which he must hold between his convinced reason on the one hand , and his outraged feelings on the other , his memory loaded with disgusting and degrading associations , and his imagination freighted with pictures disgustin g and horrible . But again , let us suppose the inquirer to feel some relentings , and , recovering a little from the terrible conclusion in which he had landed , to ask again-is there no other argument , holy mother , by which you sustain the claims of the Gospel ? She replies with the bland and patient smile of the Jesuit , or the frown of the Inquisitor-argument , my son , can never do the work ; it is only the supernatural grace of faith that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And how is that to come ? By reasoning with myself of my own guilt , and of the fitness of the Gospel to remove and cleanse it , and by bowing my reluctant will to the service of One who claims my conscience by its strong convictions , and my heart with its response to his dying love ? Oh , no ! but bow to the church , read her prayers , submit to her penances , and work thyself through all the grades of her hysteric excitements But why does he not reflect on religion as man 's noblest service to his God , as having a most sacred claim on his higher and better nature ?  --  and why does he not receive Christianity as a remedy from the degradation of sin , and thus holding strongly his conscience ? Because religion , in the theory of the church , . has no such idea . It is rather an antagonist than an aid to true moral culture , to " the perfecting of holiness in the fear of God . " It does not hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the government of God to act with its mighty energy to lift man up to his convictions of duty , but rather makes it crush him into the mire with its enormous weight , as it dispenses with so much holiness hy the payment of so much religion . It is a service , a penance , a painful appeasing of higher power through imposed services , and not the grateful service of a reformed and righthearted man . It is the most damning proof of the recreancy of Rome to the truth and to Christ , that she gives religion no hold on the enlightened conscience-nay , that she dare not trust that conscience with a scrutiny into her service or her argument . All that power can do she has turned to her useall strong and passionate addresses to the sensibilities , from the tenderest to the most heart-rendin she understands how to employ with the utmost effect-all that the taste demands in music and song and painting , she has baptized for herself-all that classical learning can frame of polished and eloquent writing , and all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she can do , but the leaving of the Gospel to stand or fall with the convicted conscience of // the man who must be saved by it , this she can not do . Should she attempt to do this , the conscience , outraged and indignant , would reject the rites which she prescribes , and tear down her altars and her confessional to make its way to the Savior whose Gospel she would preach . Failing to do this , Rome must be the parent of infidelity , if she did but this , whatever might be her errors in doctrine or the corruptions caused by her vast and powerful organization , she might justify herself to the inquiring spirit ; but failing to commend the Gospel to the moral sense , she is the grand nursery of infidelity and atheism , sheltering them at her very altars under a hollow external conformity , and training the myriads of hercuitivated men to a systematic rejection of Christianity under the one plea , that religion is a traitor to conscience and a foe to his holiest convictions of right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her faith by the bond of custom , or the iron chain of superstition , though the darkly devout may be among them , yet their craven faith is anything but a worthy homage to their revered mother . We approve of no wholesale charges against the Romish church . We do not believe that all her errors are so peculiar to herself as never to be seen in other communions , and there only acting out their natural tendencies to superstition and atheism . Her errors are common to human nature , though with her they are so systematically propounded , they have been so long maintained , and they are backed with so formidable a force from antiquity , from power and wealth , that the scale of their deadly influence has become fearfully grand . But of all the results of her errors , infidelity is the most appalling . We could endure the ignorance of her lower , and the profligacy of her higher classes , but that the inquiring and cultivated in-April , tellect of a people should be repelled from faith by the professed guardian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an outraged sense of right-that the conscience on which the Gospel has fixed its highest hope of success should furnish the most cogent arguments against Christianity , as personated by the church , is to us horrible . That she wrought this fearful work upon Blanco White , no man who reads his Life can for a moment doubt . She robbed him of a generous culture when a youth-she gave him , in one of the best of her religious families , the fearful gloom of superstitious fear , by which to remember his early home , rather than the cheerful restraints of a happy Christian household-she robbed his parents of the smile , the music and the nameless endearments of their daughters ' presence , and tore them away to murder them in her charnel houses-she surrounded him by infidel and licentious men , who were her mediators between God and man , and the guides and corrupters of the conscience of the community at the confessional , and then she bound him to her loathed carcass by the terror of imprisonment and death , holding him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and infidel , for ten long years of shame and wrath . At the age of 35 , she drove him from his hume and his altars , that he might be beyond her hated borders . He never forgot these lessons , branded thus in his memory . The falsehoods concerning religion which she taught , ever remained with him . Though once and again he seemed to recover from their influence , they haunted him like a gloomy visionthey formed the background to every system with which he became acquainted . He tried Protestantism in all the forms in which it was presented to him , from the imposing state of Anglo-Catholicism down to the lowest Unitarianism . But these were all projected on this dark background // of his early experience . In them all he saw bigotry and priestcraft , and was disgusted by their more numerous or fewer affinities with that abhorred system which he was first taught to call Christianity . Indeed , the opinion might with great show of reason be maintained , that in these first unnatural struggles his powers of intellect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deadly lesion which unfitted them for healthy action in respect to any question of religious faith . Certainly , whatever other systems of faith may have to answer for , in his case , and we propose to bring all to the account , Rome was the first transgressor , and is loaded with the heaviest burden of sin against the life of his soul . The story of his mental anguish and of his desolating unbelief is but a writing of heaviest charges against his most unnatural mother . The relation of the Romish system to infidelity assumes a deeper interest just now from the fact , that Rome is so earnestly commended as the only refuge from unbelief . It is worthy our notice that Mr. Brownson , in his article entitled Church against No Church , which almost frightened some of the Boston people out of their Protestantism , assumes precisely the same argument , as the only security against infidelity , which made Blanco White an infidel and an atheist , and which has made myriads like him atheists and unbelievers . But more of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Blanco White was brought in contact , was that of the church of England , which we will call the Anglican system . It is the misfortune of this system that it has no one spirit or character . A realist would deny that it had an entity of its own , and a nominalist could hardly find a name comprehensive enough to include its variety of individuality . The Anglican sys tem is just what Queen Elizabeth happened to fancy it ought to be , when she caught it in its progress from Rome to the truth , and petrified it by her imperial voice . It is truly represented by the transition strata of the geologist , which have no character of their own , but partake of the nature of those between which they lie ; it is heterogeneous and conglomerate . We shall see what it did for Blanco White . He came to England an atheist . He was thrown into the society of kind friends , in whom he admired the Christian character , and learned for the first time , that to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily , a bigot . He opened by accident Paley 's Natural Theology , and his heart was thawed from its unnatural frost . He entered a church , for the first time for years , without feelings of irritation and hostility . During the reading of a hymn of praise his heart was softened , and from that day commenced the renewal of his aspirations to his Creator . After this he read Paley 's Evidences of Christianity . The arguments were strong , but his feelings could not be rid of the inverisimilitude of the facts of sacred history , which had been spoiled forever by the wretched imitations of Rome 's fantastic pietism . By degrees , however , he rested in a fixed intellectual belief , and strove to bind his feelings to his intellect , lie conformed to the church of England , as freed from the objections which had made the Christianity of Rome offensive , and his early religious feelings returned . He remained in the church of England more than twenty years , but he found it a most uneasy home . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his doubts of the truth of the Athanasian creed , and his journal gives its witness to his painful scruples and his bitter conflicts . At another time he silences his doubts and takes refuge in some short-lived argument . // At one period he is satisfied with his home , and his spirit is drawn closely towards many of its freest and noblest spirits . At another , he is repelled by its mock sanctimonious and intolerant spirit , its shallow intellect , and the revival of the priestly and bigoted genius , which has neverceased to haunt its enclosure . At last , vexed and chafed with what he saw without and felt within , he rushed out from the church in a sudden bound of excitement . There may have been much of mental weakness in the course which he has laid so fully open to the world , there may have beea more or less of moral obliquity : we do not stay to inquire how much . Our business is with the question , how far this Anglican system may justly be blamed for not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had no theology to offer him , no masterly and powerful arguments in respect either to the origin or the nature of Christianity . Certainly the Anglican church had nothing which could meet the demands of an intellect acute and and rapid like his , and which had been conversant with too many systems to be moved by the pretension of any . To any mind , even , it has little to offer that deserves to be called Christian philosophy . The truth is , it does not believe in reasoning . Its very genius is opposed to it . It does not view Christianity as a system to be commended to the conscience by its own moral claims , backed by the authority of God . It regards it as a church system , existing in primitive purity in the three first centuries , and having reappeared to bless the world " under that bright occidental star , " the maiden Queen , in the form of the English church . This church , instead of giving a reason for the faith that is in her , solemnly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ab omnibus . " instead of training the young defenders of the faith to a thoroughgoing course of scientific theology , she gives them Paley , and Butler , and Pearson , and Burnet . Instead of rewarding her fellows , &amp;c. with deaneries and dioceses for high intellectual services in moral and theological reasoning , she measures out her honors , ( connection and patronage and such like accidental things being equal , ) by their nicety in writing Greek verse , or in digging out musty patristic lore . There is no such thing as a theological training in the English church ; nor is there such a thing as theological science as her glory and strength . It is true that when the Philistine has broken over the walls of the sanctuary , and has begun to lift the ax on the carved work thereof , she will find a Berkeley , a Butler , a Paley , a Watson , or a Campbell , to drive him out by a momentary defense , but she dreams not of making the walls forever impregnable , and her defenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what Butler and Paley have done , rather than sends out minds quickened by Butler and Paley to carry forward their arguments and widen their courses of thought . It is to her shame that with her wealth and leisure , her opportunity for training men of might , and the very superior training which she does give for some services , the English church has done so little for the science of Christian theology- What she has done , also , is far from being to the purpose . Her defenses have been rather learned and languid defenses of Christianity as an external establishment , than vigorous assertions of its high moral strength as God speaking by word and act to the human conscience . They have been rather apologies in excuse for an external faith , than the bold and convincing words of men who believed and therefore spoke . We have asked ourselves again and again , what work in the English language , and especially as the product of the // English church , could have been selected , either to confirm White in respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a strong grasp over the hard places of Christian theology . We do not deny to the Anglican theology eminent ability , and in some departments the high . est value ; but we do assert that for a mind such as his , and from the point of view where he stood , it was well nigh worthless , if indeed it were not worse than useless . The simple reason is , that the English theologian reasons as a churchman for churchmen , and not as a man to his fellow men . The illiberal and intolerant spirit of the English church was little fitted to convince or to win such a man as he . He seems to have found many friends , whose Christian worth he honored , and to whose Christian kindness his grateful heart responded . But among all these friends there seems to have been not one who understood his mind , or could meet him as a reasoner , except Whately , and Whately 's tolerance of him almost made shipwreck of his own reputation for orthodoxy . We are not insensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet dignity of the English Christian gentleman . We believe that the faith of such is strong , and based on rational grounds to his own mind , but we believe him in his best specimens , to be very incapable of reasoning with one who has not , like himself , grown up on the English soil , and who has not been trained , from infancy , in the English church . With Christian John Bull proper we have less sympathy , and should think him the most unlikely of all men to be liberal or tolerant towards a doubting inquirer , like Blanco White . He could not be liberal , because he could not understand the position of an inquirer , having never inquired himself . The very thought of inquiry would be treason to the church and to the throne . To be tolerant , would be to VOL . IV . incur the suspicion of being a whig , or a dissenter , or an evangelical . The repellance which arose from these causes was aggravated by the natural contempt for foreigners , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealousy of Englishmen which foreigners have thereby been taught to feel . He was at Oxford too for years , the very head quarters of ecclesiastical John Bullism , and it is most apparent that he was never suffered to forget that he was there speciali gratia , an dthatit became him to be humble and grateful , and especially to demean himself with all humility , as a converted Romanist . No one can read the significant record which he has left , of the treatment which he received for voting for Sir Robert Peel , without seeing that much must have occurred to call up all the antagonism of his nature . Last of all , it is not immaterial to observe , that he was a close observer of the Oxford movement from its very inception . He was at Oxford in its first beginnings-was intimate with Pusey , Newman and Froude , before the first shapings towards this tremendous result . He records in his diary in the year  --  , that Newman and Froude called on him to learn the order of the Roman Catholic Breviary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pusey have studied the Breviary very devoutly , and have mastered it most thoroughly , but we should not be surprised if , could the private history of the Tracts for the Times be known , it should appear that some of the imposing references to the Breviary which there appear , should turn out to have been caught from the lips of one who loathed to utter them . At all events we know that the tendencies in the minds of these men , which made Pusey and Newman priestly bigots , and which have since shaken the empire , were remarked early by Blanco White . He knew that this movement was // designed as a counter movement against Rationalism and unbelief . No man can read the Oxford tracts , without seeing clearly on every page , that a horror of Rationalism had much influence with their writers to rouse up a stronger church feeling , and to bring to the aid of a tottering Christianity , a deeper reverence for the priest , the sacraments and the church . How contemptible this must have seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church system , we can better imagine than describe . How impotent it must have confessed their aid to be , who had no better props and buttresses to construct than these . What a disgraceful confession , to his more than half unbelief , of the weakness of their cause itself , which must resort to these contemptible and abhorred defenses . What a revelation of the fact that the defenders of Christianity felt the utter weakness of their citadel , that they were obliged to mask it by such outworks . This is not a mere fancy of our own . It is not an inference simply , as to what we suppose would be the natural result of this exhibition . His private papers are full of the most abundant proofs , that it was this priestly spirit and its fanatical and self-conjured idolatry of forms , which more and more disgusted him with the Anglican church . The treatment which he received after he left the church could not have relieved this displeasure , or made him other than delighted to be out of its pale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White , from the light that it throws on this question of the relation of Rationalism to the Anglican and Romish systems . The grand argument against Protestantism at Rome and at Oxford is , that it leads to infidelity , and a prime element in the present church movements in England , and over the whole world , is a professed horror of Rationalism . There is no argument so decisive at Oxford as a sus picion of rationalizing in theology ; and in our own country , nothing is so significant as the cry against a man of whom the church is not worthy , that he has Rationalistic and Socinian tendencies . They point us to Germany and Massachusetts , as exhibiting the legitimate results of Protestantism . Nor is this all an argument to the ear . There are many who feel it in the heart . There are some who , in their agony to believe , have rushed to Rome from the very lowest forms of unbelief , alleging as a reason , that they must have rest somewhere . Not a few have sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to be settled for them and not by them , and rejoicing in symbols and creeds and chantings and responses , and above all in reposecontent to be deluded by the fictions of the imagination , rather than be satisfied with the sober joy of truth . There are some even in our freest communion , who look to a revival of church feeling as the grand recovering influence to a revival of faith . If the priest can be made the mediator between God and man ; if there can be an awful significance attached to his person and his acts ; if the religious edifice can he looked on as the most holy l ) lace ; if the magic power of symbols can return ; if children can be trained from childhood to keep holy the feasts and fasts , and to rejoice in their Holy Mother the church ; then shall faith drive out the demon of unbelief . Hence the effort to get faith , no matter in what ; faith must be had , whether with reason or not ; the argument is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor devil , we must make believe that there is . The argument may be made to look the other way . It is a hollow church system , with its external conformity , that has caused the infidelity of Christendom . So it has been in Catholic Europe , so in Protestant England , so in Lutheran // Germany-so even in Puritan Massachusetts . In the one instance , church feeling has shown itself in one way-in another in a different way . But whenever it interposes a medium between man and his Savior-whenever it leaves Christianity any thing else on which to rest , except the reason of the hope that is in herself , as urged by the convinced preacher and the convinced disciple , then does infidelity begin to lurk within the robes that rustle at the altar , and in the hearts of the precise worshippers in the pews . This revived church feeling is a sign too , of infidelity . It is a confession that inquiry can not be suffered , because there are weak points which may not be exposed . It exposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think you that he does not understand , when assertion is substituted for argument , declamation for logic , and sanctimonious whining for earnest conviction ? The history of the past , also , proves that a true revival of faith has always been a revival of logic , and that powerful preaching , earnest believing and heroic acting , have always been the consequences of strong reasoning and truth vindicated by her believing disciples . Let high churchmen of all sorts know well , that if they would foster infidelity , they should magnify church pretensions-if they would repel it , they must meet it like fair and honest maca . Especially let high-church Congregationalists understand this , and instead of fighting about the rights of the minister , and studying the properties and imposing effects of the rites and services of the worship , let them deal with their fellow men , as individual men who are to be convinced , and to be won , and to be saved . So much for the agency of church feeling in producing the infidelity of Blanco White . Rome no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of her cleaving curse and the curse of God . An English reviewer , speculating very profoundly about the causes of his fall , is very careful to assure his readers , that he never could have been looked upon as rooted in the Anglican enclosure . Both these churches will , no doubt , use his name as a warning against venturing to deviate from the old paths , whereas the mother and the fostermother should both of them be held sternly to account , for their unnatural treatment of their son . We would not be misunderstood on a point so serious as this . We desire not to overstate the truth . We are well aware that it is not by formal reasoning that the multitude are to be reached . We know that of the ten thousand influences that go to make up the grace and beauty and benignant charm of a Christian community , but few in number depend directly on the strength of the argument for miracles , or can be immediately traced to the ability of a treatise on depravity or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that if Christianity , as a system of truth , loses its hold on the intellect of a community-that moment its power is gone . The preacher loses his energy and nerve  --  the believer relaxes from the fervor of his prayers - domestic discipline remits its mild restraints and its hallowed scenes . It may be but here and there one who sees the weakness of the defenses of the truth or the impotency of her theologians , but the influence is felt through the moral life of the commonwealth . It is as when we are introduced to a beautiful edifice-as we wander through its splendid saloons and its spacious apartments , as we are pleased with the convenience of its arrangements , the finish of its workmanship , the matchless painting , which gives to the whole an air of such spirit and beauty , we exclaim at once , this is a house . We forget the foundation blocks , which were imbedded by laborious and scientific workmen- , // those faithful pillars that stand by day and night upholding with a tireless patience , all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which art and science have bestowed their thought and skill , and which are yet present at every angle , at every cornice throughout the vast edifice , as if there went out from them a very vital force ; but let an enemy dig from beneath these foundation blocks , or take a malicious advantage of defects in these pillars and arches , and the house no longer stands , or , if it is saved from falling , its safety and comfort are gone forever . This illustrates not inaptly , the relation of a sound philosophy and of a sound theology , to the Christianity of a community . Tried by this test , the systems we have examined are found utterly wanting , and hence have they been faithless to their high trust . The infidelity so appalling through the cultivated classes of continental Europe-the infidelity so thinly disguised in the splendid array of talent which England boasts , cries out against the Romish and the Anglican churches , for having shrunk from their appropriate duty , and for having placed in its stead a miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is not the Anglican and the Romish theology alone , which are responsible for the rationalism and infidelity of Blanco White . The scholastic theology of Protestantism has much for which to take blame to itself . Let him who doubts this assertion , read the honest record of the workings of his mind . Let Protestant theology see its defects mirrored into a ghastly image , from the agonizing sorrows of his struggling spirit . We beg our readers not to be alarmed . We do not deny the truth of its doctrines , nor the validity of many of its arguments , nor the ability and activity of its devotees , when we assert that what passes current for the popular theology , is much of it worthless , and worse than worthless , to meet the difficulties of such a mind as his . Let us give but a single illustration from the record of his experience . lie tells us that in the second study of the grounds of his faith , that is , after he had united with the church of England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inspiration of the Scriptures . " Marsh 's Michaelis was the first book which occupied my attention . I expected to find the most perfect satisfaction upon every important question . rrle inspiration of the Scriptures was a point which I had admitted upon the general grounds , which made me return to Christianity . 1'he absolute necessity of that inspiration for the maintenance of the divine origin of Christianity , had always appeared to me in the light of an axiom ; and as certainty , in respect to the doctrines in the acceptance of which I supposed saving faith to consist , could not exist unless the oracle from which they were derived was proved , beyond all doubt , to be divine , I felt quite confident that , as soon as I should consult the best Protestant writers , every ground of doubt would be removed from my mind . ' - " I remember however with the greatest vividness , the dismay which I experienced , when having attentively studied all that could be said to establish this preliminary point , I perceived the weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which makes the Bible isifaltibie , is made to rest . it could not but occur to me , that this theory ofinspiration was perfectly analogous to the theory of Roman infallibility . " " The inspiratiun of th.e whole Bible has become a kind of first principle , among English christians ; and to deny it , is , in this country , tantamount to denying Christianity . " " If God had intended to give us an inthllible rule by which to judge of things , on which our salvation depended , lie would not have put that light under a bushel . The foundation of certainty must be certam . " We have quoted quite enough for our purpose . We have neither the space nor the will to quote his extended discussion of this point , its efallacy is clear and its logic is loose , and yet from the point of ' view from which he looked , his reasoning has strength and force . Who gave him that point of view ? The current theology of his time , stating what is true enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the searching criticism of his mind , was an argument against the Bible and against Christianity . It is a false method to put the inspiration of the Scriptures first in the argument for the truth of Christianity , and to leave the mind of the inquirer to rest upon it . The truth of Christianity does in no sense depend upon the fact of inspiration , certainly not at all on the fact that this inspiration can be proved of all the books in the canon . The argument , in its binding force on the conscience , is just as good without as with this element . In proof of this we assert the fact , that more than ninety-nine out of a hundred receive Christianity , without even raising this question , and that many remain convinced of this truth , while as yet this question is unsettled . We assert also the fact , known to ourselves , that of all the acute sceptics , who have tried this false method , it has not made the slightest impression upon one of them ; while another has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michnelis , or Home 's Introduction , as the first matters to think of ! Send him rather to the Bible itself , with his conscience quickened , with a sense of guilt aroused , and his heart honest and human enough to know its wants , and he ought to be told that let the Bible come from where it may , the facts and truths which constitute Christianity are from God . Send a man to Marsh 's Michaelis , to learn from that whether Christianity is from God ! You might almost as well send a man to study an old almanac , to find out whether the sun shines in the mid heavens . We might show the same falseness of method and confusion of statement , in the methods of most of the current theology that led to the sentiment expressed above , about " certainty in respect to the doctrines , in the acceptance of which I supposed saving faith to consist . " But we forbear . Much striking illustration might be drawn from this record , in respect to other defects of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made , of the evidences and the doctrines of Christianity . But our object is not to go into a critique of this sort . What we should say may be said in a word . That theology argues for men who need no argument , and adapts itself to their state of mind ; rather than looks at the mind of the unbeliever and the doubter , first patiently learning the way in which the truth strikes them , and then thinking how to meet their difficulties and doubts . So did not Paulbut rather were his acute and powerful arguments a continued war-embrace with his antagonist . So did not the Master  --  but theologians do . Hence theology is scholastic , learned from books and schools , and of course , liable to be one generatioa too old , if not five . Hence theology is mystical ; having nothing to prove , it has gone to dreamingor it is learned , content with asking what Calvin or Edwards believed , instead of asking what is truth , and how shall we prove it now  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of admirers . Hence the arguments in theology which are no arguments , and its reasons which are no reasons . ' There are some , we suppose , who would not be pleased with such inferences as these , and who have a way of shutting off all inferences from the history of such a man as this , by calling him a neologist . To all that sort of people we have only to say that we do not write for them . We think , however , it is a truth that holds good in respect to theology , as in regard to all other matters , that the best way for a man to know himself most perfectly , is to ask his worst enemy what he can say against him , and to believe that the true things which he says , are // none the less true because he says them . We are next in order to study Blanco White as a Unitarian . What then did Unitarian Christianity accomplish for him ? Where did it find him , and where did it leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelation and in the historic truth of much of the evangelic record-it left him a denier of both . It found him a believer in prayer , rejoicing in grateful affection for the mission of Jesus to man-it left him a disbeliever that prayer was any thing but a make-believe , and as for the mission of Jesus as a fact , rejecting it with bitter contempt , and disdainful , angry words . He entered its ranks not merely nor mainly because he rejected the deity of Christ , but to find freedom there , and to be rid of the mental tyranny of priestly and articled Christianity . He was displeased with the name Unitarian , as dogmatic and sectarian . He would have preferred the appellation of unarticled Christianity , the more euphonious word , liberal , not having occurred to him . He is at first delighted with the simplicity and naturalness of their forms in worship , having never entered a dissenting chapel before . The hymns , the prayers , the sermons surpassed infinitely what he had been familiar with in the churches of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in food for the mindall of which might be true , and yet be no great praise to either . But the novelty of all this soon ceased to attract him . From the new starting point which he had gained , he soon made rapid leaps forward . He was no longer restrained by the fear of a church or a creed-he had forever renounced the notion of the saving efficacy of any doctrine-he was in a community where the largest liberty was tolerated . It is not wonderful that he made use of his new position to put himself as an antagonist to every opinion that came to him as a received opinion , and to renounce every doctrine against which there might be raised a shadow of a doubt . His record of March 17 , 1835 , may serve as an index of his mind . " I am convinced that my mind continued more or less , till this last period , under a remnant of the servile fear to some authority in matters of religion , instilled into it during my youth . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of awe-like that of a child who ventures to approach an object which has been long used for the purpose of fright . ening him-when certain convictions , which have been growing in spite of myself , compel me at length to question some privileged points . I am reading Paulus ' Leben Jesu a second time . Paulus believes disbelieves in the miraculous conception , &amp;c. ; yet as , free from the last restraints of orthodoxy , I look into the subject , I can not but perceive the internal inconsistency of that narrative with the spirit of the New Testament , &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c . Yet I felt a kind of misgiving when I was about to write in pencil in my copy of Paulus , just hinting at this view . Oh , superstition ! how deep have thy roots penetrated frito man 's soul 1 " ( Vol . II , pp. 109 , 10 , 11 . ) After this preparation , we are not surprised to see that he had advanced farther . His record of Dcc. 18 , 1836 , shows how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Strauss , Leben Jesu . My last printed works , as well as my manuscript notes , show that I have long been convinced that Christianity does not depend on the authority of books . I had lately advanced farther-I was persuaded that the account which we have of Jesus of Nazareth was made of the real events of his life , and of the Messianish expectations of a numerous Jewish religious party , which seems to have existed since the time of the Maccabees . In this manner were the Gospels compiled . // They contain an original moral and intellectual sketch of the individual Jesus , which the right moral feeling of man may recognize and fill up . This is the only historical element of Christianity . " ( Vol . II , p. 270-1 . ) And again , Feb. 2 , 1837- " I believe in , trust in , love , worship and obey one God , who reveals himself to mankind through his spirit of benevolence , justice and mercy , as it appears to us in the form of that internal voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . I am convinced that this is the essence of Christianity . Nothing in the shape of critical history , i. e. of historical certainty , founded on critical judgment , respecting written documents , can be necessarily connected with the only true religion , namely , that which is suited to the whole of mankind . " ( Vol . II , p. 278 . ) These were the opinions , in respect to historical Christianity , in which he died . We have yet to record other advances , under another head . But here it will be asked , How can it be shown that Unitarianism is responsible for these extremes of opinion ? The objector will say , We deny not that he came to these results , and that , soon after his connection with the Unitarian body ; hut the fact of the conjunction of the two in point of time , if used as an argument to any thing further , will only prove the reasoner guilty of the fallacy , cum hoc , ergo propter hoc . ' In reply , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this connection in point of time . We have not done it in respect to the Roman , the Anglican and the scholastic systems ; and we do not intend to do it in respect to the Unitarian . There are certain reasons for the tendency of Unitarianism to this result in his case , on which we rest our argument . First , there is the favorite doctrine of the indifference of religious opinions as a test of character . This lies at the very founda tion of the liberal system . It is the basis of their all-comprehending fellowship . To this Blanco White had fought his way through more than twenty years of inward struggles . When he had found this golden prize , it had cost him too much to be left unused . How did he use it ? Why , in the following argument , which , let the man who can , break asunder . Religious opinions are a matter of indifference . Are they ? Well , who would believe that God has taken the trouble to reveal matters of so little consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should know the truth , who would suppose that God would make it known ? We strike out of the Bible , then , all the positive opinions that are in it . How much have we left ? Or again , to use the argument in another shape . If a revelation is to be good for any thing , it must be plain enough to be understood . But the Unitarian says , Christians do not understand it alike . What follows ? Why , that all in the Bible about which those called Christians differ , is not revelation . What then is left ? What doctrines ? What records of fact ? What miracles ? We answer , as did Blanco White , not one . Secondly , the Unitarians with whom he became acquainted , had weakened the Bible so much ' by turning out of it the doctrines of the deity of the Messiah and of the efficacy of his death , as to leave it unable to support itself . It was no longer a reasonably consistent narrative . It is not the inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is the competency of it as any authority at all . It is the consistency of its parts . It is the authority of any of it . Every man knows , that if a witness solemnly asserts a connected statement , especially if it is made up of history , appeal , argument , &amp;c. , that you can not take the liberty to say he was mistaken here , and mistaken there , for reasons best known to // yourself , without destroying the entire worth of his testimony as authority . But this Unitarianism does with the Bible . Thirdly , the reasons which the Unitarians alleged for giving the reverence to the New Testament which they still retained , were no reasons for him . It seemed to him to be but the remains of education , the cleaving of fond affections , the remnant of superstitious fear . These ties he had too often broken at the call of truth , to regard them . He had felt their sacredness ; he had been held fast by their iron strength , and had broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Fourthly , Unitarianism had no positive system of religious philosophy , by which to state or defend its opinions . It had no fixed opinions , and no strong defense of them in well reasoned arguments . It is folly to think of holding such a mind as his , without the reasons why it should be held . No body of religionists can hold together-none can command the respect of its own members-much less can it enforce that of the strong men beyond its pale , without a strong religious philosophy , or in other words , without theology . But this Unitarianism does not possess , and Blanco White knew it . He records his deep conviction of the fact . Meanwhile he was studying a theology , which , however false in its data and partial in its field of view , was strong , logical and bold , and he went with it . Fifthly , Unitarianism was not sufficiently vigorous in its moral and religious tone , to meet his wants and to satisfy his ideal . He had a lofty ideal of martyrdom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not made itself strongly felt by a high and holy enthusiasm for any thing , except in protestations . When too he looked with eager eye , to the greener prospect across the Atlantic , where there was no church by law , no ancient fear of a priesthood and of rites hallowed by ages , and where Unitarianism was strong in wealth , in learning , in its social position and its high moral tone , he received this no very flattering testimony of its state from the very chief of its apostles , Dr. Channing . Dr. C. writes in a letter of Sept. 18th , 1839 , as follows : " How desirable amidst all these corruptions , that a nobler form of Christianity should be preached and practiced with an unaffected , all-sacrificing earnestness , zeal and force . It is not by assailing the low in practice or principle , but by inanifesting the high , that the great work of reformation is to go on . Whence shalt this force come ? I would that I could look to Unitarianism with more hope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a protest of the understanding against absurd dogmas , rather than the work of deep religious principle , and was early paralyzed by the mixture of a material philosophy , and fell too much into the hands of scholars and political reformers ; and the consequence is , a want of vitality and force , which gives us little hope of its accomplishing much under its present auspices , or in its present form . When I tell you that no sect in this country has taken less interest in the slavery question , or is more inclined to conservatism , than our body , you will judge what may be expected from it . Whence is salvation to come ? This is the question which strings up in my mind continually . " - ( Vo . 1 pp. 96 , 7 . ) The remarks with which in a subsequent letter , Channing qualified these observations , were not fitted , to say the least , to check White 's desire for progress , nor to hinder him in the direction in which he thought progress lay . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Unitarian body in this country as having partaken the common indifference in regard to slavery , and as wanting the spirit of progress . As to the last point I should have spoken with greater restraint . there are in the body individuals dissatisfied with the present , and anxious for higher manifestations of the truth and spirit of Christianity I think Unitarianism is administered among us with more zeal and earnestness , and will be more fruitful , though I expect no great reform until Christianity is rescued from errors , mists and corruptions , which have so long obscured aimd impaired it. - ( Vol . III , p. 182 . ) Last of all , Blanco White was retained in the fellowship of the Uni // tarian body , and had a strong hold upon their sympathies . We blame them not for this . We should have been bound to him by the spell of a mysterious attraction , we know . His generous and affectionate spirit , his noble allegiance to his convictions , and the dreadful sufferings through which he had passed , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So did it hold to him the Whatelys and other choice spirits of the church of England . The Unitarian body did more , as they ought to have done . It was no more than right that they should . For thus they were true to their principles and consistent in their spirit . Even Professor Norton , though he argued over with him in a series of letters , the same questions which he argued with Mr. Ripley , and though he was forced to tell him , in the mildest pos. sible way , that he was not a Christian , * seems to have relaxed from the severity with which he has borne himself towards the " infidels after the latest pattern " on this side the water . He had his own reasons for this , though what they could be is not so apparent . * Mr. Norton 's Christianity looks not so very different from Blanco White 's anti-Christianity . " For myself in regard to the Old Testament , though I believe the divine origin of the Mosaic dispensation , I regard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captivity , and the other historical books as having no more claim to be divinely inspired , than the histories of Eusebius and his successors . In the prophecies , as they are called , there are noble conceptions of religion and duty , ( considering the times when they were written ; ) but I do not believe that their authors claimed a miraculous power of predicting future events , or were supposed by their contemporaries to possess it . When we come to the New Testament , I put the highest value on the gospels , as an authentic record of the ministry of Jesus , and regard with strong interest the epistles of Paul , as exhibiting in the most striking manner the workings of a powerful and admirable mind under an all-pervading conviction of the truth of Christianity . But I ascribe the authorship of neither the gospels nor epistles to God , and can not call We know it will be pleaded in abatement of all this , that Blanco White was made a rationalist by the German studies , which he prosecuted assiduously after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and theology , it is true ; but it was because he found in them a logic and consistency which he looked for elsewhere in vain . We doubt not that his appreciation of them was just . But his journals present to us the same independence , the same self-reliance , and the same habit of reasoning , during his German studies , as before . There is not the least evidence of any influence from Germany , except the fact , that German writers took him up at the point where they began themselves , and carried him forward in precisely the same course of reasoning . Any man competent to judge may see this ; for rationalism is as truly English as it is German , in its causes and its results . It remains for us to look at White as a Rationalist , and to ask what his Rationalism was , and what it did for him . XVe have seen what he was in Dec. 1836 , and Feb. 1837-that he rejected the historic records of Christianity , and rested in the absolute religion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is of little moment to ask . We care not to discuss this question , still a questio ' vexalissima , or vexantissima rather , at what precise point of transition a man ceases to be a Unitarian and becomes a Rationalist . It is enough for us to remark , that the point just indicated was with him no point of rest ; but that he made from it a downward and a them in any sense the word of ' God . When you ask whether the essential and saving duties of a Christian are connected with and dependent on historical documents ? ' I should answer it by saying , that the being a good man , a truly religious man , may not depend upon a knowledge or belief of the historical docaments of our religion ; but that the being a Christian does . " 1846j 257 // gloomy progress . It is for us to trace that progress . The opinions of White , or rather his no-opinions , are presented in the manuscript written by him in 1840 , and published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is arranged under the following heads ,  --  Meditation and Prayer ; The Evil One ; Free Will ; Corruption of Human Nature ; Revealed Writings ; Disguised Selfishness supported by Perverted Religion ; Protestant Saving Faith ; Redemption ; Spirituality Humility ; Prayer ; Christian Morals ; Fear ; Death . It is a painful and gloomy transcript . It was written , we doubt not , with anguish and tears . We are quite certain that it can not be read without them . His positive belief affirmed little more than the being of a God . It affirmed this in the following words ; - " The guide , the light within us is not ourselves , nor dependent on our volitions . There is then , an infinite source of the rationality we know to be in us , who will receive us to himself . " " Oh thou great Being , who , from the dawn of my reason , didst reveal thyself within my heart . It is there that I obtain the nearest approach to Thee ; there alone I know Thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , not in the colored shadows of the imagination , but in the truly spiritual character of knowledge , power , will , consciousness. ** This is all that he affirms positively , and what is of more consequence , he concludes that it is all that can be aftirmed by any man . ' To attempt to define , to conceive of , or to reason about the Deity , his attributes , or his will , is to take the first step in error ; for to do this we must employ imagination upon a subject beyond its reach . To attempt to express truth in regard to him , is vain and impossible . Conceptions furnished by the imagination are the only materials of language , and if we err by aiming to think of God , much more do we err if we seek to speak of him , or if we judge that language can convey to us any knowledge . Of course the revelation of God , by human language , is impossible . It is not merely unsupported by evidence , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive and historical religions , are therefore equally impossible and equally false , and Christianity among the rest . When , too , we ask whether we shall live in a future state , though it may be demanded by the instincts of our nature that we must , yet to think of the future state under a single condition drawn from the present life , is to dishonor our reason and add error to delusion , by suffering the imagination to mislead us . Though it may be received that we are to hold a separate existence hereafter , yet to attach to that separate existence any of our present notions of personal being , is to err again , by suffering the imagination to cheat us with its notions . Prayer may be allowed , because the soul would have the sympathy of its fellow spirits and of God , but the common notion of it , as asking in order to receive , &amp;c. is to err by the influence of the fancy . Social prayer is a worse error , as it rouses distempered feelings by unauthorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Rationalist ; having faith in God revealing himself by the inspiration of reason as its one affirmation , and denying all faith beside , by proving it irrational and impossible . In this creed he died . We have condensed it into a dry and abstract statement , far other than the burning and bitter words in which it is spread out upon these melancholy pages , but we have reported it truly . We care not to copy the sad and mournful expostulations with which he approaches his God . They seem to us to sound like the wailing quest of the patriarch of Idumen- " Oh that I knew where I might find him . " We will not quote his oft repeated // assertions , that the imagination , applied to religion , is the fountain of error , the basis of all revelations , of all rites of worship , of alipriesthoods , and that it is the idolatrous indulgence of it which has led men to attribute deity to the Christ . Such was the Rationalism of Blanco White . Saying , in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specific form or mythology , for man must have some positive religion , and in the next breath , that all these forms must , of necessity , be delusions and lies . And such , in its great principles , is the philosophical anti-supernaturalism of the present age . It is man , striving to see truth with the eye of God , then confessing that the attempt is vain , then leaping forward as if to rush out of his humanity , and plant himself on the seat of the Eternal . Thus ever reaching and never grasping ; ever painting its bright and glowing pictures , and ever brushing them out as soon as done ; ever aiming to hold the truth and to hold the Godhead , by words which it knows can hold no such thing , it inflicts on its devotees those torments , fabled by the ancients , of rrantalus and Sisyphus . Its reasonings are as vague and as trustless as those vast quicksands that line the shores of England . The very reasoners distrust them themselves . Its propositions are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but self-conceited oracle . The propounder himself has no sooner uttered one than he confesses its inadequacy , by seeking to amend it ; and thus , ever stepping forward but never advancing , it excites , fatigues , bewilders , and at last maddens its devotee . This is Rationalism as a scheme of philosophy ; as an intellectual system . If a man would understand it as a religion , as a practical system , as fitted to meet man 's wants , to soothe his sorrows , and to give him peace in death , he need only read and ponder these pages . How can that system meet man 's wants , which tells him that to know any truth he must cease to be a man ; which forbids him to rejoice in a religious thought , a religious feeling , or a religious act-because for a man to think , or feel , or act religiously , still being a man , is to think and feel and act a delusion , or it may be a lie ; which would unclothe man-nay , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each several muscle , with keen but scientific torture , and make of him a skeleton , still having life enough to suffer , and tell him that he has the comfort that there is in the hard and solid bone , because he is the victim of no delusion ! How opposite is this to the comfort which God 's religion brings . This meets man 's wants ; it does not mock them . It tells man with one breath , canst thou by searching find out Godcanst thou find out the Almighty to perfection , ' to convince him of his wants ; and then places before him the brightness of the Father 's glory , and the express outline of his person . It shows him , that inasmuch as no man hath seen God at any time , therefore it is well that the only begotten of the Father hath revealed him . When , too , his intellect is weakened by sickness , and is flickering out into death , God stands by his bedside , and looks out upon him in the benignant eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and conjures up its frightful images of future evil , he bends over him in the person of the same Jesus , and whispers in his ear , thy sins are forgiven thee . ' The dying words of Blanco White , " God to me , is Jesus , and Jesus is God , " were the strong utterances of ' the human heart within him . They spoke the wants of the universal man . The conclusion with which he qualified them , " of course not in the sense of divines , " were but the homage of the theorist to his own consistency . Thus far have we followed Blan // co White , through the several systems under the influence of which he passed . We have endeavored to describe their character and their legitimate tendency . But our duty is not all done . We must also show certain capital defects in the principles of his inquiry , and the methods in which he proceeded . We attempt not to define how far he was to blame for their existence . We simply assert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , he seems to us to have entirely failed in a just conception of the kind of certainty , in regard to religious truth , which can be attained , or is to be desired . The certainty for which he sought , was absolute and irresistible . Truth , in his view , must needs stand out to the reason , with a clearness which could not be disputed , and against which no doubts could be conceived of , much less entertained . With this idea he was familiar from his childhood , in the claims of Rome to be infallible . Rome never recognizes a doubt as possible , nor an argument as demanded . Faith , assent , conviction , consent , certainty , are with her convertible terms . There is something terrible in this sundering of religion from moral feeling and the life , and making it but the blind submission to a palpable personation of Christ on earth , since it tends to foster this impression . Much of Protestant theology is fitted to fix the same impression , from the very loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogmas , and of the connection between these dog . mas and salvation by an arbitrary appointment of God , rather than by their moral import and attractive . ness-their power , through the living things which they describe , to rest and save the heart in sympathy with God . But let the cause of this impression have been what it might , it is certain that White always entertained it . Hence , when he let go of the Romish church , for a while he denied every thing , and then he caught hold of the inspiration of the Scriptures with the same grasp-rather the convulsive clenching of the muscles , than the strong holding of the hand in health . When the Scriptures failed he let go every truth in rapid succession , as possibly uncertain , except his faith in an impersonal God . In this error he was not alone . It is the error of much of the philosophy of Europe . It may be said to be the 7T***Ov *su*og , intellectually speaking , of the whole genus of the Rationalistic schemes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenced his labors , in order to set over against the scepticism of Hunie , religion established on grounds of certainty that is demonstrated to the intellect , and he ended by widening the domain of the same scepticism . He began with a view to put an end to unbelief-he ended by making unbelief necessary . The religious philosophers who have followed him , have followed on in the same course , criticising man 's religious nature and the objects of faith , with the aim of demonstrating the one to the other , and ending in putting the two farther asunder , or in proving a super . natural revelation impossible . The cause of it is twofold , as we have already hinted . It is to be found in the claims of Rome to an undisputed infallibility , and of Protestant theologians to a dogmatic certainty . The English deists , too of Brownson s argument for his present church . Such a certainty as this is not to be sought for . It is contrary to the very laws of our being as men . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this life . He that will have it in religion , rebels against the laws of his nature . He would be as a God , knowing good and evil , and is not content to be a man , // " shut up to faith . " As long as it is pursued , so long will it undermine the foundations of all faith , render uncertain the holiest truths , and madden the inquirer , whether honest or dishonest , with a wretched scepticism . Nor is this certainty to be desired . For a rest in heaven it is desirable , and there it xviii be found , but it is not desirable for this life of test , of trial , of labor and of struggle , in preparation for that reward . Demonstration renders faith impossible , excludes its merit , and robs it of its crown . Had Blanco White seen and felt this , he would have sought more xvisely , and perhaps would have found rest for his xvearied spirit . Had he but seen that faith is and ought to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its object , is and must be so presented , that it can be received or rejected , he would have been rid of one fatal and paralyzing incubus upon all his inquiries . Then would he have been prepared to ask whether Christianity , as a moral system with its great facts , is not armed with a power which should constrain the faith of every right-hearted man . Having seen this to be true , next he might have raised the question whether it was not revealed from God . This brings us to the second capital error in his inquiries . The error was this- ' If there be a revelation from God to man , it must be a revelation of absolute truth  --  or in other words , of truth as God sees it . But it is impossible for man to receive any knowledge respecting religious things , except as dressed in the imagery of human conceptions , and colored with the hues of human fancy , and intensified by the heat of human passions . Therefore there can be no revelation of truth at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , which was not the truth as it is ? Especially would he inspire man to see and receive this truth , without giving it to him and through him , pure and unsullied ? But man can not be thus inspired . There is , therefore , no inspiration . ' This is plausible in its sound , but fallacious and delusive in its sense . We freely grant that no such revelation as White contemplated is possible . We allow that all our conceptions of religious truth are human conceptions , and that therefore they are incommensurate to the reality as seen by God , and it may be as it shall be seen by the spirit of man , when disembodied . In this sense , all revelation to man must he imperfect and inadequate . But surely it does not follow from this , that those conceptions of God and eternity , which are fitted to induce right moral action , are not true , in the highest of all senses ; that they are not " the Truth . " Nor does it follow that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , of duty and of eternity , of which his nature is capable , or which it can bear ; truth to which , except as thus presented , he could never have attained , that it is not revealed trulk . Carrying the argument a step farther-it brings us at once to the conclusion , that if truth of this kind is revealed truth , then human minds can be inspired to reveal it , by having their human natures aided by the divine spirit , to the exactest and the healthiest action , and strained to their highest capacity of thought and feeling , and , if need be , by being presented with the wondrous imagery of human visions of God . If a man should tell us this is only naturalism , we should reply , that it would be exceedingly pleasant to us , to know what is supernaturalism . White has recorded in his journal , the following very striking remarks . " In this country , it may he safely affirmed , not one mind applies itself to the study of religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even those who devote some attention to logic , turn away // from it before what is unquestionably useful in the common dialectics has incorporated itself with the other stores of their mind . But there is another study still more necessary than logic , for the acquisition of sound religious knowledge , of which there is scarcely a notion among the British divines-I mean the study of the sources , limits and application of the mental faculties according to their essential nature . The absence of such acquaintance with our faculties , &amp;c. &amp;c. , this ignorance of what should be the foundation of all regular instruction , shows itself in almost every page of the theological writings which daily multiply among us . There is to me a most striking result of this ignorance of our own spiritual self , in the blind-man's-buff debate which is carried on between those who contend that we must go to the Bible if we are to have any knowledge of God , " and their opponents . " To me it is clear that if they were well acquainted with their spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their philosophical and theological studies by examining what is man , they would not have involved themselves in this unmeaning controversy A truly philosophical work on this most important point-this the foundation of true religion-is very much wanted in England . " To all this we say , aye , most heartily , and add that its importance is most signally illustrated by the writer 's own views of revealed and inspired truth . Another deficient element in his reasonings , was right views of the moral character and condition of man . We speak of this as a defect in his argument only , for here is no place , and we have no desire , to judge of its influence on the honesty of his inquiries . It is poor business when you argue with or about a man , first to pass judgment on the state of his heart . But we do assert , that the Bible contemplates man as a sinner , as morally deficient and corrupt , and that on this fact it bases the argument for its reception as a revelation from God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping this distinctly in view , is to our minds as unreasonable , as to argue for or against a system of medicine , and to begin the argument with an actual ( whether formal or implied we care not , ) presupposition that there is no such thing as disease . Now in the wh*le course of White 's reasonings , there are no manly and sober views of man as a sinner-there are no strong views of God as administering a holy government-there are no just notions of man as sinful and helpless and guilty . We wonder that a man apparently SQ honest as he , so self-suspecting , so scrupulous in the scrutiny of his own motives , should not have seen and held right views respecting this matter . The bearing of right views on this point , on the argument for revelation and for the Bible , is obvious . Such views justify and demand an inspired and supernatural interference . We may allow that on the score of intellectual and moral capacity , man does not need such an aid-that he can be inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such is his moral perverseness , that he will not be , without extraordinary , extranatural or supernatural influences . Allowing that if he were honest and pure in heart , he could not but see God , even in this life , yet the fact being true that he is not thus pure , there is need that the heart of one and of another should be made so , in order that he might commune with God , and then declare what he had seen . In order to start these men from their sensual sleep , it might be needed also that the ordinary course of nature should be broken in upon , and then , when they were to go forth to speak their visions to others , still morally corrupt , they might also need // the same enginery , in like manner , to awaken them . The fact of man 's sinful character , relieves the Bible from many strong objections . It establishes and confirms the necessity of a progressive revelation of moral and religious truth . The diseased eye can not bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength when in health . It rejects in agony of pain , the meridian beam . So with the soul diseased morally . It is offended by the Godhead revealed all at once . It can not comprehend him . Hence the necessity of the Jreaking of the morning , of the softened dawn before the day comes up , in the history of God 's revelations to man . This necessity is greatly augmented by the intellectual feebleness and degeneracy that attend moral corruption , which in turn , are again increased by the power of custom and social influences , rolling up at a geometric rate of increase , as one generation leaves to its successor its heritage of ignorance , of passion , and of shame . If such a race are to be raised at all , they must be raised by just such a discipline as that described in the Scriptures of the Old Testament ; and all the so-called objections to the Jewish ritual , and the Jewish conceptions of God , so far as authorized by supernatural messengers , vanish before this necessity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testament , which make a good argument when the character of man is not understood , are turned into confirmations of its truth and of its divine origin , when looked at with the knowledge of man 's actual wants . We need hardly say , that the want of this element in the argument for the truth of Christianity , is not confined to Blanco White . It pervades the entire circle of rationalistic philosophers , so far as we know them . We name as the last defect , the intellectual and moral habits of the man . The appreciation of the claims of the Scriptures , where these claims are searched to the profoundest depths and followed out into all the refinements of philosophical analysis , demands a superior mental structure and a just mental training . The claims of Christianity as a practical system , demand only a sense of one 's wants , and a willingness to acknowledge and apply the remedy . But it is a different thing to understand all the phi . losophical and critical difficulties that have been raised in the schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as a critic , a historian , and a philosopher , to understand and justify the Scriptures . Whatever may be a man 's learning , or acuteness , or ability to generalize , if he does not do full justice to the wants of living men , and of men as they are out of the study and beyond the precincts of the university , he can not decide the question . He wants the first , the prime condition , to pass judgment upon the relations of one truth to another . All these other qualifications are what the advocates and the testimony are to a tribunal without a judge to pass upon them . The habits of a scholar tend to deaden this intuitiv*e power of deciding - this instinctive delicacy in appreciating the force of an argument , especially when that argument turns on the wants and judgments , not of the reflecting and astute scholar , but of the unrefiecting and stupid man . The scholar too , dry as he is , is a dreamer , and his dreams are to him the most glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world of fact , they lead astray . So too he is often bewildered by the variety and amount of his knowledge , elated if not intoxicated , by the excitement of his own etherealized spirit . Then , he dwells apart , and years add strength to his habits of thought , dogmatism to his fond opinions , and // enthusiasm to his generous dreams . What wonder that the abundance of his resources , and the intellectual adroitness to control them , should have been earned at the expense of the capacity to use them in an argument that depends at last on a knowledge of man as he is , and not as he is thought to be . It is to these deficiencies that we ascribe , in very great measure , the sad perversions of rationalizing Germany . These defects are most apparent on every page of this memoir , and the training of White was fitted in every particular to produce and augment them . Let a man be made a priest at the age of 14 ; let him be imbued with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peril of his soul , as he thinks . Let him be shut up in a confessional and see man only in his depraved passions there disclosed , or his morbid self-accusings , which the confessor learns to loathe . From the same confessional let him watch the lovely eye of some fair penitent . Let her lips utter the language of love in the words of self-upbraidings before God ; and let him feel that woman 's love for him is denied forever . Let him become an unbeliever for conscience 's sake ; and after doubt and despair , let him believe again . Let him find little sympathy in his aspirations for freedom , among his English friends . Let him find himself alone in his studies ; in advance of all about him in his philosophical and theological attainments . Let him have been a recluse by training , by necessity , by foreign birth , and a foreign tongue : and such a result as occurred to White should not surprise us . We do no discredit to his mental capacity , to his very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding an argument , when we say that he lacked the prime essentials deliberately and calmly to judge on a question like this . Book-madness is no uncom mon affection in these days , we believe . In some of its forms it is very innocent and harmless . In its actual influence , if its dreams are taken for the inspirations of wisdom , it may often delude and destroy . This memoir has been to us a study , not merely because of the interest that arises from the very eventful life of this unhappy man , nor even because of the intense and agonizing sorrow which he endured , but because of its marvelous illustrations of the tendency of religious systems . It is very common , we know , for many wise and good men to raise the cry of rationalism , neology , and German studies , and to point to the sad results to which they lead , as the strong and sutlicient argument against what they deem to be dangerous error . The argument from results is good enough in its place ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sophistry , and the distinct analysis of a fallacy . To those men who have the blessed ignorance to believe that German philosophers and theologians are all mere dealers in moonshine , and weavers of arguments of film , we have nothing to say . Their self-complacency is so pleasant to themselves , that we have not the heart to interrupt it . The rationalism which is illustrated in this memoir , is abroad in this land . It has spread more widely than is known by many , and than is acknowledged by all who know its extent . Its secret influence is far more extensive . There are districts in the gay capital of continental Europe , on whose solid pavement if you strike , you will be startled at the vibrations from the caverns of death beneath . Even so it seems to us that beneath fair portions of our own land , the social and moral structure has been deeply undermined by the silent ravages of terrific unbelief . God grant that its nature and extent may never be revealed by the convulsion that shall // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface . Of Blanco White the man , in our waking hours , we have had more than one troubled dream . We dimly beheld a gloomy procession ushered into the presence of the blessed Jesus . It was the spirit of the departed , conducted by four forms , unequal in garb and bearing , personating to our view the four systems of error which had led him astray . First , Romanism , with stately mien and purple robes , and a port that at a distance seemed divine , but at a nearer view , on her face were deeply drawn the lines of human passion , and her countenance was stamped with a sensual look . Next , Anglo-catholicism , imitating the step and sxvelling with the state of her elder sister , but revealing a nature too noble for her foolish mockery of so poor an example . On the other side was Scholasticism , hard in features , and strong in her tread ; the earth shook under her step , but she was narrow in her look , and had been untrue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust which truth had committed to her care . Behind her was Rationalism , who did nothing but sneer at the mistakes of her elder sister , at her hard-favored but truth-loving features . Behind the train , there followed at a distance , with a pensive air , as it were a mourner , sad and sorrowful-she was Truth , she was Christianity . The train went forward . The clouds parted to receive them , but just as we expected to see them ushered into the presence of Him who is " the Way , the Truth , and the Life , " a cloud encompassed them , and we could see no more . There was silence for a while dreadful and still , and then it seemed that from behind sweet sounds rung out in these words of more than mortal melody , " But blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed , " and to them a response was heard as from many voices , " Whom having not seen ye love , and in whom , though now ye see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and full of glory . "
