Time of acting 2 hours 40 minutes . PREFACE . THE DRUNKARD . ' Oh , star of strength ! I see thee stand And smile upon my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am strong again . '  --  Longfellow . ' There is a tide in the affairs of men , ' &c.; Right ! worthy Willie Shakspeare , perfectly right  --  there is a tide , not only in the affairs of men , but in the casualities of the Drama also , that bears the fortunate object to success , provided the opportunity is not neglected . There could not have been a better time chosen for the production of this most successful and deserving Domestic Drama , than the season it was first performed at the Boston Museum . No unprejudiced person will attempt to deny that it was the cause of much moral good , and materially aided the Temperance movement it was meant to advocate . In the representation it was a powerful and living picture , and all that saw it , felt it , for IT WAS TRUE . No one who had not seen it would feel inclined , from the mere reading , to believe the very powerful effect produced . The action of the play being located in our own city and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the stage arrangements admirable , while the acting in some instances was not to be surpassed , and throughout each character above mediocrity , all served to aid in the triumphant success that was awarded it on its first representation . Mr. Smith 's personation of Edward , evidently the result of accurate and laborious study , and deep knowledge of human frailty , was at times terribly real , particularly the scene of delirium tremens , which , though far short of the horrors of that dreadful malady , and appeared to those unacquainted with the disease to be overstepping the bounds of nature , was true to the letter , and universally acknowledged to be the most naturally effective acting ever seen in this city . In this scene , and those depicting the distress of the family , it was no uncommon thing to see scores of men and women in the auditory weeping like children , while at the next moment their faces would radiate with smiles at the quaint humor of Bill Dowton , or the pompous peculiarities of Miss Spindle . Many inquiries have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as rumor has named a dozen or more persons , some of whom have never troubled themselves to deny their identity in regard to connexion with the subject , we give the following facts , which , if of importance to any but those immediately concerned , are simply as follows . The proprietor of the Museum , ever ready to take the tide on its flood in any matter of general interest , conceiving that a Drama might aid the cause of Temperance , and prove highly productive to his establishment , engaged a gentleman of known and appreciated literary acquirements to undertake the task . Unfortunately his production , though eminently worthy of the gentleman and scholar , was , from want of theatrical experience , merely a story in dialogue , entirely deficient in stage tact and dramatic effect . Under these circumstances , the manuscript was placed in the hands of Mr. W. H. Smith , with the request that he would finish and prepare it for the stage . That gentleman revised what was written , altering what he considered ineffective , and introduced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second act , and the entire of the third , fourth and fifth parts . No claim is laid to originality of invention in the character of Cribbs , Agnes , or any other part in the piece . The object was not so much to prepare an original , as an effective drama . The piece was produced under direction of Mr. Smith , in the winter of 1844 , and performed that season for upwards of one hundred and forty times , and is by all acknowledged to be the most successful play ever acted in Boston . Main text ACT I. SCENE 1st.  --  Interior of a pretty rural cottage . Flowers , &c.; Paintings , &c.; Every thing exhibits refined taste and elegant simplicity . Table , with Bible and arm chair , R.

Mary Wilson Dear mother . It is true , this sweet cottage is most dear to us . But we are not the proprietors of it . Old Mr. Middleton never troubled us much . Even when our rent was in arrears . But as our late worthy landlord is no more , it is generally believed , that our dear cottage will be sold . We can not censure his son for that . Mrs. W. Mrs. Wilson No ,  --  the young must be provided for , and willingly would I bow with resignation to that great power that loveth while it chasteneth ; but when I think that you , my beloved child , will be left exposed to the thousand temptations of life a penniless orphan . a knock , C.

Mrs. Wilson Many a poor person , I fear , will have reason to think so , sir . Cribbs . Lawyer Cribbs Yes , yes . You are right . Ah ! he was a good man , that Mr. Middleton . I knew him well . He placed great confidence in my advice . Mary . Mary Wilson Was he not very rich once , Mr. Cribbs ? Cribbs . Lawyer Cribbs Yes , yes : when the times were good , but bad speculations , unlucky investments , false friends ,  --  alas ! alas ! we have all our ups and downs , my dear madam ! Mrs. W. Mrs. Wilson Ah ! Mr. Cribbs , I perceive you are a man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel for the unfortunate . True , madam , it is the character I have attained , though I am not the man to boast . Have you any prospect of  --  that is  --  have you provided  --  Mary . Mary Wilson It is true then , too true , the cottage and garden will be sold ? Cribbs . Lawyer Cribbs Why ! what can the young man do , my dear ? A gay young man like him . Fond of the world , given somewhat to excess , no doubt . But pardon me , my dear Miss Mary , I would not call up a blush on the cheek of modesty . But you know , the extravagance , that is , the folly  --  Mrs. W. Mrs. Wilson All , sir . I understand you  --  very much unlike his father I would say . Cribbs . Lawyer Cribbs I place great confidence in your prudence , Mrs. Wilson . I wish the young man well , with all my heart . Heaven knows I have cause to do so , for his honored father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Mrs. Wilson Come , come , Mr. Cribbs , he is better off . It is impiety to mourn a good man 's death . His end was that of a Christian . Cribbs . Lawyer Cribbs Judge , then , of the interest which I take in the last remaining scion of that honored stock . But , Madam , Edward Middleton . He is yet young , and  --  Mrs. W. Mrs. Wilson I think he is not more than twenty . I recollect him when a lad , a bright , blue-eyed boy , with flaxen hair , tall of his age . Cribbs . Lawyer Cribbs Twenty-three last July , madam ; that is his age precisely  --  he is giddy , wild and reckless . As the good man says , " when I was a child , I thought as a child . " A pause . Cribbs looks round the room . Well , madam , business is business . I am a plain man , Mrs. Wilson , and sometimes called too blunt  --  and  --  and  --  Mary . Mary Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . Cribbs . Lawyer Cribbs Pretending feeling . No , not yet , my dear young lady ,  --  I would say it is best to be prepared , and as Edward is sudden in all his movements , and as my entreaties would never change him  --  why , if you could find a place before he moves in the matter , it might save you from much inconvenience , that 's all . Mrs. W. Mrs. Wilson You impose upon us a severe task , my dear sir . Cribbs . Lawyer Cribbs Bear up , my dear madam , bear up . If I may be so officious , I would try Boston  --  at the Intelligence Offices there , any healthy young woman , like your daughter , can obtain a profitable situation  --  think of it , think of it , my good madam . I will see you again soon , and now , Heaven bless you . Exit Cribbs C. D. &; off L. H. Mrs. W. and Mary look for a moment at each other and then embrace . Mrs. W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a good thing to have a friend in the hour of trouble . This Mr. Cribbs , appears to be a very feeling man , but before taking his advice , we would do well to make our proposed trial of this young man , Edward Middleton . You have the money in your purse ? Mary . Mary Wilson It is all here , mother . Thirty dollars . The sum which we have saved to purchase fuel for the winter . Mrs. W. Mrs. Wilson That will partially pay the rent score  --  when this young man finds we are disposed to deal fairly with him , he may relent.  --  You turn pale , Mary  --  what ails my child ? Mary . Mary Wilson Dear mother , it is nothing ; it will soon be over  --  it must be done . I fear this young man . He has been described so wild , so reckless . I feel a sad foreboding  --  Mrs. W.

He must , from family and association , at least , have the manners of a gentleman  --  and however wild a youth may be , when abroad among his associates , no gentleman ever insulted a friendless and unprotected woman . Mary . Mary Wilson You give me courage , dear mother . I should , indeed , be an unnatural child , if aside yet I am agitated ,  --  Oh , why do I tremble thus ? Puts on little village bonnet , &c.]; Mrs. W. Mrs. Wilson Kisses her . Go forth , my child  --  go , as the dove flew from the Ark of old , and if thou should'st fail in finding the Olive Branch of peace , return , and seek comfort where thou shalt surely find it ,  --  in the bosom of thy fond and widowed mother .

Yes , the widow and her child must quit the cottage  --  I 'm resolved .  --  First , for the wrongs I years ago endured from old Wilson , and secondly , it suits my own interests ; and in all cases , between myself and others , I consider the last clause as a clincher . Ha ! here comes the girl  --  I must watch closely here . Retires , L. H. Q. E. Mary enters , fearful and hesitating . Mary . Mary Wilson I have now nearly reached the old mansion house . In a few moments I shall see the young man , this dissipated collegian . Oh ! my poor mother must be deceived ! Such a man can have no pity for the children of poverty , misfortunes suppliants for shelter beneath the roof of his cottage  --  oh , my poor mother , little do you know the sufferings that  --  Ha ! a gentleman approaches .

Edward Middleton Mr. Cribbs , your most obedient , any friends of my father 's folks , always welcome . Cribbs . Lawyer Cribbs Well said , nobly said , I see your father before me , when I look on you . Edward . Edward Middleton You were inquiring for me , Mr. Cribbs ? Cribbs . Lawyer Cribbs I was . I wished to see you with regard to the cottage and lands adjoining . I have an opportunity of selling them . When last we talked on this subject  --  Edward . Edward Middleton I was then ignorant that a poor widow Mary at back C. listening. and her only daughter  --  Cribbs . Lawyer Cribbs Who are in arrears for rent  --  Edward . Edward Middleton Had lived there many years  --  that my father highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , in the present condition of the old lady  --  Cribbs . Lawyer Cribbs Which old lady has a claim upon the Alms House . Mary shudders . Edward . Edward Middleton In short , Mr. Cribbs , I can not think of depriving them of a home , dear to them as the apple of their eyes , to send them forth from the flowers which they have reared , the vines which they have trained in their course ,  --  a place endeared to them by tender domestic recollections , and past remembrances of purity and religion . Cribbs . Lawyer Cribbs Oh ! all that , and more ,  --  the fences which they have neglected ; the garden gate off the hinges ; the limbs of the old birch tree broken down for firewood ; the back windows ornamented with an old hat ,  --  Edward . Edward Middleton Cease , Mr. Cribbs ; all this has been explained ;  --  my foster-brother , William , has told me the whole story . The trees were broken down by idle school-boys , and with regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the hat of a man , can as much be said of yours , Mr. Cribbs ? Cribbs . Lawyer Cribbs You are pleased to be pleasant , to-day , sir . Good morning , Mr. Edward , good morning . Exit L. H. muttering . Edward . Edward Middleton I 'm sorry I offended the old man . After all he was the friend of the family ; though it is strange , my poor father almost always took his advice , and was invariably unfortunate when he did so . Re-enter Cribbs , L. H. Cribbs . Lawyer Cribbs Good morning again ; beg pardon , sir . I now understand you better . You are right ; the daughter  --  fine girl  --  eh ! sparkling eyes , eh ! dimples , roguish glances ! Ah , when I was young , eh , ha ! Well , never mind ; you have seen her , eh ? Edward . Edward Middleton Never ; explain yourself , Mr. Cribbs . Cribbs . Lawyer Cribbs If you have not seen her , you will , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and daughter grateful ; love-passion ; free access to the cottage at all hours  --  Edward . Edward Middleton Cribbs , do you know this girl has no father ? Cribbs . Lawyer Cribbs That 's it ; a very wild flower growing on the open health . Edward . Edward Middleton Have you forgotten that this poor girl has not a brother ? Cribbs . Lawyer Cribbs A garden without a fence , not a stake standing . You have nothing to do but to step into it . Edward . Edward Middleton Old man ! I respect your grey hairs . I knew an old man once , peace to his ashes , whose hair was as grey as yours ; but beneath that aged breast beat a heart , pure as the first throbs of childhood . He was as old as you  --  he was more aged ; his limbs tottered as yours do not ;  --  I let you go in peace . But had that old man heard you utter such foul sentence to his son : had he heard you tell me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tear from her mother 's arms the hope of her old age , he would have forgotten the winters that have dried the pith within his aged limbs , seized you by the throat , and dashed you prostrate to the earth , as too foul a carcass to walk erect and mock the name of man . Crosses to L. H. Cribbs . Lawyer Cribbs But , Mr. Middleton , sir ,  --  Edward . Edward Middleton Leave me , old man , begone ; your hot lascivious breath can not mingle with the sweet odor of these essenced wild flowers . Your raven-voice will not harmonize with the warblings of these heavenly songsters , pouring forth their praises to that Almighty power , who looks with horror on your brutal crime . Crosses R. H. , Mary rushes forward C. and kneels . Mary . Mary Wilson The blessings of the widow and fatherless be upon thee , may they accompany thy voice to Heaven 's tribunal , not to cry for vengeance , but plead for pardon on this wretched man . Cribbs . Lawyer Cribbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mistake me . I  --  I can not endure a woman 's tears . I  --  poor child ! I 'll be terribly revenged for this . Outside . Exit Cribbs L. I. E. Edward . Edward Middleton This , then , is the widow 's child , nurtured in the wilderness . She knows not the cold forms of the fashionable miscalled world . Cribbs , too , gone ; a tale of scandal ,  --  I 'll overtake the rascal , and at least give no color to his base fabrications . Crossing and going L. H. Mary . Mary Wilson R. Stay , sir , I pray you . I have an errand for you . This is part of the rent , which  --  Holding out money . Edward . Edward Middleton Nay , then , you have not overheard my discourse with the old man , who has just left us . I have told him  --  Mary . Mary Wilson That we should still remain in the cottage . Oh , sir ! is that a reason we should withhold from you these dues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a benefactor in our creditor  --  take this I entreat , ' t is but a portion of debt ;  --  but he assured , the remainder shall be paid as soon as busy , willing hands can earn it . Edward . Edward Middleton Nay , nay , dear girl , keep it as a portion of your dowry . Mary . Mary Wilson Sir ! Edward . Edward Middleton If you have overheard the dialogue , that I just held with that old man , you must know that I sometimes speak very plain . Mary . Mary Wilson Yes , sir . Apprehensively . Edward . Edward Middleton I have spoken plainly to him : shall I now speak plainly to you ? Mary . Mary Wilson Alas , sir ! It is not our fault that the fences are broken down . When my poor father lived , it was not so . But since  --  Edward . Edward Middleton When that vile old man spoke to me of your charms , I heeded him not . There are plenty of pretty girls in this section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had before heard , something more than the ordinary beauty which he described . A charm that he is incapable of appreciating . The charm of mental excellence , noble sentiment , filial piety . These are the beauties that render you conspicuous above all the maidens I have seen . These are the charms which bind captive the hearts of men . I speak plainly , for I speak honestly , and when I ask you to keep that money as a portion of your dowry , need I say into whose hands I would like to have it fall at last ? Mary . Mary Wilson Droops her head during the above . To affect  --  to affect not to understand you , sir , would be an idle return for kindness such as yours , and yet  --  Edward . Edward Middleton I sometimes walk down in the vicinity of your cottage , and  --  Mary . Mary Wilson Should I see you go by without stopping ,  --  why , then  --  Edward . Edward Middleton Then what , dear Mary ? Mary . Mary Wilson Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward . Edward Middleton Thanks ! Kisses her hand . Ah ! Little did I think when I thought of selling that dear old cottage , that it should be regarded as a casket , invaluable for the jewel it contained . Leads her off L. U. E. SCENE 3d.  --  Interior of Miss Spindle 's Dwelling House . Toilette Table . Looking Glass . Essence Bottles . All denotes vulgar wealth , devoid of elegance or taste . Miss Spindle discovered at Toilette Table . R. H. Miss S. Miss Spindle The attractions of the fair sex are synonymous . True , old Bonus is the destroyer of female charms ; but as my beautiful poet , Natty P. says , in his sublime epistle to Lucinda Octavia Pauline , " Age can not wither me , nor custom stale my infinite vacuity . " But time is money , then money is time , and we bring back , by the aid of money , the times of youth . I value my beauty at fifty dollars a year , as that is about the sum it costs me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say that my beauty is repaired in this way , year by year ; well , what then ? I have heard a gentleman say , that a pair of boots , when repaired and foxed , were better than they were when new . Why should it not be so with our charms ? Certainly , they last longer in this way . We can have red cheeks at seventy , and , thanks to the dentist , good teeth at any time of life . Woman was made for love . They suppose that my heart is unsusceptible of the tender passion . But the heart can be regulated by money , too . I buy all the affecting novels , and all the terrible romances , and read them till my heart has become soft as maiden wax , to receive the impression of that cherished image I adore . Ah ! as true as I live , there goes his foster brother , William , by the window , hem , William ! Taps at window centre . William William Dowton sings without L. H. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy led me I did wander , Sweet Caroline was all my joy , But I missed the goose and hit the gander . " Enter William Dowton , L. 1 . E. William . William Dowton Good day , Miss Spindle . Miss S. Miss Spindle You heard my rap , William ? Wm . William Dowton As much as ever , Miss Spindle . Such fingers as yours do n't make a noise like the fist of a butcher . Miss S. Miss Spindle My hand is small , William , but I did not suppose that you had noticed it . Wm . William Dowton I only noticed it by the lightness of your tap . So I supposed you must be very light fingured . Miss S. Miss Spindle Pray sit down , William , take a chair , do n't be bashful ; you 're too modest . Wm . William Dowton It 's a failing I 've got , Miss Spindle . I 'm so modest I always go to bed without a candle . Both sit centre . Miss S. Miss Spindle R. C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Wm . William Dowton L. C. Why , that 's just as you agree to with yourself . I do n't care much about it , one way or t' other . Miss S. Miss Spindle You were singing as you came in , William . I suppose you know I sometimes invoke the help of Polyhymnia . Wm . William Dowton Why , I do n't know as to the help of Polyhym-him-nina , but if you want a good help , you ca n't do better than hire Polly Striker , old Farmer Jones 's wife 's daughter , by her first husband . Miss S. Miss Spindle You do n't understand the Heathen mythology , William . Wm . William Dowton Why , I hear Parsen Roundtext talk sometimes of the poor benighted heathens ; but I am free to say , that I ca n't come any thing in regard to their conchology , as you call it . Will you have some shell barks , or chestnuts , Miss Spindle ? Miss S. Miss Spindle No , William . But this is what I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wm . William Dowton Oh , yes , Miss Spindle , long ones and short ones , like cigars . Sometimes the short ones are the best smoking , too . Miss S. Miss Spindle You mistake my meaning , William . Some are warm and susceptible of the charms of women . Wm . William Dowton Warm , oh , yes . Florida boys , and Carolina niggers , eh ? Miss S. Miss Spindle While others are cold and apparently insensible to our beauties  --  Wm . William Dowton Oh , yes . Newfoundlanders , Canada fellows , and Blue noses . Miss S. Miss Spindle Now , William , dear William , this is the confession I would confide to your generous secrecy . I have a trembling affection , and then , a warm , yet modest flame . Wm . William Dowton Trembling affection , warm flame , why , the old girl 's got the fever and ague . Miss S. Miss Spindle And how to combat with this dear , yet relentless foe . Wm . William Dowton Put your feet in warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiling hot arb tea . Cover yourself with four thick blankets , and six Canada comforters , take a good perspicacity , and you 'll be well in the morning . Miss S. Miss Spindle Sir ! Wm . William Dowton That 's old Ma'am Brown 's recipe for fever and ague , and I never yet found it fail . Miss S. Miss Spindle Fever and ague ! You mistake me , William , I have an ardent passion . Wm . William Dowton Do n't be in a passion , Miss Spindle , it 's bad for your complaint . Miss S. Miss Spindle You will not understand . I have a passion for one . Wm . William Dowton For one ! Well , it 's very lucky it 's only one . Miss S. Miss Spindle Can you not fancy who that one is ? He lives in your house . Wm . William Dowton Well , I 'm darned , Miss Spindle , it 's either me or Mr. Middleton . Miss S. Miss Spindle I never can bestow my hand without my heart , William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself they ought to be included in the same bill of sale . Miss S. Miss Spindle Ah !

Miss Spindle I have read all the Romantics of the day . I have just finished Mr. Cooper 's Trapper . Wm . William Dowton Oh ! I dare say she understands trap , but she do n't come the trapper over my foster brother this year . Miss S. Miss Spindle He understands little of the refinements of the civilized circular . I must try something else . How do you like my new green dress ? How does it become me ? Wm . William Dowton Beautiful ! It matches very well indeed , marm . Miss S.

He always tells the cook to make green tea . Miss S. Miss Spindle Well , William , how about the cottage ? When are you going to turn out those Wilsons ? Wm . William Dowton The girl will be out of that place soon , depend on that , marm . Miss S. Miss Spindle I 'm glad to hear it . I never could endure those Wilsons , and it 's a duty when one knows that respectable people like your master are injured , to speak out . I know they have n't paid their rent , and do you know that girl was seen getting into a chaise with a young man , when she ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return till nine o'clock at night , William , for I took the pains to put on my hood and cloak and look for myself  --  though it was raining awful . Wm . William Dowton That was the time you cotched the fever , the fever and ague , marm . Well , good bye . Miss S. Miss Spindle Are you going , William ? Wm . William Dowton Yes , marm . I shall be wanted to hum . You take care of your precious health , marm . Keep your feet warm , and your head cool ; your mouth shut , and your heart open , and you 'll soon have good health , good conscience , and stand well on your pins , marm . Good morning , marm .

I 'm quite sure it 's some thing about bud . Yes , I am convinced , my charms as yet are undecayed , and even when old age comes on , the charm of refined edecation , will still remain  --  as the immortal Chelsea Beach Poet has it .
