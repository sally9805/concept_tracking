txt ALEXANDER DUMAS is one of the most lively and popular writers in that new school of French 1iterature and politics , which has attained its chief triumphs since the Revolution of 1830 , though its origin may be traced a few years further back . The members of it are numerous and active , and the number and rapid succession of their publications show with what favor they are greeted by the public . In a recent number of this Journal , * we had occasion to sketch some of the characteristics of this school , when speaking particularly of the writings of George Sand . Our present subject is not equally attractive , for IDumas falls far short of Madame iDudevant in inventive genius and mastery of style . But his plays and novels show much talent , and afford very striking illustrations of the extraordinary bouleversement of taste and opinion , which is now exhibited by the reading public of France . The fertility of his pen , and the variety of subjects which he has treated , show a very ready and productive mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaping a present harvest from his popularity , rather than establishing a permanent reputation . The four ponderous octavo volumes , that lie before us , of about seven hundred pages each , printed in double columns , do not comprise the whole of his publications . Materials for a fifth volume have appeared since 1840 , and still there are no signs of weariness on the part of the author or satiety on that of his readers . He appears in various characters , and writes on the most dissimilar topics , with equal liveliness and success . Novels , tragedies in prose and rhyme , history , political essays , and books of travels come from the same pen , and the family likeness betrays their common origin . His powers of invention appear to as much advantage in history as in romance , and the scenes and personages that he describes as a traveller , are very like the off-hand creations of the playwright and novelist . France is not the only country in which literature begins to assume the aspect and undergo the mutations of trade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the printer and the bookseller , being created by the same causes , and subject to the same laws . The nature of the supply seems likely to be as strictly proportioned to the demand , as in any other commercial operation . The public appetite will not be sated with the food , which the caprice of writers and the irregular distribution of natural genius may create . It must be gratified with its peculiar delicacies , its favorite cates ; and the means of satisfying it , in one way or another , are sure to be discovered . The publisher , in the name of his customers , calls for a particular kind of authorship , just as he would bespeak a dinner at a restaurant ; and , in preparing the required article , the cooks at the desk show as much versatility and readiness as their brethren in the kitchen . The great increase of the reading public , consequent on the diffusion of education and the cheapness of paper and print , is the great cause of this extraordinary cultivation of the art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , when he ministers to the pleasures of so large a circle , who are willing to pay for the amusement and gratification , which he affords them . He no longer looks for his reward to the judgment of the judicious few , or the united voice of different countries and ages . He finds a more immediate recompense in the accounts of his bookseller and the applause of the multitude . And he is able to direct his course with a view to the attainment of this reward , and to disregard the higher motive . The mind is not so irresistibly inclined towards one pursuit or one kind of exertion , that it can not be forced out of its channel . Successive efforts by different individuals , urged on by the popular voice and eager for gain , will be sure to create the desired product , however foreign it may be to their original taste or previously acquired habits . The present literature of France seems to have grown up under influences of this character . It is not that the literary habits and preferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same persons at one period should relish the formal literature of the age of Louis the Fourteenth , and at another the extravagant Romanticism of the present day . But the changes in the constitution of society , and the improvements in the mechanical arts , have brought forward a new community of readers , whose taste differs from that of // the higher classes not more widely now , than it did a century ago , when it had not the power of manifesting itself and creating the appropriate means for its gratification . In a word , the democratic principle is now exerting as visible an influence in literature as in politics , the change being accompanied , in the beginning , with as much turmoil and as many ill effects in the one case as in the other , but destined in the end , as we may trust , to be productive of much good . A literature created for the people , if not by them , must always be characterized by greater energy and simplicity , by more excitement and a broader license , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is destined for a learned and aristocratic class . If it consist only of songs and ballads , these qualities will yet be manifested , though in a narrow sphere . But , when the progress of society has extended a certain degree of instruction to all classes , and rendered books accessible to all by cheapening their price , and when , moreover , it has lessened the weight of the authority and example of the few , removed the attachment to old established principles , and diminished the reverence for antiquity , we may expect that these characteristics will appear on a larger scale , and overpower for a time those laws of taste , which formerly enjoyed an undisputed supremacy . New sources of interest and amusement will be opened , and new fields of literary exertion entered , by men , who attach more importance to the number of their admirers , than to the basis on which the admiration rests . They will look to the quantity , and not the quality , of the praise obtained , and will measure their reputation by their substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - will represent the feelings and tastes , and be suited to the prejudices , of the multitude to whom they are addressed . France has now been in an agitated , and at short intervals a revolutionary state , for more than half a century . A people very excitable by nature have had their enthusiasm kindled to the highest degree by great and rapid changes effected in their social and political condition . The sense of their own power has been animated by brilliant successes , checkered by sudden alternations of fortune , and resulting , to the mass of the people , in bitter disappointment . Great events have passed before their eyes with the rapidity with which the scenes shift upon the stage , and the mutability of // private fortunes has outdone in real life the wonders of romance . Religion , since it lost its hold on the minds of the people , has been at times taken up and again laid aside as an implement of state , a part of the political machine . Moral restraints were swept away in the current of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime were involved in the downfall of political institutions , or their execution was forgotten in the hurry of those passing events , which absorbed the attention , as they involved the safety , of the government and the people . And these exciting changes , these convulsions in state affairs and in social life , have all occurred within a single lifetime . Many are still living who xvitnessed the opening scenes of the first revolution , who assisted in the destruction of the Bastille , and took the oath to support the constitution of 1789 . " A revolution in letters , " says Victor Hugo , " is the necessary consequence of a political revolution . " As applied to the recent history of France , the remark is certain ly true , though it will not hold , if , by a revolution , we understand a mere change in the form of government , which often occurs without any great alteration in the habits or feelings of the people . But , when the change has affected all classes and conditions in the state , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shaped by the course of political events , it is only a truism to say , that the literature of the people will also be revolutionized . It will undergo as rapid a metamorphosis , it will exhibit as strange features , as have appeared in the political aspect and condition of the country . Among the various branches of letters , prose fiction , poetry , and the drama will naturally be the first to show the influence of external events , and to appear under the most striking transformations . According as the writer 's sphere of effort lies near to life and manners , or as his work pretends to display a copy or a shadow of real events and things , or to embody personal or national feelings , so will it contain the visible impress of those great occurrences , which have been operating upon the character of the people . After such a troublous period , as the last half-century has been for France , we might well expect that the imaginative and fanciful department of her literature would display more license , energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fictions would he conceived , more fantastic poetry be // written , and a struggle of wilder passions be exhibited on the stage . It was impossible , that the old principles of taste , the stiff laws of a rather pedantic school of criticism , should any longer retain their supremacy . They were swept away with as much hurry and enthusiasm , as the National Assembly showed when they abrogated the remains of the Feudal system . In both these cases , a temporary anarchy succeeds . The nation was so eager to do away with the old law , that it is content for a time to remain without any substitute for it , - to be guided only by passion and impulse . When the novelty of such a state of things has ceased to charm , and its practical inconveniences begin to be felt , an attempt will he made to erect a new system , and once more to draw order and method out of chaos . French Romanticism is too violent and convulsive in its character to show much promise of long life or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be followed by a severe chill . We have already hinted that Alexander IDumas , though at times a pleasing , and even a brilliant writer , and certainly a very acceptable one to his countrymen , is not the ablest or the most distinguished representative of the new school of prose fiction and the drama in France . He is too much of a hack author , adapting his works with great readiness and skill to the popular taste , but leaving upon them no strong and distinct image of his individual character . He is much inferior to Victor Hugo in invention , variety , picturesque description , and all the higher attributes of a poet and a dramatist ; and to George Sand in the intense conception of passion and in eloquence of style . But he is very lively and graphic in manner , is often successful in the exhibition of character , and shows himself a thorough student of effect . His great aim apparently is to startle the reader , and his contrivances for this end are frequently happy , though sometimes they flash in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deeper passions , or of keeping up a strong emotion , while the effort to do so is very apparent . The influence of his dramatic experience is quite visible , even when he is occupied with prose fiction , history , or the medley which he calls travels ; he is continually making points , that remind one strongly of the clap-traps of a third-rate tragedian . His figures are bold , and sometimes magnificent ; but they are often marred by bad taste , and not unfrequently sink into bathes. // The secret of his popularity is found in his spirited narration , in his heaping together incidents of a striking but very improbable character , and in his free use of the wildest speculations and the most atrocio*is sentiments , which a lively fancy and a had heart can devise . To say that he is perfectly lawless and unprincipled in all that relates to art , propriety , or morals , is only to remind one of the school to which he belongs . In these respects , he is neither better nor worse than Balzac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His favorite characters are jailbirds and cut-throats , who sometimes affect to disguise their villany with a parade of sentiment , and , at others , brazen the matter out with a disgusting brutality ; and his incidents are drawn from the darkest annals of crime . No regard is paid to poetical justice , nor is any respect shown for the sympathies of the reader , as they are drawn out by the course of events ; but the action is carried on with a view only to excite and astonish , and all minor considerations are sacrificed to the desire of weaving a fearful and absorbing tale . Poverty of invention is betrayed by a frequent recourse to history for some wild scene or striking event , though the truth is then so disguised and mixed up with fictitious and extravagant adjuncts , that the reader feels mocked with the presence of familiar names in connexion with incidents which are no longer recognised . We can easily imagine what passages such a writer would be likely to glean from the historian . The foul deeds of the Borgias , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of some of the profligate monarchs of France , the most fearful incidents of the Reign of Terror , - in short , whatever page in the annals of history is spotted with blood or stained with crime , has furnished Dumas with materials , which he has turned to account by exaggerating the horrors , and inventing minor incidents to increase the probability , of the tale . Though our author sometimes inveighs against existing institutions and the customs of society , we can not find that he has any particular grievance to avenge , or any favorite theory to inculcate . The invective does not come from the heart , nor are the writer 's peculiar views urged with that sincerity and warmth , which belong to the passionate pleadings of George Sand and other theorists and innovators . He has evidently not been led astray by fantastic speculations , // 1843.1 His Early Life . and , provided his books sell , he probably cares little whether the public adopt or reject his opinions . In politics , he occasionally manifests more earnestness , for he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect there is a prudent reference to the wishes and prejudices of that part of the community , to whom his books are chiefly addressed , and no deeply grounded personal conviction . He seems to be more intent upon pleasing his readers , than upon altering the form of government . The indifference thus manifested rather aggravates his crime in setting forth pernicious doctrines and immoral sentiments ; for one can pardon much error and extravagance , when the views set forth are honestly entertained and warmly defended . We have no doubt , for instance , that Madame iDudevant has really quarrelled with the laws of society , which she attacks , and that she espouses the wrong with something of a martyr 's spirit . Dumas has a more cool and calculating temperament , and , if he were not a needy writer , he would probably be a peaceful subject . Our author is of honorable , though not of wealthy , parentage . His father , Alexandre Dumas , obtained the rank of general in Napoleon 's army , and served with some distinction in Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , at twenty years of age , with a very imperfect education , came with his widowed mother to Paris , in the hope of obtaining some small post under government , the income of which would support them both . He gives a lively sketch of his reception by some of his father 's old companions in arms , who were rich and powerful , but not much inclined to notice or assist the son of their former comrade . Only General Verdier and General Foy received him with interest and kindness , but unluckily they were both nearly as poor as himself . At last , through the intervention of the latter , he obtained an humble clerkship , with a salary of three hundred dollars a year , in the household of the present King , who was then only Duke of Orleans . This appeared a fortune to his mother and himself , and he immediately settled down in quiet at Paris , being employed at the office during a great part of the day and evening , and devoting his nights to study , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the confinement of such an office , and the insufficiency of his salary , pressed severely upon an ardent temperament ; and his independent conduct , according to his own // account , deprived him of the favor of his superiors . Urged by these circumstances , he turned his thoughts towards writing for the stage , which has long been the most lucrative department of literary exertion in France , since the law secures to the author a large share of the profits from the representation of his pieces . " Christine , " a tragedy , or rather a drama , in verse , was his first effort , and it ' is still the most pleasing , and the least exceptionable of his performances . The play was accepted by the directors of the theatre , but some delay occurred in preparing it for the stage , and Pumas meanwhile wrote another , " Henry the Third and his Court , " which was first represented , and had great success . The time occupied in attending the rehearsals caused him to neglect somewhat the duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must choose between the theatre and his post , he immediately resigned the latter . These events took place in 1829 , and since that year IDumas has been an author by profession , the number of his publications evincing his industry and the fertility of his talent . His writings for the stage may be divided into two classes , the first including four tragedies in verse , " Christine , " " The Alchymist , " " Charles the Seventh , " and " Caligula , " which in form , though not in substance , follow the classical models of Corneille and Racine . In two of them the unities are strictly preserved , and in all , the fetters of rhyme operating as a happy restraint on the extravagance of his conceptions , the more offensive peculiarities of the Romantic school are scarcely visible . The second class comprises " Antony , " Richard Darlington , ' ' Teresa , ' ' Catherine Howard , ** and several other dramas in prose , which are most characteristic of the man , and of the school to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kean " and " Don Juan de Marana , - . a bad copy and continuation of a bad original , - are as contemptible in point of execution , as they are exerrable in design . The others show much talent , though polluted to the last degree by immorality , extravagance , and bad taste . They contain powerfully written scenes , affording admirable scope for the abilities of the performers , and have , consequently , been very successful upon the stage . The further representation of " Antony " was prohibited by the government , after it had been played for eighty successive nights ; and some other interferences of this sort , proba // bly , first kindled the republican zeal of the offended dramatist . " La Tour de Nesle , " also , had a great run upon the stage ; but it has subsequently appeared , that this play , although represented and printed as the production of Dumas , was actually written by another person , who has made good his title to the profits in a court of law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Dumas retouched and modelled the raw material ; and the honor of originating such an extravagant picture of impurity and crime may be fairly divided between the two claimants . As a specimen of the bold and striking style of Dumas , and to show with what vigor he conceives a subject , and how clear are his ideas of effect , we translate a portion of the preface to his " Caligula . " Some of the expressions may appear offensive , if not impious , but we have softened , rather than exaggerated , the audacity of the original . " Five years have elapsed since I conceived the plan of this tragedy ; and , during that time , not a day has passed but I have labored upon it . It was not designed to be a work of sentiment , like Antony , ' nor an improvised drama , like the Tower of Nesle , ' nor yet , like Angela , ' a picture of manners . The period , which it was to present , was obscurely known , or , what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a period , which , when we have arrived at a certain age , we look back upon only through the wearisome recollections of our college studies , and which it was necessary to build up again on the movable ground of the theatre , within the narrow limits of the stage , and according to the severe architecture of the unities . " Add to this , that antiquity , as it is displayed in the tragedies of Voltaire 's school , had fallen into such utter discredit , the sense of wearisomeness , with which it affected us , had become proverbial . It was not any thing new that I was about to attempt ; it was rather a restoration . " Therefore , when once resolved to undertake the work , I grudged no labor for its accomplishment . The imperfect reminiscences of college studies were effaced ; the reading of the Latin authors appeared insufficient . I went to Italy , in order to see Rome ; for , not being able to study the body , I wished at least to visit the tomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Seven Hills , visiting the Vatican by day , and the Coliseum by night . But after I had reconstructed the whole in my imagination , from the Mamertine // Prisons , even to the Baths of Titus , I perceived , that I had seen only one face of the ancient Janus , - that grave and austere countenance , which had appeared to Corneille and Racine , and from its lips of bronze had dictated the Horatii ' of the one , and the Britannicus ' of the other . " It was Naples , the beautiful Greek slave , which was to present to me the second face , hidden under the lava of Herculaneurn and the ashes of Pompeii ; - a face as sweet as an elegy of Tibullus , laughing as an ode of Horace , and mocking like a satire by Petronius . I descended into the excavations under Resina ; I established myself in the house of the Faun ; during eight days I waked and slept in a Roman habitation , - in actual contact with antiquity ; - not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us , - grand , poetical , and almost divine ; but antiquity familiar , material , and domestic , as it is revealed to us by Propertius , Martial , and Suetonius . Then the nation that wore the toga began to come down to me from its pedestal , to assume a palpable form , to exhibit a living countenance . I peopled these empty houses with their lost inhabitants , from the palace of the patrician down to the shop of the oilmerchant ; and all the steps of that immense ladder , which reached from the emperor even to the slave , appeared to me in a dream like that of Jacob , covered with beings like ourselves , who were ascending and descending . This was not all . I went to them , I opened the tunic , I raised the cloak , I put aside the toga , and everywhere I found the man described by Homer and Diogenes , by Dante and by Swift , - with the stature of a dwarf , and the passions of a giant . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass to the knowledge of things . I endeavoured to form an intelligible account of those times , of which we have a history , but no explanation . I looked at the frantic emperors , and the enslaved people , - a hundred and sixty millions of men , victims of the cunning of a tiger , or the ferocity of a lion . I sought out a motive for these monstrous crimes , and for this unbounded patience ; and I discovered one , by substituting faith for philosophy , and contemplating the Pagan world from a Christian point of view . " At this epoch , Rome was not only the capital of the empire , but also the centre of the world . It resounded so loudly over the face of the earth , that not even a murmur could be heard from the other cities . Its houses covered the whole space from Tivoli to Ostia , from Ponte Molle to Albano . In this immense hive hummed , like bees , five millions of inhabitants , or about six times the population of Paris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent garden , which reached from Vesuvius to // Mount Gendvre ; a voluptuous gyna*ceum , called Bake , a splendid villa , denominated Naples , and two immense granaries , Sicily and Egypt , always full of corn and maize . Moreover , either by stratagem or conquest , it had inherited the treasures of Babylon and Tyre , its ancestors , the commerce of Carthage and Alexandria , its rivals , and the learning of Athens , its instructress . " From this centralization of men , wealth , and learning , there had resulted a strange mixture of manners , a frantic luxury , a corruption like that of Sodom . The Roman colossus , powerful as it was in appearance , experienced at times sudden shocks , quakings of the earth , and mysterious agitations . The earth was like a woman near the end of her travail ; she felt the movements of her offspring , - the unknown progeny foretold by the salutation of the angels , and awaited by faith . The ancient world was opening in fissures from old age ; a cleft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to the west ; the universe was in a state of torpor , like that of a serpent changing its skin . A mortal shudder ran through this society , which tried to overcome the presentiment by its orgies , and , with a hand hot with revelling , i*ndeavoured to wipe out with wine and blood , the fatal words traced by the finger of the angel on the reeking walls of its festivities . At last , Rome could no longer have trust either in earth or heaven ; it was between a volcano and a tempest ; it had the full catacombs under its feet , and over its head an empty Olympus . " It was because it had just been chosen for the designs of the Almighty ; - because , a predestined city , from a rock , it was to become a pharos ; - because this immense crucible , wherein the human race was transformed by heat , was at the same time a gigantic mould , from which was to come forth a new world . As human revolutions , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by human means , God willed to assault this fortress of iniquity , both at the summit and at the base ; he sent madness upon the emperors , and faith to the enslaved . Behold , therefore , these C*esars , from Tiberius even to Julian , when they have hardly attained the height which they call empire , how they are seized with a sudden vertigo , with wild insanity , with incredible blindness ! See how their bloody rage foolishly destroys every thing , which might serve for their support , by striking at both the knights and the patricians , those natural props of every monarchy ! See how the doomed nobility destroys itself , and , at a word , a gesture , as the command of its tyrant , holds out the throat , opens the veins , or perishes by famine ! It is a thirst for death , a mania for // annihilation ; and Rome has not a palace , that does not send forth death-rattles , cries , and groans . " Now cast your eyes on the other extremity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of executioners armed with the axe , see old men bearing the cross and the Gospel ; in place of a hand digging up the earth , a finger which points to heaven . " Thus the anger of God descended upon the great , and his mercy was extended over the humble . These two messengers of the Almighty went to meet each other , the one coming down from the emperor to the people , the other ascending from the people to the emperor . They came together in the middle ranks of society , each having accomplished its work . From that time , there was a Pope instead of a C*esar , martyrs in the place of gladiators , Christians and no more slaves . A second Genesis was accomplished ; to the light of the eyes succeeded that of the soul . God had made a new world out of the wrecks of the ancient universe . " When I had arrived at this point of view , one may imagine what poetical and sublime materials were offered to my mind by this struggle between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to select from these three ages of transformation , nn epoch proper for the developement of my plan . The close of the reign of the successor of Tiberius appeared to me the best fitted for my theory respecting the action of Providence . Of the three types which I needed , history offered me two , and my imagination had long before conceived the third . These three were Messalina , Caligula , and Stella . " - Vol. ii . p. 659 . Dumas had not the power to execute the plan which he has here sketched with so much strength and clearness , though in a distorted and galvanized style . The topic is a magnificent one , but we question whether it is a tractable theme for the poet , and it certainly can not be compressed within the narrower limits prescribed to the dramatist . " Caligula " contains some striking scenes , the action is carried on with much spirit , and the diction , though occasionally roughhewn , is often rich and impressive . But far from embodying the poet 's whole idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preface , that he had such a lofty end in view , or that he designed any thing more than to represent with theatrical effect the frightful crimes and terrible death of the worst of the Roman emperors . The characters in general are feebly drawn , especially Stella , who was designed to be the impersonation of Christian faith and the martyr spirit . // Her belief , indeed , is only an accident in the story , dignifying her character , but in no wise affecting the course of events nor the termination of the tragedy . She is represented as the daughter of Caligula 's nurse , and the action turns on her becoming the victim of the emperor 's brutality , and being avenged by her mother and her betrothed . If she had been a pagan , the action might have led to the same issue ; and , though increased interest might attach to her , in the present case , from the higher belief and noble sentiments which she professes , this is precisely the advantage which our poet is incapable of using . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and excellence , and the attempt to accomplish such an end produces nothing but mawkish sentiment , or extravagance and bathos . But he is quite at home in delineating such a monster as Caligula , to whom history attributes as much ferocity and madness as iDumas is fond of representing in his fictitious heroes . The most natural and striking personage in the tragedy , or rather in the prologue to it , in which alone be appears , is Lepidus , a dissipated and reckless young patrician , but with some traces of high feeling , who , having been denounced to the emperor for using seditious language , opens his own veins in the bath , in order to escape a more ignominious death . The quickness and composure , with which the young trifler , when apprized of his danger , conceives his plan of forestalling the executioner , and goes jesting to his death , are brought out with great effect . The union of strength and crime , the junction of a powerful intellect with violent passions and a bad heart , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plays and in his prose fictions . With his usual exaggeration , lie carries the first element so far that it appears superhuman , and be gives a degree of atrocity to the other , which augments the horror , as much as it lessens the credibility , of the tale . Alfred d'Alvimar , Richard IDarlington , Marguerite , Antony , and Don Juan de Marana are all personations of unmitigated xvickedness coupled with extraordinary power , and the course of events usually brings about the triumph of these demons , instead of their defeat and punishment . Dumas professes great admiration for Shakspeare , and seems to imagine that in this respect , as in many others , he is only following in the steps of the great dramatist . He forgets , von . LvI. - No. 118. 16 // that the " mighty master " always qualifies guilt with some marks of compunction or some touches of natural feeling ; or he shows the magnitude of the temptation together with the atrocity of the crime , and paints the struggle of conflicting desires which is thus occasioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a foil to virtue , and appears only in a subordinate part . lago is perhaps the only character of unmixed and gratuitous evil in the whole Shakspearian gallery , and be was necessary , as a part of the ground on which Desdemona appears more silvery white and pure by the contrast , and as a means of preserving the beholder 's sympathies for the noble Moor , when stimulated to foul injustice by the other 's devices . It may be observed , also , that the character of lago is the most unnatural one in the play , as appears by the anxiety of the reader to detect some other motives for his conduct , besides the insignificant pretexts which he assigns . We can not accept at once and on trust such a union of a powerful mind and a black heart , and we search eagerly for some key to the enigma , - some cause or palliation of the crime . It is scarcely necessary to say , that Macbeth , Shylock , King John , and even Richard the Third have enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our esteem . Not so with the villains that our French dramatist is delighted to portray . He seeks only to startle the reader by the magnitude and gratuitous character of the crime , or by the atrocious motives which even heighten its guilt . And the effect is , when the interest is most absorbing , that we detest most heartily the writer and the book . Before quitting " Caligula , " we must cite a short passage , which shows either the extraordinary inaptitude of the French language for a certain class of subjects , or how dangerous it is for such writers as IDumas to venture upon Scriptural ground . In giving an account of her conversion , Stella narrates the story of Lazarus , as it was told to her by an eyewitness of his resurrection . It would be difficult to match the last verse as a specimen of bathos . " Madeleine en pleurant tendit au ciel les bras ! Mais le Sauveur lul dit , Femme ne pleure pas . Et marchant aussit6t vers le s*puIchre avare Oiii pour l ' *ternit* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peuple immobile d'effroi , Dit , *tendant la main ; Lazare , hive-toi ! // A peine retenti cette voix tut*1aire , Q uc , brisant de son front le marbre tumulaire , Lazare , ob*issant au cri qui l'appela , Se dressa dans sa tombe , en disant , ME VoILA ! " " Catherine Howard " is neither the most powerful nor the most absurd of our author 's dramas , but it may be cited as a sample of his method of constructing a plot , and of his use of historical materials . Etbelwood , Duke of Dierham , is secretly married to Catherine Howard , who is of an ignoble family , and whom he retains in concealment near London , from his fear of the brutal passions of Henry the Eighth . She is accidentally seen by Fleming , the astrologer of the king , who is struck with her beauty , and , being ignorant that she is a married woman , proposes her as a wife to the monarch , after the dissolution of his match with Anne of Cleves . Henry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking to her , immediately accepts the proposal , and orders Ethelwood to bring up the beautiful damsel to court , and introduce her into the train of the princess Margaret , the king 's sister . The husband , not daring to reveal the truth , applies to Fleming for advice , and obtains from him a draught , that will bring on the appearance of death for several days , but , at the end of this time , the patient will awake to life again . This potion being administered to Catherine , her apparent death follows , and she is placed in the burial vault , which is visited first by Ethelwood and then by Henry , who comes to mourn over her , and even places a nuptial ring on the finger of the seeming corpse ; a sentimental act , of which one would hardly suspect the burly monarch . After the king has withdrawn , Catherine revives , and her husband explains to her what has passed , even to the circumstance of the ring , and then hurries her away in secret to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Duke of IDierham are not ended . The king visits him in the castle , where Catherine is concealed , and says that the princess Margaret has conceived an affection for him , and offers him her hand in marriage and the regency of the kingdom , while Henry himself is to be absent on an expedition against Scotland . Ethelwood wishes to refuse these proffers , and the king leaves him , menacing him with death and the confiscation of his estates . To // escape this danger , the unhappy husband resolves upon the use of the same means by which he had saved his wife . He drinks the remainder of Fleming 's potion , and gives to Catherine two keys of the funeral vault , one of which , after his apparent death , is to be handed to the king , in conformity with the custom on the burial of an English nobleman , and with the other she is to open the tomb at the proper time , when the two can escape together , with a portion of his wealth , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the monarch , and the prospect of becoming queen of England , and she resolves , after a short struggle with herself , to leave her husband to perish in the vault . She seeks the presence of Henry , informs him that she had accidentally been buried alive , and had escaped , shows him the royal ring upon her finger , and , when the enraptured monarch offers at once to marry her , she secretly throws the key which she had received from Ethelwood into the Thames . The marriage takes place , but a singular chance saves the life of her first husband , and places the means of vengeance iii his power . The princess Margaret obtains the other key , which had been delivered to the king , and , going to the vault to mourn over the object of her affections , finds him alive and brings him to the palace , where he remains concealed in her apartment . Remorse pursues Catherine after her elevation to the throne , and a few days afterwards she is terrified by the appearance of Ethelwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had attempted , and announces that her punishment is at hand . Henry returns while they are still together , and though Catherine bars the door against him , the duke persists in remaining there till the king has heard his voice in conversation , and then retires , leaving his cap on the sofa . The monarch bursts open the door , finds the cap , which confirms the suspicion excited by hearing a many s voice in the chamber , and goes away , menacing the queen with the fate of Anne Boleyn . The trial of Catherine before the Peers now follows , and she is found guilty of adultery and treason , and condemned to death . But the young earl of Sussex demands the trial by combat in her favor , and generously offers himself as her champion . Proclamation being made to find a champion for the king , Ethelwood presents himself disguised in black armour , without announcing his name , and vanquishes Sussex . // The queen is now deprived of her last hope , and is visited in the Tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the execution of his office . She suddenly conceives the design of bribing him to leave the kingdom , thinking that a delay of some days must occur before a substitute could be found , and that meanwhile the king might incline to mercy . The man yields to the offer of a diamond ring , and , when the hour arrives , no executioner is to be found , and Catherine is again excited by the hope of escape . But the herald offers a large reward for any one who will undertake the hateful office , and , a man in a mask presenting himself , the execution at last takes place . After the blow is struck , iEthelwood pulls off the mask and exclaims , - " I have stricken the guilty ; behold her accomplice ! * Comment is unnecessary on this extraordinary mixture of history and fable , and the absurdity of every part of the story . But putting aside the extravagant improbability of the plot , it certainly offers a wide field for the actor 's powers in the rapid changes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended , and the conflict of opposing passions , to which Catherine and Ethelwood are subject . It is difficult to select a scene which shall be a fair specimen of the execution of the work ; but our readers may form some ideas of it from a translation of Ethelwood 's soliloquy on his first visit to the burial vault , before his wife has recovered from the trance . " Etheiwood . Yes , Fleming has strictly kept his word . Her sleep is indeed the twin brother of death , and , if it were not my work , my own eyes would be deceived by the resemblance . How fragile is human existence ! A few drops extracted from certain plants are enough to interrupt it ; a few more would destroy it entirely , and the soul which once sparkled in these eyes that are now closed , which once animated the voice that is now mute , which gave life and thought to the body that is now motionless and cold , would depart for ever , and mount upwards to the source of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is more than sleep , and less than death ? Does it fly to the realm of dreams , does it sleep like a sacred lamp shut up in the tabernacle ? Is it gone to knock at the gate of that unknown world , which is called eternity ? And when the blood shall begin again to circulate in the veins , when the thought shall return to animate the understanding , and this soul , exiled for a // time , shall again enter into the body , like a queen into her palace , will it have recollection of the objects of this world , or of the things of heaven , which it will have seen during these two days ? Oh , I can conceive that the assassin should feel no remorse at the sight of his victim , for if this inanimate body is not happy , it is at least very tranquil ! 0 , Catherine , would it not be better that I should lie down beside thee in this tomb , and let the vault he sealed up over our heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arms even till the day of the final awakening , than to intrust our lives again to the hazards of the world and the vicissitudes of fortune ? For there is no certain future but that of the tomb , and why should we wait for this , when we can so easily go to meet it ? ( Kissing her forehead. ) 0 , God ! she moved , I think ! My voice reached her soul , even in the depths of her slumber . Catherine ! Catherine ! come to thyself ! Think no more of death ! Life - life - with thee , happy or miserable , in joy or in despair ! 0 , my God , send life ! ( Turning towards the door of the tomb , which is opening . ) Unhappy chance ! Who comes here ? Imprudent wretch that I am , why did I not close this door behind the last person that went out ? ( Going to the door , and then recoiling in frar . ) The king , - the king here ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Ye powers of darkness , let your iron slumber weigh heavily upon her eyes , and , rather than they should open now , let them never open again " - Vol. ii . p. 517 . The incident , on which the plot of " Charles the Seventh " turns , is far more natural and striking than the extravagances which we have just cited , and the play is executed with more finish and in better taste . It presents rather a vivid sketch of some peculiarities of the Feudal system , as exhibited in their influence on social life , and of the distracted state of France at the time when that system was rapidly crumbling to pieces , and the monarchy was gradually becoming consolidated in the hands of the king . It is hardly possible to give an idea of the piece in our limited space , as there is very little unity of action in it , notwithstanding the boast of the author in the preface , that in this instance he had rigidly observed the classical forms . The chief interest attends the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom the Count de Savoisy had brought home on his return from a warlike expedition to the East , undertaken by command of the Pope , in order to expiate an involuntary sacrilege . To bori ; ow the pedantic style , in which our author // speaks of his art , the several characters are presented rather as types of things , than as individuals . Yaqoub represents the slavery of the East , Rayniond the servitude of the West , the Count himself pictures forth the Feudal system , and the monarchy , of course , appears in the person of the King . The moral idea , - for Dumas fancies that the play contains one , - is , that nature has organized every individual in harmony with the place where he was born , and where he ought to live and die . To transplant him is to do more or less violence to his original constitution . The principles of good , which , in his natural climate , and on his maternal earth , might ripen into fruit , are turned to evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air which offends his lungs , the sun which scorches him , or the earth which wounds his feet , his hatred turns upon men , on whom he can always wreak his vengeance . This " moral idea* ' is rather a striking one ; the only difficulty is , that it is not true , - that it is contradicted by history and daily experience . Man is neither a polar bear , that can live only on the ice , nor a palm tree , that will grow only within the tropics . Early habits may make a change of country irksome for a time , and to an ardent temperament the new locality may produce serious evil ; and this fact is enough for our author 's present purpose . But human nature is especially distinguished from that of the brutes by its great power of adaptation to the most dissimilar circumstances . Yaqoub is irritated by the insults to which he is exposed as a captive and an unbeliever , and not merely by the change of air and the novel circumstances with which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called out as readily by the affection which he conceives for B*reng&amp;re , the noble lady of a Frank , as it would have been by a passion for a daughter of the desert . If he had visited the country as a conqueror , instead of a slave , he would have found the soil as genial and the new home as pleasant , as that of Spain appeared to his Arab ancestors , who wrested it from the Coths . The contrasts that are presented by the characters grouped around him , and the scenes in which they are called to act , certainly present a fine scope for the powers of the dramatist , and , though the execution falls short of the design , the whole play is one of the most pleasing and effective of our author 's performances . // We have purposely selected for particular comment the least exceptionable of the dramas of Dumas , since a full notice of the others would only create weariness and disgust . In " Antony , " " Richard iDarlington , " and " Angela , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have noticed ; the plot turns generally upon adultery , murder , or incest , and the personages are worthy of the atrocious sentiments which they are made to express . As the writer has shown himself capable of better things , as he does not appear , like some of his contemporaries , to be a sincere and devoted advocate of anti-social theories and licentious speculations , we must attribute these lamentable perversions of talent rather to the taste of the audiences for whom he labors , than to the natural obliquity of his own disposition . The latest of his writings for the stage , " Mademoiselle de Belle Isle , " is one of his most ingenious and successful efforts ; and , though marked with some of his characteristic faults , the plot is interesting , and it is carried out with much art and finish of execution . Those who have had the good fortune to witness its representation by such admirable performers as Lockroy , Firmin , and Mademoiselle 1Jars , though the last , at the full age of sixty-five , had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will not readily forget the impressive and delightful exhibition . The play continues a favorite on the Parisian stage , though she who contributed so largely to its first success , has at last heeded the whispers of her friends , and retired from the scene , of which , for nearly half a century , she was so distinguished an ornament . Pumas having acquired his popularity chiefly as a playwright , we have considered his dramas at some length ; and it is necessary to pass very quickly over his other writings . These are very miscellaneous in character , and certainly show a ready and versatile mind . The most considerable in dimensions and importance are the " Impressions of Travel , " a medley of fancies , tales , and sketches , a large portion of which have but a slender connexion with a journey and residence of the author for a few months in Switzerland ; and " Fifteen days at Sinai , " a work which has rather better founded pretensions than the other to be called a book of travels , though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookmaker are very apparent in these // volumes , which are swelled to their present size for no other object that we can perceive , except to increase the profits of the author and publisher . Even as they are , from the liveliness of the style and the great variety of matter , they furnish very pleasant , though certainly very light reading . iDumas has a good deal of the talent so happily displayed by our own Willis and Stephens , in infusing spirit into the observations and sketches which are expected from the professed traveller , and in giving a lively narrative of personal adventure . The following is a translation of the Introduction to the book , which explains the motives of the expedition . " Every traveller thinks he is bound to inform his readers of the motives of his journey . I have too much respect for my illustrious predecessors , from M. de Bougainville , who circumnavigated the globe , down to M. Le Maistre , who made a tour round his own chamber , not to follow their example . Besides , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be , two very important things , which would be sought in vain elsewhere ; - a receipt against the cholera , and a proof of the infallibility of the newspapers . " On the fifteenth of April , 1832 , as I was coming back from escorting to the staircase my excellent and celebrated friends , Litz and Boulanger , who had spent the evening with me in fortifying themselves against the prevailing scourge by taking strong black tea , I found that my legs suddenly failed me ; at the same moment a dizziness obscured my sight , and a tremor passed over my body ; I clung to a table to save myself from falling . I was attacked with the cholera . " Whether it was Asiatic or European , epidemic or contagious , is a point of which I know nothing . But what I do know very well is that , five minutes afterwards , perceiving that I could hardly speak , I made haste to call for some sugar and ether . The domestic , who was a very intelligent girl , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of sugar in rum , sup . posed that I wanted something similar . She filled a glass with pure ether , placed upon its opening the largest piece of sugar she could find , and brought it to me when I had just gone to bed , shivering in all my limbs . As my conscIousness began to leave me , I mechanically reached out my hand . I felt that they put something into it , and at the same time I heard somebody say , Swallow that , Sir ; it will do you good . ' I brought this something up to my mouth , and swallowed what it contained ; that is to say , about half a flask of ether . " What revolution took place when this diabolical liquor en // tered my body , it is impossible for me to say , for almost immediately I lost all consciousness . An hour afterwards , I returned to myself and found that I was wrapped up in several folds of fur ; a bottle of boiling water was at my feet ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were rubbing me on every seam . For a moment I thought I was dead and in the infernal regions ; the ether was burning my vitals within , the assistants were frying me brown without . At last , after a quarter of an hour more , the cold confessed itself vanquished ; I was dissolving into water , and the doctor declared that I was cured . It was high time ; two more turns of the spit , and I had been roasted . " Four days afterwards , the director of the Porte-Saint-Martin came to take a seat at my bedside . The theatre was yet more sick than I , and the dying called to its aid the convalescent . M. Harel told me , that he required in a fortnight , at the utmost , a piece which should produce at least fifty thousand crowns ; he added , in order to persuade me , that the feverish condition in which I was placed , was very favorable for a work of the imagination , on account of the excitement of the brain with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so conclusive , that I immediately set myself to work . I gave him his piece at the end of a week , instead of a fortnight , and it produced a hundred thousand crowns , in lieu of fifty thousand . It was true , that I was very near becoming insane . " This forced labor was of no benefit whatever to my health . Such was my weakness that I could hardly stand upright , when I heard of the death of General Lamarque . The next day I was appointed one of the committee of arrangements for the funeral ; my duty was to cause the artillery of the national guard , to which I belonged , to take the place assigned to it in the procession by the military hierarchy . " All Paris saw the funeral pomp pass by , - a sublime spec. tacle of order , sorrow , and patriotism . Who changed this order into confusion , this grief into anger , this patriotism into rebellion ? I know not , nor do I wish to know , before the day when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ninth , shall give up its accounts to God , or , like that of Louis the Sixteenth , shall settle its affairs with men . " On the ninth of June , 1 read in a legitimist paper , that I had been taken with arms in my hand , at the affair in the cloister Saint-M6ry , tried by a military tribunal in the course of the night , and shot at three o'clock in the morning . The news bore such an official character , the account of my execution , which I had met with great bravery , was given in such detail , the information came from so good a source , that for a moment I entertained // serious doubts about the matter . Besides , the writer was perfectly convinced tbat the account was true . For the first time he spoke well of me in his paper ; it was very evident he thought I was dead . " I threw off the coverlet , jumped down from the bed , and ran to the glass in order to obtain some proofs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chamber opened and a messenger entered bringing a note from Charles Nodier , which was as follows . " My Dear Alexandre. " 1 bave just read in the newspaper that you were shot yesterday at three o'clock in the morning . Be kind enough to let me know whether this will prevent you from coming to dine with me to-morrow at the Arsenal , along with Taylor . ' " I sent back word to Charles , that , as to the matter of being dead or alive , I could not speak with certainty , for my own opinion was not yet made up on that point ; but , in either case , I should certainly come to dine with him on the morrow ; so he had only to make himself ready , like Don Juan , to entertain the statue of the commander . " The next day , it was finally decided that I was not dead . But this was not gaining much , for 1 was still very sick , and therefore the doctor ordered me , as a doctor always does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a journey to Switzerland . " Consequently on the twenty-first of July , 1832 , I left Paris. ** - Vol. i. p. 165 . This extract affords one specimen of the manner in which Dumas alludes to topics of political interest . Frequent remarks of a similar character are scattered throughout his works , betraying rather the exasperation of personal feeling , and the desire of making pungent and exciting observations , calculated for the popular ear , than the sober and earnest convictions of a lover of freedom and truth . The spirit of the opposition to the present dynasty of France appears on this and other occasions rather violent and revengeful , than deliberative and profound ; it betrays the bitterness of disappointment and even the desire of blood , but it does not seem to rest upon fixed principles , nor to point to any definite end . In a word , it shows the disposition of a people accustomed to revolutions suddenly brought about by violence and bloodshed , and not by a gradual change of opinion effected by the diffusion of knowledge , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civilization . In a historico-political work by Duinas , entitled " Gaul and France , " which has been translated and published in this country , there are further manifestations of this state of political feeling , which we commend to the attention of the curious . To return to the " Impressions of Travel , " Dumas , after leaving Paris , makes his first halt at Montereau , about twenty leagues from the capital , where the sight of the bridge over the Seine reminds him of the two great events in the history of France , of which it was the theatre ; the assassination of the Duke of Burgundy , by the Dauphin , in 1419 , and the last great victory of Napoleon over the Allies in 1814 . After his usual fashion , of swelling the size of his book by foreign matter , lugged in by the head and shoulders , he takes this occasion to narrate at length , in a strange mixture of truth and fable , the story of both events . In this way , the reader is perpetually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and playwright , who is seeking everywhere for the materials of his art , and who sets down , as the fruit of a voyager 's observations , what was in truth slowly concocted at home in his closet . Some of the historical reminiscences thus introduced , and dressed up in the usual manner of a writer of fiction , are told with great vivacity , and are very acceptable to most readers , though they make a rather disjointed book . They are more tolerable , at any rate , than the antiquarian discussions and other passages which show some pretensions to learning , and serve to fill up a given number of pages , though the facts and arguments seem to be derived from no higher source than encyclopai*dias and guide-books . But there are other portions of the book , which afford far more entertaining matter . Dumas has an eye and a heart for the more striking aspects of outward nature ; and though the wonders of Switzerland have already wellnigh exhausted the pen and the pencil of the tourist and the draughtsman , his descriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the reader willingly lingers over them , and even turns to them for a second time . Then the crowd of motley characters from all parts of the world , whom the attractions of this country bring together at its chief places of interest during the summer months , afford fine scope for his ready // talent in sketching portraits and caricatures . As he has no scruple in inventing scenes and incidents for showing off their peculiarities to the best advantage , he forms a very amusing gallery of grotesque and life-like personages . Something of national prejudice appears in his portraitures of the travelling English , who , it must be confessed , do not sustain a very high character in any part of the continent . IDumas sketches , with malicious fidelity , the stiffness of John Bull 's manners , his helplessness in novel situations , and his ludicrous attempts at speaking any other than his vernacular tongue . The drawings of his own countrymen are more flattering , as might be expected , but they are equally well done . The carelessness and vivacity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voyager and amusing companion on the road for a single day , - the travelling bag-man , or commercial agent , - are shown up with great effect . A scene on the top of the Righi between one of these people and an Englishman is described with much comic power , though it is absurdly made to terminate in a duel of so tragic a cast , as to remind one of the dramatist 's study of horrible d6nouernens . The stories and traditions of the peasantry , especially those relating to the heroic days of Switzerland , are picked up by our traveller , and related , with the usual admixture of fiction , in a very agreeable way . We have room only for one extract more , and that shall be a part of the account of the first ascension of Mont Blanc , which iDumas pretends to have taken down from the lips of Jacques Balmat himself , the hero of the story , who was alive in 1832 , at the age of about seventy . He accomplished his great feat in 1786 . M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who should reach the summit , and , thus stimulated , Balmat , an active and hardy peasant , having explored the way alone , for about two thirds of the distance , in two previous trials , determined to make his great effort in company with Dr. Paccard , of Geneva . " All our little affairs being arranged , we took leave of our wives , and set out about five o'clock in the afternoon , one of us taking the right bank of the river Arve , and the other the left , in order that no one might suspect the end which we had in view . We came together again at the village of C6te , and , having attained an elevated point between the glacier of Bossons and that // of Taconnay , resolved to pass the night there . I had brought with me a blanket , in which I rolled up the Doctor like an infant in swaddling clothes , and , thanks to this precaution , he passed a good night . For my own part , I slept soundly till about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line appeared in the horizon , and the sun soon rose , without mist , clear and bright , prom . ising a famous day . I awakened the Doctor , and we began our journey . In a quarter of an hour , we were engaged in crossing the glacier of Taconnay . The first steps of the Doctor upon this great sea , among the yawning crevices , to the bottom of which the eye could not reach , over the bridges of ice which one hears cracking under his feet , and is certain of instant death if they break , were rather wavering . But he gained courage by degrees , as he saw me advance , and we got over it safe and sound . We then began to ascend the Grands-Mulets , and soon left it behind us . I pointed out to the Doctor the place where I had passed the first night . He made up a very meaning face , and remained silent for ten minutes ; then , suddenly stopping , he exclaimed , Balmat , do you think we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceived where the shoe pinched , and reassured him by a laugh , though without promising any thing . We kept on ascending for two hours ; the wind had risen since we left the plateau , and was now becoming more and more troublesome . At last , when we reached the peak of rock , called the Petit-Mulet , a violent gust carried off the Doctor 's hat . At the round oath which he uttered , I stopped and perceived his beaver sailing away towards Carmayer . He was looking after it with outstretched arms . 0 ! you must bid it adieu , Doctor , ' I exclaimed , for it is on the way to Piedmont . A good journey to it ! ' It seemed that the wind had taken a fancy for joking , for I had hardly closed my mouth when there came such a furious gust , that we were obliged to lie down on the ground , to avoid being carried after the hat . For ten minutes we were not able to rise ; the wind lashed the mountain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as large as a house . The Doctor was disheartened . For myself , I thought only of the saleswoman , who at this time had agreed to look up to the dome Gouter ; and therefore , the moment that the wind lulled , I stood up ; but the Doctor would only consent to follow me on all fours . We thus arrived at a point whence the village could be seen . There I drew out my pocket glass , and in the valley , twelve thousand feet below us , I perceived our gossip , together with a crowd of fifty people , eagerly gazing upwards . A consideration of selflove prompted the Doctor to get upon his legs again ; and , as soon // as he rose , I perceived that we were recognised ,  --  he by his great surtout , and I by my ordinary dress . The people in the valley waved their hats to us , and I answered with mine . That of the Doctor was absent on a long furlough . " But Paccard had exhausted all his energies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induce him to continue the ascent . After I had used all my eloquence , and saw that it was only losing time , I told him to continue moving about , and to keep himself as warm as possible . He answered , Yes ! yes ! ' mechanically , only to get rid of me . I then left the bottle with him , and set off alone , saying that I would return for him . " After this , the route did not offer any great difficulty , but , in proportion as I ascended , the air became less fit for respiration . Every ten steps I was obliged to stop , as if afflicted with the asthma . It seemed as if I had no lungs , and that my chest was empty . I then folded up my handkerchief like a cravat , tied it over my mouth , and breathed through it , which eased me a little . Still the cold increased , and I was an hour in advancing half a mile . I walked with my head bent down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I raised my head , and perceived that I was at last on the summit of Mont Blanc . " Then I cast my eyes around , trembling lest I should be deceived , and should find some other peak , which I should not have the strength to ascend ; for the joints of my legs seemed to hold together only by means of my trowsers . But no , no . I was at the end of my journey . I had reached a spot that no one had occupied before me , not even the eagle or the chamois . I had come alone , without other aid than that of my strength and will . All that surrounded me seemed to be my property . I was king of Mont Blanc , I was the statue of this immense pedestal . " Then I turned towards Chamouny , waving my hat on the end of my stick , and saw , by the aid of my glass , that they answered my signs . The whole village had turned out . The first moment of exultation having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I descended as rapidly as I could , calling out his name , and was frightened to find that he did not answer . At last , I perceived him , with his head between his knees , bent up like a cat asleep before the fire . I struck him on the shoulder , and he mechanically raised his head . I told him that I had reached the top of Mont Blanc . The news did not seem very interesting , for he replied by asking me , where he could lie down and go to sleep . I then told him that he had come thither in order to reach the summit , and that he should go there . I shook him , raised him up , and made him take a few steps . He appeared stupefied , and it seemed to be indifferent to him whether he went one way or another , // - whether he ascended or descended . But when the movements which I forced him to make brought back a little the circulation of the blood , he asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those which were on my hands . They were mittens of rabbit fur , which I had caused to be made expressly for the excursion . Under the circumstances , I would have refused both of them to my own brother ; but I gave him one . " A little after six o'clock , we both stood upon the summit , and although the sun shone brightly , the sky appeared darkly blue , and a few stars were visible . When we turned our eyes downwards , we saw nothing but ice , snow , rocks , and rugged peaks . The immense chain of mountains that runs through Dauphiny , and extends as far as the Tyrol , spread out before us its four hundred glaciers glowing with light . The lakes of Ge . neva and Neufch*tel seemed like blue points , and were hardly perceptible . On our left lay mountainous Switzerland , piled together in heaps , and beyond it the level country appeared like a rich carpet . On our right was all Piedmont and Lombardy , as far as Genoa . In front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him all . For myself , I no longer suffered , I was no more fatigued . I hardly perceived the difficulty of breathing , which a short time before had nearly caused me to renounce the undertaking . We remained there thirty.three minutes . " It was now seven o'clock , and but two hours and a half of daylight remained . It was high time to commence the descent . I waved my hat again as a final signal to those in the valley , and we began to descend . There was no path for our guidance , and we found our way only by the little holes in the ice made by our iron-shod staves . Paccard was like a child , without energy or will , whom I guided when the route was good , and carried in my arms when it was bad . At eleven o'clock we had left behind us the region of ice , and placed our feet upon firm ground . Then I permitted the Doctor to stop , and prepared to wrap him up again in the blanket . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rock , and , having eaten and drank a little , we crept as close as possible to each other , and went to sleep . " - Vol. i. p. 213 . The next morning they resumed their descent , and arrived in safety at the village , though the Doctor had become totally blind , and remained so for several days ; and even the vigorous Balmat did not recover for some time from the effects of the excursion . De Saussure ascended the next year , guided by this intrepid pioneer , and , between that time and 1832 , ten other parties accomplished the same feat . // Among the names we find those of two Americans , Dr. Rensselaer and Mr. Howard , who ascended in 1819 . We have as yet said nothing of the novels of Dumas , which form rather the most bulky portion of his works . There is less need of noticing them at length , as they evince less talent than his other productions , though they are equally characteristic of his school , and as some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , " Pauline , " appeared recently from the American press . It is a strange tale , in which horrible incidents are accumulated , too improbable to create any illusion , and without sufficient force of coloring or style to become interesting as a work of art . " Isabel of Bavaria " and some others are historical romances , the story following at times very closely the course of real events , and not embellished with sufficient copiousness of invention or descriptive power to correspond with the dignity of the characters or the richness of the materials . It would be idle to compare them with the magic creations of Scott , as they are much inferior to works of the same class by the writer 's countrymen . They belong to the mass of indifferent fictions , which the press of France , England , and America is now sending forth in vast profusion , adapted for a great multitude of uninstructed readers , who seem to find nothing better than the perusal of such trash for the amusement of their leisure hours.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
