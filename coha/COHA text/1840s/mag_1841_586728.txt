txt Ir is remarkable of all men who urge systems founded in falsehood - indeed , of impostors of every sort , whether in public or private matters - that their appeals are addressed , not to the naked reason of man , but to his personal or national prejudices . As if smitten with an instinctive dread of open dealing , they seek to enlist on their side all those partial and corrupting influences , by which human judgment is too commonly deflected . Like skilful orators , their deficiency of argument is concealed in a cloud of passion and feeling , which they excite , in the hope that fine sentiment may accomplish what feeble logic fails to effect . * The early and late movements of the friends of the tariff policy , are a pointed illustration of this fact . When they began , they urged their scheme upon the American people , not on the ground that it was just in itself , but because it was a part of an " . lmeri. can System . " It was to advance American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productions , to extend American commerce ! This was the reason , and not because it would carry forward the great cause of universal truth and justice , that it was recommended to American adoption . The argument was a sort of national argumentum ad kominem ; it addressed itself to a narrow patriotism , or a still narrower feeling of individual selfishness . In the same manner , at their recent convention in the city of New York , the same scheme is put forward , under the name of a Home-League . The beautiful and sacred associations that cluster about that noble old Saxon word Home , are to be turned // to the uses of a sect , are to be prostituted into the service of a self-seeking faction , are to be made the symbols of a movement against the great cause of national progress . It is not to be contended that Free-Trade is inconsistent vith the principles of impartial and liberal government , that it violates the acknowledged and fundamental truths of politico-economical science , or that it is adverse to the best interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly as well as dangerous attempt . But the position from which the assault is to be made , is that it is unfriendly to home industry , to home advancement , to home ties . All the fine feelings that centre about the domestic hearth , all the prejudices of classes , all the biases that attach men to the country of their birth or residence , are to be mustered to the attack ; and the contest will be - as it has always been , by the way - a struggle between truth on one hand , and special interest on the other . Need we say that there is no doubt as to which side the victory will belong 1* This revived movement is altogether so singular , that we propose to devote a few pages to the consideration of it . Its purposes , no less than the agencies to be used for their promotion , are worthy of a passing remark . About the middle of October last , our readers may perhaps remember , a convention assembled in the city of New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a design , it seems to us , of superseding all State and Federal legislation ; but as they state in one of their resolutions , " to digest and recommend a national polity ; for the promotion of the general interests of agriculture , manufactures , commerce , and finance ; exercising a continuous influence for the benefit of the Union , independent of local prejudices , aloof from trammels , and free from vacillating and temporizing expedients . " This convention adopted for its distinctive title the Hotne-League , and proposed to carry its plans by the organization of affiliated societies throughout the States , whose duty it should be to further , by every means in their power , the adoption of certaia leading principles . Those principles arewe quote again from the resolutions * " that no independent nation should tolerate any other than a reciprocal commerce ; since to receive the surplus products of nations that refhse ours in exchange is only another name for vassalage ; " and " that the establishment and preservation of a sound currency can only be promoted by a steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not secured from violent changes is liable to paralyze industry , prostrate trade and confidence , and subject the country to revulsions imminently dangerous to our welfare . " // It will be seen , there are here two questions , which are intimately related , but which may be considered separately . The first involves an inquiry as to how far nations are bound to cultivate a free intercourse with each other ; and the second refers to the influence of the tariff ' upon currency . We have a word to say in regard to both points , but shall confine our remarks in this paper to the first only . That there may exist no doubt , let us state the issue in few words . It is presented by the tariffites , in the form of an alternative - that is - as Reciprocity or Protection . If we understand this , it means , that all the nations of the globe must establish free-trade , or that each nation must " protect " itself ; in other words , that so long as the trade between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one or the other , and should be arrested by the party which suffers . We , on the contrary , deny these positions . We assert that a nation is bound to adopt a free system , whether other nations do or not ; that whatever may be considered good policy for Europe , the only true policy for the United States is unlimited intercourse . Our motto is , Free-Trade , and Free-Trade only , without qualification and without stint . In one respect , then , we all agree ; Free-Trade , if universally recognised , would be beneficial . We differ chiefly in regard to its effect if recognised only by one nation . We shall not stop to observe , what an immense advancement in opinion is. here impliedly admitted . The time was when Free-Trade was regarded as the *vild and impracticable scheme of a few visionary speculators ; it is now the alternative proposed by the liege and sworn men of restriction . Let us say , however , that the fact , if they be sincere ( and of their sincerity they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the process of discussion and of time , they will be compelled to surrender the prejudices still remaining , as they have surrendered many with which these are connected . The substance of the Home-League doctrine is , we repeat , that the prohibitory legislation of other countries must be countervailed by a home legislation of the same sort . Duty is to be met by duty ; restriction by restriction ; the paper-shot fired against our commerce must be returned in kind against theirs . In short , law must be pitted against law , until the one party or the other has been forced to yield . Because Great Britain refuses * receive our cotton and tobacco , we must retaliate upon her , by refusing to receive her hardware and woollens . This is the principle . // Now we deny that this would be good policy . We assert , on the contrary , and shall attempt to prove , that a regard to our own highest and permanent interests would lead us to adopt a more liberal practice . Our argument is short and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because Great Britain , or any other foreign nation , inflicts a grievous wrong upon her own industry , as well as that of her neighbors , we must follow her example , and , by way of amendment , inflict a similar and equal wrong upon ourselves and upon her ! Because she has cut off her right hand , we must cut off our left ! Because she has tied strong cords about her feet , we must fasten ours with gyves of iron ! buy wise-how kindhow manly ! Let us see : Great Britain interdicts the reception of our cotton and tobacco . By this , it is undeniable , she has done an injury to us . She has deprived us of an important and lucrative trade . But she has done no less an injury to herself . By forbidding the admission of our products , the consumers of them will be compelled either to relinquish the use of them altogether , or to pay a higher price for them than they would otherwise have done . Their command over the necessaries and luxuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command is the only criterion of wealth , it follows that the wealth of the nation has been decreased . The additional price paid by the consumers is so much abstracted from the products of their own industry ; besides , as the price of an article increases , the consumption of it decreases , and the demand for these domestic products by which it was paid for is lessened . Here is another inroad made upon domestic industry . Again : the rise of price in any article of consumption raises the cost of production of all other articles ; so that their effectiveness ( that is , their cheapness ) in foreign markets is affected in a degree corresponding with their increased cost . And this is the third evil inflicted by the prohibition . Great Britain , then , by her foolish regulations , has injured herself , and has injured us . How do the Home-Leaguers propose to remedy the difficulty l Why , by persuading the United States into the adoption of precisely the same disastrous course . Let us illustrate the matter by another example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The commerce between this country and Buenos Ayres consists , for the most part , in an exchange of agricultural products ; we send to her flour , she gives us , in exchange for * , hides . Now , why should the United States , who have such an abundance of grazing lands , send all the way to Buenos Ayres , a distance of several thousand miles , to procure what they can raise at home l* And why should the people of Buenos // Ayres , who have very fine wheat land , send all the way to North America to procure what they can raise at home ? * The answer is plain : because each , by appropriating its lands to raising the particular species of agricultural productions to which they are best adapted , and then bartering the one for the other , can procure a greater quantity of the article desired than if it were raised at home . In other words , the American farmer , by raising wheat , can purchase with it , by sending it abroad , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle on his farm ; and the Buenos-Ayrean gaucho , by grazing cattle , can purchase more flour , by sending his hides abroad , than he could raise , with the same capital and labor , if he were to till his lands . Let us now suppose that , at Buenos Ayres , there is no duty on American flour , as , in the United States , there is no duty on Buenos-Ayrean hides . Let us also suppose that a Pennsylvania farmer , on one hundred acres of land , can raise tw6 thousand bushels of wheat , which can be manufactured into four hundred barrels of flour , and that this flour can be bartered at Buenos Ayres for hides , so as to bring back , after paying freight , insurance , commissions , and all other charges , four hundred hides ; that is , one hide for every barrel of flour . We will also suppose that the Pennsylvania farmer , by grazing , instead of tillage , can only get , off his hundred acres of land , two hundred hides ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to combat asserts that , if the Buenos-Ayrean government should lay a duty on flour , it would be good policy in our government to lay a corresponding duty on hides ; that we should be benefited by such countervailing duty . Buenos Ayres imposes a duty of fifty per cent . on American flour . The effect of this would be to diminish its consumption ; for , at a higher price , it is not possible that the same quantity of any commodity can be consumed . The Pennsylvania farmer finds a diminished demand for flour at Buenos Ayres , and he will not , consequently , raise so much wheat . He experiences a positive loss for this diminution of his trade , arising from the act of the foreign government , as the Buenos-Ayrean people also experience a corresponding loss , from a diminution in the demand for hides . Each nation , from necessity , will be obliged to turn a portion of its capital and industry to a less productive branch of agriculture . But the Pennsylvania farmer can still find a market at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land ; that is , for three hundred barrels of flour , and can receive , in exchange for it , three hundred hides . It is , therefore , better for him to go on with his trade ; because , notwithstanding this high duty , he can get more hides from Buenos Ayres , for the produce of his // seventy-five acres , than he could get from turning his land to grazing . Buenos Ayres , we will suppose , goes still further . She increases the duty on American flour , and by that means dimin .. ishes the consumption of it to two hundred barrels . Still the Pennsylvania farmer can find a market for the product of half his land ; and so long as the market is left open to him for any portion of it , it is not for his interest that he should restrict it , further than the Buenos-Ayrean government itself has done . A half a loaf is better than no bread . If a man refuses to buy two bats , that is no reason why a hatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he refuses to buy of a butcher a quantity of mutton , that is no reason why the butcher should refuse to sell him a leg . That a countervailing duty would only make matters worse , can easily be shown by following up the illustration . The United States government , by way of retaliation , lay a duty upon Buenos-Ayrean hides . This diminishes the sale of hides in Buenos Ayres ; and as those who can not sell are deprived to an equal extent of the power of buying , the derriand for American flour is to that amount diminished ; and thus the Pennsylvania farmer would find that the act of his own government , instead of beriefiting him , had aggravated the original evil , and that the effect of such a measure would be precisely like that of a man who , by way of retaliation upon another for a supposed wrong , should fall to work and pull the hair out of his own head , as some children do.7** Nothing could be clearer than the principle set forth in this homely example ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the intellects of the wiseacres who form the Home-League . It is not enough for them that the reasoning is sound ; that the illustrations are pertinent ; that the language is simple . Their piddling conceptions of their own interests do not allow them to receive the truth , and there is an end of it . America , they say , has already adopted the system , and is now obliged to maintain it ; great interests have grown up under its favor , and these can not be sacrificed : the sacredness of vested rights calls upon the government to pursue its career of protection . Let us consider , then , since that is the question , the extbnt of these interests , and to what degree they would be injured , and the community benefited , by the introduction of a more general freedom . Let us imagine that all the imposts intended to operate as a protection are gradually withdrawn . The ports of the nation would then be thrown open to the world . Every person on the Raguet on Free Trade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument . // face of the earth , who sh'ould conceive that be might conduct with us a profitable intercourse , would forthwith send hither his products and his wares . An increase in the quantity of our imports , and a decrease in their price , would be the inevitable result . The home-producers would experience the influx of a powerful competition , and be compelled , in consequence of it , either to submit to diminished profits , or to relinquish their business altogether . In the former case , the loss might still be consistent with a profitable business , or , at most , be attended by an inconsiderable transfer of capital ; but in the latter , it would lead to a more or less extensive ruin . Yet , in neither case would the loss be permanent , or the ruin complete . The circumstances attending the change would ease its introduction , and prepare the classes the most to be affected by it , for the worst result . Its effects might be likened to those which accompany the introduction of a new instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men engaged in laboring with the old instruments , or according to the old methods , are thrown out of employment ; and this is an evil , but it is not a universal nor permanent evil . It is not universal , since a portion of those formerly employed still find employment in the same branch of business . It is not permanent , for the change is effected gradually , and those who suffer soon find a relief and remedy in other pursuits ; while the increased productiveness given to labor by the new machinery increases the demand for other labor , and enriches the whole body of consumers , by multiplying the means and facilities of enjoyment . In the same way , when , by removing restrictions on trade , the superior and cheaper productions of foreigners ( labor-saving machines in effect ) are introduced , a class of homeproducers are superseded . But their loss is not total-their interests are not completely annihilated . There are circumstances to be considered , which greatly soften and ameliorate the effects of the change : 1 . As it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dispose their affairs so as to adapt their condition to the event ; 2 . Of the capital invested in the business , most of it is in such a form - consisting of ra*v materials , bills receivable , and cash - that it would not be sunk ; 3 . That portion composed of buildings , machinery , and immoveable property , would still be applicable to other purposes ; and , 4 . The impulse given to trade by the starting of additional markets abroad , would open new channels for the investment of capital , and enlarge the demand for labor . Still , we admit that vested interests must suffer ; but we do not admit that this investment of interest imposes an obligation On government to maintain it undisturbed . Were we // to concede this , we should feel bound , in consistency , to concede the duty of the government to resist the introduction of all improvements in mechanics and arts , since none are ever made without displacing some portion of the capital and labor formerly employed . We should feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamboats , which have ruined so many smaller and less expeditious craft ; to stop the locomotive , which brought irreparable evil upon the holders of turnpike stock , upon the proprietors , drivers , and dependants of stages , and upon the owners of horses and wagons , and upon hotel-keepers . Since , however , there would be suffering , we shall state , in as condensed a form as we can , how far Free-Trade would compensate society for the loss . To argue each point at length would swell our Article to the magnitude of a volume . 1 . The first effect of the adoption of Free-Trade would be to restore the lost integrity of government , and give a legitimate direction to its action . One of the worst evils of the times , is the proneness to accumulate power in the hands of government . Its true function is , to protect men equally in the enjoyment of the blessings of life . When it departs from this , to become the regulator of trade , it is guilty of a flagrant usurpation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tvise qualified ; it breaks through the order of nature ; and , by assisting some and retarding others , commits practical injustice . Even if we grant it the right to intermeddle , such a course is always inexpedient . Nothing is more desirable in the administration of power than simplicity and directness . Laws intended for the general guidance should be plain to the commonest minds . But let government assume the duties of individuals , and its action is embarrassed and complicated , its character is perverted , it inevitably falls into error . It is sure to do wrong . Society , upon which it acts , is so intricate a machine , interests are so diverse , so liable to be moved by the most secret and inscrutable causes , so many vast and distant issues depend upon the slightest changes , that it becomes an act of incredible boldness in the legislator to presume to manage its affairs . Let him guard against public disorder and private wrong-doing , and he has discharged his only and highest trusts . It is a good principle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is the best judge of the time and place of employiDg his faculties . No sagacity is sharper than that of self-interest , no energy more constant , no wisdom more subtle and unerring . This power of choice , too , is one of the highest rights of the soul , and when government takes it away , it exercises a despotic sway-it tramples upon one of the chief distinctions of human nature . // 2 . Free-Trade *vouId restore to men the enjoyment of the world , of which they were made by the Creator the overseers and possessors . By the restrictive system , they are confined to the narrow territory upon which they happened to have been horn or live . They are deprived by it of the free use of that variety of products , which it was intended that a diversity of climate and soil should present . Every country on the face of the earth is adapted to bring forth something which other nations can not produce with the same facility or in equal perfection . Some , by natural fitness , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill and habit , must ever excel their neighbors in agriculture or in art . Yet the peculiar products of each are adapted to gratify the desires , and are desired by all the rest . It is not by the inhabitants of the frigid zone only that the skins of the seal are wanted ; the pomegranate and the orange are not delicious in southern mouths alone ; bread-stuffs have a value beyond the temperate regions ; and comfortable clothing and habitations are deemed articles of prime necessity , wherever the sentiments of civilization have made an inroad upon the practices of barbarism . The wealth of every part of the earth is coveted by those who every*vhere dwell upon its surface . Commerce is the medium by*vhich the desire and its object are brought into contact . Nations separated by broad seas are thus placed in mutual relationship . An exchange of commodities is effected , which is beneficial to both ; for each is put in possession of what it most craves . The exchange is an exchange of equivalents , both relinquishing what is esteemed of little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the peltries of the savage are given for the beads of the trader , the one as well as the other acquires an article of more importance in his sight than those with which he parts . Both are satisfied , because both are accommodated ; both rejoice , because both have reaped an advantage . How manifestly absurd , therefore , the impediments thrown in the way of these reciprocal dealings ! They multiply and enlarge the facilities of procuring desirable and useful objectsobjects , without which , life loses much of its comfort and half its charms . When these impediments are natural-things interposed by Providence in its ordering of the world-they are looked upon as curses . What two nations , disposed to a mutual traffic , ever thought it a matter of rejoicing that a long and dangerous sea intervened between them , to obstruct their commerce and embarrass their intercourse l No people were ever so unwise as to fill up their harbors with dirt , to close the mouths of their navigable streams with bridges of iron , or to point batteries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frosts of the North seal up , for half the year , the main branch as well as the tributaries of the St. Lawrence , do the inhabitants of their borders esteem it an especial favor ? * Indeed , all over the globe , are not the obstructions raised by nature or circumstances against a perfectly free trade deplored as calamities ; are not vast sums of money and years of toil expended in getting rid of them ; and are not artificial facilities constructed with painful perseverance and anxiety l Yet , there is no difference in effect between the barriers erected by nature and those instituted by government ; between a reef of rocks and a tariff of imports ; between fortifications to repel ships , or " protection " to repel their contents . They are the same in their operation , and equally pernicious . Adopt Free-Trade , and you at the same time destroy the evils they produce , and the miserable prejudices from which they spring . 3 . Free-Trade would relieve the community from a stupendous amount of indirect taxation and commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which it would be difficult to estimate the magnitude . If theynre prohibitory , at the same time that they are unproductive of revenue , they inflict an indirect tax equal to the whole difference of price between the homemade article and the foreign articles which they include ; if they are merely protective , the tax is equal to the whole amount of duties levied , at the same time that the price of domestic articles coming into the competition is proportionally raised . How much more does each man pay for the foreign articles consumed by himself and his family , than if no duties were imposed upon them ? How much more does he pay , for domestic articles consumed in the same manner , on the raw materials of which duties have been levied l How much more does he pay for domestic articles , increased in price in consequence of the absence of foreign competition * How much does he suffer in consequence of the derangements and fluctuations of trade which restrictive laws occasion l It must not be imagined that the influences of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consumers . It first taxes and impoverishes them , and then spreads its disastrous disturbances through all the ramifications of commerce . Like a stone thrown into the water , the agitation extends in concentric circles until it has reached the utmost limit of the pool . Laborers are the first who are distressed by a rise of prices , which they the least of all classes are able to endure ; then tradesmen begin to suffer from diminished sales larger dealers come next , and are obliged to curtail their business and to fall into the ranks of mere chapmen in short , all trades // and professions receive a shock , from which they only escape after a long period of pecuniary , mental , and often physical suffering . This is an important consideration , worthy of a more detailed and minute development . We will suppose that a nation , in order to give encouragement to its agriculture , prohibits or impedes the introduction of foreign grains . We take this example , because it relates to a great controversy now going on in Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traced through all its bearings , of a measure of this kind l It is obvious that the immediate consequence would be a diminution of the quantity , and a rise in the price of the interdicted commodity . This of itself , whatever may be its remote results , is a great evil . To lessen the supply of food , or to raise the price of it , brings direct and positive suffering upon large and important classes . The majority of the population of every modern state are in circumstances of poverty , in many cases approaching absolute want . Grain is with such an indispensable article . If you lessen the supply , they must either be reduced to starvation , or be forced to curtail their other expenses to procure it . They must consume less meat and fewer of the luxuries that may have been within their reach . Their ordinary outlays for clothing , for furniture , for commodious dwelling-places , must all be retrenched . The worn-out garment of the last year must be made to last a while longer ; families dispense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodging , &amp;c. , to which they have been accustomed ; and those who formerly kept their own house , are forced into boarding-houses , or compelled to unite with others in occupying a tenement which they had otherwise used alone . Thus , on every side , there occurs a diminution of demand for articles of general consumption . The farmer and the grazier find that the market for their peculiar products has declined ; manufacturers and tradesmen discover that they have lost a large number of customers , and that their sales have ruinously fallen off ; they are obliged , if they would maintain any thing like a profitable business , to make up for the deficiency , first , by ecoaomizing their own expenditures , and , second , by increasing the price of what they do sell . In either event , they aggravate the general scarcity and pressure . Nor does the mischief stop here ; for those who manufacture goods for exportation , or the foreign merchants , as they are called , soon begin to experience the disastrous operation of the restriction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations engaged exclusively in producing grain , since the introduction of that is prohibited . Nor can they deal as largely with other countries , not so engaged , inasmuch as the retrenchment which so many have been compelled to practise , has diminished the de // mand for the respective products of the latter ,  --  for teas , silks , cottons , wines , ores , woods , dye-stuffs , &amp;c. , &amp;c . As their profits are thus decreased , many must give up business , and enter into other occupations which bring them in competition with the small dealers and the laborers , who are deprived of employment at the very moment when the means of subsistence are becoming more hard to obtain . Thus , a mass of men are distressed , pinched , starved , and wronged for the sake of a few . Free-Trade would reverse the process . It would enable consumers , who comprise the total population of every country , to purchase their prime articles at the lowest price they could be furnished at in the world . Paying less for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things . Producers and tradesmen would find that a new demand had been created for their goods . A general activity would spread itself through all branches of business . For the consumption of foreign commodities gives employment to domestic industry as much as the consumption of those produced at home . What a nation gets from abroad , must be either a pure gratuity or an equivalent for something given . If the former , it is an unmixed gain , or if the latter , the equivalent paid must haves been a product of domestic labor . Foreign importations can only be paid for in one of four waya ; by articles produced at home and sent to the country from which they come ; by bills of exchange drawn upon shipments made to third parties ; by articles purchased with home products in foreign countiies , or transmitted to the nation from which the import is received ; and by gold and silver or bullion . In either case , there must have been an employment of home labor equal in value to the amount of goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interchange of equivalents , the better , in every commercial respect , for all who are concerned . 4 . Free-Trade would give a security to interests that tariffs are instituted to encourage , which the tariffs themselves do not always secure . It is a singular fact in the history of restrictive laws , that they do not always benefit the peculiar branches of industry which they were devised to sustain . The indubitable evidence of experience  --  the experience of England and France , as well as of most of the nations of the continent-teaches us that the most flourishing trades are not those which are under protection . They wither , side by side , with trades which left to themselves , shoot up into vigorous maturity . Nor are the causes of this fact abstruse . We can instantly assign several . ( 1 . ) When the duties upon au article are high , they lead to an extensive and remediless system of smuggling , which introduces as effectual competilion as though the trade were left open : ( 2 ) the prestige cre*ated // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patronage of government attracts to it more capital than its capacities require : ( 3 ) where the monopoly enjoyed is complete , the very security of those who possess it diminishes their enterprise , they neglect the means of improvement , the new mechanical contrivances to which stronger competition leads : ( 4 ) but , more potent than all , the exclusion of foreign products raises up powerful rivals in those very nations with whom an exchange is refused : as when Great Britain , rejecting the grains of the German states , in return for her manufactures , compelled them to manufacture for themselves , arid even to supplant her in her most lucrative markets . Thus , we find a series of causes constantly at work to defeat the purposes of protection . On this account , restrictionists are always clamoring for more restriction . They are never satisfied : their business is in unceasing fluctuation ; now this thing , and now that , depresses it ; accustomed to stimulus , each administration of it , by natural reaction , enlarges the craving for more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations of society on what may be called a more natural foundation . Leaving all men to the free choice of their pursuits , few enterprises would be undertaken not warranted by a well-considered probability of success . Capital and labor would flow into channels where they were most wanted . Whatever the actual condition of society demanded would spontaneously grow up , as its resources and capabilities were successively developed , and would rest upon a basis more stable and secure than any that could be provided by artificial and forced systems of growth . Like hardy plants , the unsought products of luxuriant nature , they would stand the rude blasts of the wind , the shock of the tempest , when the more tender shoots of a hot-house nourishment would lie trailed and *vithering upon the ground . For the laws of man are subject to perpetual change , and whatever depends upon their protection , partakes of their frail and transient character ; while the laws of nature are as eternal as their Author , and that which is founded upon them is marked with permanence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Free-Trade can be compared to its effect in ameliorating the hostile feelings of nations . By leading to a more frequent and friendly intercourse , by the reciprocal interchange , not only of peculiar products , but of arts , literature , and science , the incompatibility of sentiment and mutual repulsion of prejudice and manners , which is so irresistible a provocation to national misunderstanding and dispute , would gradually be worn away , and those who were before enemies , become allies . But a more powerful cement among nations would be found in the fact of a perfect identity of material interests . // It is customary with the champions of tariffs to urge their necessity on the ground that they prepare a nation to meet her foes in war . We reply , that without tariffs there would be few or no occasions of war . The relations of distant people would be made so close and vital , that it would be next to impossible to foment a war . Causes of disagreement might perhaps arise , but they would be settled on other principles than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and armies . A war between nations conducting a perfectly free intercourse of trade would be an almost instantaneous destruction of both . So many of the population of each would be dependant upon the welfare of the other , so many ties of interest and of friendship would have been interwoven between them , that the public opinion , the moral sentiment of both , would frown into oblivion every movement toward an open hostility . What is the secret of that deep , strong feeling of attachment to each other , in the midst of all their political contentions , which the people of the American Union universally profess ? * Why is it that patriotism , with them no longer a narr ow prejudice in favor of the place of their birth , has become a high , fraternal , and almost holy feeling 2 Why is it they are united , not only in name , but in sympathies , in aspirations , and in honor ? * Because they are no longer adversaries ; because they have broken through the miserable feeling which converts a foreigner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impediments to free intercourse ; because they have given room for the action of those kindly and brotherly sentiments which the Deity designs should bind together all the dwellers upon earth . Ah ! it is a great truth-would it were more generally received in private as well as public affairsthat the freer men are , the more loving and affectionate they are . We might add , in the further vindication of the principles of Free-Trade , that no nation would suffer less , or gain more , by their adoption , than the United States . Her natural position , and the circumstances of her existence , while they would enable her , in the worst emergency , to supply all her own wants , give her an immeasurable superiority over her neighbors . Possessed of a territory of vast extent , visited by every variety of climate , fertile in the extreme , intersected by majestic and overflowing streams , protected from external danger , inhabited by a hardy , ingenious , enterprising , and indomitable people , she has nothing to fear from the most intense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urge our great topic on such narrow grounds . Our sympathies and our views stretch beyond the small horizon of our own petty interests . We would maintain free trade , because it involves the happiness and progress of the whole human // race . We can not consent to raise ourselves by the ruin of others ; we can not consent to plunge whole nations in misery , that one may thrive ; we will not force the poor , degraded , starving populations of Europe into still lower depths of distress , that our own may be elevated ; nor will we , in imitation of the despotisms of a ruder age , strive to lay the foundations of our own empire upon the broken pillars and crumbled arches of another and unoffending people . If this nation must attain prosperity , it can only be by methods of honorable industry , and according to the eternal principles of justice and truth . It has been the shame , the disgrace , of statesmen of all times , that they have not been men . They have seldom been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their affections and hopes to the inconsiderable limits of their own land ; no enlarged notions of a universal policy have yet softened and expanded their hearts . The moral movements of the human race are nothing to them ; the spread of knowledge , the advancement of civilization , the progress of the masses , are the dreams of visionaries ; the triumph of virtue and happiness over all hinderances , a vain and impotent desire . Nations are to them conflicting powers , set to jostle and tear each other in a rough contest for supremacy . How much more noble , humane , and manly , the beautiful sentiment of one of the purest and ablest men of the day , * who , speaking of a foreign nation , says : " That nation is not an abstraction to me ; it is no longer a vague mass ; it spreads out before me into individuals , in a thousand interesting forms and relations ; it consists of husbands and wives , parents and children , who love one another as I love my own home* it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christians , united with me to the common Savior , and in whose spirit I reverence the likeness of his divine virtue ; it consists of a vast multitude of laborers at the plough and in the workshop , whose toils I sympathize with , whose burden I should rejoice to lighten , and for whose elevation I have pleaded ; it consists of men of science , taste , genius , whose writings have beguiled my solitary hours , and given life to my intellect and best affections . I love this nation : its men and women are my brothers and sisters . I could not , without unutterable pain , thrust a sword into their hearts . " We know that language like thi 's , as it once was with the divine teachings of Christianity , will be " to the Jews a stumbling-block , and to the Greeks foolishness ; " but we pray that Providence may hasten the time when it will be appreciated and applauded by every thinking creature.               @ @ @ @ @ @
