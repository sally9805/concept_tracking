Covers , Edges and Spine Main text Preliminaries THE BALD EAGLE . " I 'll have you chronicled , and chronicled , and cut and chronicled , and sung in all-to-be-praised sonnets , and grav 'd in new brave ballads , that all tongues shall troule you in scula sculorum. "  --  Old Comedy . In one of the little villages sprinkled along the delicious valley of the Connecticut , there stood , not many years ago , a little tavern called the Bald Eagle . It was an old-fashioned building , with a small , antique portico in front , where , of a lazy summer afternoon , the wise men of the village assembled to read newspapers , talk politics , and drink beer . Before the door stood a tall , yellow sign-post , from which hung a white sign , emblazoned with a fierce bald-headed eagle , holding an olive branch in one claw , and a flash of forked lightning in the other . Underneath was written , in large , black letters , " The Bald Eagle ; Good Entertainment for Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One calm , sultry , summer evening , the knot of village politicians had assembled , according to custom , at the tavern door . At the entrance sat the landlord , Justice of the Peace and Quorum , lolling in a rocking chair , and dozing over the columns of an electioneering handbill . Along the benches of the portico were seated the village attorney , the schoolmaster , the tailor , and other personages of less note , but not less idle , nor less devoted to the affairs of the nation . To this worthy assembly of patriotic citizens , the schoolmaster was drowsily doling forth the contents of the latest Gazette . It was at that memorable epoch of our national history , when Lafayette returned to visit , in the evening of his days , the land that owed so much to his youthful enthusiasm ; and to see , in the soft decline of life , the consummation of his singular glory , in the bosom of that country where it first began . His approach was every where hailed with heart-stirring joy . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village through which he passed , hailed him with rural festivities , addresses , odes , and a dinner at the tavern . Every step of his journey was regularly and minutely recorded in those voluminous chronicles of our country , the newspapers ; and column after column was filled with long notices of the dinners he had eaten , and of the toasts drank , and of the songs sung on the occasion . As the schoolmaster detailed to the group around him an account of these busy festivals , which were so rapidly succeeding each other all over the country , the little soul he possessed kindled up within him . With true oratorical emphasis he repeated a long list of toasts , drank on a recent celebration of the kind  --  " the American Eagle , "  --  " the day we celebrate , "  --  " the New England Fair , "  --  " the Heroes who fought , bled , and died at Bunker Hill , of which I am one ! "  --  and a thousand others equally patriotic . He was interrupted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the blue hills that skirted the village ; and shortly after a cloud of dust came rolling its light volume along the road , and the stage-coach wheeled up to the door . It was driven by a stout , thickest young fellow , with a glowing red face , that peeped out from under the wide brim of a white hat , like the setting sun from beneath a summer cloud . He was dressed in a wrentailed gingham coat , with pocket-holes outside , and a pair of gray linen pantaloons , buttoned down each leg with a row of yellow bell buttons . His vest was striped with red and blue ; and around his neck he wore a colored silk handkerchief , tied in a loose knot before , and tucked in at the waistband . Beside him on his coach-box sat two dusty travellers in riding-caps , and the group within presented an uncomfortable picture of the miseries of travelling in a stage-coach in the month of June . In an instant all was noise and confusion in the bar-room of the inn . Travellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set off in the evening coach , came crowding in with their baggage ; some eager to secure places , and others lodgings . A noisy group was gathered at the bar , within which the landlady was bouncing to and fro in a huff , and jingling a great bunch of keys , like some wild animal at a raree-show , stalking about its cage , whisking its tail , and jingling its iron chain . The fireplace was filled with pine boughs and asparagus tops ; and over it the wall was covered with advertisements of new-invented machines , patent medicines , tollgate and turnpike companies , and coarse prints of steamboats , stage-coaches , opposition lines , and Fortune 's home forever . In one corner stood an old-fashioned oaken settee , with high back and crooked elbows , which served as a seat by day , and a bed by night : in another was a pile of trunks and different articles of a traveller 's equipage : travelling-coats hung here and there about the room , and the atmosphere was thick with the smoke of tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wheels was heard at the door . " Stage ready ! " shouted the coachman , putting his head in at the door ; there was a hurry and bustle about the room ; the travellers crowded out ; a short pause succeeded ; the carriage door was slammed to in haste ; and the coach wheeled away , and disappeared in the dusk of evening . The sound of its wheels had hardly ceased to be heard , when the tailor entered the bar-room with a newspaper in his hand , and strutted up to the squire and the schoolmaster , who sat talking together upon the settee , with a step that would have done honor to the tragedy hero of a strolling theatre . He had just received the tidings that Lafayette was on his way north . The stage-driver had brought the news ; the passengers confirmed it ; it was in the newspapers ; and of course there could be no doubt upon the subject . It now became a general topic of conversation in the bar-room . The villagers came in one by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lafayette , the Marquis , the Gin'ral ! He would pass through the village in two days from then . What was to be done ? The town authorities were at their wits ' end , and were quite as anxious to know how they should receive their venerable guest , as they were to receive him . In the mean time , the news took wing . There was a crowd at the door of the post-office talking with becoming zeal upon the subject ; the boys in the street gave three cheers , and shouted , " Lafayette forever ! " and in less than ten minutes the approaching jubilee was known and talked of in every nook and corner of the village . The town authorities assembled in the little back parlor of the inn , to discuss the subject more at leisure over a mug of cider , and conclude upon the necessary arrangements for the occasion . Here they continued with closed doors until a late hour , and , after much debate , finally resolved to decorate the tavern hall , prepare a great dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by surprise . The lawyer was appointed to write an oration , and the schoolmaster an ode , for the occasion . As night advanced , the crowd gradually dispersed from the street . Silence succeeded to the hum of rejoicing , and nothing was heard throughout the village but the occasional bark of a dog , the creaking of the tavern sign , and the no less musical accents of the one-keyed flute of the schoolmaster , who , perched at his chamber window in nightgown and slippers , serenaded the neighborhood with " Fire on the Mountains , " and half of " Washington 's March ; " whilst the grocer , who lived next door , roused from sweet dreams of treacle and brown sugar , lay tossing in his bed , and wishing the deuce would take the schoolmaster , with his Latin and his one-keyed flute . As day began to peep next morning , the tailor was seen to issue out of the inn yard in the landlord 's yellow wagon , with the negro hostler Csar mounted behind , thumping about in the tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the gray of morning mellowed , life began its course again in the little village . The cock hailed the daylight cheerly ; the sheep bleated from the hills ; the sky grew softer and clearer ; the blue mountains caught the rising sun ; and the mass of white vapor , that filled the valley , began to toss and roll itself away , like ebb of a feathery sea . Then the bustle of advancing day began ; doors and windows were thrown open ; the gate creaked on its hinge ; carts rattled by ; villagers were moving in the streets ; and the little world began to go , like some ponderous machine , that , wheel after wheel , is gradually put in motion . In a short time the tailor was seen slowly returning along the road , with a wagon-load of pine boughs and evergreens . The wagon was unloaded at the tavern door , and its precious cargo carried up into the hall , where the tailor , in his shirt sleeves , danced and capered about the room , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , like an Indian warrior before going to battle . In a moment the walls were stripped of the faded emblems of former holidays ; garlands of withered roses were trampled under foot ; old stars , that had lost their lustre , were seen to fall ; and the white pine chandelier was robbed of its yellow coat , and dangled from the ceiling , quite woe-begone and emaciated . But erelong the whole room was again filled with arches , and garlands , and festoons , and stars , and all kinds of singular devices in green leaves and asparagus tops . Over the chimney-piece were suspended two American flags , with a portrait of General Washington beneath them ; and the names of Trenton , Yorktown , Bunker Hill , &c.,; peeped out from between the evergreens , cut in red morocco , and fastened to the wall with a profusion of brass nails . Every part of the room was liberally decorated with paper eagles ; and in a corner hung a little black ship , rigged with twine , and armed with a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt a description of all the wonders that started up beneath the tailor 's hand , as from the touch of a magician 's wand . In a word , before night , every thing was in readiness . Travellers that arrived in the evening brought information that the general would pass through the village at noon the next day ; but without the slightest expectation of the jubilee that awaited him . The tailor was beside himself with joy at the news , and pictured to himself with good-natured self-complacency the surprise and delight of the venerable patriot , when he should receive the public honors prepared for him , and the new blue coat , with bright buttons and velvet collar , which was then making at his shop . In the mean time the landlady had been busy in making preparations for a sumptuous dinner ; the lawyer had been locked up all day , hard at work upon his oration ; and the pedagogue was hard ridden by the phantom of a poetic eulogy , that bestrode his imagination like the nightmare . Nothing was heard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martial music of drums and fifes . For a while the ponderous wheel of labor seemed to stand still . The clatter of the cooper 's mallet was silent , the painter left his brush , the cobbler his awl , and the blacksmith 's bellows lay sound asleep , with its nose buried in the ashes . The next morning at day-break the whole military force of the town was marshalled forth in front of the tavern , " armed and equipped as the law directs . " Conspicuous among this multitude stood the tailor , arrayed in a coat of his own making , all Iace and buttons , and a pair of buff pantaloons , drawn up so tight , that he could hardly touch his feet to the ground . He wore a military hat , shaped like a clam-shell , with little white goose feathers stuck all round the edge . By his side stood the gigantic figure of the blacksmith , in rusty regimentals . At length the roll of the drum announced the order for forming the ranks , and the valiant host displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tall lantern-jawed fellow , all legs , furbished up with a red waistcoat , and shining-green coat , a little round wool hat perched on the back of his head , and downward tapering off in a pair of yellow nankeens , twisted and wrinkled about the knees , as if his legs had been screwed into them . Beside him stood a long-waisted being , with a head like a hurra 's nest , set off with a willow hat , and a face that looked as if it were made of sole-leather , and a gash cut in the middle of it for a mouth . Next came a little man with fierce black whiskers , and sugar-loaf hat , equipped with a long fowling-piece , a powder-horn , and a white canvass knapsack , with a red star on the back of it . Then a country bumpkin standing bolt upright , his head elevated , his toes turned out , holding fast to his gun with one hand , and keeping the other spread out upon his right thigh . Then figured the descendant of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arms and accoutrements of his ancestor , a cocked hat on his head , a heavy musket on his shoulder , and on his back a large knapsack , marked U. S. Here was a man in straw hat and gingham jacket ; and there a pale , nervous fellow , buttoned up to the chin in a drab great-coat , to guard him against Eyes right ! Eyes left ! Steady ! Attention to the roll-call ! " shouted the blacksmith , in a voice like a volcano . " Peleg Popgun ! " " Here . " " Tribulation Sheepshanks ! " " He  --  e  --  e  --  re . " " Return Jonathan Babcock ! " " Here . " And so on through a whole catalogue of long , hard names . " Attention ! Shoulder  --  arms ! Very well . Fall back there on the extreme left ! No talking in the ranks ! Present  --  arms ! Squire Wiggins , you 're not in the line  --  if you please , a little farther in  --  a little farther out  --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Very well done . Quick time , upon your post  --  march ! " The little red-coated drummer flourished his drum-sticks ; the bandy-legged fifer struck up Yankee-doodle ; Csar showed his flat face over the horizon of a great bass drum , like the moon in an eclipse ; the tailor brandished his sword ; and the whole company , wheeling with some confusion round the tavern sign-post , streamed down the road , covered with dust , and followed by a troop of draggle-tailed boys . As soon as this company had disappeared , and the dub of its drum ceased to be heard , the too-too of a shrill trumpet sounded across the plains , and a troop of horse came riding up . The leader was a jolly , round-faced butcher , with a red fox tail nodding over his head , and came spurring on , with his elbows flapping up and down , like a pair of wings . As he approached the tavern , he ordered the troop to wheel , and form a line in front  --  a manoeuvre , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and precision . This body of light-horse was the pride of the whole country round ; and was mounted and caparisoned in a style of splendor , that dazzled the eyes of all the village . Each horseman wore a cap of bear-skin , crested with a fox tail , a short blue jacket , faced with yellow , and profusely ornamented with red morocco and quality binding . The pantaloons were of the same color as the jackets , and were trimmed with yellow cord . Some rode with long stirrups , some with short stirrups , and some with no stirrups at all ; some sat perpendicular upon their saddles , some at an obtuse angle , and others at an angle of forty-five . One was mounted on a tall , one-eyed bone-setter , with his tail and ears cropped ; another on a little red nag , with shaggy mane , and long switch tail , and as vicious as if the very devil were in him . Here was a great fellow , with long , curly whiskers , looking as fierce as Mars himself ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crest , short spurs , elbows stuck out , and jacket cocked up behind , looking like a barn-door " rooster , " with his tail clipped , just preparing to crow . When this formidable troop was formed to the satisfaction of their leader , the word of command was given , and they went through the sword exercise , hewing and cutting the air in all directions , with the most cool and deliberate courage . The order was then given to draw pistols . Ready !  --  aim !  --  fire . Pop  --  pop  --  poo , went the pistols . Too  --  too  --  too , went the trumpet . The horses took fright at the sound ; some plunged , others reared and kicked , and others started out of the line , and capered up and down , " like mad . " The captain being satisfied with this display of the military discipline of his troop , they wheeled off in sections , and rode gallantly into the tavern-yard , to recruit from the fatigues of the morning . Crowds of country people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fun and the general . The honest farmer , in broad-brimmed hat and broad-skirted coat , jogged slowly on , with his wife and half a dozen blooming daughters , in a square-top chaise ; and country beaux , in all their Sunday finery , came racing along in wagons , or parading round on horse-back , to win a sidelong look from some fair country lass in gypsy hat and blue ribbons . In the meantime the schoolmaster was far from being idle . His scholars had been assembled at an early hour , and after a deal of drilling and good advice , were arranged in a line in front of the school-house , to bask in the sun , and wait for the general . The little girls had wreaths of roses upon their heads , and baskets of flowers in their hands ; and the boys carried Bibles , and wore papers on their hats , inscribed , " Welcome , Lafayette . " The schoolmaster walked up and down before them , with a ratan in his hand , repeating to himself his poetic eulogy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rogue over the knuckles for misdemeanor ; shaking one , to make him turn out his toes ; and pulling another 's ear , to make him hold up his head and look like a man . In this manner the morning wore away , and the hour , at which it had been rumored that the general was to arrive , drew near . The whole military force , both foot and horse , was then summoned together in front of the tavern , and formed into a hollow square , and the colonel , a swarthy knight of the forge , by the aid of a scrawl , written by the squire and placed in the crown of his hat , made a most eloquent and patriotic harangue , in which he called the soldiers his " brothers in arms , the hope of their country , the terror of their enemies , the bulwark of liberty , and the safeguard of the fair sex . " They were then wheeled back again into a line , and dismissed for ten minutes . An hour or two previous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stationed upon the high-road , not far from the entrance of the village , equipped with a loaded gun , which he was ordered to discharge by way of signal , as soon as the general should appear . Full of the importance and dignity of his office , Boaz marched to and fro across the dusty road , with his musket ready cocked , and his finger on the trigger . This manoeuvring in the sun , however , diminished the temperature of his enthusiasm , in proportion as it increased that of his body ; till at length he sat down on a stump in the shade , and leaning his musket against the trunk of a tree , took a short-stemmed pipe out of his pocket , and began to smoke . As noon-day drew near , he grew hungry and homesick ; his heart sunk into his stomach . His African philosophy dwindled apace into a mere theory . Overpowered by the heat of the weather , he grew drowsy , his pipe fell from his mouth , his head lost its equipoise , and dropped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently from his seat , he fell asleep at the root of the tree . He was aroused from his slumber by the noise of an empty wagon , that came rattling along a cross-road near him . Thus suddenly awakened , the thought of the general 's approach , the idea of being caught sleeping at his post , and the shame of having given the signal too late , flashed together across his bewildered mind , and springing upon his feet , he caught his musket , shut both eyes , and fired , to the utter consternation of the wagoner , whose horses took fright at the sound , and became unmanageable . Poor Boaz , when he saw the mistake he had made , and the mischief he had done , did not wait long to deliberate , but throwing his musket over his shoulder , bounded into the woods , and was out of sight in the twinkling of an eye . The sharp report of the gun rang far and wide through the hush of noontide , awakening many a drowsy echo that grumbled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . At the sound of the long-expected signal-gun , the whole village was put in motion . The drum beat to order , the ranks were formed in haste , and the whole military force moved off to escort the general in , amid the waving of banners , the roll of drums , the scream of fifes , and the twang of the horse trumpet . All was now anxious expectation at the village . The moments passed like hours . The lawyer appeared at the tavern door , with his speech in his hand ; the schoolmaster and his scholars stood broiling in the sun ; and many a searching look was cast along the dusty highway to descry some indication of their guest 's approach . Sometimes a little cloud of dust , rolling along the distant road , would cheat them with a vain illusion . Then the report of musketry , and the roll of drums , rattling among the hills , and dying on the breeze , would inspire the fugitive hope , that he had at length arrived , and a murmur of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There he comes !  --  that 's he ; " and the people would crowd into the street to be again disappointed . One o'clock arrived ; two , three , but no general ! The dinner was overdone , the landlady in great tribulation , the cook in a great passion . The gloom of disappointment began to settle on many a countenance . The people looked doubtingly at each other , and guessed . The sky , too , began to lower . Volumes of black clouds piled themselves up in the west , and threatened a storm . The ducks were unusually noisy and quarrelsome around the green pool in the stable yard ; and a flock of ill-boding crows were holding ominous consultation round the top of a tall pine . Every thing gave indication of an approaching thunder-gust . A distant , irregular peal rattled along the sky , like a volley of musketry . They thought it was a salute to the general . Soon after the air grew damp and misty ; it began to drizzle ; a few scattered drops pattered on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene of confusion ensued . The pedagogue and his disciples took shelter in the school-house ; the crowd dispersed in all directions , with handkerchiefs thrown over their heads , and their gowns tucked up , and every thing looked dismal and disheartening . The bar-room was full of disconsolate faces . Some tried to keep their spirits up by drinking ; others wished to laugh the matter off ; and others stood , with their hands in their pockets , looking out of the window , to see it rain , and making wry faces . Night drew on apace , and the rain continued . Still nothing was to be heard of the general . Some were for despatching a messenger to ascertain the cause of this delay ; but who would go out in such a storm ! At length the monotonous too-too of the horse trumpet was heard ; there was a great clattering and splashing of hoofs at the door ; and the troop reined up , spattered with mud , drenched through and through , and completely crest-fallen . Not long after , the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one half its number by desertions . The tailor entered the bar-room reeking and disconsolate , a complete epitome of the miseries of human life written in his face . The feathers were torn out of his clam-shell hat , his coat was thoroughly sponged , his boots full of water , and his buff pantaloons clung tighter than ever to his little legs . He trembled like a leaf ; one might have taken him for Fever and Ague personified . The blacksmith , on the contrary , seemed to dread the water as little as if it were his element . The rain did not penetrate him , and he rolled into the bar-room like a great sea-calf , that , after sporting about in the waves , tumbles himself out upon the sand to dry . A thousand questions were asked at once about the general , but there was nobody to answer them . They had seen nothing of him , they had heard nothing of him , they knew nothing of him ! Their spirit and patience were completely soaked out of them ; no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart seemed now to sink in despair . Every hope had given way , when the twang of the stage-horn was heard , sending forth its long-drawn cadences , and enlivening the gloom of a rainy twilight . The coach dashed up to the door . It was empty  --  not a solitary passenger . The coachman came in without a dry thread about him . A little stream of water trickled down his back from the rim of his hat . There was something dismally ominous in his look ; he seemed to be a messenger of bad news . " The gin'ral !  --  the gin'ral !  --  where 's the gin'ral ? " " He 's gone on by another road . So much for the opposition line and the new turnpike ! " said the coachman , as he tossed off a glass of New England . " He has lost a speech ! " said the lawyer . " He has lost a coat ! " said the tailor . " He has lost a dinner ! " said the landlord . It was a gloomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat late over their bottle , drank hard , and tried to be merry ; but it would not do . Good-humor flagged , the jokes were bad , the laughter forced , and one after another slunk away to bed , full of bad liquor , and reeling with the fumes of brandy and beer .
