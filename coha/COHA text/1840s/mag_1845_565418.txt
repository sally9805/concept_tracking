txt IT is on record that Geo.Whitefield was a preacher of uncommon power . This record is true . His first sermon was an earnest of his subsequent greatness , and revealed him to his audience a preacher of no ordinary character . That sermon , before he delivered it , he sent to a clergyman to show him that he was unfit to take upon him the important work of preaching . The clergyman " kept it for a fortnight , and then sent it hack with a guinea for the loan of it ; telling me he had divided it into two , and had preached it morning and evening to his congregation . " When he had preached the sermon , he thus wrote to a friend " Glory ! glory ! glory ! be ascrib. ed to an Almighty Triune God . Last Sunday , in the afternoon , I preach . ed my first sermon in the church of St. Mary De Crypt , where I was baptized , and also first received the sacrament of the Lord 's Supper . Curiosity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together on the occasion . The sight at first a little awed me ; but I was comforted by a heartfelt sense of the divine presence , and soon found the unspeakable advantage of having been accustomed to public speaking when a boy at school , and of exhorting and teaching the prisoners and poor people at private houses whilst at the university . By these means I was kept from being daunted overmuch . As I proceeded , I perceived the fire kindled , till at last , though so young , and amidst a crowd of those who had known me in my infant , childish days , I trust I was enabled to speak with some degree of Gospel authority . Some few mocked , but most , for the present , seemed struck ; and I have since heard that a complaint had been made to the bishop that I drove fifteen persons mad by the first sermon . The worthy prelate , as I am informed , wished that the madness might not be forgotten till the next Sunday . " His first appearance in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pulpit , his juvenile aspect excited a general sneer of contempt ; but he had not spoken long when the sneer gave place to universal symptoms of wonder and pleasure . The sermon stamped his character at once , and from that time his popularity in London continued to increase . " From this time onward to the day of his death , his preaching always awakened deep interest , and was usually followed by important results . He studied , and prayed , and lived , to preach ; and when he preached , he spoke with authority " in demonstration of the Spirit and with power . " Unless he could exhort in a private or social way , or have opportunity to preach " Christ and him crucified " to the multitudes , he seemed to be out of his element . When he could stand in the pulpit , no matter whether that pulpit was in the stately church with its lofty spire pointing heavenward , or under the solitary tree , or in the booth , or in the open air with nothing but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was in his ap . propriate place , and engaged in his appropriate calling . Here he uniformly acquitted himself so as to alarm the careless , convince the sinner of his guilt and danger , and strengthen and comfort the people of God . Whether speaking to the polished congregations of London , or the multitudes at Moorfields , whether in England or Wales or Scotland , whether in Great Britain or America , he always spoke with // an unction from the Holy One , and was finally styled the " prince of preachers . " The testimony of a Franklin and a Hume proves his power to reach at least the intellect of scholars and philosophers ; the whitened furrows made by tears on the faces of the colliers show with what effect he could adapt himself to the unlettered mind and the unsophisticated heart . Houses crowded to suffocation , presenting him with a " sea of upturned faces , " whenever he arose to address his dying fellow men ; thousands upon thousands gathering with eagerness and haste to the field where it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebels that came to scoff and raise a mob , tamed and sent back weeping ; hoary age and lisping childhood , feeble woman and hardy manhood , entranced for hours under the spell of his voice and action ; many hundreds dating the commencement of new thoughts , new desires , new purposes , a new life , in their own souls , from the hour they first heard him tell the story of the cross and invite them to Him who was crucified thereon ; - all , all attest his *vonderful power . We are to inquire into the secret of that power  --  to trace the elements of that mighty influence which he exerted over the minds and hearts of his frilow men . In doing this , it may be well to state at the outset , that his original endowments of mind were of a high order , and such as admirably fitted him for the brilliant course of life which he run . This is clearly shown by the record of his whole life . It would seem that the exact state of things embraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he was created with the express design of meeting it . A great work was to be accomplished in his day . A signal illustration of the worthlessness and inefficacy of mere forms in religion was to be given ; the necessity of bringing the great truths of the Gospel directly into contact with the heart and life was to be shown ; and some one was required by the exigencies of the case who should burst the trammels of prescription , and go out even into the highways and hedges to preach the Gospel to the poor and perishing . A man of Whitefield 's peculiar powers and temperament was needed , and such an one was raised up . " Every great and effectual movement in human society begins in secret and in silence ; in the diffusion through the mass of those who are to be the actors , of those elements of thought and feeling , under the influence of which they are to act . As the movement draws towards its full development , it produces the leading minds which it needs ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what the movement is to be , and under whose guidance the multitude labor purposely for its accomplishment . " The powers of intellect with which nature had endowed Whitefield were cultivated by various and long-continued study . He was not a man to depend on native genius or happy impulses , or on what is sometimes called good luck . Full well he knew that the only price of intellectual or moral excellence is hard study ; and that if a man would make his mark upon the world and accomplish the great end of life , he must improve the talents he has and increase their productiveness by judicious and varied cultivation . Hence , he never was one to decry learning , or to undervalue a course of thorough training for the work of the Gospel ministry . He felicitated himself in after life that he could say , " My mother was very careful of my education . " By this he meant not only that she gave him good instructions , but sedulous. // ly guarded him against evil influences . When he was ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fond of being a clergyman , and used frequently to imitate the minister 's reading prayers , &amp;c . " At an early age he was sent to a grammar school , and there his proficiency in study was quite remarkable . " Having a good elocution and memory , " he says , " I was remarked for making speeches before the corporation at their annual visitation . " Here he contracted a great fondness for plays , and absented himself for days together from school , that he might prepare for acting them . This relish for plays followed him to the university , and its influence was felt in after life in two ways : first , " their dismal effects I have felt and groaned under ever since and secondly , this early acting doubtless contributed its shnre in the formation of his habits of oratory after he became a preacher of the Gospel . While preparing for college , he seems to have been intent on unproving his mind , made " considerable progress in the Latin classics , " was very diligent in reading and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek Testament . " Shortly before he had completed his eighteenth year , he entered the university of Oxford . During his residence at this seat of learning , he became acquainted with the Wesleys ; and as " iron sharpeneth iron , " this contact of two powerful though differently constituted minds , must have affected in no unimportant manner the intellectual training of Whitefield . His mental history at Oxford was very peculiar , and the different states of feeling through which he passed indeed remarka. able . At length that great crisis of moral character seems to have been passed which separated him forever from the world , and introduced him into the light and freedom of God 's own children . " After a long night of desertion and temptation , the star which I had seen at a distance before , began to appear again ; the day-star arose in my heart . " This moral renovation , this introduction to a new world of thought and feeling , had a very marked influence upon his studies , and gave a peculiar cast to his subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to prepare himself for the work of the ministry . Notwithstanding the ardor of his feelings and his desire to be immediately engaged in doing good to others , he knew that his studies must not be neglected . His circumstances were favorable , not only to the improvement of his intellect , but to the correct training and full development of his moral feelings . When about twenty two years of age he took orders , and began to preach " that true religion was a union of the soul with God , and Christ formed within us , " - " the new birth and the unsearchable riches of Jesus Christ . " Having taken his bachebr 's degree at Oxford , he commenced in serious earnest the great business of his life ; and , as long as he lived , he continued to cultivate with unwearied assiduity those powers which enabled him to surpass nearly all other men as a persuasive and effective preacher of the Gospel . With such original powers of mind and such opportunities for their cultivation , Whitefleld had acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was made particularly sensible of his own sinfulness , and hence was prepared , when he became a preacher of righteousness , to hold up to the view of his fellow men the human heart in all its corruption and moral deformity . His own testimony on this point follows : " I can remember such early stirrings of corruption in my heart , as abundantly convince me that I was conceived and born in sin ; that in me dwelleth no good // thing by nature ; and that , if God had not freely prevented me by his grace , I must have been forever ban . ished from his presence . I was so brutish as to hate instruction ; and used purposely to shun all opportunities of receiving it . I soon gave pregnant proofs of an impudent temper . Lying , filthy talking , and foolish jesting , I was much addicted to , even when very young . Sometimes I used to curse , if not to swear . Stealing from my mother I thought no theft at all , and used to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was up . I have frequently betrayed my trust . Numbers of Sabbaths have I broken , and generally used to behave myself very irreverently in God 's sanctuary . Much money have I spent in plays and in the common amusements of the age . Cards and reading romances were my heart 's delight , it would be endless to recount the sins and offenses of my younger days . They are more in number than the hairs of my head . ' My heart would fail me at the remembrance of them , were I not assured that my Redeemer liveth to make intercession for me . Whatever foreseen fitness for salvation others may talk of and glory in , I disclaim any such thing ; if I trace myself from my cradle to my manhood , I can see nothing in me but a fitness to be damned . I speak the truth in Christ , I lie not . ' " As he increased in years his conceptions of the enormity and odiousness of sin , and of the moral corruption of the natural heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerfully strove with him , and sent him to his closet weeping . For a considerable period before his conversion , he was the subject of various and peculiar exercises of mind , and was led in a way which presented him with a great diversity of views of the human heart . When he was introduced into the kingdom of grace and began to rejoice in the freedom wherewith Christ makes free , his feelings were strong and decided indeed , and he was in raptures . " I found and felt in myself that I was delivered from the burden that had so heavily oppressed me . The spirit of mourning was taken from me , and I knew what it was truly to rejoice in God my Savior . For some time I could not avoid singing psalms wherever I was ; but my joy became gradually more settled . " But he had much to learn after that turning point in his history ; and in the study of himself , he was no unapt or dull scholar . Few perhaps have excelled him in the science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the human heart , or more skillfully analyzed its multiform and mysterious workings . With this deep experience of what was in himself , he was so situated as to have opportunity to learn human nature , as exhibited by others , in a great variety of forms . Born in an inn , he there saw man in an attitude which he seldom presents elsewhere . Removing from place to place in the course of his preparatory education , he came in contact with mind in a great diversity of circumstances . When he began to preach , he commenced anew the great study of man ; and thus , what with studying himself and others and various reading , he came to have an unusual knowledge of human nature . This gave him great power as a preacher of the gospel . Knowing so well what was in himself , and " as in water face answereth to face , so the heart of man to man , " also what was in other men , he could address himself to others with a skill sure as instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to him . This enabled him to speak from his own heart to other hearts-from his own conscience to other consciences-from // his own experience to the varying conditions of other minds . The abasing yet elevating , painful yet joyful , simple yet sublime truths of the Gospel , had all been authenticated in the humblings and elevations , the conflicts and triumphs of his own breast . " He spoke what he knew , and testified what he had seen and felt . " His preaching was not made up of dry abstractions and cold technicalities and vague generalities ; but it contained living realities drawn fresh and glowing from the heart . Its staple was not of the letter which killeth , hut of the spirit that giveth life . His pictures were not mere copies , but originals , conceived at first in his own soul , and then sketched boldly with a master 's hand and held up to the view of dying men , instinct with life and full of power . Was the sinfulness of man 's heart the theme of discourse ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had felt the bitterness of sin and been chained to its cruel servitude . Did he persuade sinners to become reconciled to God ? his persuasion was almost resistless , because he knew in his own experience the reasonableness and joys of reconciliation . When he portrayed the consequences of continued unbelief , and pointed to a coming judgment and the retributions of eternity , it was with the earnestness , the melting pathos of one who had often made that judgment a reality in his own vivid imagination , and looked into the " lake that burneth . " This may account for a species of egotism-modest but not unpleasant-which we find running through nearly all his sermons . He touches a point in Christian experience . How natural to illustrate it by what his own heart has taught him . He grapples with some difficulty that causes the young Christian to stumble and despair . What more effective mode to dispose of it can he employ , than to tell how it troubled himself and how he obtained the mastery over it ? " He thinks aloud about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about their own perplexities , dilemmas , and temptations . He shows them his own soul , merely to prove that no strange thing has befallen ' their souls . " Let the following passage serve as a specimen of this clerical egotism . " Do not say that I preach despair . I despair of no one , when I consider how God had mercy on such a wretch as I , who was running in a full career to hell . I was hasting thither ; but Jesus Christ passed by and stopped me . Jesus Christ passed by while I was in my blood , and bid me live . Thus I am a monument of God 's free grace ; and , therefore , my brethren , I despair of none of you , when I consider , I say , what a wretch I was . " Looking upon one who was openly profane , grossly vicious and who gloried in his shame , he exclaimed with irrepressible emotion , " but for the grace of God , there goes George Whitefield ! " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust I feel somewhat of a sense of God 's distinguishing love upon my heart ; therefore I must divert a little from congratulating believers , to invite poor Christless sinners to come to him , and accept his righteousness , that they may have life . Alas , my heart almost bleeds ! What a multitude of precious souls are now before me ! How shortly must all be ushered into eternity ! and yet , 0 cutting thought , was God now to require all your souls , how few , comparatively speaking , could really say , The Lord our righteousness . ' " And think you , 0 sinners , that you will be able to stand in the day of judgment , if Christ be not your righteousness ! No , that alone is the wedding garment in which you must appear . 0 Christless sinners , I am distressed for you ! the desires of my soul are enlarged . 0 that // this may be an accepted time ! That the Lord may be your righteousness ! for whither would you flee , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding yourselves from his presence . The pitiful figleaves of your own righteousness will not cover your nakedness , when God shall call you to stand before him . 0 think of death ! 0 think of judgment ! Yet a little while , and time shall be no more ; and then what will become of you , if the Lord be not your righteous-ness While thus speaking , says his biographer , " his face was a language , and his intonation music , and his action passion . " Could he have spoken thus , and held multitudes in breathless silence hour after hour , had he not declared what he had seen and testified what he had felt ? Surely nothing short of this utterance of the heart , this disclosure of the realities of his own deep experience , could have packed the houses where he preached to suffocation , and caused " multitudes to follow him home weeping . " Though his sermons were elaborated in the bead , they must have been " carried through the heart , " or they could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his large knowledge of human nature , enabled him to adapt himself to all classes of mind and to the varying conditions of those whom he addressed . He knew , as by intuition , when to construct the chain of elaborate argument , when to lead captive the imagination , when to urge the claims of law and duty upon the conscience , and when to apply all his power of entreaty , persuasion and pathos directly to the heart . He had in an eminent degree this quality of an effective preacher of the Gospel ; a knowledge of the nature of the material he had to work upon . Without this , he might have had uncommon powers of intellect , and yet made but little impression upon the minds of others . Without this , he could not have exhibited that wonderful skill , that almost miraculous sagacity , which enabled him so powerfully to affect alike the rich and the poor , the philosopher and the collier . Without this the name of George Whitefield had never been interchangeable with " prince of preachers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complex and mysterious workings of the human heart , he understood also with unusual clearness the nature of the means with which he was to reach and mould that heart . In other words , He was " mighty in the Scriptures . " Before he took orders as a preacher of righteousness , he was accustomed to spend much time in perusing the word of God and those books which illustrated divine truth . On one occasion he says , " Though weak , I often spent two hours in my evening retirements , and prayed over my Greek Testament and Bishop Hall 's most excellent Contemplations . " " While thus engaged in searching the Scriptures , he discovered the true grounds of a sinner 's hope and justification . The testimony of God concerning his Son became power unto salvation . " Again he says , " My mind being now more open and enlarged , I began to read the holy Scriptures upon my knees , laying aside all other books , and praying over , if possible , every line and word . This proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily received fresh life , light , and power from above . I got more true knowledge from reading the book of God in one month than I could ever have acquired from all the writings of men . In one word , 1 found it profitable for reproof , for correction , for instruction , every way sufficient to make the man of God perfect , thoroughly furnished for every good work and word . About this time , // God was pleased to enlighten my soul and bring me into the knowledge of his free grace , and the necessity of being justified in his sight by faith alone . Burkitt 's and Henry s Expositions were of admirable use to lead me into this and all other Gospel truths . " After his ordination and his first appearance in London , he returned to Oxford , and there he " devoted the chief part of his time to the study of Henry 's Commentary . " How highly he valued this work may be seen from the manner in which he expressed his gratitude to God for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished him . " Forever blessed be divine goodness ! " Most heartily did he respond to the sublime eulogy pronounced by the psalmist on God 's word : " The law of God is perfect , converting the soul . " " How love I thy law ! it is my meditation all the day . " " Thy word have I hid in my heart . " No one can read the life of Whitefield , or peruse those sermons of his , which , imperfect as they are , have been preserved , without perceiving his uncommon familiarity with the word of God . In almost every paragraph of his discourses you find either a direct quotation , or obvious allusion , or brief paraphrase , which shows you clearly that his whole soul was imbued with the spirit of the Gospel , and his trains of thought suggested and carried forward by " the words in which the Holy Ghost spoke to holy men of old . " Now it can not be questioned that this extensive and intimate acquaintance with the truths and language of revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ . He might have been vastly more profound than he was in the exact sciences , and much more learned in the literature of the ancients and the moderns ; he might have explored the whole circle of intellectual and moral philosophy , and been perfectly at home in all the arts of the dialectician and the rhetorician ; and yet , deficient in respect to a knowledge of the word of God , he could not have excelled as he did as a preacher of the everlasting Gospel . His sermons might have been carefully elaborated and full of historical and classical allusions ; they might have contained ingenious essays on morality , subtle disquisitions on the nature and advantages of virtue , and the disadvantages of vice ; they might withal have been pronounced in the most finished style of elocution ; yet , had they not exhibited a profound and familiar knowledge of the word of God , and been shaped and characterized by the demands of God 's own truth , he never could have produced such effects as he did upon the diversified classes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be mighty in human science , in philosophy , in literature , is one thing ; to be " mighty in the Scriptures , " is quite another and altogether a superior thing . This power is indeed indispensable to the effective preacher . If a man presents himself before a company of immortal beings , professedly to teach them how to escape the consequences of sin , and how to render their immortality blessed and glorious , he does little more than perpetrate an absurdity , at least an impertinence , if he leave out of his ministrations the instructions of the Holy Spirit on those subjects which constitute the essence of the Gospel . No matter what else he preaches , if his sermons are not imbued with the spirit of Gospel truth , if he depend not on this for his groundwork , superstructure , finish and effect , he preaches to very little purpose . His declamations , and soarings , and fancies , will be as powerless as a pageant , if the mind be not illumined by divine light , and the deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God 's word . His trumpet gives an uncertain sound , so fights he as one that beateth the air . An intimate acquaintance with the words and facts  --  the biography , history , prophecy , poetry , doctrines and precepts of the Bible , will enable him to speak with authority , and to produce an effect , to which the transient results of mere secular eloquence are tame and insignificant . George Whitefield spoke not so much in the words which man 's wisdom teacheth as in those which the Holy Ghost teacheth-words fitly chosen and fitly spoken , like apples of gold in pictures of silver ; and hence he went to the thronged churches in the metropolis of Great Britain , and to the ten thousands in Moorfields and the gathering multitudes in America , " in demonstration of the Spirit and in power . " He had studied the Bible for himself , had obtained clear perceptions of its great and majestic truths , knew that they would be mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds , and used them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armory of heaven to contend with spiritual wickedness in high places and in low places . " He uttered his message in freeness and fervor , with the belief that there is an importance , a dignity , a worth attached to it , which the most reckless must respect , and a power inherent which the most obdurate must feel . His deep-felt confidence in his weapon , his bold relief of doctrine , often arrested attention , and by the Spirit 's aid subdued the heart , when a doubtful and faltering utterance would have been met with the most vacant indifference , if not with positive scorn . " A distinguished modern divine has recorded his own experience of an intelligent study of the divine word , in the following graphic language : " It has given me more intelligence in the things of God , more conviction of what is truth , more confidence in preaching the Gospel , more elevation above the atmosphere of vapors , and hobbies and isms , more rich and vanous furniture for the sacred desk , more stability in religious vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigor and equability of faith , and so has done me more substantial good , probably ,  --  than all other ways and means , with the use of all other books in my library . " Doubtless Whitefield would have recorded his experience on this point , in language equally strong . Cowper never could have applied to him the remonstrance , which , when applied , cut with so keen an edge . " If true , then why resort at every torn , To Athens or to Rome for wisdom short Of men 's occasions , when in Him reside Grace , knowledge com store ? * , fort , an unfathomed How oft , when Paul hath served us with a text , Hath Epictetus , Plato , Tully , preached ! " In continuing our estimate of Whitefield 's power as a preacher , we must not omit to mention that he had a deep sense of the magnitude and importance of his office . Writing to a dear friend , June 20 , 1736 , he says , " This is a day much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was solemnly admitted by good Bishop Benson , before many witnesses , into holy orders . I endeavored to behave with unaffected devotion ; but not suitable enough to the greatness of the office I was to undertake . At the same time , I trust , I answered to every question from the bottom of my heart , and heartily prayed that God might say , Amen . I hope the good of souls will be my only principle of action . Let come what will-life or death , depth or height-I shall henceforth live like one , who , this day , in the presence of men and angels , took the holy sacrament upon the profession of being inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon me that ministration in the church . I // can call heaven and earth to witness , that when the Bishop laid his hand upon me , I gave myself up to be a martyr for Him who hung upon the cross for me . I have thrown myself blindfold , and , I trust , without reserve , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe , that until you hear of my dying for or in my work , you will not be apprised of all the preferment that is expected by G. W. " His recent biographer subjoins , " Perhaps no mind , since the apostolic age , has been more deeply affected , or suitably exercised , by the laying on of hands ' than Whitefield was . A supernatural unction from the Holy One , could hardly have produced greater moral effects . That high sense of responsibility , that singleness of heart , that entire and intense devotedness of soul , body , and spirit , which characterized the first embassadors of Christ , seems revived in him . Accordingly , after reading the narrative of his ordination , we naturally expect from Whitefield a sort , of apostolic career . After witnessing at the altar a spirit wound up to the highest pitch of ardor , throbbing and thrilling with strong emotions , and , like a renovated eagle , impatient to burst off , we naturally look for a corresponding swiftness of flight and width of sweep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that follows . His unbosomings of himself disclose in his heart a secret place of thunder , ' and a fountain of tears , ' from which we expect alternate bursts of terror and tenderness-bolts of Sinai and dew of Hermon ; and we shall not be disappointed . " This feeling of responsibility and deep sense of the magnitude of . his work followed Whitefield through the whole course of his ministry . Hence he was wont to express himself in the following caustic manner in reference to such as Paul would probably have styled novices . " It has long since been my judgment , that it would be best for many of the present preachers to have a tutor and retire for a while , and be content with preaching now and then , till they were a little more improved . Otherwise I fear that many who now make a temporary figure , for want of a proper foundation , will run themselves out of breath , will grow weary of the work and leave it . " In regard to himself he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infirmities , as against going into holy orders too soon . However some may come to preach here and there , I have prayed hundreds of times that God would not let me go too soon . I remember once at Gloucester-I know the room , and I can not help looking up at the window when I am there and going by ; I know the bedside , I know the floor , on which I have been prostrate for weeks together , crying , I can not go ; I am a novice ; I shall fall into the condemnation of the devil . Yet I wanted to be at Oxford ; I wanted to stay there three or four years , that I might make one hundred and fifty sermons at least , for I wished to set up with a stock in trade . I remember wrestling , praying , groaning , striving with God ; and I said , I am undone , unfit to speak in thy name ; my God , send me not . ' After I had written to all my friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into my mind- ' My sheep hear my voice , and none shall pluck them out of my hand . ' Then I said , Lord , I will go : send me when thou wilt . " ' Most deeply did he feel that " if any man desire the office of bishop , he desireth a good work , " and a great work ; and it was his constant care to " magnify his office , " whenever and wherever he was called to exercise his ministry . " Believing himself to be the messenger of God , commissioned to call sinners to re // pentance , he spoke as one conscious of his high credentials , with authority and power . " Had he imagined that this office could rightly be asstimed , the principal intent being the obtainment of a living , had he entered upon this work merely because he must be *employed somewhere and somehow , had he adopted this calling because he was ambitious to enter upon one of the learned professions ,  --  or had he become a minister in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this profession for literary pursuits , or for pursuing the chase and following the giddy pleasures and fashionable frivolities of high life ,  --  he would never have been , " now the son of thunder and now the messenger of consolation " that he was . But feeling that God had called him to a great work , that it was sufficient to put in requisition all his talents and resources , that it involved vast responsibilities , and took deep hold upon eternity , he preached as a dying man to dying men , and concentrated all his energies for the accomplishment of one glorious object ,  --  and that to win the greatest possible number of souls to Christ . Neither place nor power , neither love nor money , neither fear nor favor ,  --  could have induced him to impair the dignity or detract from the magnitude of his office by becoming a school teacher to augment his income , or to descend from the exalted sphere of an embassador of Christ to stand for a seat in Parliament , or go on a mission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descent , whether from friend or foe , his prompt and emphatic reply would have been , " I am doing a great work , so that I can not come down to you . Why should the work cease , while I leave it to come down ? " Draw near , ye who make merchandise of the sacred office , or imagine that no peculiar responsibility attaches to the work of negotiating between God and man , and contemplate Whitefield overwhelmed in view of the magnitude of his calling , and yielding for life all his powers and attainments to its solemn duties . Look at him especially as he enters " the pulpit , " which " Must stand acknowledged while the world shall stand , The most important and effectual guard , Support , and ornament , of virtue 's cause . There stands the messenger of truth ; there stands The legate of the skies - His theme divine , His office sacred , his credentials clear . By him the violated law speaks out Its thunders ; and hy him , in strains as sweet As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mutatis mutandis , et de te fabula narratur . " Another element of power in the preaching of Whitefield , was a practical sagacity which he had in an eminent degree  --  a talent of nice selection and wise adaptation , which enabled him " rightly to divide the word of truth and give to each one his portion in due season . " When he read prayers and expounded the Scriptures to the poor , he knew what was needed , and with consummate skill adapted himself to the wants and capacities of his hearers . When he went between decks and preached to the sailors and soldiers during his voyages across the Atlantic , he so preached that the profane learnt to speak with reverence the name of God , and the scoffer became serious and prayerful . Why ? Because he had sagacity to perceive what was needed in their case , wisdom to make the right application of truth , and the Holy Spirit crowned with success labors thus directed . When he told the story of the cross to multitudes made up of nearly all classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the unwise . " To the Jew , he became a Jew , that he might gain the Jew ; to the Roman , a Roman , that he might gain him . " When he preached before lords and philosophers , he was wise to adapt himself to their particular wants and circumstances , and , r // though some smiled and scoffed , and would have no part nor lot in the great salvation ; how hardly shall they that are rich enter the kingdom ! not many wise , not many noble are called ; - yet he always produced effect , and was instrumental in bringing some to the knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus . So attractive was his preaching to many in high life , that at Bath , in Lady Huntingdon 's new chapel , there was a seat with curtains specially provided for bishops . It was often occupied too . With peculiar significance this seat with vails was styled the Nicodemite corner . David Hume pronounced Whitefield the most ingenious preacher he ever heard ; and said , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant man , being asked what he thought of the preaching of Whitefield , replied , that he preached like a lion ; * no unapt notion , " says Dr. Southey , " of the force , and vehemence , and passion of that oratory which awed the hearers , and made them tremble like Felix before the Apostle . " No one can read the life or the imperfect sermons that remain of Whitefield , without according to him a large measure of that practical sagacity and nice discrimination , which enabled the preacher so to adapt himself to the ever varying condition and wants of his hearers , as always to produce effect . He felt that the Gospel contains something fitted to meet all classes of men , all states of mind , and all shades of character ; and hence , he studied to be pertinent , to put right things in right places , to say what he ought to say and when he ought to say it . He would not cause the nail to start back by giving it a single blow after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave it where it would do no execution . The accuracy of this representation is shown by the following testimony of Cornelius Winter . " The difference of the times in which Whitefield made his public appearance , materially determined the matter of his sermons , and in some measure , the manner of his address . Whatever the world might think of him , he had his charms for the learned as well as for the unlearned ; and as he held himself to be a debtor both to the wise and the unwise , each received his due at such times . The peer and the peasant alike went away satisfied ' Our course of thought leads us to inquire in the next place , what use Whitefield made of the imagination , in producing such remarkable effects upon the minds of his fellow men . It was stated near the beginning of this article , that George Whitefield was endowed by his Creator with intellectual faculties of a high order . Perhaps for no power of mind was he so much distinguished as the one now brought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution , which induced him to contract in early life so great a fondness for dramatic writers . It was this which enabled him to present such vivid pictures before the mental eye of his auditors , that all seemed for the hour to be amid scenes of enchantment . It was this which gave him wings to soar into eternity , and dwell now amid the radiant verities of an eternal weight of glory , and now in the soul 's great charnel-house , amid the dread realities of the second death . It was this which infused so abundantly into all his sermons the elements of the dramatic . Hear him descanting upon Peter 's request to Christ on the mount of transfiguration . " Peter , when he had drank a little of Christ 's new wine , speaks like a person intoxicated ; he was overpowered by the brightness of the manifestations . Let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elms ? It is well added , not knowing what // he said . ' That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to be here , ' in such good company , and in so glorious a condition , is no wonder ; which of us all would not have been apt to do the same ? But to talk of building tabernacles , and one for Christ , and one for Moses , and one for Elias , was surely something for which Peter himself must stand reproved . Surely , Peter , thou wast not quite awake ! Thou talkest like one in a dream . If thy Lord had taken thee at thy word , what a poor tabernacle thou wouldst have had , in comparison with that house not made with hands , eternal in the heavens , in which thou hast long since dwelt , now the earthly house of the tabernacle of thy body is dissolved . What ! build tabernacles below , and have the crown before thou hast borne the cross ? 0 Peter , Peter ! Master , spare thyself , ' sticks too , too closely to thee . And why so selfish , Peter ? Carest thou not for thy fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee to the mount ? Carest thou not for the precious souls that are as sheep having no shepherd , and must perish forever unless thy master descends from the mount , to teach and to die for them ? Wouldst thou thus eat thy spiritual morsels alone ? Besides , if thou art for building tabernacles , why must there be three of them ; one for Christ , one for Moses , and one for Elms ? Are Christ and the prophets divided ? Do they not sweetly harmonize and agree in one ? Did they not prophesy concerning the sufferings of thy Lord , as well as of the glory that should follow ? Alas ! how unlike is their conversation to thine . Moses and Elias came down to talk of suffering ; and thou art dreaming of building I know not what tabernacles . Surely , Peter , thou art so high upon the mount , that thy head seems giddy . " He would bring the Savior in the attitude of prayer vividly before the minds of his hearers . How does he attempt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contemplate him in this touching posture ? By calling upon all , with great parade of words and assumed pathos , to drag near that they may behold the greatest wonder that the universe ever saw ? Nothing like it . " Hark , hark ! do you not hear him ? " " I have known him , " says Winter , " avail himself of the formality of the judge putting on his black cap , to pronounce sentence . With his eyes full of tears , and his heart almost too big to admit of speech , he would say , after a momentary pause , I am now going to put on my condemning cap . Sinner , I MUST do it ! I must pronounce sentence ! ' Then in a strain of tremendous eloquence , he would repeat our Lord 's words , Depart ye cursed ! ' and not without a very powerful description of the nature of that curse. ** One other example must suffice . It is thus related by an eye-witness . " Once , after a solemn pause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just about to leave the threshold of this sanctuary , and ascend to heaven . And shall he ascend , and not bear with him the news of one sinner , among all this multitude , reclaimed from the error of his ways ? ' To give the greater effect to this exclamation , Whitefield stamped with his foot , lifted up his hands and eyes to heaven , and cried aloud , Stop , Gabriel , stop , ere you enter the sacred portals , and yet carry with you the news of one sinner converted to God . ' This address was accompanied with such animated yet natural action , that it surpassed any thing I ever saw or heard in any other preacher . " These examples may show us that one of the commanding and prominent elements of Whitefield 's power as a preacher , was a vivid , almost creative , yet on the whole chastened and sanctified imagina // tion . This would not allow him to speak coldly , to deal in dry abstractions , to dress up a body without a soul for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ; his pictures were hold in outline , graphic in the filling up , colored to the life , and placed before the mind 's eye , not as mere paintings , but living , acting beings . He made his hearers feel that God and Christ , and heaven and hell , are all solemn realities ; and while he aimed first of all and more than all , to commend himself to every man 's conscience in the sight of God , he did not deem it hostile to his object , to transform the abstract into the concrete , to have his skeletons rounded out in all their parts into the beauty of fair proportions , and to breathe into them the breath of life . The dramatic element was so strong in him , that he presented to the beholder only those scenes in which be had lived and moved himself ; and thus presenting them , he made all who beheld , feel , not merely that important scenes were passing before them , but that they themselves were passing with them , nay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that so beautifully expressed by one of the most accomplished of our modern writers . " Logic forms an excellent body for a discourse ; we assent to it , we approve it , it is good , all good , but it awakens no admiration . It is not till rhetoric sends its warm life-blood to mantle on the cold cheek of logic , and clothes its angular form in the garments of taste , that we begin to admire the discourse . " This theory he reduced to practice whenever he prepared a discourse for the pulpit . By a vivid imagination , he was able to clothe with life the great themes on which he treated ; and thus he awakened attention , elicited admiration , roused the conscience , and by the attendant energies of the Spirit , subdued the will and transformed the man . He did not often descend so low in dramatizing his themes as Bunyan , for instance , in the following passage . " They that will have heaven must run for it , because the devil , the law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never a poor soul that is going to heaven , but the devil , the law , sin , death and hell make after that soul . And I will assure you the devil is nimble , he can run apace , he is light of foot ; he bath overtaken many ; he bath turned up their heels , and bath given them an everlasting fall . Also the law ; that can shoot a great way ; have a care that thou keep out of the reach of those great guns , the ten commandments . Hell also bath a wide mouth , and can stretch itself farther than you are aware of . If this were well considered , then thou , as well as I , wouldst say , they that will have heaven , must run for it . " He was careful to avoid what might beget lightness in such presentations ; and his scenes were always touching and power ful , because there was so much of solemnity , such deep pathos in his whole aspect . In this respect , he nearly resembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply metaphysical and distinguished for the dramatic element . Did he wish to bring God 's law home to the conscience of the sinner-it was not by presenting a series of frigid abstractions that he accomplished his aim . He took his audience with him to Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim ; brought them into the midst of the twelve tribes of Israel ; made them hear the Levites read the curses pronounced against the law-breaker , and all the thousands of Jacob utter their loud Amen . " Cursed is he that confirmeth not all the words of the law to do them ; and all the people shall say , Amen . " Having shown how heinous is the transgression of the holy law , and what a tremendous doom awaits the sinner , he brought the objector upon the stage to state his exceptions to what // 1845 . Elements of Power in the Preaching of H/7titefield. had been advanced . " Then , " says Trumbull , " Gabriel was brought down to show the futility of these objections , and the impious presumption of making them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered , and the opponent was triumphantly swept from the stage . The argument gained strength and beauty through the whole progress . " " It seemed as if so many new witnesses were summoned for the truth . The stern doctrines of the Gospel assumed a lifesomeness and a plausibility , which they could not possess on the coldness of abstract detail , and to each sinner there seemed to come a voice pronouncing upon him the fearful doom and demanding his ap . proving Amen . " We should be glad to quote in this connection a beautiful passage from one of Prof. Tholuck 's sermons . It is intended to represent to the sinner the danger of delay in religion ; and is perhaps as fine a specimen as any language affords of the higher dramatic power . " Too late , " are the words which indicate the passage , but our limits forbid the quotation . To the prominence of this element of the dramatic in his mental constitution , Whitefield was indebted for a large share of his popularity with the multitudes , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be really worth while for all our clergymen to inquire whether enough is made of this in our present style of preaching , and what are the causes why so few excel in it . The examples of Bunyan , of Whitefield , of Jeremy Taylor , of Bellamy , of Payson , of Tholuck , seem to rebuke its neglect , and summon all to its cultivation and its discreet use . In proceeding with our estimate of Whitefield 's powers , we must not overlook the diligent and unwearied attention which he gave to manner . We refer to his manner both of preparing and delivering his sermons . Philip says , " There was much art in Whitefield 's preaching ; I mean , the art of studying to be perfectly natural in all things pertaining to real life and godliness . He left nothing to accident that he could regulate by care in his delivery . Hence practiced speakers and shrewd observers could tell at once whenever he delivered a sermon for the first time . " It was thought by Foote and Garrick that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sermon for the fortieth time . Then every glance of his eye , every movement of his muscles , every attitude of his body , and every intonation of his voice , contributed to the deep and marvellous impression which he produced . Franklin says , " By hearing him often , I came to distinguish easily between sermons newly composed and those he had preached often in the course of his travels . His delivery of the latter was so improved by frequent repetition , that every accent , every emphasis , every modulation of voice , was so perfectly turned and well placed , that without being interested in the subject , one could not help being pleased with the discourse . " His manner was greatly varied , in accordance with the ever changing circumstances in which he was placed , but always appropriate and effective . He felt it to be his duty to obey the commands given to some of the prophets , to smite with the hand , stamp with the foot , and lift up the voice like a trumpet , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his impassioned paragraphs , it might have been said of him , as it was of one of the German reformers- " Vivi. dus vultus , vividi oculi , vividmn manus , denique omnia vivida . " It is worthy of note , however , that whether he stamped or wept , whether he put on the boldness of the // Jan. lion , or assumed the gentleness of the lamb , whether he roared in the tornado , or whispered in the gentle zephyr , he was always solemn . " There was no levity in his lively sallies , and no dullness in his reasonings , and no departure from the spirit of his mission , even when he used market language . ' " In his preaching all modes of address were made to contribute solemn impressions . In his modulations of voice , his gestures , his features , the gleamings of his eye , there was such a combination of vivacity and solemnity , " that the most dissipated and thoughtless found their attention involuntarily fixed . " " Nothing awkward , " says Winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulpit , nor do I ever recollect his stumbling on a word . Whether he frowned or smiled , whether he looked grave or placid , it was nature acting in him . " There was something in White . field 's manner which fascinated the illiterate as well as the learned , the poor as well as the rich . One of his converts , nearly a hundred years old , was visited a few years since , and asked whether he remembered Whitefleld 's person . The old man brightened at the question , and said , sure : he was a jolly , brave man ; and what a look he had , when he put out his right hand , thus , to rebuke a disturber , as tried to stop him under the pear-tree . The man had been very threatening and noisy ; but he could not stand the look . Off he rode , and Whitefield saidThere he goes ; empty barrels make the most din . ' He was a jolly , brave man , and sich a look with him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in original endowment and in cultivation ? Because , amongst other reasons , he gave attention ,  --  *-laborious , careful , unwearied attention , to both the composition and delivery of his discourses . The parts of a sermon which came " feebly from the tongue and fell heavily on the ear , " were laid aside , and their places supplied by fresh material , more skillfully arranged , and better adapted to produce effect . This thorough preparation beforehand gave him complete mastery of himself and his subject ; and hence , when new thoughts presented themselves in the course of delivery and the inspiration of favored moments , he was ready to seize upon them with eagerness and appropriate them to his noble aims . This may account for the following statemen tofSouthey : " They who lived with him could trace him , in his sermons , to the book which he had last been reading , or the subject which had recently taken his attention . But the salient points of his oratory were not prepared passages , they were bursts of passion , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full play . " Yes ; but what unwearied pains , what earnest and varied study beforehand is requisite , in order that the spring may be in full play ! Was Whitefield right in giving such heed to preparation in advance of delivery , and in bestowing so much attention upon tones , gestures , looks , as well as words ? " Then how many like myself , " inquires his biographer , " are far wrong ? Let the rising ministry take warning . Awkwardness in the pulpit is a sin , monotony a sin , dullness a sin , and all of them sins against the welfare of immortal souls . You would not dare to violate grammar ; dare not to be vulgar or vapid in manner . Your spirituality of mind is too low , and your communion with God too slight , and your love of the truth too cold , if they can be endangered by cultivating an eloquence worthy of the pulpit . " Was the subject of our remarks ever injured in spirit , was he less devotional , did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwearied pains-taking // in the preparation and utterance of his discourses ? Perhaps no man ever lived nearer to God , or felt the " powers of the world to come " more intensely than Whitefield ; and few have ever paid more attention to the qualities of the true orator . " He was too devotional to he cooled by rules , and too natural to be spoiled by art , and too much in earnest to win souls to neglect system . " What a contrast to some examples presented in our own day ! A modern writer , a little tinged perhaps with the spirit of exaggeration , tells us " of arms that sail about like the arms of a windmill , and with as little meaning ; and of the more common sawing , hammering , and punching , that suggest a doubt whether the man was not intended for a different trade from that of speaking ; of a distortion of countenance like that of Piso , who as Cicero tells us , spake in the senate with one eyebrow screwed up to the forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin . " And yet how loud , how imperative is the demand for a manner in the preacher , suited to the subject , and adapted to arrest attention . " We are so made that looks , tones and gestures , if adjusted according to nature , and the offspring of a living soul within , arrest and move us . There is something within our breasts , which solicits the orator 's touch , and which is quick and gen. erous in its response . " A graphic writer has said , " The multitude are ready to swallow any thing that comes in the shape of rhetoric . They are hungering and thirsting for it ; they are lifting up their souls for it , to the pulpit , the bar , to the senate chamber ; they are ready to be instructed , to be moved ; to be aroused , transported-yes , the most obdurate to be melted , the dullest to be charmed , if the power and the wisdom , come in the form of eloquence . " Says Bishop Middleton , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some . " A greater than he has said to the minister of Christ , " Study to show thyself approved unto God , a workman that needeth not to be ashamed . Meditate upon these things ; give thyself wholly to them ; that thy profiting may appear in all things . " " And because the preacher was wise , he still taught the people knowledge ; yea , he gave good heed , and sought to find out acceptable words . " " A word fitly spoken , is like apples of gold in pictures of silver . " Thus far , in enumerating the elements of power in the preaching of Whitefield , we have spoken of his original endowments of mind ; of the manner in which his intellectual powers were trained ; of accurate and varied knowledge of human nature ; of his large acquaintance with the holy Scriptures ; of his deep sense of the magnitude and solemnity of his office ; of his practical sagacity in the adaptations of truth ; of the use he made of the imagination , or his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bestowed upon both the manner of preparing and the manner of delivering his discourses . Would the limits of this article admit , we might allude to his possession of a person " graceful and well-proportioned , a stature above the middle size , a fair complexion , a manly countenance , and a very sprightly eye " - as auxiliary to his power as a pulpit orator . We should speak also of organs of utterance which could command a volume of sound sufficient to reach the ears of twenty thousand persons at the same time , and whose lowest whispers would thrill through the heart of that vast multitude . Garrick declared that he could move to tears , or make men tremble , by his wonderful intonations in pronouncing the word Mesopotamia . Nor would we think it aside from the // spirit of our theme , to dwell upon a native ardor of temperament which conduced , even amid much weariness and corporeal pain , to an animated and vivid presentation of the great truths of salvation . Said an aged divine , who practically exemplifies his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential requisites in a preacher , Temperament . When asked , what is a second , he replied , Temperament . To the question reiterated , he again answered , Temperament . The quality intended to be expressed by this answer , Whitefield possessed in an eminent degree . This helped him to be energetic , when others would have languished in their impotency ; to be cheerful and buoyant , when others would have been sad and drooping ; to be abundant in labors , and joyful in the Lord , when many would have shrunk from all effort , and become the prey of despair ; to overcome difficulties and overmaster temptations , which would have been insuperable by others and reduced them to subjection. - Jt would also be necessary to a complete development of our subject , to dwell somewhat at length upon the state of the religious community in Whitefield 's day . It differed in many respects from what it is now . There was far less general intelligence , and far less knowledge of the doctrines of the Gospel . When Whitefield , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelty to aid the impression which he made . " They had never heard of regeneration but at the baptismal font ; and that told them of its beginning and completion in the same breath . " The leaders of the people in religion were accustomed to say , " that we should go to our baptism for the date of our regeneration . " On this and its kindred themes there was great ignorance and confusion of mind among the people ; following the lead of blind guides , they were in a place most of all unfavorable to any clear views or just appreciation of the realities of divine truth . Whitefield burst upon them at once as an angel of light . He brushed away the cobwebs of error , stripped off the disguises that had been thrown around the truth , and brought before the minds of the people the simple and sublime truths of the Gospel as subjects in which they were personally interested . Under his treatment the new birth , repentance , faith , God and his Son Jesus Christ , heaven , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and he was made to feel that there was something in his moral nature that responded to these spiritual realities , and connected him with the solemn retributions of eternity . To him Whitefield was an original . He took truths that long before had been taught , freed them from the dust and rubbish that had been accumulating for ages , and , in forms of interest and new proportions , threw them into wide circulation . In estimating his power as a preacher , therefore , the state of the times in which he commenced his career must by no means be overlooked . Being an original in those times , the force of novelty contributed its full proportion in swelling that tide of influence over the public mind which acquired for him the title of " prince of preachers . " It is not intended , however , by this statement , to imply that Whitefield would not be a remarkable and powerful preacher at the present day . Such powers of mind as he had , such training , such a religious experience , such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boldness and energy , would make a man popular and effective any where and in any age . The man who could preach in 1740 so as to elicit encomiums like the following , from the most competent judges , could also make himself heard and // felt in 1844 . " He appeared to me , * in all his discourses , very deeply affected and impressed in his own heart . How did that burn and boil within him , when he spake of the things he had made touching the King ! ' How was his tongue like the pen of a ready writer , touched as with a coal from the altar ! With what a flow of wordswhat a ready profusion of language , did he speak to us upon the great concerns of our souls . In what a flaming light did he set our eternity before us ! How earnestly he pressed Christ upon us ! How did he move our passions with the constraining love of such a Redeemer ! The awe , the silence , the attention which sat upon the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could reign over all their powers . Many thought he spake as never man spake before him . So charmed were the people with his manner of address , that they shut up their shops , forgot their secular business , and laid aside their schemes for the world ; and the oftener he preached , the keener edge he seemed to put upon their desires to hear him again . How close , strong , and pungent were his applications to the conscience ; mingling light and heat ; pointing the arrows of the Almighty at the hearts of sinners , while he poured in the balm upon the wounds of the contrite , and made broken bones rejoice . Eternal themes , the tremendous solemnities of our religion , were all alive upon his tongue . " In connection with the thought above exhibited , it ought to be stated that the fact that Whitefleld had power , greatly increased his power . The popularity which he had acquired at an early stage of his ministry , was a means of augmenting his popularity . This necessarily implies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellences beforehand ; and yet it did undoubtedly operate so as to add to his power and extend his influence . His case affords a fine illustration of the principle , that " to him who bath , shall be given , and he shall have more abundantly . " Having five talents ' when he began , he went and traded with them , ' until he had increased them to ten . Once having established his reputation as a preacher , it " had a purpose to be his purveyor , " and always heralded his approach . To hear him , " expectation was on tiptoe . " When he arrived , all were on the qui vive . ' When he took his stand in the pulpit , or on the temporary platform prepared for him under the " peartree , " every eye was open , every ear unstopped , every mind awake , and every heart prepared to be interested and moved by his address . The gathered multitudes acted and reacted upon each other before and when he came ; the sea of upturned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if he should fail to meet all this expectation , he would fall far below himself ; and all the circumstances of the occasion , the outlines and filling up of the scene , conspired to give him a wonderful influence over the great mass of mind with which his own was to be brought into contact . But we must not dwell on topics like these , however pleasant and instructive it might be , if the limits of our article would allow it . We hasten to a close by a single additional remark . George Whit efield was eminently a holy man . From the time that he cordially embraced Christ as his Lord and Savior , to the hour when he went to his reward , his whole soul appears to have been devoutly consecrated to God . It was a maxim with him , that they who live through Christ , should live henceforth not unto themselves , but unto him who died for them , and rose again . ' He could * Sermon by the Rev. Josiah Smith , Charleston , S. C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That every faculty of his mind , every acquisition he had made in knowledge , every influence which he possessed , or could acquire , should be devoted to the service of God in the gospel of his Son , seemed to him not only important as contributing to his success in preaching , but pre-eminently reasonable . From the commencement of his course as a Christian , he said with all sincerity , with all his heart in his words , Lord , I am thine in body , soul and spirit-thine , now-thine , through life-thine , till death-thine , forever2 He had such assurance that be was really a converted man , that Christ was formed within him the hope of glory , and made unto him wisdom , righteousness , sanctification and redemption , that his mind was relieved in a great measure from embarrassment and perplexity on this point , and his undivided energies left free for the prosecution of his great work . He was not merely a moral man , or a serious minded man , or a gifted man , or a learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some future time ; but , as his life shows , a regenerated man . Nor was he merely a regenerated man ; but a man of deep and ardent piety . Daily he " walked with God . " As on the mount of trans. figuration , he gazed upon the Redeemer 's glory , till his own soul became penetrated with its beams , and itself radiant . Cultivating intimate fellowship with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ , he became a lucid medium of communicating a divine influence to his fellow men . As a general rule , he went from his closet to the pulpit , and returned from the pulpit to his closet . He walked " in the garden where his great and only master dwelleth , " and came forth daily " from that paradise , with his robes exhaling the perfume of its spices . " This made him interesting . This drew to him the attention and the hearts of the people . This enabled him to throw around them cords of influence , gentle and constraining , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself , kept his heart with all diligence , lived and preached for eternity . By purging himself from false ambition 's aspirations , and crucifying the flesh with its affections and its lusts , he became a vessel unto honor , ' sanctified , and meet for the Master 's use . Honest with himself and with his God , he could not deal " in the false commerce of unfelt truth . " Hear him describe his habits of spirituality , just before he took orders . " Oh , what sweet communion had I daily vouchsafed with God in prayer , after my coming to Gloucester ! How often have I been carried out beyond myself , when meditating in the fields ! How assuredly I felt that Christ dwelt in me and I in him ; and how daily did I walk in the comforts of the Holy Ghost , and was edified and refreshed in the multitude of peace ! " Again he writes , long after he had begun to preach , " There is nothing I dread more than having my heart drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be over with me indeed ; I must then bid adieu to zeal and fervency of spirit , and in effect bid the Lord Jesus depart from me . For alas , what room can there be for God , when a rival has taken possession of the heart ? My blood runs cold at the very thought thereof . I can not , indeed I can not away with it . " " It is not for me to tell how often I use secret prayer ; if I did not use it , nay , if in one sense I did not pray without ceasing , it would be difficult for me to keep up that frame of soul , which , by the divine blessing , I daily enjoy . " Speaking of his popularity , he says , " It is too much for one man to be received as I have been by thousands . The thoughts of it lay me low , but I can not get low enough . I would willingly sink into nothing before the // blessed Jesus , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitefield die , so that the cause of Christ may live . " In reading the Life of this wonderful man , noting his first introduction into the kingdom of Christ , and marking his progress as a preacher , from the time he was reported to have driven fifteen mad by his first sermon , till the day of his departure , when he exclaimed , Lord Jesus , I am weary in thy work , but not of thy work , '  --  the evidence is constantly breaking in upon us and accumulating , that he was a man of deep and ardent piety . His religion was spiritual . It entered the heart . It stirred and purified its depths ; and out of the abundance of the heart , the mouth spoke . " For touching hearts , the only secret known , My worthy friend , is this ; to have one of your own . " " After all , " says his biographer , " the grand secret of Whitefield 's power , was his devotional spirit . Had he been less prayerful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prince of preachers without the vail , because he was a Jacob within the vail . His face shone when he came from the mount , because he had been long alone with God upon the mount . He was so often at the throne , and always so near it , that , like the apocalyptic angel , he came down clothed with its rainbow . " " He loved the world that hated him ; the tear That dropped upon his Bible was sincere ; Assailed by scandal and the tongue of strife , His only answer was ,  --  a blameless life ; And he that forged , and he that threw .. the dart , Had each a brother 's interest in his heart . " Such were the endowments of the Rev. George Whitefield . Thus he felt , thus he prayed , thus he lived . Therefore , he acquired an influence over the multitudes unparalleled in the annals of preaching , and made for himself a name that will outlast stars and suns , and be had in everlasting remembrance . The following inscription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his memory , may not be an inappropriate close to this brief account of his excellences as a preacher .
