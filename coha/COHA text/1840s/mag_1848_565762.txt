txt and imbecility . The same is true in secular music . There is a great choice in pieces , in respect to character and influence . Pieces of the better sort may become a source of high enjoyment in hours of wearLness or relaxation . But the indulgence of an exclusive passion for secular music is scarcely consistent with excellence in religious song . The importance of this consideration seems not to be sufficiently understood ; especially in those Christian families where years of instruction and practice are devoted to the secular department , to the almost entire neglect of sacred music . We cnn not take leave of the subject of church music without offering a single suggestion to the educated classes of the community . If what we have said is true , it will readily be seen that much remains to be done which can not safely be entrusted either to thoughtless youth or to men of one idea . Other appliances than those of an artistical nature must be brought to bear upon the subject . A general knowledge of rhetoric , oratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with religious experience , will be found indispensable to success in that kind of training which is demanded . Zeal , susceptibility and enterprise are , to some extent , already enlisted in the cause-but there is need of more intelligence , religious principle and weight of character , to secure the right direction and the right issue . The work to be done can not be postponed for counteracting forces are now in action , that will not easily be impeded . The present is on the whole the most favorable period we have ever known for redeeming the character of religious music , and placing it upon a just basis . But the work will not be accomplished without an effort ,  --  and the favorable opportunity may soon pass . We commend the subject , therefore , to the immediate and earnest attention of those friends of religion who have intelligence and taste to discern the imperfections of our church music , and ability to apply the remedy . THE FRENCH REVOLUTION OF 1848 . SINCE the issue of our last number , events have transpired in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era in history . The suppressed popular agitation in England and Ireland , which in ordinary times would absorb our interest , has been quite distanced in public regard by the mighty movements on the continent . France , the Papal States , Naples , Sicily , Tuscany , Parma , Placentia , Modena , Lucca , Venice , Lombardy , Austria , Prussia , have been tossed on the billows of popular commotion or civil revolution . And in these States , as also in some others where the popular movement has been less violent or has been anticipated by concessions from the rulers-as in many of the smaller States of Germany and in the Netherlands-steps have been taken . within a few months , which , if they shall be rightly maintained , if there shall be no retrogression toward arbitrary rule , and no diversion toward popular anarchy , will accomplish more , for civil and religious freedom and the vast human interests dependent upon it , than has been accomplished in a previous century . We shall not attempt within the brief limits of this article to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be better to confine // our attention to the late movements in that nation which more than all others is an object of present interest-interest at once hopeful and fearful , joyful and painfulto France . There , a monarch , every where celebrated for his shrewdness and ability in government , who had long been seeking to establish his throne and the legitimacy of his family , who had rendered his capital the most strongly fortified city in the world , who had within call 200,000 troops , with a strong majority of the national legislature to support him , has been driven from his throne and realm , a disguised fugitive , seeking protection in a foreign land  --  and that in two or three days , almost without bloodshed , and with nearly as little violence as occurs in one of ' our presidential elections . Amid the growing dissatisfaction and agitation of the nation , in consequence of the great burdens imposed by his selfish plans , the unconstitutional restrictions on liberty , and the enormous bribery revealed in various departments of his government , lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous army ; but was awakened from his fancied security by the sudden development of sympaihy and alliance between the whole army and the offended people . It was as though a foundation of rock beneath his feet bad suddenly changed into an engulphing sea . What then did all the fortifications , on which , for the selfish interests of family , he had squandered the resources of an overtaxed and straitened nation , avail him , without soldiers to man them yea , with soldiers to man them against himself ? In a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , the monarch of thirty-five millions of people , and the commander of an army of four hundred thousand soldiers , became as weak as any other man ; a fact most portentously instructive to all earthly monarchs , teaching them that popular sympathy in their armies ( to which the army is very liable , and will be more and more , in any country where there is any general difibsion of ' knowledge ) may render the sole support on which they lean " a reed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a temporary or provisional government was constituted by acclamation and general consent . That provisional government proclaimed as their motto , " Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , " similar in meaning to the famous phrase in our Declaration of Independence ; and ordered an election of a National Assembly of nine hundred members , for the formation of such a constitution , or ordinance of government , as it shall thereby appear the nation desiresan electioti ordered on the broadest basis of republican rights or privileges-an election in which every man , of suitable age and unconvicted of crime , was invited to vote . That election has taken place . The elected members have met and organized themselves into a National Assembly . And to that Assembly as the embodied sovereignty of the people of France , the provisional or revolutionary government have given their account , and resigned their office-an office which they have exercised , through greftt exigencies and embarrassing difficulties , usually with rare ability , and with remarkable success . We await with anxious interest the action of the National Assembly . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first French Revolution , in the latter part of the last century ; who remember the hope , the joy , the anxiety , gradually changed into fear and horror , as wave after wave of intelligence came from the scenes of anarchy and popular despotism , and at length military despotism and general European war , which that Revolution introduced . And all // have read of these things . So that there is in some minds , very naturally , a predominance of fear , as to the results of the present movement . And , on the other hand , there are many , having a strong conviction of the preeminent beneficence of real republican government , confiding in the capacity of civilized and enlightened nations to maintain it , and remembering moreover the comparatively quiet process , and the good results , of the second revolution-that of 1830-who have a predominance of hope , and feel at liberty greatly to rejoice , though they rejoice not without anxiety . We will therefore , in a cursory manner , survey the grounds of hope on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respecting the results of the present revolution in France . It may seem to some that any prediction regarding the future in France is hazardous . We might appear wiser , perhaps , should we take the safe course in respect to this subject adopted by most of our contemporaries , and deal with what has been rather than with what will be . But we are not ambitious of that infallibility which consists in attempting nothing ; and we will not avoid a question of great and anxious interest from the fear that the future will not sustain our positions . Yet we shalltake no positions which do not seem well grounded . There are data bearing on the general question of results now proposed , which are well worthy of consideration . What reasons then are there to hope for good results ? It is quite common to think of the present revolution in connexioi* with the terrible revolution of the last century . But it is certainly more reasonable to think of it in connexion with the revolution of 1830 , the results of which , though insufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely , far more similarity between France in 1848 and France in 1830 , than between France in 1848 and France in 1789 . And what is hardly secondary in its bearing on the subject , there is far more similarity between the world in 1848 and the world in 1830 , than between the world in 1848 and the world in 1789 . It would seem that the fear and despair of those who think only or chiefly of the revolution of 1789 , should be in a measure removed by the more reasonable employment of their thoughts on the revolution of 1830 . But as the first revolution is associated in the minds of men , more or less , with the present revolution , it may be well to take advantage of that fact , by presenting the reasons for hope of good results now , in the form of a contrast , in some few points , between that revolution and this . 1 . That which occurs first in order is , that the French people had not then , as they have now , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1789 presents . So fearful a lesson as that can not be in vain to the friends of liberty . It must be constantly before their eyes ; teaching them where both their danger and their safety lie . It stands like a lofty beacon on the reefs , whereon they were dashed beforethe rocks of popular excess and anarchy-bidding them beware of the danger . That lesson , as we have learned , is not in vain . Both the leaders and the people ponder it . The members of the late Provisional Government , and of the present Executive Committee of the National Assembly , gather wisdom from it . Phe leading member of that Government , Lamartine-the master spirit of the present movement , who , for sixty hours , sublimely rode , and ruled , and subdued that whirlwind of human passion-has often , in his speeches to the people , reminded them of the excesses of that first revolution , and of their terrible results . The very fact , then , from which some gather despairthe // fact of that first revolution , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives us ground of hope . 2 . This revolution is strongly contrasted , thus far , with the first , in the temper and spirit of the people . Of the violence and sanguinary character of the first revolution , none need to be reminded . This , so far , has been remarkable , wonderful , ( it would be in any country , ) for the moderation , * self-control and humanity of the people . That they , in their struggle to overthrow the throne of a perfidious and detested monarch-one who was put into power by the voice of the people and as the man of the people , a citizen king , and had proved false to his pledges respecting freedom , and had bent his policy and energy to render his dynasty absolute and independent of the nation-that the people , in their struggle to overthrow his throne , and in the flush of their triumph , should have shed so little blood , destroyed so little property , and been so free from the crimes and excesses to which such occasions prompt , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first movements of the Provisional or revolutionary Government was to proclaim that no man should suffer death for political offences-thus shutting up entirely , so far as such a law and example could do it , the way , which , in the first revolution , led to the atrocities of the guillotine ; and thus , in the most effectual manner , exhorting the nation to a mild temper and gentle measures . Indeed , not only the leaders , but all the people , seemed to possess that republican spirit of human brotherhood , which is so well taught by that republican passage in the New Testament , God " hath made of one blood all men to dwell on the face of the earth . " Fraternity was not only on their lips , but controlled their conduct , and seemed to be the inspiring spirit of the whole movement There may have been much of sentimentalism and romance in it ; and it may be transitory . But we may hope otherwise . The remark of one of the people to another , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of his brother by one of the National Guard , declared that he must kill one of the Guard in return  --  the remark , " Stop , if you should , you would only lose another brother , " was worthy even of an apostle , and was said by observers to be characteristic of the general feeling . The spirit , then , in which the revolution has been carried on thus far , is in strong contrast with the spirit of the first revolution , and is very hopeful . 3 . Another , and a very important difference between that revolution and this is , that now , on the one hand , the other nations of Europe are not disposed to interfere , as they did then ; and on the other hand , France adopts a pacific policy , and is disposed to commend republicanism to other nations by her example of well ordered freedom , and not , as then , to promote it by incendiary and military propagandism . Any one who reads and reflects upon the history of those times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restoration of the Bourbons in 1815 , can hardly avoid the conviction that the foreign interference was entirely wrong , and lamentably disastrous in its influences and results . If then France had been let alone ( why should she not have been ? who had a right to meddle with her ? what right had the monarchies of Europe to dictate terms to her ? ) if France had then been let alone , in all probability the subsequent excesses and atrocities of the revolution would have been avoided , and the nation , generally , would have become quiet under the establishment of a constitutional monarchy , or perhaps of a republic . But France was not let alone . // The monarchs of Europe with their counselors , jealous of any popular movement , jealous of anything recognizing and proclaiming the rights of the people , anxious to maintain universally in European countries the divine right of hereditary princes to govern or tyrannize as they please , over subjects who have no divine right except to obey-these monarchs , in an alliance , which , sooner or later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liberty in France ; and , at the head of their arrayed armies , upon her borders , menaced her with war , unless she submitted to their dictation in her internal affairs  --  a dictation which forbade the establishment of civil liberty . This was a step very disastrous to all Europe , but especially to France . It exasperated the revolutionists against all the royalists , as those who were allied with these foreign enemies and meddlers , as indeed many of them were , at home , and in other countries , whither not a few had fled , partly for the purpose of securing the military interposition of other European powers . It turned the revolution into a civil war , in which parties devoured one another in terrible succession . It greatly aggravated the chief source of embarrassment to the revolutionary government , viz , its financial difficulties , by preventing the return of social quiet , commercial confidence , and productive industry ; by drawing off her strong men from useful labor , to military life and fields of slaughter ; and by throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war with all Europe . Indeed , more than to any other cause , may the excesses and disasters of that revolution be traced to this foreign interferenceto this selfish attempt of the throned ones of Europe to put down civil freedom , to crush beneath the tread of their armed and allied legions every spark of the idea that kings and nobles do not rule by divine right , and that the many are not made for the few. * *As we have sometimes heard this fact of foreign interference questioned and denied , it may be well to quote briefly , from some authorities . No one will impute to Alison partiality to France , or an unfavorable disposition towards the allied powers . He says " The rise of this terrible spirit ( the democratic ) destined to convulse the globe , excited the utmost alarm in all the European monarchies . From it sprang the bloody wars of the French RevoluPon , undertaken to crush the evil , but which at first tended only to extend it , by ingrafting on the energy of democratic ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 157 . " The error of the allied sovereigns , and it was one fraught with the most disastrous consequences , consisted in attack . ing France at the period of its highest excitation , and thereby converting revolutionary phrensy into patriotic resistance , without following it up with such vigor as to crush the spirit which was thus awakened . France was beginning to be divided by the progress of the Revolution , when foreign invasion united it . * The catastrophe of the 10th of August was in some degree owing to the imprudent advance and ruinous retreat of the Prussian army ; the friends of order at Paris were paralyzed by the danger of the national independence ; the supporters of the throne , ashamed of a cause which seemed leagued with the public enemies . * * The fault of the aristocracy consisted in leaving their country in the period of its greatest agitation , and their sovereign in his extremest peril , to invoke the hazardous aid of foreign powers . Such a proceeding is always both criminat and dangerous ; criminal , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous , because success with such assistance produces perils as great as defeat . By striving to raise a crusade against French liberty , they put themselves in the predicament of ' having as much to fear from victory as defeat ; the first endangered the national independence , the last threatened the power and possessions of their order-Vol . I , 131 . The object of the alliance is twofold . The first object concerns the rights of the dispossessed princes , and the dangers of the propagation of revolutionary principles ; the second , the maintenance of the fundamental principles of the French monarchy . - Hardenburg , quoted by *1i. son , p. 177 . Lamartine declares , that " the classes dispossessed united themselves with the // The result to the other nations of Europe , was a series of sanguinary and devastating wars , destroying millions of lives , and creating enormous debts , which were entailed on their posterity , on whom they now lie , a crushing burden . In those wars , England subsidized a large part of Europe ; and in so doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , by necessitating taxation and restrictions on trade , grinds the faces of her poor , and produces an amount of misery and absolute starvation at which the heavens may well be desolate . In contemplating this war policy , which the English government adopted under the guidance of Pitt  --  a policy carried on by immense loans-we have often pondered the strong words of Robert Hall , and have been more and more deeply convinced of their truth . " Far be it from me to wish to withhold an atom of the praise justly due to him ( Pitt ) . That he devoted much time and a considerable portion of talent to the affairs of his country is undeniable . The evils which he has brought upon us were not the production of an ordinary mind , nor the work of a day , nor done in sport ; but what I contend for is , that , to say nothing of his unparalleled apostasy , his devotion to his country , and , what was worse , its devotion to him , have been the source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has befallen it ; and that the memory of Pitt will he identified in the recollection of posterity with accumulated taxes , augmented debt , extended pauperism , a debasement and prostration of the public mind , and a captive royalty and with jealous foreigners , to deny its revotution in France , and to reimpose upon it the monarchy , the aristocracy and the theocracy , by inva5100 . And Atison shows ahundantly that Louis XVI . was in communication with the allied sovereigns respecting their interference for his relief , and counseled their movements . system of policy , not only hostile to the cause of liberty at home , but prompt and eager to tread out every spark of liberty in Europe ; in a word with all those images of terror and destruction which the name imports . " * But , now , so far as we can judge from present appearances , France will be let alone . This disturbing evil of foreign interference and general war , she will be spared . The monarchs of Europe are not disposed to meddle for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they find enough to do to take care of their subjects at home . It is rather an anxious season for kings . On the other hand , in the first revolution , France indulged a spirit and adopted a method , of republican propagandism , dangerous to the internal peace of the European monarch ies . The National Convention declared by decree , in the name of the French nation , that it would grant fraternity and assistance to all people who wished to recover their liberty ; and it charged the executive power to send the necessary orders to the generals , to give succor to such people , and to defend those citizens who had suffered , or might suffer , in the cause of liberty . This , however , it ought in justice to be said , was not till after the alliance to put down French liberty by force , and after the actual invasion of France by the Allied Powers , for that purpose . It was a retaliatory course  --  a course which , probably , France would not have taken had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interference.t But , whatever tnay have been the cause , the French republic did enter with great enthusiasm upon the enterprise of extending democracy in * Hall 's works-Am. edit. , Vol . II. , p. 105 . I rrhe process by which they came to adopt this course is seen in the following language , which we quote from a unanimous address to the throne by the AsEurope , // by force , and by alliance with the discontented subjects of the monarchies . It even went so far as to declare , that the French nation would treat as enemies the people , who , refusing , or renouncing , liberty and equality , were desirous of preserving their prince and privileged castes , or of entering into an accommodation with them . But , now , France is indisposed to adopt , and there is no prospect that she will be provoked or driven to adopt , any such policy . On the contrary , her policy is that of peace . It is thus announced to all nations , by Lamartine , the minister of Foreign Affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsurpassed in the felicitous combination of lucid statement , profound philosophy , and lofty eloquence . " War is not the principle of the French republic , as it became the fatal and glorious necessity of the republic in 1792. * The sole interest of the consolidation and duration of the republic , would inspire , in the statesmen of France , the thoughts of peace . It is not the country that runs the greatest danger in the war ; it is the liberty . sembly , about a year previous to the decree of the Convention referred to above . " No sooner did the Assembly cast their eyes on the state of the kinffdo * m , than they perceived that the troubles which agitate it have their source in the criminal preparations of the French emigrants . Their audacity is supported by the German princes , who , forgettin the faith of treaties , openly encourage their armaineots , and compel counter-preparations on our part , which absorb the sums destined to the liquidation of the debt . It is your province to put a stop to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ befitting a kin* of the French . Tell them that , wherever preparations of war are carried on , there France beholds nothing but enemies ; that we will religiously observe peace on our side ; that we will respect their laws , their usaaes , their constitutions ; hut that , if they continue to favor the armaments destined against the French , France will bring into their bosoms , not fire and sword , but freedom . It is for them to calculate the consequences of such a wakening of their people . - qlison , Vol. 1 , p. 117 . War is almost always a dictatorship . Soldiers forget institutions for men . Thrones tempt the ambitious . Glory dazzles patriotism . The prestige of a glorious name veils the attack upon the sovereignty of the nation . The republic desires glory , without doubt ; but she wishes it for herself , and not for Ctesars or Napoleons. * * * She will not endeavor any immoderate or incendiary propagandism amongst her neighbors . She knows that there is no durable freedom but that which grows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will exercise , by the light of her ideas , by the spectacle of order and of peace which she hopes to give to the world , the sole and honest proselytism of esteem and sympathy . That is not war -- it is nature . That is not the agitation of Europe -- it is life . That is not to embroil the world-it is to shine from her place on the horizon of nations , to advance them and to guide them at the same time . We desire , for humanity , that the peace be preserved . " 4 . We have made allusion to the internal divisions of France in the first revolution . Here is another point of contrast too important to be omitted . Then , the nation was very far from union , indeed greatly distracted by factions . There were large classes , opposed in heart to the revolution , and especially to republicanism , particularly the nobility and their adherents , and a large part of the clergy and of the church of Rome . " Jn 1792 , " says Lamartine , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed on the same soil . A terrible struggle still prolonged itself between the classes dispossessed of the privileges , and the classes who had just succeeded in achieving equality and liberty . " The former , he states , conspired with the captive king and jealous foreign princes , against the revolution , and to restore the old condition of things . This , in // some measure , occasioned , certainly greatly aggravated , the excesses of the revolution . The revolutionists were possessed with the idea that liberty was unsafe , till all its enemies were destroyed . And this idea was called into sanguinary action , by one misguided republican after another , and one selfish demagogue after another , till multitudes of the best citizens of France and even of the truest friends of liberty poured out their blood under the guillotine . But , now , so far as we have learned , the whole nation is remarkably united . Republicanism meets with little open opposition . All classes have given in their adhesion to the existing government , including the high officers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the late king . There seems to be a universal conviction that the time has come , when republicanism must , at least , be tried . Even Louis Phillippe is said , as he left the shores of that realm , to have advised a friend who assisted his escape , to give his cordial support to the Republic , adding , " I have been the last king of France . " From this internal union of judgment and feeling respecting free government , we may have strong hopes of good results . 5 . There is another hopeful consideration which , however , though weighty , may be stated in a few words . Since 1789 there has been great progress in France , in popular intelligence , in just ideas of human rights and government , in the diffusion of property , and in religion . The Christian world is much older and wiser , France is older and wiser , than she was more than half a century since . The preceding revolutions have done much to prepare the French people for selfgovernment , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estates , producing thus a wide diffusion of property and of personal independence , by breaking up in a great measure the cumbrous and oppressive establishment of the Romish State religion , and by a general amelioration of government . Nor will it be without substantial profit to the French people that they have had , for more than fifty years , the example of our republic , and can study our history and institutions , and can model theirs after ours , in such respects as wisdom dictates . 6 . XVe may hope much , moreover , from the sincerity and consistency of French republicanism . The members of the late provisional government , who seem to be a fair representation of the general spirit of the people , made their proclamation of " Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , " and have acted consistently therewith . They have not only given to every man , unconvicted of crime , a voice in the formation of the government which is so vitally to affect his interests , but they have declared that negro slavery shall cease in their colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly . The French republicans give a sincere and consistent recognition of the right " of " all men " " to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . " Theirs is real , sincere , democracy . Not that hypocritical democracy , ( how intensely hypocritical ) which , with one hand unfurls the flag inscribed with the declaration that all men are endowed by nature with the inalienable right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , and , with the other , fastens the chains of slavery on three millions of men , and even contends , and , from the heights of official power , proclaims to the world , that s ! avery is the very corner stone of republican freedom . Not that hypocritical democracy which rants in the capitol of the nation about republican principles , and the creation of all men free and equal , and yet resists every effort to // suppress the traffic in human beings , and human bondage , all around that capitol , every effort to remove thence the slave pens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coffied gangs , past the very temple of national freedom , to a merciless and distant bondage . Not that hypocritical democracy , which insists that every man over twenty-one years of age unconvicted of crime has , as a man , the right of suffrage , and yet withholds suffrage from all men with a dark colored skin . There is reason to fear that God will say to all such republicans , wo unto you hypocrites . And there is reason to hope , that in his love for sincerity and consistency and the spirit of human brotherhood , he will prosper the French people in their sincere and consistent republicanism . But it is time that we turn to consider some of the reasons for fear respecting the results of the present movement in France . 1 . The first and most obvious ground for fear is , that there may not be sufficient intelligence and virtue among the French people , for the purposes of political selfgovernment . Here , it must be acknowledged , there is reason for anxiety . Yet , as has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects among the French people during the last fifty , and especially during the last eighteen , years . Besides , it may allay our anxiety , in some degree , to remember that republican government is maintain . ed in such commonwealths as some of our southwestern States . If they are proved by experiment capable of republican government , we may well hope that France is . It is also a question quite worthy of consideration , whether a truly republican government is not the governmen t , in which , better than in any other , the various selfish interests and passions will balance and regulate themselves . There is on this subject of entrusting a people with freedom , a common fallacy respecting which we will quote the words of a writer , whose brilliancy leads many to overlook his profound political philosophy . " Many politicians of our time are in the habit of laying it down as a self-evident proposition , that no people ought to be free till they are fit to use their freedom . The maxim is worthy of the fool in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water till he had learned to swim ! If men are to wait for liberty till they have become wise and good in slavery , they may indeed wait forever . " There is only one cure for the evils which newly acquired freedom produces  --  and that cure is freedom . When a prisoner leaves his cell , he can not bear the light of day : - he is unable to discriminate colors , or to recognize faces . But the remedy is not to remand him into his dungeon , hut to accustom him to the rays of the sun . The blaze of truth and liberty , may at first dazzle and bewilder nations which have become half blind in the house of bondage . But let them gaze on , and they will soon be able to bear it . In a few years men learn to reason . The extreme violence of opinions subsides . Hostile theories correct each other . The scattered elements of truth cease to conflict , and begin to coalesce . And at length a system of justice and order is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been expressed for France on account of the establishment of universal suffrage . It has not yet been proved by any experiment that it is not the safest and best method , to give the right of suffrage to every man of suitable age , who is unconvicted of crime . On the contrary , the light of experience seems to indicate that a government is most secure from overthrow , // when it stands on the broadest base  --  the extension of political rights to all citizens-when the whole people are its armed defense , and share by franchise in the national sovereignty . There is profound philosophy in the remark , made by Lamartine , when , resigning the temporary sovereignty of the Provisional Government into the hands of the National Assembly , he announced that that government had armed the whole people for the national defense , and had rendered the right of the citizen universal by rendering universal the right of suffrage- " Factions are no longer possible in a republic where there are no divisions between political and non-political citizens ; between those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has his right ; every one has his weapon- In such a state of things insurrection is no longer the extreme right opposed to oppression ; it would be a crime . He who would separate himself from the people , is no longer of the people . " One of the greatest difficulties in the republic of the first French revolution was , that it did not extend political rights to the masses of the people ; was this very distinction between " political and non-political citizens . " " In 1792 , " says Lamartine , " it was not the entire population who entered into the possession of the government . It was the middle classes only who wished to exercise liberty and enjoy it . The triumph of the middle class , at that time , was egotistical ( selfish ) as the triumph of every oligarchy must be . It wished to retain for itself the rights achieved for all . It was necessary for it to operate a strong diversion against the advance of the people , by precipitating it ( the people ) on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from entering into the exercise of government . " Thus , moreover , we may add , a constant struggle was kept up between the political and non-political citizens ; as there ever will be in every government where that distinction exists , and so long as it exists . That effect will follow from that cause as surely as a weight will fall by gravity . We are inclined to think , that the extension of suffrage to the whole French people by the Provisional Government , was a measure of profound political wisdom . We may gather from it hope rather than fear . 3 . Another ground of fear is the fact , that the question of the " organization of labor , " as it is called , has had some part in the revolution ; and that the government have been disposed , and have promised , to make some experiments on that subject . Here again undoubtedly is cause for anxiety . Thus far , however , the government have done nothing which should cause fear . They have merely established a few work-houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laborers needing employment and support-far less , however , than England expends constantly in sustaining her poor law system . Yet there is reason to fear that the late Provisional Government raised expectations which no government can satisfy-that they promised more than any government can perform , or at least more than a hungry people will be willing long to wait for . however , God sometimes leads nations to good results by paths to them very unpromising . Certainly it is very manifest to careful and candid observers , that there is a tendency , especially in populous countries and cities , to the excessive accumulation of capital in the hands of individuals , and to a corresponding depression of the laboring masses-a tendency , for the counteraction of which , it is very desirable that the principles of the gospel and the principles of republicanism should , in some way , be applied . In what way , is to many a very interesting // and important problem . And , perhaps , this problem , in the good providence of God , against the anxieties , fears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in France , just as God in his good providence led the older New England Commonwealths to complete religious liberty  --  to the entire separation of the church and state  --  to the entire abolition of the compulsory support of religion-against the anxieties , fears , protests , and prayers of a majority of the Christians in those commonxvealths-a result which all now acknowledge to be good . Let us wait in hope , if not in faith . We ought also to mention one other reason of anxiety which presents itself  --  the financial embarrassments of the government . These , it ought to be remembered , have been produced , in the greater part , by the selfish extravagance of the overthrown dynasty . And as to the other part , it is nothing more than must temporarily result from that interruption of commercial confidence and productive industry which accompanies any fundamental change in government . That interruption will be only temporary . It is already passing away . And when quiet and confidence are again restored , the enterprise and energy of a free people , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doubtless , give to France greater financial prosperity than she has ever enjoyed . On this point , we shall do well to consider the financial embarrassments of the period during , and for years subsequent to , our own revolution , and the prosperity which has ensued . On the whole our hopes greatly surpass our fears , respecting the French revolution of 1848 , and constrain us to rejoice in it as an event of great promise for France . That church and state will be separated , and that a form of government , truly republican , will be established , and prosperously administered , we expect , though not with the greatest confidence . But , that the result will be a decided progress in civil and religious liberty and prosperity , we have no doubt whatever . We have called this revolution an event of great promise for France . That promise is not for France only , but for all nations . Its influencewho can measure it ? It goes on its way swift and resistless as the electric power . And its waywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through all the earth , and its words to the end of the world.
