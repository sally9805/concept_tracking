EDITOR 'S PREFACE ( 1893 ) 1 The Rambles and Recollections of an Indian Official , always a costly book , has been scarce and difficult to procure for many years past . Among the crowd of books descriptive of Indian scenery , manners , and customs , the sterling merits of Sir William Sleeman 's work have secured it pre-eminence , and kept it in constant demand , notwithstanding the lapse of nearly fifty years since its publication . The high reputation of this work does not rest upon its strictly literary qualities . The author was a busy man , immersed all his life in the practical affairs of administration , and too full of his subject to be careful of strict correctness of style or minute accuracy of expression . Yet , so great is the intrinsic value of his observations , and so attractive are the sincerity and sympathy with which he discusses a vast range of topics , that the reader refuses to be offended by slight formal defects in expression or arrangement , and willingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unstudied conversation . It would be difficult to name any other book so full of instruction for the young Anglo-Indian administrator . When this work was published in 1844 the author had had thirty-five years ' varied experience of Indian life , and had accumulated and assimilated an immense store of knowledge concerning the history , manners , and modes of thought of the complex population of India . He thoroughly understood the peculiarities of the various native races , and the characteristics which distinguish them from the nations of Europe ; while his sympathetic insight into Indian life had not orientalized him , nor had it ever for one moment caused him to forget his position and heritage as an Englishman . This attitude of sane and discriminating sympathy is the right attitude for the Englishman in India . To enumerate the topics on which wise and profitable observations will be found in this book would be superfluous . The wine is good , and needs no bush . So much may be said that the book is one to interest that nondescript person , the general reader in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides good advice and sound teaching on matters of policy and administration , it contains many charming , though inartificial , descriptions of scenery and customs , many ingenious speculations , and some capital stories . The ethnologist , the antiquary , the geologist , the soldier , and the missionary will all find in it something to suit their several tastes . In this edition the numerous misprints of the original edition have been all , and , for the most part , silently corrected . The extremely erratic punctuation has been freely modified , and the spelling of Indian words and names has been systematized . Two paragraphs , misplaced in the original edition at the end of Chapter 48 of Volume I , have been removed , and inserted in their proper place at the end of Chapter 47 ; and the supplementary notes printed at the end of the second volume of the original edition have been brought up to the positions which they were intended to occupy . Chapters 37 to 46 of the first volume , describing the contest for empire between the sons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bernier 's work entitled , The Late Revolution of the Empire of the Great Mogol . These chapters have not been reprinted because the history of that revolution can now be read much more satisfactorily in Mr. Constable 's edition of Bernier 's Travels . Except as above stated , the text of the present edition of the Rambles and Recollections is a faithful reprint of the Author 's text . In the spelling of names and other words of Oriental languages the Editor has ' endeavoured to strike a mean between popular usage and academic precision , preferring to incur the charge of looseness to that of pedantry ' . Diacritical marks intended to distinguish between the various sibilants , dentals , nasals , and so forth , of the Arabic and Sanskrit alphabets , have been purposely omitted . Long vowels are marked by the sign . Except in a few familiar words , such as Nerbudda and Hindoo , which are spelled in the traditional manner , vowels are to be pronounced as in Italian , or as in the following English examples , namely : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e , as the medial vowel in ' cake ' ; i , as in ' kill ' ; i , as the medial vowels in ' keel ' ; u , as in ' full ' ; u , as the medial vowels in ' fool ' ; o , or o , as in ' bone ' ; ai , or ai , as ' eye ' or ' aye ' , respectively ; and au , as the medial sound in ' fowl ' . Short a , with stress , is pronounced like the u in ' but ' ; and if without stress , as an indistinct vowel , like the A in ' America ' . The Editor 's notes , being designed merely to explain and illustrate the text , so as to render the book fully intelligible and helpful to readers of the present day , have been compressed into the narrowest possible limits . Even India changes , and observations and criticisms which were perfectly true when recorded can no longer be safely applied without explanation to the India of to-day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A copious analytical index has been compiled . The bibliography is as complete as careful inquiry could make it , but it is possible that some anonymous papers by the Author , published in periodicals , may have escaped notice . The memoir of Sir William Sleeman is based on the slight sketch prefixed to the Journey through the Kingdom of Oude , supplemented by much additional matter derived from his published works and correspondence , as well as from his unpublished letters and other papers generously communicated by his only son , Captain Henry Sleeman . Ample materials exist for a full account of Sir William Sleeman 's noble and interesting life , which well deserves to be recorded in detail ; but the necessary limitations of these volumes preclude the Editor from making free use of the biographical matter at his command . The reproduction of the twenty-four coloured plates of varying merit which enrich the original edition has not been considered desirable . The map shows clearly the route taken by the Author in the journey the description of which is the leading theme of the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Archibald Constable and Company in 1893 being out of print but still in demand , Mr. Humphrey Milford , the present owner of the copyright , has requested me to revise the book and bring it up to date . This new edition is issued uniform with Mr. Beauchamp 's third edition of Hindu Manners , Customs , and Ceremonies by the Abbe J. A. Dubois ( Oxford : at the Clarendon Press , 1906 ) , a work bearing a strong resemblance in substance to the Rambles and Recollections , and , also like Sleeman 's book in that it ' is as valuable to-day as ever it was  --  even more valuable in some respects ' . The labour of revision has proved to be far more onerous than was expected . In the course of twenty-one years the numerous changes which have occurred in India , not only in administrative arrangements , but of various other kinds , necessitate the emendation of notes which , although accurate when written , no longer agree with existing facts . The appearance of many new books and improved editions involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most considerable in the annotations dealing with the buildings at Agra , Sikandara , Fathpur-Sikri , and Delhi , and the connected political history , concerning which much new information is now available . Certain small misstatements of fact in my old notes have been put right . Some of those errors which escaped the notice of critics have been detected by me , and some have been rectified by the aid of criticisms received from Sir George Grierson , C.I.E. , Mr. William Crooke , sometime President of the Folklore Society , and other kind correspondents , to all of whom I am grateful . Naturally , the opportunity has been taken to revise the wording throughout and to eliminate misprints and typographical defects . The Index has been recast so as to suit the changed paging and to include the new matter . Captain James Lewis Sleeman of the Royal Sussex Regiment has been good enough to permit the reproduction of his grandfather 's portrait , and has communicated papers which have enabled me to make corrections in and additions to the Memoir , largely enhancing the interest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . Certain small changes have been made . MEMOIR OF MAJ. - GEN . SIR WILLIAM HENRY SLEEMAN , K.C.B. The Sleemans , an ancient Cornish family , for several generations owned the estate of Pool Park in the parish of Saint Judy , in the county of Cornwall . Captain Philip Sleeman , who married Mary Spry , a member of a distinguished family in the same county , was stationed at Stratton , in Cornwall , on August 8 , 1788 , when his son William Henry was born . In 1809 , at the age of twenty-one , William Henry Sleeman was nominated , through the good offices of Lord De Dunstanville , to an Infantry Cadetship in the Bengal army . On the 24th of March , in the same year , he sailed from Gravesend in the ship Devonshire , and , having touched at Madeira and the Cape , reached India towards the close of the year . He arrived at the cantonment of Dinapore , near Patna , on the 20th December , and on Christmas Day began his military career as a cadet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study of the Arabic and Persian languages , and of the religions and customs of India . Passing in due course through the ordinary early stages of military life , he was promoted to the rank of ensign on the 23rd September , 1810 , and to that of lieutenant on the 16th December , 1814 . Lieutenant Sleeman served in the war with Nepal , which began in 1814 and terminated in 1816 . During the campaign he narrowly escaped death from a violent epidemic fever , which nearly destroyed his regiment . ' Three hundred of my own regiment , ' he observes , ' consisting of about seven hundred , were obliged to be sent to their homes on sick leave . The greater number of those who remained continued to suffer , and a great many died . Of about ten European officers present with my regiment , seven had the fever and five died of it , almost all in a state of delirium . I was myself one of the two who survived , and I was for many days delirious. 1 The services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordingly , in 1816 , he was selected to report on certain claims to prize-money . The report submitted by him in February , 1817 , was accepted as ' able , impartial , and satisfactory ' . After the termination of the war he served with his regiment at Allahabad , and in the neighbouring district of Partabgarh , where he laid the foundation of the intimate knowledge of Oudh affairs displayed in his later writings . In 1820 he was selected for civil employ , and was appointed Junior Assistant to the Agent of the Governor-General , administering the Sagar and Nerbudda territories . Those territories , which had been annexed from the Marathas two years previously , are now included in the jurisdiction of the Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces . In such a recently-conquered country , where the sale of all widows by auction for the benefit of the Treasury , and other strange customs still prevailed , the abilities of an able and zealous young officer had ample scope . Sleeman , after a brief apprenticeship , received , in 1822 , the independent civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley , and there , for more than two years , ' by far the most laborious of his life ' , his whole attention was engrossed in preventing and remedying the disorders of his District . Sleeman , during the time that he was in charge of the Narsinghpur District , had no suspicion that it was a favourite resort of Thugs . A few years later , in or about 1830 , he was astounded to learn that a gang of Thugs resided in the village of Kandeli , not four hundred yards from his court-house , and that the extensive groves of Mandesar on the Sagar road , only one stage distant from his head-quarters , concealed one of the greatest bhils , or places of murder , in all India . The arrest of were followed up by Sleeman with consummate skill and untiring assiduity . In the years 1831 and 1832 the reports submitted by him and other officers at last opened the eyes of the superior authorities and forced them to recognize the fact that the murderous organization extended over every part of India . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evil . ' Thuggee Sleeman ' made it the main business of his life to hunt down the criminals and to extirpate their secret society . He recorded his experiences in the series of valuable publications described in the Bibliography . In this brief memoir it is impossible to narrate in detail the thrilling story of the suppression of Thuggee , and I must be content to pass on and give in bare outline the main facts of Sleeman 's honourable career. 2 While at Narsinghpur , Sleeman received on the 24th April , 1824 , brevet rank as Captain . In 1825 , he was transferred , and on the 23rd September of the following year , was gazetted Captain . In 1826 , failure of health compelled him to take leave on medical certificate . In March , 1828 , Captain Sleeman assumed civil and executive charge of the Jabalpur ( Jubbulpore ) District , from which he was transferred to Sagar in January , 1831 . While stationed at Jabalpur , he married , on the 21st June , 1829 , Amelie Josephine , the daughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the sacrifice of a considerable property , had managed to escape from the Revolution . A lady informs the editor that she remembers Sleeman 's fine house at Jabalpur . It stood in a large walled park , stocked with spotted deer . Both house and park were destroyed when the railway was carried through the site . Mr. C. Eraser , on return from leave in January , 1832 , resumed charge of the revenue and civil duties of the Sagar district , leaving the magisterial duties to Captain Sleeman , who continued to discharge them till January , 1835 . By the Resolution of Government dated 10th January , 1835 , Captain Sleeman was directed to fix his head-quarters at Jabalpur , and was appointed General Superintendent of the operations for the Suppression of Thuggee , being relieved from every other charge . In 1835 his health again broke down , and he was obliged to take leave on medical certificate . Accompanied by his wife and little son , he went into camp in November , 1835 , and marched through the Jabalpur , Damoh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Native States of Orchha , Datiya , and Gwalior , arriving at Agra on the 1st January , 1836 . After a brief halt at Agra , he proceeded through the Bharatpur State to Delhi and Meerut , and thence on leave to Simla . During his march from Jabalpur to Meerut he amused himself by keeping the journal which forms the basis of the Rambles and Recollections of an Indian Official . The manuscript of this work ( except the two supplementary chapters ) was completed in 1839 , though not given to the world till 1844 . On the 1st of February , 1837 , in the twenty-eighth year of his service , Sleeman was gazetted Major . During the same year he made a tour in the interior of the Himalayas , which he described at length in an unpublished journal . Later in the year he went down to Calcutta to see his boy started on the voyage home . In February , 1839 , he assumed charge of the office of Commissioner for the Suppression of Thuggee and Dacoity . Up to that date the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate from that of General Superintendent of the measures for the Suppression of Thuggee , and had been filled by another officer , Mr. Hugh Eraser , of the Civil Service . During the next two years Sleeman passed much of his time in the North-Western Provinces , now the Agra Province in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh , making Muradabad his head-quarters , and thoroughly investigating the secret criminal organizations of Upper India . In 1841 he was offered the coveted and lucrative post of Resident at Lucknow , vacant by the resignation of Colonel Low ; but that officer , immediately after his resignation , lost all his savings through the failure of his bankers , and Sleeman , moved by a generous impulse , wrote to Colonel Low , begging him to retain the appointment . Sleeman was then deputed on special duty to Bundelkhand to investigate the grave disorders in that province . While at Jhansi in December , 1842 , he narrowly escaped assassination by a dismissed Afghan sepoy , who poured the contents of a blunderbuss into a native officer in attendance. 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Maharajpur , fought on the 29th December , 1843 , Sleeman , who had become a Lieut. - Colonel , was Resident at Gwalior , and was actually in Sindhia 's camp when the battle unexpectedly began . In 1848 the Residency at Lucknow again fell vacant , and Lord Dalhousie , by a letter dated 16th September , offered Sleeman the appointment in the following terms : The high reputation you have earned , your experience of civil administration , your knowledge of the people , and the qualifications you possess as a public man , have led me to submit your name to the Council of India as an officer to whom I could commit this important charge with entire confidence that its duties would be well performed . I do myself , therefore , the honour of proposing to you to accept the office of Resident at Lucknow , with especial reference to the great changes which , in all probability , will take place . Retaining your superintendency of Thuggee affairs , it will be manifestly necessary that you should be relieved from the duty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that you will not withhold from the Government your services in the capacity I have named , and in the further hope of finding an opportunity of personally making your acquaintance , I have the honour to be , Dear Colonel Sleeman , Very faithfully yours , DALHOUSIE. 4 The remainder of Sleeman 's official life , from January , 1849 , was spent in Oudh , and was chiefly devoted to ceaseless and hopeless endeavours to reform the King 's administration and relieve the sufferings of his grievously oppressed subjects . On the 1st of December , 1849 , the Resident began his memorable three months ' tour through Oudh , so vividly described in the special work devoted to the purpose . The awful revelations of the Journey through the Kingdom of Oude largely influenced the Court of Directors and the Imperial Government in forming their decision to annex the kingdom , although that decision was directly opposed to the advice of Sleeman , who consistently advocated reform of the administration , while deprecating annexation . His views are stated with absolute precision in a letter written in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November , 1857 : We have no right to annex or confiscate Oude ; but we have a right , under the treaty of 1837 , to take the management of it , but not to appropriate its revenues to ourselves . We can do this with honour to our Government and benefit to the people . To confiscate would be dishonest and dishonourable . To annex would be to give the people a government almost as bad as their own , if we put our screw upon them ( Journey , ed. 1858 , vol. i , Intro. , p. xxi ) . The earnest efforts of the Resident to suppress crime and improve the administration of Oudh aroused the bitter resentment of a corrupt court and exposed his life to constant danger . Three deliberate attempts to assassinate him at Lucknow are recorded . The first , in December , 1851 , is described in detail in a letter of Sleeman 's dated the 16th of that month , and less fully by General Hervey , in Some Records of Crime , vol. ii , p. 479 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tikaram , who was badly wounded . Inquiry proved that the crime was instigated by the King 's moonshee . The second attempt , on October 9 , 1853 , is fully narrated in an official letter to the Government of India ( Bibliography , No. 15 ) . Its failure may be reasonably ascribed to a special interposition of Providence . The Resident during all the years he had lived at Lucknow had been in the habit of sleeping in an upper chamber approached by a separate private staircase guarded by two sentries . On the night mentioned the sentries were drugged and two men stole up the stairs . They slashed at the bed with their swords , but found it empty , because on that one occasion General Sleeman had slept in another room . The third attempt was not carried as far , and the exact date is not ascertainable , but the incident is well remembered by the family and occurred between 1853 and 1856 . One day the Resident was crossing his study when , for some reason or another , he looked behind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing there with a large knife in his hand . General Sleeman , who was unarmed , challenged the man as being a Thug . He at once admitted that he was such , and under the spell of a master-spirit allowed himself to be disarmed without resistance . He had been employed at the Residency for some time , unsuspected . Such personal risks produced no effect on the stout heart of Sleeman , who continued , unshaken and undismayed , his unselfish labours . In 1854 the long strain of forty-five years ' service broke down Sleeman 's strong constitution . He tried to regain health by a visit to the hills , but this expedient proved ineffectual , and he was ordered home . On the 10th of February , 1856 , while on his way home on board the Monarch , he died off Ceylon , at the age of sixty-seven , and was buried at sea , just six days after he had been granted the dignity of K.C.B. Lord Dalhousie 's desire to meet his trusted officer was never gratified . The following correspondence between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , is equally creditable to both parties : BARRACKPORE PARK , January 9th , 1856 . MY DEAR GENERAL SLEEMAN , I have heard to-day of your arrival in Calcutta , and have heard at the same time with sincere concern that you are still suffering in health . A desire to disturb you as little as possible induces me to have recourse to my pen , in order to convey to you a communication which I had hoped to be able to make in person . Some time since , when adjusting the details connected with my retirement from the Government of India , I solicited permission to recommend to Her Majesty 's gracious consideration the names of some who seemed to me to be worthy of Her Majesty 's favour . My request was moderate . I asked only to be allowed to submit the name of one officer from each Presidency . The name which is selected from the Bengal army was your own , and I ventured to express my hope that Her Majesty would be pleased to mark her sense of the long course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had passed , by conferring upon you the civil cross of a Knight Commander of the Bath . As yet no reply has been received to my letter . But as you have now arrived at the Presidency , I lose no time in making known to you what has been done ; in the hope that you will receive it as a proof of the high estimation in which your services and character arc held , as well by myself as by the entire community of India . I beg to remain , My dear General , Very truly yours , DALHOUSIE . Major-General Sleeman . Reply to above . Dated 11th January , 1856 . MY LORD , I was yesterday evening favoured with your Lordship 's most kind and flattering letter of the 9th instant from Barrackpore . I can not adequately express how highly honoured I feel by the mention that you have been pleased to make of my services to Her Majesty the Queen , and how much gratified I am by this crowning act of kindness from your Lordship in addition to the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight years ; and whether it may , or may not , be my fate to live long enough to see the honourable rank actually conferred upon me , which you have been so considerate and generous as to ask for me , the letter now received from your Lordship will of itself be deemed by my family as a substantial honour , and it will so preserved , I trust , by my son , with feelings of honest pride , at the thought that his father had merited such a mark of distinction from so eminent a statesman as the Marquis of Dalhousie . My right hand is so crippled by rheumatism that I am obliged to make use of an amanuensis to write this letter , and my bodily strength is so much reduced , that I can not hope before embarking for England to pay my personal respects to your Lordship . Under these unfortunate circumstances , I now beg to take my leave of your Lordship ; to offer my unfeigned and anxious wishes for your Lordship 's health and happiness , and with every sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lordship 's most faithful and Obedient servant , W. H. SLEEMAN , Major-General . To the Most Noble The Marquis of Dalhousie , K.T. , Governor-General , &c.,; &c.,; Calcutta . Sir William Sleeman was an accomplished Oriental linguist , well versed in Arabic , Persian , and Urdu , and also in possession of a good working knowledge of Latin , Greek , and French . His writings afford many proofs of his keen interest in the sciences of geology , agricultural chemistry , and political economy , and of his intelligent appreciation of the lessons taught by history . Nor was he insensible to the charms of art , especially those of poetry . His favourite authors among the poets seem to have been Shakespeare , Milton , Scott , Wordsworth , and Cowper . His knowledge of the customs and modes of thought of the natives of India , rarely equalled and never surpassed , was more than half the secret of his notable success as an administrator . The greatest achievement of his busy and unselfish life was the suppression of the system of organized murder known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and onerous task he displayed the most delicate tact , the keenest sagacity , and the highest power of organization . His own words are his best epitaph : ' I have gone on quietly , ' he writes , ' " through evil and through good report " , doing , to the best of my ability , the duties which it has pleased the Government of India , from time to time , to confide to me in the manner which appeared to me most conformable to its wishes and its honour , satisfied and grateful for the trust and confidence which enabled me to do so much good for the people , and to secure so much of their attachment and gratitude to their rulers . ' 5 His grandson . Captain J. L. Sleeman , who , when stationed in India from 1903 to 1908 , visited the scenes of his grandfather 's labours , states that everywhere he found the memory of his respected ancestor revered , and was given the assurance that no Englishman had ever understood the native of India so well , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sleeman , and that his memory would endure for ever in the Empire to which he devoted his life 's work . This necessarily meagre account of a life which deserves more ample commemoration may be fitly closed by a few words concerning the relatives and descendants of Sir William Sleeman . His sister and regular correspondent , to whom he dedicated the Rambles and Recollections , was married to Captain Furse , R.N. His brother 's son James came out to India in 1827 , joined the 73rd Regiment of the Bengal Army , was selected for employment in the Political Department , and was thus enabled to give valuable aid in the campaign against Thuggee . In due course he was appointed to the office of General Superintendent of the Operations against Thuggee , which had been held by his uncle . He rose to the rank of Colonel , and after a long period of excellent service , lived to enjoy nearly thirty years of honourable retirement . He died at his residence near Ross in 1899 at the age of eighty-one . In 1831 Sir William 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16th ( Queen 's ) Lancers , and having retired early from the army , with the rank of Captain , died in 1905 . His elder son William Henry died while serving with the Mounted Infantry during the South African War . His younger son , James Lewis , a Captain in the Royal Sussex Regiment , who also saw active service during the war , and was mentioned in dispatches , has a distinguished African and Indian record , and recently received the honorary degree of M.A. from the Belfast University for good work done in establishing the first Officers ' Training Corps in Ireland . The family of Captain James Lewis Sleeman consists of two sons and a daughter , namely , John Cuthbert , Richard Brian , and Ursula Mary . Captain Sleeman , as the head of his family , possesses the MSS. &c.; of his distinguished grandfather .

Before setting out on our journey towards the Himalaya we formed once more an agreeable party to visit the Marble Rocks of the Nerbudda at Bheraghat. 1 It was the end of Kartik , 2 when the Hindoos hold fairs on all their sacred streams at places consecrated by poetry or tradition as the scene of some divine work or manifestation . These fairs are at once festive and holy ; every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at the same time seeking purification from all past transgressions by bathing and praying in the holy stream , and making laudable resolutions to be better for the future . The ceremonies last five days , and take place at the same time upon all the sacred rivers throughout India ; and the greater part of the whole Hindoo population , from the summits of the Himalaya mountains to Cape Comorin , will , I believe , during these five days , be found congregated at these fairs . In sailing down the Ganges one may pass in the course of a day half a dozen such fairs , each with a multitude equal to the population of a large city , and rendered beautifully picturesque by the magnificence and variety of the tent equipages of the great and wealthy . The preserver of the universe ( Bhagvan ) Vishnu is supposed , on the 26th of Asarh , to descend to the world below ( Patal ) to defend Raja Bali from the attacks of Indra , to stay with him four months , and to come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds of worship and festivities are suspended ; and they recommence at these fairs , where people assemble to hail his resurrection . Our tents were pitched upon a green sward on one bank of a small stream running into the Nerbudda close by , while the multitude occupied the other bank . At night all the tents and booths are illuminated , and the scene is hardly less animated by night than by day ; but what strikes a European most is the entire absence of all tumult and disorder at such places . He not only sees no disturbance , but feels assured that there will be none ; and leaves his wife and children in the midst of a crowd of a hundred thousand persons all strangers to them , and all speaking a language and following a religion different from theirs , while he goes off the whole day , hunting and shooting in the distant jungles , without the slightest feeling of apprehension for their safety or comfort . It is a singular fact , which I know to be true , that during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chief leaders bound themselves by a solemn oath not to suffer any European lady or child to be injured or molested , happen what might to them in the collision with their officers and the Government . My friend Captain Reid , one of the general staff , used to allow his children , five in number , to go into the lines and play with the soldiers of the mutinous regiments up to the very day when the artillery opened upon them ; and , of above thirty European ladies then at the station , not one thought of leaving the place till they heard the guns. 4 Mrs. Colonel Faithful , with her daughter and another young lady , who had both just arrived from England , went lately all the way from Calcutta to Ludiana on the banks of the Hyphasis , a distance of more than twelve hundred miles , in their palankeens with relays of bearers , and without even a servant to attend them. 5 They were travelling night and day for fourteen days without the slightest apprehension of injury or of insult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dak ( stages ) immediately after their arrival from England to all parts of the country occur every day , and I know of no instance of injury or insult sustained by them. 6 Does not this speak volumes for the character of our rule in India ? Would men trust their wives and daughters in this manner unprotected among a people that disliked them and their rule ? We have not a garrison , or walled cantonments , or fortified position of any kind for our residence from one end of our Eastern empire to the other , save at the three capitals of Calcutta , Madras , and Bombay. 7 We know and feel that the people everywhere look up to and respect us , in spite of all our faults , and we like to let them know and feel that we have confidence in them . Sir Thomas Munro has justly observed , ' I do not exactly know what is meant by civilizing the people of India . In the theory and practice of good government they may be deficient ; but , if a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment of schools for reading and writing , if the general practice of kindness and hospitality , and , above all , if a scrupulous respect and delicacy towards the female sex are amongst the points that denote a civilized people ; then the Hindoos are not inferior in civilization to the people of Europe ' . 8 Bishop Heber writes in the same favourable terms of the Hindoos in the narrative of his journey through India ; and where shall we find a mind more capable of judging of the merits and demerits of a people than his ? 9 The concourse of people at this fair was , as usual , immense ; but a great many who could not afford to provide tents for the accommodation of their families were driven away before their time by some heavy showers of , to them , unseasonable rains . On this and similar occasions the people bathe in the Nerbudda without the aid of priests , but a number of poor Brahmans attend at these festivals to receive charity , though not to assist at the ceremonies . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came out of the sacred stream , but in no case was it demanded , or even solicited with any appearance of importunity , as it commonly is at fairs and holy places on the Ganges . The first day , the people bathe below the rapid over which the river falls after it emerges from its peaceful abode among the marble rocks ; on the second day , just above this rapid ; and on the third day , two miles further up at the cascade , when the whole body of the limpid stream of the Nerbudda , confined to a narrow channel of only a few yards wide , falls tumultuously down in a beautiful cascade into a deep chasm of marble rocks . This fall of their sacred stream the people call the ' Dhuandhar ' , or ' the smoky fall ' , from the thick vapour which is always seen rising from it in the morning . From below , the river glides quietly and imperceptibly for a mile and a half along a deep , and , according to popular belief , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with snow-white marble rocks rising perpendicularly on either side from a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet high , and in some parts fearfully overhanging . Suspended in recesses of these white rocks are numerous large black nests of hornets ready to descend upon any unlucky wight who may venture to disturb their repose ; 10 and , as the boats of the curious European visitors pass up and down to the sound of music , clouds of wild pigeons rise from each side , and seem sometimes to fill the air above them . Here , according to native legends , repose the Pandavas , the heroes of their great Homeric poem , the Mahabharata , whose names they have transferred to the valley of the Nerbudda . Every fantastic appearance of the rocks , caused by those great convulsions of nature which have so much disturbed the crust of the globe , or by the slow and silent working of the , waters , is attributed to the god-like power of those great heroes of Indian romance , and is associated with the recollection of scenes in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kaimur range of sandstone hills , which runs diagonally across the valley of the Nerbudda , are thrown up almost perpendicularly , in some places many hundred feet above the level of the plain , while in others for many miles together their tops are only visible above the surface . These are so many strings of the oxen which the arrows of Arjun , one of the five brothers , converted into stone ; and many a stream which now waters the valley first sprang from the surface of the earth at the touch of his lance , as his troops wanted water . The image of the gods of a former day , which now lie scattered among the ruins of old cities , buried in the depth of the forest , are nothing less than the bodies of the kings of the earth turned into stone for their temerity in contending with these demigods in battle . Ponds among the rocks of the Nerbudda , where all the great fairs are held , still bear the names of the five brothers , who are the heroes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited by hundreds of thousands who implicitly believe that their waters once received upon their bosoms the wearied limbs of those whose names they bear . What is life without the charms of fiction , and without the leisure and recreations which these sacred imaginings tend to give to the great mass of those who have nothing but the labour of their hands to depend upon for their subsistence ! Let no such fictions be believed , and the holidays and pastimes of the lower orders in every country would soon cease , for they have almost everywhere owed their origin and support to some religious dream which has commanded the faith and influenced the conduct of great masses of mankind , and prevented one man from presuming to work on the day that another wished to rest from his labours . The people were of opinion , they told me , that the Ganges , as a sacred stream , could last only sixty years more , when the Nerbudda would take its place . The waters of the Nerbudda are , they say already so much more sacred than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cleanse men from their sins , whereas the Ganges must be touched before it can have that effect. 13 At the temple built on the top of a conical hill at Bheraghat , overlooking the river , is a statue of a bull carrying Siva , the god of destruction , and his wife Parvati seated behind him ; they have both snakes in their hands , and Siva has a large one round his loins as a waistband . There are several demons in human shape lying prostrate under the belly of the bull , and the whole are well cut out of one large slab of hard basalt from a dyke in the marble rock beneath . They call the whole group ' Gauri Sankar ' , and I found in the fair , exposed for sale , a brass model of a similar one from Jeypore ( Jaipur ) , but not so well shaped and proportioned . On noticing this we were told that ' such difference was to be expected , since the brass must have been made by man , whereas the " Gauri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a conversion of living beings into stone by the gods ; 14 they were therefore the exact resemblance of living beings , while the others could only be rude imitations ' . ' Gauri ' , or the Fair , is the name of Parvati , or Devi , when she appears with her husband Siva . On such occasions she is always fair and beautiful . Sankar is another name of Siva , or Mahadeo , or Rudra . On looking into the temple at the statue , a lady expressed her surprise at the entireness as well as the excellence of the figures , while all round had been so much mutilated by the Muhammadans . ' They are quite a different thing from the others ' , said a respectable old landholder ; ' they are a conversion of real flesh and blood into stone , and no human hands can either imitate or hurt them . ' She smiled incredulously , while he looked very grave , and appealed to the whole crowd of spectators assembled , who all testified to the truth of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant day the figures would be all restored to life again , the deities would all come back without doubt and reanimate their old bodies again ' . All the people who come to bathe at the fair bring chaplets of yellow jasmine , and hang them as offerings round the necks of the god and his consort ; and at the same time they make some small offerings of rice to each of the many images that stand within the same apartment , and also to those which , under a stone roof supported upon stone pillars , line the inside of the wall that surrounds the circular area , in the centre of which the temple stands . The images inside the temple are those of the three great gods , Brahma , Vishnu , and Siva , with their primaeval consorts ; 15 but those that occupy the piazza outside are the representations of the consorts of the different incarnations of these three gods , and these consorts are themselves the incarnations of the primaeval wives , who followed their husbands in all their earthly ramblings . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of ordinary women , and extremely well cut out of fine white and green sandstone ; but their heads are those of the animals in which their respective husbands became incarnate , such as the lion , the elephant , &c.,; or those of the ' vahans ' , or animals on which they rode , such as the bull , the swan , the eagle , &c.; But these , I presume , are mere capricios of the founder of the temple . The figures are sixty-four in number , all mounted upon their respective ' vahans ' , but have been sadly mutilated by the pious Muhammadans. 16 The old ' Mahant ' , or high priest , told us that Mahadeo and his wife were in reality our Adam and Eve ; ' they came here together ' , said he , ' on a visit to the mountain Kailas , 17 and being earnestly solicited to leave some memorial of their visit , got themselves turned into stone ' . The popular belief is that some very holy man , who had been occupied on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now stands , in austere devotions for some few thousand years , was at last honoured with a visit from Siva and his consort , who asked him what they could do for him . He begged them to wait till he should bring some flowers from the woods to make them a suitable offering . They promised to do so , and he ran down , plunged into the Nerbudda and drowned himself , in order that these august persons might for ever remain and do honour to his residence and his name . They , however , left only their ' mortal coil ' , but will one day return and resume it . I know not whether I am singular in the notion or not , but I think Mahadeo and his consort are really our Adam and Eve , and that the people have converted them into the god and goddess of destruction , from some vague idea of their original sin , which involved all their race in destruction .

Barrackpore , fifteen miles north of Calcutta , is still a cantonment . The Governor General has a country house there . The mutiny of the native troops stationed there occurred on Nov. 1 , 1824 , and was due to the discontent caused by orders moving the 47th Native Infantry to Rangoon to take part in the Burmese War .

CHAPTER 2 Hindoo System of Religion . The Hindoo system is this . A great divine spirit or essence , ' Brahma ' , pervades the whole universe ; and the soul of every human being is a drop from this great ocean , to which , when it becomes perfectly purified , it is reunited . The reunion is the eternal beatitude to which all look forward with hope ; and the soul of the Brahman is nearest to it . If he has been a good man , his soul becomes absorbed in the ' Brahma ' ; and , if a bad man , it goes to ' Narak ' , hell ; and after the expiration of its period there of limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of some other animal . It again advances by degrees to the body of the Brahman ; and thence , when fitted for it , into the great ' Brahma ' . 1 From this great eternal essence emanate Brahma , the Creator , whose consort is Sarasvati ; 2 Vishnu , the Preserver , whose consort is Lakshmi ; and Siva , alias Mahadeo , the Destroyer , whose consort is Parvati . According to popular belief Jamraj ( Yamaraja ) is the judicial deity who has been appointed by the greater powers to pass the final judgement on the tenor of men 's lives , according to proceedings drawn up by his secretary Chitragupta . If men 's actions have been good , their souls are , as the next stage , advanced a step towards the great essence , Brahma ; and , if bad , they are thrown back , and obliged to occupy the bodies of brutes or of people of inferior caste , as the balance against them may be great or small . There is an intermediate stage , a ' Narak ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Baikunth ' , or paradise , for the good , in which they find their felicity in serving that god of the three to which they have specially devoted themselves while on earth . But from this stage , after the period of their sentence is expired , men go back to their pilgrimage on earth again . There are numerous Deos ( Devas ) , or good spirits , of whom Indra is the chief ; 3 and Daityas , or bad spirits ; and there have also been a great number of incarnations from the three great gods , and their consorts , who have made their appearance upon the earth when required for particular purposes . All these incarnations are called ' Avatars ' , or descents . Vishnu has been eleven times on the globe in different shapes , and Siva seven times. 4 The avatars of Vishnu are celebrated in many popular poems , such as the Ramayana , or history of the Rape of Sita , the wife of Rama , the seventh incarnation ; 5 the Mahabharata , and the Bhagavata Purana , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last human shape. 6 All these books are believed to have been written either by the hand or by the inspiration of the god himself thousands of years before the events they describe actually took place . ' It was ' , they say , ' as easy for the deity to write or dictate a battle , an amour , or any other important event ten thousand years before as the day after it took place ' ; and I believe nine-tenths , perhaps ninety-nine in a hundred , of the Hindoo population believe implicitly that these accounts were also written . It is now pretty clear that all these works are of comparatively recent date , that the great poem of the Mahabharata could not have been written before the year 786 of the Christian era , and was probably written so late as A.D. 1157 ; that Krishna , if born at all , must have been born on the 7th of August , A.D. 600 , but was most likely a mere creation of the imagination to serve the purpose of the Brahmans of Ujain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were invented about the same time , and for the same object , though the other persons described as incarnations were real princes , Parasu Rama , before Christ 1176 , and Rama , born before Christ 961 . In the Mahabharata Krishna is described as fighting in the same army with Yudhishthira and his four brothers . Yudhishthira was a real person , who ascended the throne at Delhi 575 B.C. , or 1175 years before the birth of Krishna. 7 Bentley supposes that the incarnations , particularly that of Krishna , were invented by the Brahmans of Ujain with a view to check the progress of Christianity in that part of the world ( see his historical view of the Hindoo astronomy ) . That we find in no history any account of the alarming progress of Christianity about the time these fables were written is no proof that Bentley was wrong. 8 When Monsieur Thevenot was at Agra in 1666 , the Christian population was roughly estimated at twenty-five thousand families . They had all passed away before it became one of our civil and military stations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search history in vain for any mention of them ( see his Travels in India , Part III ) . One single prince , well disposed to give Christians encouragement and employment , might , in a few years , get the same number around his capital ; and it is probable that the early Christians in India occasionally found such princes , and gave just cause of alarm to the Brahman priests , who were then in the infancy of their despotic power. 9 During the war with Nepal , in 1814 and 1815 , 10 the division with which I served came upon an extremely interesting colony of about two thousand Christian families at Betiya in the Tirhut District , on the borders of the Tarai forest . This colony had been created by one man , the Bishop , a Venetian by birth , under the protection of a small Hindoo prince , the Raja , of Betiya. 11 This holy man had been some fifty years among these people , with little or no support from Europe or from any other quarter . The only aid he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his Church should be subject to the Purveyance system , under which the people everywhere suffered so much , 12 and this pledge the Raja , though a Hindoo , had never suffered to be violated . There were men of all trades among them , and they formed one very large street remarkable for the superior style of its buildings and the sober industry of its inhabitants . The masons , carpenters , and blacksmiths of this little colony were working in our camp every day , while we remained in the vicinity , and better workmen I have never seen in India ; but they would all insist upon going to divine service at the prescribed hours . They had built a splendid pucka13 dwelling-house for their bishop , and a still more splendid church , and formed for him the finest garden I have seen in India , surrounded with a good wall , and provided with admirable pucka wells . The native Christian servants who attended at the old bishop 's table , taught by himself , spoke Latin to him ; but he was become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Italian , his native tongue , and Hindustani . We used to have him at our messes , and take as much care of him as of an infant , for he was become almost as frail as one . The joy and the excitement of being once more among Europeans , and treated by them with so much reverence in the midst of his flock , were perhaps too much for him , for he sickened and died soon after . The Raja died soon after him , and in all probability the flock has disappeared . No Europeans except a few indigo planters of the neighbourhood had ever before known or heard of this colony ; and they seemed to consider them only as a set of great scoundrels , who had better carts and bullocks than anybody else in the country , which they refused to let out at the same rate as the others , and which they ( the indigo lords ) were not permitted to seize and employ at discretion . Roman Catholics have a greater facility in making converts in India than Protestants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship to win the affections through the medium of the imagination. 14 Notes : 1 . Men are occasionally exempted from the necessity of becoming a Brahman first . Men of low caste , if they die at particular places , where it is the interest of the Brahmans to invite rich men to die , are promised absorption into the great ' Brahma ' at once . Immense numbers of wealthy men go every year from the most distant parts of India to die at Benares , where they spend large sums of money among the Brahmans . It is by their means that this , the second city in India , is supported . W. H. S. Bombay is now the second city in India , so far as population is concerned . 2 . Brahma , with the short vowel , is the eternal Essence or Spirit ; Brahma , with the long vowel , is ' the primaeval male god , the first personal product of the purely spiritual Brahma , when overspread by Maya , or illusory creative force ' , according to the Vedanta system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p. 44 ) . 3 . Indra was originally , in the Vedas , the Rain-god . The statement in the text refers to modern Hinduism. 4 . The incarnations of Vishnu are ordinarily reckoned as ten , namely , ( 1 ) Fish , ( 2 ) Tortoise , ( 3 ) Boar , ( 4 ) Man-lion , ( 5 ) Dwarf , ( 6 ) Rama with the axe , ( 7 ) Rama Chandra , ( 8 ) Krishna , ( 9 ) Buddha , ( 10 ) Kalki , or Kalkin , who is yet to come . I do not know any authority for eleven incarnations of Vishnu . The number is stated in some Puranas as twenty-two , twenty-four , or even twenty-eight . Seven incarnations of Siva are not generally recognized ( see Monier Williams , Religious Thought and Life in India , pp. 78-86 , and 107-16 ) . For the theory and mystical meaning of avatars , see Grierson , J.R.A.S. , 1909 , pp. 621-44 . The word avatar means ' descent ' , scil. of the Deity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . 5 . Sita was an incarnation of Lakshmi . She became incarnate again , many centuries afterwards , as the wife of Krishna , another incarnation of Vishnu W. H. S.. Reckoning by centuries is , of course , inapplicable to pure myth . The author believed in Bentley 's baseless chronology . 6 . For the Mahabharata , see ante , note 11 , Chapter 1 . The Bhagavata Purana is the most popular of the Puranas , The Hindi version of the tenth book ( skandha ) is known as the ' Prem Sagar ' . The date of the composition of the Puranas is uncertain . 7 . The dates given in this passage are purely imaginary . Parts of the Mahabharata are very ancient . Yudhishthira is no more an historical personage than Achilles or Romulus . It is improbable that a ' throne of Delhi ' existed in 575 B.C. , and hardly anything is known about the state of India at that date . 8 . It is hardly necessary to observe that this grotesque theory is utterly at variance with the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of native Christians at Agra are mostly of modern origin . Very ancient Christian communities exist near Madras , and on the Malabar coast . The travels of Jean de Thevenot were published in 1684 , under the title of Voyage , contenant la Relation de l'Indostan . The English version , by A. Lovell ( London , 1687 ) , is entitled The Travels of Monsieur de Thevenot into the Levant , in three Parts . Part III deals with the East Indies , The passage referred to is : ' Some affirm that there are twenty-five thousand Christian Families in Agra , but all do not agree in that ' ( Part III , p. 35 ) . Thevonot 's statement about the Christians of Agra is further discussed post in Chapter 52. 10 . The war with Nepal began in October , 1814 , and was not concluded till 1816 . During its progress the British arms suffered several reverses . 11 . The Betiya ( Bettiah of I.

' Pucka ' ( pakka ) here means ' masonry ' , as opposed to ' Kutcha ' ( kachcha ) , meaning ' earthen ' . 14 . Native Christians , according to the census of 1872 , number 1,214 persons , who are principally found in Bettia thana police-circle . There are two Missions , one at Bettia , and the other at the village of Chuhari , both supported by the Roman Catholic Church . The former was founded in 1746 by a certain Father Joseph , from Garingano in Italy , who went to Bettia on the invitation of the Maharaja . The present number of converts is about 1,000 persons . Being principally descendants of Brahmans , they hold a fair social position ; but some of them are extremely poor . About one-fourth are carpenters , one-tenth blacksmiths , one-tenth servants , the remainder carters . The Chuhari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been expelled from Nepal after the Gorkha conquest in 1768 . There are now 283 converts , mostly descendants of Nepalis . They are all agriculturists , and very poor ( Article ' Champaran District ' in Statistical Account of Bengal , 1877 ) . The statement in I.G. 1908 , s.v . Bettiah , differs slightly , as follows : ' A Roman Catholic Mission was established about 1740 by Father Joseph Mary , an Italian missionary of the Capuchin Order , who was passing near Bettiah on his way to Nepal , when he was summoned by Raja Dhruva Shah to attend his daughter , who was dangerously ill . He succeeded in curing her , and the grateful Raja invited him to stay at Bettiah and gave him a house and ninety acres of land . ' The Bettiah Mission still exists and maintains the Catholic Mission Press , where publications illustrating the history of the Capuchin Missions have been printed . Father Felix , O.C. , is at work on the subject . CHAPTER 3 Legend of the Nerbudda River . The legend is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambay , was wooed and won in the usual way by the Son river , which rises from the same tableland of Amarkantak , and flows east into the Ganges and Bay of Bengal. 1 All the previous ceremonies having been performed , the Son 2 came with ' due pomp and circumstance ' to fetch his bride in the procession called the ' Barat ' , up to which time the bride and bridegroom are supposed never to have seen each other , unless perchance they have met in infancy . Her Majesty the Nerbudda became exceedingly impatient to know what sort of a personage her destinies were to be linked to , while his Majesty the Son advanced at a slow and stately pace . At last the Queen sent Johila , the daughter of the barber , to take a close view of him , and to return and make a faithful and particular report of his person . His Majesty was captivated with the little Johila , the barber 's daughter , at first sight ; and she , ' nothing loath ' , yielded to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen herself ; and that his Majesty was no further in fault than in mistaking the humble handmaid for her noble mistress ; but , be that as it may , her Majesty no sooner heard of the good understanding between them , than she rushed forward , and with one foot sent the Son rolling back to the east whence he came , and with the other kicked little Johila sprawling after him ; for , said the high priest , who told us the story , ' You see what a towering passion she was likely to have been in under such indignities from the furious manner in which she cuts her way through the marble rocks beneath us , and casts huge masses right and left as she goes along , as if they were really so many coco-nuts ' . ' And was she ' , asked I , ' to have flown eastward with him , or was he to have flown westward with her ? ' ' She was to have accompanied him eastward ' , said the high priest , ' but her Majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go a single pace in the same direction with such wretches , and would flow west , though all the other rivers in India might flow east ; and west she flows accordingly , a virgin queen . ' I asked some of the Hindoos about us why they called her ' Mother Nerbudda ' , if she was really never married . ' Her Majesty ' , said they with great respect , ' would really never consent to be married after the indignity she suffered from her affianced bridegroom the Son ; and we call her Mother because she blesses us all , and we are anxious to accost her by the name which we consider to be at once the most respectful and endearing . ' Any Englishman can easily conceive a poet in his highest ' calenture of the brain ' addressing the ocean as ' a steed that knows his rider ' , and patting the crested billow as his flowing mane ; but he must come to India to understand how every individual of a whole community of many millions can address a fine river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hears and understands all they say , and exercises a kind of local superintendence over their affairs , without a single temple in which her image is worshipped , or a single priest to profit by the delusion . As in the case of the Ganges , it is the river itself to whom they address themselves , and not to any deity residing in it , or presiding over it : the stream itself is the deity which fills their imaginations , and receives their homage . Among the Romans and ancient Persians rivers were propitiated by sacrifices . When Vitellius crossed the Euphrates with the Roman legions to put Tiridates on the throne of Armenia , they propitiated the river according to the rites of their country by the suovetaurilia , the sacrifice of the hog , the ram , and the bull . Tiridates did the same by the sacrifice of a horse . Tacitus does not mention the river god , but the river itself , as propitiated ( see Annals , book vi , chap . 37 ) . 3 Plato makes Socrates condemn Homer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged to be a divinity , in offering to fight him , 4 and towards the river Sperchius , another acknowledged god , in presenting to the dead body of Patroclus the locks of his hair which he had promised to that river. 5 The Son river , which rises near the source of the Nerbudda on the tableland of Amarkantak , takes a westerly course for some miles , and then turns off suddenly to the east , and is joined by the little stream of the Johila before it descends the great cascade ; and hence the poets have created this fiction , which the mass of the population receive as divine revelation . The statue of little Johila , the barber 's daughter , in stone , stands in the temple of the goddess Nerbudda at Amarkantak , bound in chains. 6 It may here be remarked that the first overtures in India must always be made through the medium of the barber , whether they be from the prince or the peasant. 7 If a sovereign prince sends proposals to a sovereign princess , they must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never be considered as done in due form , as likely to prove propitious . The prince will , of course , send some relation or high functionary with him ; but in all the credentials the barber must be named as the principal functionary . Hence it was that Her Majesty was supposed to have sent a barber 's daughter to meet her husband . The ' Mahatam ' ( greatness or holiness ) of the Ganges is said , as I have already stated , to be on the wane , and not likely to endure sixty years longer ; while that of the Nerbudda is on the increase , and in sixty years is entirely to supersede the sanctity of her sister . If the valley of the Nerbudda should continue for sixty years longer under such a government as it has enjoyed since we took possession of it in 1817 , 8 it may become infinitely more rich , more populous , and more beautiful than that of the Nile ever was ; and , if the Hindoos there continue , as I hope they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they are so much attached , the prophecy may be realized in as far as the increase of honour paid to the Nerbudda is concerned . But I know no ground to expect that the reverence9 paid to the Ganges will diminish , unless education and the concentration of capital in manufactures should work an important change in the religious feelings and opinions of the people along the course of that river ; although this , it must be admitted , is a consummation which may be looked for more speedily on the banks of the Ganges than on those of a stream like the Nerbudda , which is neither navigable at present nor , in my opinion , capable of being rendered so . Commerce and manufactures , and the concentration of capital in the maintenance of the new communities employed in them , will , I think , be the great media through which this change will be chiefly effected ; and they are always more likely to follow the course of rivers that are navigable than that of rivers which are not. 10 Notes : 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District of the Central Provinces , is situated on a high tableland , and is a famous place of pilgrimage .

Concerning the prophecy that the sanctity of the Ganges will cease in 1895 , see note to Chapter 1 , ante , 13 .

We took a ride one evening to Gopalpur , a small village situated on the same bank of the Nerbudda , about three miles up from Bheraghat . On our way we met a party of women and girls coming to the fair . Their legs were uncovered half-way up the thigh ; but , as we passed , they all carefully covered up their faces . ' Good God ! ' exclaimed one of the ladies , ' how can these people be so very indecent ? ' They thought it , no doubt , equally extraordinary that she should have her face uncovered , while she so carefully concealed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going from the village to bathe in the holy stream. 2 Here there are some very pretty temples , built for the most part to the memory of widows who have burned themselves with the remains of their husbands , and upon the very spot where they committed themselves to the flames . There was one which had been recently raised over the ashes of one of the most extraordinary old ladies that I have ever seen , who burned herself in my presence in 1829 . I prohibited the building of any temple upon the spot , but my successor in the civil charge of the district , Major Low , was never , I believe , made acquainted with the prohibition nor with the progress of the work ; which therefore went on to completion in my absence . As suttees are now prohibited in our dominions3 and can not be often seen or described by Europeans , I shall here relate the circumstances of this as they were recorded by me at the time , and the reader may rely upon the truth of the whole tale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then about sixty-five years of age , here mixed her ashes with those of her husband , who had been burned alone four days before . On receiving civil charge of the district ( Jubbulpore ) in March , 1828 , I issued a proclamation prohibiting any one from aiding or assisting in suttee , and distinctly stating that to bring one ounce of wood for the purpose would be considered as so doing . If the woman burned herself with the body of her husband , any one who brought wood for the purpose of burning him would become liable to punishment ; consequently , the body of the husband must be first consumed , and the widow must bring a fresh supply for herself . On Tuesday , 24th November , 1829 , I had an application from the heads of the most respectable and most extensive family of Brahmans in the district to suffer this old woman to burn herself with the remains of her husband , Ummed Singh Upadhya , who had that morning died upon the banks of the Nerbudda. 4 I threatened to enforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and placed a police guard for the purpose of seeing that no one did so . She remained sitting by the edge of the water without eating or drinking . The next day the body of her husband was burned to ashes in a small pit of about eight feet square , and three or four feet deep , before several thousand spectators who had assembled to see the suttee . All strangers dispersed before evening , as there seemed to be no prospect of my yielding to the urgent solicitations of her family , who dared not touch food till she had burned herself , or declared herself willing to return to them . Her sons , grandsons , and some other relations remained with her , while the rest surrounded my house , the one urging me to allow her to burn , and the other urging her to desist . She remained sitting on a bare rock in the bed of the Nerbudda , refusing every kind of sustenance , and exposed to the intense heat of the sun by day , and the severe cold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulders . On Thursday , to cut off all hope of her being moved from her purpose , she put on the dhaja , or coarse red turban , and broke her bracelets in pieces , by which she became dead in law , and for ever excluded from caste . Should she choose to live after this , she could never return to her family . Her children and grandchildren were still with her , but all their entreaties were unavailing ; and I became satisfied that she would starve herself to death , if not allowed to burn , by which the family would be disgraced , her miseries prolonged , and I myself rendered liable to be charged with a wanton abuse of authority , for no prohibition of the kind I had issued had as yet received the formal sanction of the Government . On Saturday , the 28th , in the morning , I rode out ten miles to the spot , and found the poor old widow sitting with the dhaja round her head , a brass plate before her with undressed rice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked very collectedly , telling me that ' she had determined to mix her ashes with those of her departed husband , and should patiently wait my permission to do so , assured that God would enable her to sustain life till that was given , though she dared not eat or drink ' . Looking at the sun , then rising before her over a long and beautiful reach of the Nerbudda river , she said calmly , ' My soul has been for five days with my husband 's near that sun , nothing but my earthly frame is left ; and this , I know , you will in time suffer to be mixed with the ashes of his in yonder pit , because it is not in your nature or usage wantonly to prolong the miseries of a poor old woman ' . ' Indeed , it is not ,  --  my object and duty is to save and preserve them sic ; and I am come to dissuade you from this idle purpose , to urge you to live , and to keep your family from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not afraid of their ever being so thought : they have all , like good children , done everything in their power to induce me to live among them ; and , if I had done so , I know they would have loved and honoured me ; but my duties to them have now ended . I commit them all to your care , and I go to attend my husband , Ummed Singh Upadhya , with whose ashes on the funeral pile mine have been already three times mixed . ' 5 This was the first time in her long life that she had ever pronounced the name of her husband , for in India no woman , high or low , ever pronounces the name of her husband ,  --  she would consider it disrespectful towards him to do so ; and it is often amusing to see their embarrassment when asked the question by any European gentleman . They look right and left for some one to relieve them from the dilemma of appearing disrespectful either to the querist or to their absent husbands  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point , and are afraid he will attribute their silence to disrespect . They know that few European gentlemen are acquainted with them ; and when women go into our courts of justice , or other places where they are liable to be asked the names of their husbands , they commonly take one of their children or some other relation with them to pronounce the words in their stead . When the old lady named her husband , as she did with strong emphasis , and in a very deliberate manner , every one present was satisfied that she had resolved to die . ' I have ' , she continued , ' tasted largely of the bounty of Government , having been maintained by it with all my large family in ease and comfort upon our rent-free lands ; and I feel assured that my children will not be suffered to want ; but with them I have nothing more to do , our intercourse and communion here end . My soul ( pran ) is with Ummed Singh Upadhya : and my ashes must here mix with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see them together ' , said she , with a tone and countenance that affected me a good deal , ' under the bridal canopy ! '  --  alluding to the ceremonies of marriage ; and I am satisfied that she at that moment really believed that she saw her own spirit and that of her husband under the bridal canopy in paradise . I tried to work upon her pride and her fears . I told her that it was probable that the rent-free lands by which her family had been so long supported might be resumed by the Government , as a mark of its displeasure against the children for not dissuading her from the sacrifice ; that the temples over her ancestors upon the bank might be levelled with the ground , in order to prevent their operating to induce others to make similar sacrifices ; and lastly , that not one single brick or stone should ever mark the place where she died if she persisted in her resolution . But , if she consented to live , a splendid habitation should be built for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support out of these rent-free lands , her children should come daily to visit her , and I should frequently do the same . She smiled , but held out her arm and said , ' My pulse has long ceased to beat , my spirit has departed , and I have nothing left but a little earth , that I wish to mix with the ashes of my husband . I shall suffer nothing in burning ; and , if you wish proof , order some fire , and you shall see this arm consumed without giving me any pain ' . I did not attempt to feel her pulse , but some of my people did , and declared that it had ceased to be perceptible . At this time every native present believed that she was incapable of suffering pain ; and her end confirmed them in their opinion . Satisfied myself that it would be unavailing to attempt to save her life , I sent for all the principal members of the family , and consented that she should be suffered to burn herself if they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should ever do the same . This they all agreed to , and the papers having been drawn out in due form about midday , I sent down notice to the old lady , who seemed extremely pleased and thankful . The ceremonies of bathing were gone through before three o'clock , while the wood and other combustible materials for a strong fire were collected and put into the pit . After bathing , she called for a ' pan ' ( betel leaf ) and ate it , then rose up , and with one arm on the shoulder of her eldest son , and the other on that of her nephew , approached the fire . I had sentries placed all round , and no other person was allowed to approach within five paces . As she rose up fire was set to the pile , and it was instantly in a blaze . The distance was about 150 yards . She came on with a calm and cheerful countenance , stopped once , and , casting her eyes upward , said , ' Why have they kept me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to the sentries her supporters stopped ; she walked once round the pit , paused a moment , and , while muttering a prayer , threw some flowers into the fire . She then walked up deliberately and steadily to the brink , stepped into the centre of the flame , sat down , and leaning back in the midst as if reposing upon a couch , was consumed without uttering a shriek or betraying one sign of agony . A few instruments of music had been provided , and they played , as usual , as she approached the fire , not , as is commonly supposed , in order to drown screams , but to prevent the last words of the victim from being heard , as these are supposed to be prophetic , and might become sources of pain or strife to the living. 6 It was not expected that I should yield , and but few people had assembled to witness the sacrifice , so that there was little or nothing in the circumstances immediately around to stimulate her to any extraordinary exertions ; and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united to her husband in the next world , and the entire confidence that she would be so if she now burned herself , that alone sustained her . From the morning he died ( Tuesday ) till Wednesday evening she ate ' pans ' or betel leaves , but nothing else ; and from Wednesday evening she ceased eating them . She drank no water from Tuesday . She went into the fire with the same cloth about her that she had worn in the bed of the river ; but it was made wet from a persuasion that even the shadow of any impure thing falling upon her from going to the pile contaminates the woman unless counteracted by the sheet moistened in the holy stream . I must do the family the justice to say that they all exerted themselves to dissuade the widow from her purpose , and had she lived she would assuredly have been cherished and honoured as the first female member of the whole house . There is no people in the world among whom parents are more loved , honoured , and obeyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more honoured than the mother . No queen upon her throne could ever have been approached with more reverence by her subjects than was this old lady by all the members of her family as she sat upon a naked rock in the bed of the river , with only a red rag upon her head and a single-white sheet over her shoulders . Soon after the battle of Trafalgar I heard a young lady exclaim , ' I could really wish to have had a brother killed in that action ' . There is no doubt that a family in which a suttee takes place feels a good deal exalted in its own esteem and that of the community by the sacrifice . The sister of the Raja of Riwa was one of four or five wives who burned themselves with the remains of the Raja of Udaipur ; and nothing in the course of his life will ever be recollected by her brother with so much of pride and pleasure , since the Udaipur Raja is the head of the Rajput tribes. 7 I asked the old lady when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told me that about thirteen years before , while bathing in the river Nerbudda , near the spot where she then sat , with many other females of the family , the resolution had fixed itself in her mind as she looked at the splendid temples on the bank of the river erected by the different branches of the family over the ashes of her female relations who had at different times become suttees . Two , I think , were over her aunts , and one over the mother of her husband . They were very beautiful buildings , and had been erected at great cost and kept in good repair . She told me that she had never mentioned this her resolution to any one from that time , nor breathed a syllable on the subject till she called out ' Sat , sat , sat ' , 8 when her husband breathed his last with his head in her lap on the bank of the Nerbudda , to which he had been taken when no hopes remained of his surviving the fever of which he died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magistrate of Benares , in 1806 prevented the widow of a Brahman from being burned . Twelve months after her husband 's death she had been goaded by her family into the expression of a wish to burn with some relic of her husband , preserved for the purpose . The pile was raised to her at Ramnagar , 9 some two miles above Benares , on the opposite side of the river Ganges . She was not well secured upon the pile , and as soon as she felt the fire she jumped off and plunged into the river . The people all ran after her along the bank , but the current drove her towards Benares , whence a police boat put off and took her in . She was almost dead with the fright and the water , in which she had been kept afloat by her clothes . She was taken to Harding ; but the whole city of Benares was in an uproar , at the rescue of a Brahman 's widow from the funeral pile , for such it had been considered , though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , and his court was filled with the principal men of the city , imploring him to surrender the woman ; and among the rest was the poor woman 's father , who declared that he could not support his daughter ; and that she had , therefore , better be burned , as her husband 's family would no longer receive her . The uproar was quite alarming to a young man , who felt all the responsibility upon himself in such a city as10 Benares , with a population of three hundred thousand people , 11 so prone to popular insurrections , or risings en masse very like them . He long argued the point of the time that had elapsed , and the unwillingness of the woman , but in vain ; until at last the thought struck him suddenly , and he said that ' The sacrifice was manifestly unacceptable to their God  --  that the sacred river , as such , had rejected her ; she had , without being able to swim , floated down two miles upon its bosom , in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been rejected . Had she been an acceptable sacrifice , after the fire had touched her , the river would have received her ' . This satisfied the whole crowd . The father said that , after this unanswerable argument , he would receive his daughter ; and the whole crowd dispersed satisfied. 12 The following conversation took place one morning between me and a native gentleman at Jubbulpore soon after suttees had been prohibited by Government :  --  ' What are the castes among whom women are not permitted to remarry after the death of their husbands ? ' ' They are , sir , Brahmans , Rajputs , Baniyas ( shopkeepers ) , Kayaths ( writers ) . ' ' Why not permit them to marry , now that they are no longer permitted to burn themselves with the dead bodies of their husbands ? ' ' The knowledge that they can not unite themselves to a second husband without degradation from caste , tends strongly to secure their fidelity to the first , sir . Besides , if all widows were permitted to marry again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caste ? We should all soon sink to a level with the lowest . ' ' And so you are content to keep up your caste at the expense of the poor widows ? ' ' No ; they are themselves as proud of the distinction as their husbands are . ' ' And would they , do you think , like to hear the good old custom of burning themselves restored ? ' ' Some of them would , no doubt . ' ' Why ? ' ' Because they become reunited to their husbands in paradise , and are there happy , free from all the troubles of this life . ' ' But you should not let them have any troubles as widows . ' ' If they behave well , they are the most honoured members of their deceased husbands ' families ; nothing in such families is ever done without consulting them , because all are proud to have the memory of their lost fathers , sons , and brothers so honoured by their widows. 13 But women feel that they are frail , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to temptation and suspicion . ' ' And why do not the men burn themselves to avoid the troubles of life ? ' ' Because they are not called to it from Heaven , as the women are . ' ' And you think that the women were really called to be burned by the Deity ? ' ' No doubt ; we all believe that they were called and supported by the Deity ; and that no tender beings like women could otherwise voluntarily undergo such tortures  --  they become inspired with supernatural powers of courage and fortitude . When Duli Sukul , the Sihora14 banker 's father , died , the wife of a Lodhi cultivator of the town declared , all at once , that she had been a suttee with him six times before ; and that she would now go into paradise with him a seventh time . Nothing could persuade her from burning herself . She was between fifty and sixty years of age , and had grandchildren , and all her family tried to persuade her that it must be a mistake , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was burnt the day after the body of the banker . ' ' Did not Duli Sukul 's family , who were Brahmans , try to dissuade her from it , she being a Lodhi , a very low caste ? ' ' They did ; but they said all things were possible with God ; and it was generally believed that this was a call from Heaven . ' ' And what became of the banker 's widow ? ' ' She said that she felt no divine call to the flames . This was thirty years ago ; and the banker was about thirty years of age when he died . ' ' Then he will have rather an old wife in paradise ? ' ' No , sir ; after they pass through the flames upon earth , both become young in paradise . ' ' Sometimes women used to burn themselves with any relic of a husband , who had died far from home , did they not ? ' ' Yes , sir , I remember a fisherman , about twenty years ago , who went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to have been back in two months . Six months passed away without any news of him ; and at last the wife dreamed that he had died on the road , and began forthwith , in the middle of the night , to call out " Sat , sat , sat ! " Nothing could dissuade her from burning ; and in the morning a pile was raised for her , on the north bank of the large tank of Hanuman , 15 where you have planted an avenue of trees . There I saw her burned with her husband 's turban in her arms , and in ten days after her husband came back . ' ' Now the burning has been prohibited , a man can not get rid of a bad wife so easily ? ' ' But she was a good wife , sir , and bad ones do not often become suttees . ' ' Who made the pile for her ? ' ' Some of her family , but I forget who . They thought it must have been a call from Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream . ' ' You are a Rajput ? ' ' Yes . ' ' Do Rajputs in this part of India now destroy their female infants ? ' ' Never ; that practice has ceased everywhere in these parts ; and is growing into disuse in Bundelkhand , where the Rajas , at the request of the British Government , have prohibited it among their subjects . This was a measure of real good . You see girls now at play in villages , where the face of one was never seen before , nor the voice of one heard . ' ' But still those who have them grumble , and say that the Government which caused them to be preserved should undertake to provide for their marriage . Is it not so ? ' ' At first they grumbled a little , sir ; but as the infants grew on their affections , they thought no more about it . ' 16 Gurcharan Baboo , the Principal of the little Jubbulpore College , 17 called upon me one forenoon , soon after this conversation . He was educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ; is tolerably well read in English literature , and is decidedly a thinking man . After talking over the matter which caused his visit , I told him of the Lodhi woman 's burning herself with the Brahman banker at Sihora , and asked him what he thought of it . He said that ' In all probability this woman had really been the wife of the Brahman in some former birth  --  of which transposition a singular case had occurred in his own family . ' His great-grandfather had three wives , who all burnt themselves with his body . While they were burning , a large serpent came up , and , ascending the pile , was burnt with them . Soon after another came up , and did the same . They were seen by the whole multitude , who were satisfied that they had been the wives of his great-grandfather in a former birth , and would become so again after this sacrifice . When the " sraddh " , or funeral obsequies , were performed after the prescribed intervals , 18 the offerings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , to this day , every member of his family , and every Hindoo who had heard the story , believed that these two serpents had a just right to be considered among his ancestors , and to be prayed for accordingly in all " sraddh " . ' A few days after this conversation with the Principal of the Jubbulpore College , I had a visit from Bholi Sukul , the present head of the Sihora banker 's family , and youngest brother of the Brahman with whose ashes the Lodhi woman burned herself . I requested him to tell me all that he recollected about this singular suttee , and he did so as follows : ' When my eldest brother , the father of the late Duli Sukul , who was so long a native collector under you in this district , died about twenty years ago at Sihora , a Lodhi woman , who resided two miles distant in the village of Khitoli , which has been held by our family for several generations , declared that she would burn herself with him on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three different births , had already burnt herself with him three times , and had to burn with him four times more . She was then sixty years of age , and had a husband living of about the same age . We were all astounded when she came forward with this story , and told her that it must be a mistake , as we were Brahmans , while she was a Lodhi . She said that there was no mistake in the matter ; that she , in the last birth , resided with my brother in the sacred city of Benares , and one day gave a holy man who came to ask charity salt , by mistake , instead of sugar , with his food . That , in consequence , he told her she should , in the next birth , be separated from her husband , and be of inferior caste ; but that , if she did her duty well in that state , she should be reunited to him in the following birth . We told her that all this must be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if she were not allowed to burn herself , the other should not be allowed to take her place . We prevented the widow from ascending the pile , and she died at a good old age only two years ago at Sihora . My brother 's body was burned at Sihora , and the poor Lodhi woman came and stole one handful of the ashes , which she placed in her bosom , and took back with her to Khitoli . There she prevailed upon her husband and her brother to assist her in her return to her former husband and caste as a Brahman . No soul else would assist them , as we got the then native chief to prohibit it ; and these three persons brought on their own heads the pile , on which she seated herself , with the ashes in her bosom . The husband and his brother set fire to the pile , and she was burned . ' 19 ' And what is now your opinion , after a lapse of twenty years ? ' ' Why , that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pile she prophesied that my nephew Duli should be , what his grandfather had been , high in the service of the Government , and , as you know , he soon after became so . ' ' And what did your father think ? ' ' He was so satisfied that she had been the wife of his eldest son in a former birth , that he defrayed all the expenses of her funeral ceremonies , and had them all observed with as much magnificence as those of any member of the family . Her tomb is still to be seen at Khitoli , and that of my brother at Sihora . ' I went to look at these tombs with Bholi Sukul himself some short time after this conversation , and found that all the people of the town of Sihora and village of Khitoli really believed that the old Lodhi woman had been his brother 's wife in a former birth , and had now burned herself as his widow for the fourth time . Her tomb is at Khitoli , and his at Sihora . Notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who burns herself with her husband . The word , in common usage , is transferred to the sacrifice of the woman . 2 .

The author discusses infanticide as practised in Oudh in many passages of his Journey through the Kingdom of Oudh ( Bentley , 1858 ) , It is possible that female infanticide may be still prevalent in many Native States .

Before quitting Jubbulpore , to which place I thought it very unlikely that I should ever return , I went to visit the groves in the vicinity , which , at the time I held the civil charge of the district in 1828 , had been planted by different native gentlemen upon lands assigned to them rent-free for the purpose , on condition that the holder should bind himself to plant trees at the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that rate ; and that for each grove , however small , he should build and keep in repair a well , lined with masonry , for watering the trees , and for the benefit of travellers. 1 Some of these groves had already begun to yield fruit , and all had been married . Among the Hindoos , neither the man who plants a grove , nor his wife , can taste of the fruit till he has married one of the mango-trees to some other tree ( commonly the tamarind-tree ) that grows near it in the same grove . The proprietor of one of these groves that stands between the cantonment and the town , old Barjor Singh , had spent so much in planting and watering the grove , and building walls and wells of pucka2 masonry , that he could not afford to defray the expense of the marriage ceremonies till one of the trees , which was older than the rest when planted , began to bear fruit in 1833 , and poor old Barjor Singh and his wife were in great distress that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much prized by their children . They began to think that they had neglected a serious duty , and might , in consequence , be taken off before another season could come round . They therefore sold all their silver and gold ornaments , and borrowed all they could ; and before the next season the grove was married with all due pomp and ceremony , to the great delight of the old pair , who tasted of the fruit in June 1834 . The larger the number of the Brahmans that are fed on the occasion of the marriage , the greater the glory of the proprietor of the grove ; and when I asked old Barjor Singh , during my visit to his grove , how many he had feasted , he said , with a heavy sigh , that he had been able to feast only one hundred and fifty . He showed me the mango-tree which had acted the part of the bridegroom on the occasion , but the bride had disappeared from his side . ' And where is the bride , the tamarind ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died ' , said the old man , ' before we could bring about the wedding ; and I was obliged to get a jasmine for a wife for my mango . I planted it here , so that we might , as required , cover both bride and bridegroom under one canopy during the ceremonies ; but , after the marriage was over , the gardener neglected her , and she pined away and died . ' ' And what made you prefer the jasmine to all other trees after the tamarind ? ' ' Because it is the most celebrated of all trees , save the rose . ' ' And why not have chosen the rose for a wife ? ' ' Because no one ever heard of marriage between the rose and the mango ; while they sic take place every day between the mango and the chambeli ( jasmine ) . ' 3 After returning from the groves , I had a visit after breakfast from a learned Muhammadan , now guardian to the young Raja of Uchahara , 4 who resides part of his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the curious notion of the Hindoos regarding the necessity of marrying them ; and he told me that , among Hindoos , the man who went to the expense of making a tank dared not drink of its waters till he had married his tank to some banana-tree , planted on the bank for the purpose. 5 ' But what ' , said he with a smile , ' could you expect from men who believe that Indra is the god who rules the heavens immediately over the earth , that he sleeps during eight months in the year , and during the other four his time is divided between his duties of sending down rain upon the earth , and repelling with his arrows Raja Bali , who by his austere devotions ( tapasya ) has received from the higher gods a promise of the reversion of his dominions ? The lightning which we see ' , said the learned Maulavi , ' they believe to be nothing more than the glittering of these arrows , as they are shot from the bow of Indra upon his foe Raja @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maulavi Sahib , there are many good Muhammadans who believe that the meteors , which we call shooting stars , are in reality stars which the guardian angels of men snatch from the spheres , and throw at the devil as they see him passing through the air , or hiding himself under one or other of the constellations . Is it not so ? ' ' Yes , it is ; but we have the authority of the holy prophet for this , as delivered down to us by his companions in the sacred traditions , and we are bound to believe it . When our holy prophet came upon the earth , he found it to be infested with a host of magicians , who , by their abominable rites and incantations , get into their interest certain devils , or demons , whom they used to send up to heaven to listen to the orders which the angels received from God regarding men and the world below . On hearing these orders , they came off and reported them to the magicians , who were thereby enabled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . In this manner they often overheard the orders which the angel Gabriel received from God , and communicated them to the magicians as soon as he could deliver them to our holy prophet . Exulting in the knowledge obtained in this diabolical manner , these wretches tried to turn his prophecies into ridicule ; and , seeing the evil effects of such practices among men , he prayed God to put a stop to them . From that time guardian angels have been stationed in different parts of the heavens , to keep off the devils ; and as soon as one of them sees a devil sneaking too near the heaven of heavens , he snatches the nearest star , and flings it at him . ' 7 This , he added , was what all true Muhammadans believed regarding the shooting of stars . He had read nothing about them in the works of Plato , Aristotle , Hippocrates , or Galen , all of which he had carefully studied , and should be glad to learn from me what modern philosophers in Europe thought about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fixed stars visible to the naked eye ; their being radiant with unborrowed light , and probably every one of them , like our own sun , the great centre of a solar system of its own ; embracing the vast orbits of numerous planets , revolving around it with their attendant satellites ; the stars visible to the naked eye being but a very small portion of the whole which the telescope had now made distinctly visible to us ; and those distinctly visible being one cluster among many thousand with which the genius of Galileo , Newton , the Herschells , and many other modern philosophers had discovered the heavens to be studded . I remarked that the notion that these mighty suns , the centres of planetary systems , should be made merely to be thrown at devils and demons , appeared to us just as unaccountable as those of the Hindoos regarding Indra 's arrows . ' But ' , said he , ' these foolish Hindoos believe still greater absurdities . They believe that the rainbow is nothing but the fume of a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth this fume from a hole in the surface of the earth , without being himself seen ; and , when you ask them why , in that case , the rainbow should be in the west while the sun is in the east , and in the east while the sun is in the west , they know not what to say . ' 8 ' The truth is , my friend Maulavi Sahib , the Hindoos , like a very great part of every other nation , are very much disposed to attribute to supernatural influences effects that the wiser portion of our species know to rise from natural causes . ' The Maulavi was right . In the Mishkat-ul-Masabih , 9 the authentic traditions of their prophet , 10 it is stated that Ayesha , the widow of Muhammad , said , ' I heard His Majesty say , " The angels come down to the region next the world , and mention the works that have been pre-ordained in heaven ; and the devils , who descend to the lowest region , listen to what the angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carry them to fortune-tellers ; therefore , they tell a hundred lies with it from themselves " ' 11 ' Ibn Abbas said , " A man of His Majesty 's friends informed me , that whilst His Majesty 's friends were sitting with him one night , a very bright star shot ; and His Highness said , " What did you say in the days of ignorance when a star shot like this ? " They said , " God and His messenger know best ; we used to say , a great man was born to-night , and a great man died . " 12 Then His Majesty said , " You mistook , because the shootings of these stars are neither for the life nor death of any person ; but when our cherisher orders a work , the bearers of the imperial throne sing hallelujahs ; and the inhabitants of the regions who are near the bearers repeat it , till it reaches the lowest regions . After the angels which are near the bearers of the imperial throne say , " What did your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it is handed from one region to another , till the information reaches the people of the lowest region . Then the devils steal it , and carry it to their friends , ( that is ) magicians ; and these stars are thrown at these devils ; not for the birth or death of any person . Then the things which the magicians tell , having heard from the devils , are true , but these magicians tell lies , and exaggerate in what they hear " . ' Kutadah said , ' God has created stars for three uses ; one of them , as a cause of ornament of the regions ; the second , to stone the devil with ; the third , to direct people going through forests and on the sea . Therefore , whoever shall explain them otherwise , does wrong , and loses his time , and speaks from his own invention and embellishes ' . 13 Ibn Abbas . ' The prophet said , " Whoever attains to the knowledge of astrology for any other explanation than the three aforementioned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An astrologer is a magician , and a magician is a necromancer , and a necromancer is an infidel . " ' 14 This work contains the precepts and sayings of Muhammad , as declared by his companions , who themselves heard them , or by those who heard them immediately from those companions ; and they are considered to be binding upon the faith and conduct of Musalmans , though not all delivered from inspiration . Everything that is written in the Koran itself is supposed to have been brought direct from God by the angel Gabriel. 15 Notes : 1 .

Certain it is that no Hindoo will have a marriage in his family during the four months of the rainy season ; for among eighty millions of souls1 not one doubts that the Great Preserver of the universe is , during these four months , down on a visit to Raja Bali , and , consequently , unable to bless the contract with his presence. 2 Marriage is a sacred duty among Hindoos , a duty which every parent must perform for his children , otherwise they owe him no reverence . A family with a daughter unmarried after the age of puberty is considered to labour under the displeasure of the gods ; and no member of the other sex considers himself respectable after the age of puberty till he is married . It is the duty of his parent or elder brothers to have him suitably married ; and , if they do not do so , he reproaches them with his degraded condition . The same feeling , in a degree , pervades all the Muhammadan community ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old bachelors among us to their sad condition . Marriage , with all its ceremonies , its rights , and its duties , fills their imagination from infancy to age ; and I do not believe there is a country upon earth in which a larger portion of the wealth of the community is spent in the ceremonies , or where the rights are better secured , or the duties better enforced , notwithstanding all the disadvantages of the laws of polygamy . Not one man in ten can afford to maintain more than one wife , and not one in ten of those who can afford it will venture upon ' a sea of troubles ' in taking a second , if he has a child by the first . One of the evils which press most upon Indian society is the necessity which long usage has established of squandering large sums in marriage ceremonies . Instead of giving what they can to their children to establish them , and enable them to provide for their families and rise in the world , parents everywhere feel bound to squander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Men in India could never feel secure of being permitted freely to enjoy their property under despotic and unsettled governments , the only kind of governments they knew or hoped for ; and much of the means that would otherwise have been laid out in forming substantial works , with a view to a return in income of some sort or another , for the remainder of their own lives and of those of their children , were expended in tombs , temples , sarais , tanks , groves , and other works  --  useful and ornamental , no doubt , but from which neither they nor their children could ever hope to derive income of any kind . The same feeling of insecurity gave birth , no doubt , to this preposterous usage , which tends so much to keep down the great mass of the people of India to that grade in which they were born , and in which they have nothing but their manual labour to depend upon for their subsistence . Every man feels himself bound to waste all his stock and capital , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremonies which attend the marriage of his children , because his ancestors squandered similar sums , and he would sink in the estimation of society if he were to allow his children to be married with less . But it could not have been solely because men could not invest their means in profitable works , with any chance of being long permitted to enjoy the profits under such despotic and unsettled governments , that they squandered them in feeding idle people in marriage ceremonies ; since temples , tanks , and groves secured esteem in this life , and promised some advantage in the next , and an outlay in such works might therefore have been preferred . But under such governments a man 's title even to the exclusive possession of his wife might not be considered as altogether secure under the mere sanction of religion ; and the outlay in feeding the family , tribe , and neighbourhood during the marriage ceremony seems to have been considered as a kind of value in exchange given for her to society . There is nothing that she and her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of their marriage , if it happen to be large for their condition of life ; it is their amoka , their title of nobility ; 3 and their parents consider it their duty to make it as large as they can . A man would hardly feel secure of the sympathy of his family , tribe , circle of society , or rulers , for the loss of ' his ox , or his ass , or anything that is his ' , if it should happen to have cost him nothing ; and , till he could feel secure of their sympathy for the loss , he would not feel very secure in the possession . He , therefore , or those who are interested in his welfare , strengthen his security by an outlay which invests his wife with a tangible value in cost , well understood by his circle and rulers . His family , tribe , and circle have received the purchase money , and feel bound to secure to him the commodity purchased ; and , as they are in all such matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent among them is more efficacious in securing the exclusive enjoyment of the wife than if it had been paid in taxes or fees to them for a marriage licence. 4 The pride of families and tribes , and the desire of the multitude to participate in the enjoyment of such ceremonies , tend to keep up this usage after the cause in which it originated may have ceased to operate ; but it will , it is to be hoped , gradually decline with the increased feeling of security to person , property , and character under our rule . Nothing is now more common than to see an individual in the humblest rank spending all that he has , or can borrow , in the marriage of one of many daughters , and trusting to Providence for the means of marrying the others ; nor in the higher , to find a young man , whose estates have , during a long minority , under the careful management of Government officers , been freed from very heavy debts , with which an improvident father had left them encumbered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management , borrowing three times their annual rent , at an exorbitant interest , to marry a couple of sisters , at the same rate of outlay in feasts and fireworks that his grandmother was married with. 5 Notes : 1 .

See ante . Chapter 1 , note 3. 3 . The word amoka is corrupt , and even Sir George Grierson can not suggest a plausible explanation . Can it be a misprint for anka , in the sense of ' stamp ' ? 4 .

In 1772 Warren Hastings abolished the marriage fees levied up to that time in Bengal by the Muhammadan law-officers . But I am disposed to think that a modern finance minister might reconsider the propriety of imposing a moderate tax , carefully graduated . 5 . Extravagance in marriage expenses is still one of the principal curses of Indian society . Considerable efforts to secure reform have been made by various castes during recent years , but , as yet , small results only have been attained . The editor has seen numerous painful examples of the wreck of fine estates by young proprietors assuming the management after a long term of the careful stewardship of the Court of Wards . CHAPTER 7 The Purveyance System , We left Jubbulpore on the morning of the 20th November , 1835 , and came on ten miles to Baghauri . Several of our friends of the 29th Native Infantry accompanied us this first stage , where they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here some venders in wood to save the people from the miseries of the purveyance system ; but I now found that a native collector , soon after I had resigned the civil charge of the district , and gone to Sagar , 1 in order to ingratiate himself with the officers and get from them favourable testimonials , gave two regiments , as they marched over this road , free permission to help themselves gratis out of the store-rooms of these poor men , whom I had set up with a loan from the public treasury , declaring that it must be the wish and intention of Government to supply their public officers free of cost ; and consequently that no excuses could be attended to . From that time shops and shopkeepers have disappeared . Wood for all public officers and establishments passing this road has ever since , as in former times , been collected from the surrounding villages gratis , under the purveyance system , in which all native public officers delight , and which , I am afraid , is encouraged by European officers , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the trouble of seeing the men paid either for their wood or their labour ; and their head servants of the kitchen or the wardrobe weary and worry them out of their best resolutions on the subject . They make the poor men sit aloof by telling them that their master is a tiger before breakfast , and will eat them if they approach ; and they tell their masters that there is no hope of getting the poor men to come for their money till they have bathed or taken their breakfast . The latter wait in hopes that the gentleman will come out or send for them as soon as he has been tamed by his breakfast ; but this meal has put him in good humour with all the world , and he is now no longer unwilling to trust the payment of the poor men to his butler , or his valet de chambre . They keep the poor wretches waiting , declaring that they have as yet received no orders to pay them , till , hungry and weary , in the afternoon they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . If , in the meantime , the gentleman comes out , and finds the men , his servants pacify him by declaring either that they have not yet had time to carry his orders into effect , that they could not get copper change for silver rupees , or that they were anxious to collect all the people together before they paid any , lest they might pay some of them twice over . It is seldom , however , that he comes among them at all ; he takes it for granted that the people have all been paid ; and passes the charge in the account of his servants , who all get what these porters ought to have received . Or , perhaps the gentleman may persuade himself that , if he pays his valet or butler , these functionaries will never pay the poor men , and think that he had better sit quiet and keep the money in his own pocket . The native police or revenue officer is directed by his superior to have wood collected for the camp of a regiment or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to employ the people around in felling trees , and cutting up wood enough to supply not only the camp , but his own cook-rooms and those of his friends for the next six months . The men so employed commonly get nothing ; but the native officer receives credit for all manner of superlatively good qualities , which are enumerated in a certificate . Many a fine tree , dear to the affections of families and village communities , has been cut down in spite , or redeemed from the axe by a handsome present to this officer or his myrmidons . Lambs , kids , fowls , milk , vegetables , all come flowing in for the great man 's table from poor people , who are too hopeless to seek for payment , or who are represented as too proud and wealthy to receive it . Such always have been and such always will be some of the evils of the purveyance system . If a police officer receives an order from the magistrate to provide a regiment , detachment , or individual with boats , carts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found within his jurisdiction forthwith seized  --  releases all those whose proprietors are able and willing to pay what he demands , and furnishes the rest , which are generally the worst , to the persons who require them . Police officers derive so much profit from these applications that they are always anxious they should be made ; and will privately defeat all attempts of private individuals to provide themselves by dissuading or intimidating the proprietors of vehicles from voluntarily furnishing them . The gentleman 's servant who is sent to procure them returns and tells his master that there are plenty of vehicles , but that their proprietors dare not send them without orders from the police ; and that the police tell him they dare not give such orders without the special sanction of the magistrate . The magistrate is written to , but declares that his police have been prohibited from interfering in such matters without special orders , since the proprietors ought to be permitted to send their vehicles to whom they choose , except on occasions of great public emergency ; and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions , he does not feel authorized to issue such orders . On the Ganges , many men have made large fortunes by pretending a general authority to seize boats for the use of the commissariat , or for other Government purposes , on the ground of having been once or twice employed on that duty ; and what they get is but a small portion of that which the public lose . One of these self-constituted functionaries has a boat seized on its way down or up the river ; and the crew , who are merely hired for the occasion , and have a month 's wages in advance , seeing no prospect of getting soon out of the hands of this pretended Government servant , desert , and leave the boat on the sands ; while the owner , if he ever learns the real state of the case , thinks it better to put up with his loss than to seek redress through expensive courts , and distant local authorities . If the boat happens to be loaded and to have a supercargo , who will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sands by his crew ; in his search for aid from the neighbourhood , his helplessness becomes known  --  he is perhaps murdered , or runs away in the apprehension of being so  --  the boat is plundered and made a wreck . Still the dread of the delays and costs of our courts , and the utter hopelessness of ever recovering the lost property , prevent the proprietors from seeking redress , and our Government authorities know nothing of the circumstances . We remained at Baghauri the 21st to enable our people to prepare for the long march they had before them , and to see a little more of our Jubbulpore friends , who were to have another day 's shooting , as black partridges2 and quail had been found abundant in the neighbourhood of our camp. 3 Notes : 1 .

It will be observed that the author , though so keenly sensitive to the abuses attending the system , proposes no substitute for it , and confesses that the small attempt he made to check abuse was a failure . From time immemorial it has been the custom for Government officials in India to be supplied with necessaries by the people of the country through which their camps pass . Under native Governments no officials ever dream of paying for anything . In British territory requisitions are limited , and in well ordered civil camps nothing is taken without payment except wood , coarse earthen vessels , and grass . The hereditary village potter supplies the pots , and this duty is fully recognized as one attaching to his office . The landholders supply the wood and grass . None of these things are ordinarily procurable by private purchase in sufficient quantity , and in most cases could not be bought at all . Officers commanding troops send in advance requisitions specifying the quantities of each article needed , and the indent is met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including wood and grass , is supposed to be paid for , but in practice it is often impossible , with the agency available , to ensure actual payment to the persons entitled . Troops and the people in civil camps must live , and all that can be done is to check abuse , so far as possible , by vigilant administration . The obligation of landholders to supply necessaries for troops and officials on the march is so well established that it forms one of the conditions of the contract with Government under which proprietors in the permanently settled province of Benares hold their lands . The extreme abuses of which the system is capable under a lax and corrupt native Government are abundantly illustrated in the author 's Journey through the Kingdom of Oudh . ' The System of Purveyance and Forced Labour ' is the subject of article xxv in the Hon. F , J , Shore 's curious book , Notes on Indian Affairs ( London , 1837 , 2 vols. 8vo ) . Many of the abuses denounced by Mr. Shore have been suppressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to continue for many years . CHAPTER 8 Religious Sects  --  Self-government of the Castes  --  Chimney-sweepers  - -  Washerwomen1  --  Elephant Drivers . Mir Salamat Ali , the head native collector of the district , a venerable old Musalman and most valuable public servant , who has been labouring in the same vineyard with me for the last fifteen years with great zeal , ability , and integrity , came to visit me after breakfast with two very pretty and interesting young sons . While we were sitting together my wife 's under-woman2 said to some one who was talking with her outside the tent-door , ' If that were really the case , should I not be degraded ? ' ' You see , Mir Sahib ' , 3 said I , ' that the very lowest members of society among these Hindoos still feel the pride of caste , and dread exclusion from their own , however low . ' 4 ' Yes ' , said the Mir , ' they are a very strange kind of people , and I question whether they ever had a real prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether they really ever had such a person . They of course think the incarnations of their three great divinities were beings infinitely superior to prophets , being in all their attributes and prerogatives equal to the divinities themselves. 5 But we are disposed to think that these incarnations were nothing more than great men whom their flatterers and poets have exalted into gods  --  this was the way in which men made their gods in ancient Greece and Egypt . These great men were generally conquerors whose glory consisted in the destruction of their fellow creatures ; and this is the glory which their flatterers are most prone to extol . All that the poets have sung of the actions of men is now received as revelation from heaven ; though nothing can be more monstrous than the actions attributed to the best incarnation , Krishna , of the best of their gods , Vishnu. 6 ' No doubt ' , said Salamat Ali ; ' and had they ever had a real prophet among them he would have revealed better things to them . Strange people ! when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads shaved before the image of their god ; and the offering of the hair is equivalent to the offer of their heads ; 7 for heads , thank God , they dare no longer offer within the Company 's territories . ' ' Do you . Mir Sahib , think that they continue to offer up human sacrifices anywhere ? ' ' Certainly I do . There is a Raja at Ratanpur , or somewhere between Mandla and Sambalpur , who has a man offered up to Devi every year , and that man must be a Brahman . If he can get a Brahman traveller , well and good ; if not , he and his priests offer one of his own subjects . Every Brahman that has to pass through this territory goes in disguise. 8 With what energy did our emperor Aurangzeb apply himself to put down iniquities like this in the Rajputana states , but all in vain . If a Raja died , all his numerous wives burnt themselves with his body  --  even their servants , male and female , were obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is he to do in the next world without attendants ? The pile was enormous . On the top sat the queen with the body of the prince ; the servants , male and female , according to their degree , below ; and a large army stood all round to drive into the fire again or kill all who should attempt to escape . ' 9 ' This is all very true , Mir Sahib , but you must admit that , though there is a great deal of absurdity in their customs and opinions , there is , on the other hand , much that we might all take an example from . The Hindoo believes that Christians and Musalmans may be as good men in all relations of life as himself , and in as fair a way to heaven as he is ; for he believes that my Bible and your Koran are as much revelations framed by the Deity for our guidance , as the Shastras are for his . He doubts not that our Christ was the Son of God , nor that Muhammad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks from us is to allow him freely to believe in his own gods , and to worship in his own way . Nor does one caste or sect of Hindoos ever believe itself to be alone in the right way , or detest any other for not following in the same path , as they have as much of toleration for each other as they have for us. 10 ' True , ' exclaimed Salamat Ali , ' too true ! we have ruined each other ; we have cut each other 's throats ; we have lost the empire , and we deserve to lose it . You won it , and you preserved it by your union -- ten men with one heart are equal to a hundred men with different hearts . A Hindoo may feel himself authorized to take in a Musalman , and might even think it meritorious to do so ; but he would never think it meritorious to take in one of his own religion . There are no less than seventy-two sects of Muhammadans ; and every one of these sects would not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but every member of every one of the other seventy-one sects ; and the nearer that sect is to its own , the greater the merit in taking in its members . ' 11 ' Something has happened of late to annoy you , I fear , Mir Sahib ? ' ' Something happens to annoy us every day , sir , where we are more than one sect of us together ; and wherever you find Musalmans you will find them divided into sects . ' It is not , perhaps , known to many of my countrymen in India that in every city and town in the country the right of sweeping the houses and streets is one of the most intolerable of monopolies , supported entirely by the pride of caste among the scavengers , who are all of the lowest class . The right of sweeping within a certain range is recognized by the caste to belong to a certain member ; and , if any other member presumes to sweep within that range , he is excommunicated  --  no other member will smoke out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he can get restored to caste only by a feast to the whole body of sweepers . If any housekeeper within a particular circle happens to offend the sweeper of that range , none of his filth will be removed till he pacifies him , because no other sweeper will dare to touch it ; and the people of a town are often more tyrannized over by these people than by any other. 12 It is worthy of remark that in India the spirit of combination is always in the inverse ratio to the rank of the class ; weakest in the highest , and strongest in the lowest class . All infringements upon the rules of the class are punished by fines . Every fine furnishes a feast at which every member sits and enjoys himself . Payment is enforced by excommunication  --  no one of the caste will eat , drink , or smoke with the convicted till the fine is paid ; and , as every one shares in the fine , every one does his best to enforce payment . The fines are imposed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fix the amount accordingly . Washermen will often at a large station combine to prevent the washermen of one gentleman from washing the clothes of the servants of any other gentleman , or the servants of one gentleman from getting their clothes washed by any other person than their own master 's washerman . This enables them sometimes to raise the rate of washing to double the fair or ordinary rate ; and at such places the washermen are always drunk with one continued routine of feasts from the fines levied. 13 The cost of these fees falls ultimately upon the poor servants or their masters . This combination , however , is not always for bad or selfish purposes . I was once on the staff of an officer commanding a brigade on service , whose elephant driver exercised an influence over him that was often mischievous and sometimes dangerous ; 14 for in marching and choosing his ground , this man was more often consulted than the quarter-master-general . His bearing was most insolent , and became intolerable , as well to the European gentlemen as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by saying that he would spit in the face of another gentleman 's elephant driver with whom he was disputing . All the elephant drivers in our large camp were immediately assembled , and it was determined in council to refer the matter to the decision of the Raja of Darbhanga 's driver , who was acknowledged the head of the class . We were all breakfasting with the brigadier after muster when the reply came-the distance to Darbhanga from Nathpur on the Kusi river , where we then were , must have been a hundred and fifty miles. 16 We saw men running in all directions through the camp , without knowing why , till at last one came and summoned the brigadier 's driver . With a face of terror he came and implored the protection of the brigadier ; who got angry , and fumed a good deal , but seeing no expression of sympathy on the faces of his officers , he told the man to go and hear his sentence . He was escorted to a circle formed by all the drivers in camp , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the middle of the circle and commanded to stand on one leg17 while the Raja 's driver 's letter was read . He did so , and the letter directed him to apologize to the offended party , pay a heavy fine for a feast , and pledge himself to the offended drivers never to offend again . All the officers in camp were delighted , and some , who went to hear the sentence explained , declared that in no court in the world could the thing have been done with more solemnity and effect . The man 's character was quite altered by it , and he became the most docile of drivers . On the same principle here stated of enlisting the community in the punishment of offenders , the New Zealanders , and other savage tribes who have been fond of human flesh , have generally been found to confine the feast to the body of those who were put to death for offences against the state or the individual . I and all the officers of my regiment were at one time in the habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring immediately , and give to the first religious mendicant we could pick up , the fine we thought just . All the religionists in the neighbourhood declared that justice had never been so well administered in any other regiment ; no servant got any sympathy from them  --  they were all told that their masters were far too lenient . We crossed the Hiran river18 about ten miles from our last ground on the 22nd , 19 and came on two miles to our tents in a mango grove close to the town of Katangi , 20 and under the Vindhya range of sandstone hills , which rise almost perpendicular to the height of some eight hundred feet over the town . This range from Katangi skirts the Nerbudda valley to the north , as the Satpura range skirts it to the south ; and both are of the same sandstone formation capped with basalt upon which here and there are found masses of laterite , or iron clay . Nothing has ever yet been found reposing upon this iron clay. 21 The strata of this range have a gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angles to its face which overlooks the valley , and this face has everywhere the appearance of a range of gigantic round bastions projecting into what was perhaps a lake , and is now a well-peopled , well-cultivated , and very happy valley , about twenty miles wide . The river crosses and recrosses it diagonally . Near Jubbulpore it flows along for some distance close under the Satpura range to the south ; and crossing over the valley from Bheraghat , it reaches the Vindhya range to the north , at the point where it reaches the Hiran river , forty miles below . Notes : 1 . This is a slip , probably due to the printer 's reader . There are no chimney-sweepers in India . The word should be ' sweepers ' . The members of this caste and a few other degraded communities , such as the Doms , do all the sweeping , scavenging , and conservancy work in India . ' Washerwomen ' is another slip : read ' Washermen ' . 2 . The ' under-woman ' , or ' second ayah ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The title Mir Sahib implies that Salamat Ali was a Sayyid , claiming descent from Ali , the cousin , son-in-law , and pupil of Muhammad , who became Khalif in A.D. 656. 4 . The sweeper castes stand outside the Hindoo pale , and often incline to Muhammadan practices . They worship a special form of the Deity , under the names of Lal Beg , Lal Guru , &c.; 5 . No avatar or incarnation of Brahma is known to most Hindoos , and incarnations of Siva are rarely mentioned . The only avatars ordinarily recognized are those of Vishnu , as enumerated ante . Chapter 2 , note 4. 6 . This theory is a very inadequate explanation of the doctrine of avatars. 7 . ' Women . . . are most careful to preserve their hair intact .

If the story is true , the selection of a Brahman for sacrifice is remarkable , though not without precedent . Human sacrifice has prevailed largely in India , and is not yet quite extinct .

In the hill tracts of Orissa bordering on the Central Provinces the rite of human sacrifice was practised by the Khonds on an awful scale , and with horrid cruelty , It was suppressed by the special efforts of Macpherson , Campbell , MacViccar , and other officers , between the years 1837 and 1854 . Daring that period the British officers rescued 1,506 victims intended for sacrifice ( Narrative of Major-General John Campbell , C.B. , of his Operations in the Hill Tracts of Orissa for the Suppression of Human Sacrifices and Female Infanticide . Printed for private circulation . London : Hurst and Blackett , 1861 ) . The rite , when practised by Hindoos , may have been borrowed from some of the aboriginal races . The practice , however , has been so general throughout the world that few peoples can claim the honour of freedom from the stain of adopting it at one time or another , Much curious information on the subject , and many modern instances of human sacrifices in India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balfour , Cyclopaedia of India , 3rd edition , 1885 .

Bernier vividly describes an ' infernal tragedy ' of this kind which he witnessed , in or about the year 1659 , during Aurangzeb 's reign , in Rajputana . On that occasion five female slaves burnt themselves with their mistress ( Travels , ed . Constable and V. A. Smith ( 1914 ) , p. 309 ) . 10 . Hinduism is a social system , not a creed , A Hindoo may believe , or disbelieve , what speculative doctrine he chooses , but he must not eat , drink , or marry , save in accordance with the custom of his caste .

Mir Salamat Ali is a stanch Sunni , the sect of Osman ; and they are always at daggers drawn with the Shias , or the sect of Ali . He alludes to the Shias when he says that one of the seventy-two sects is always ready to take in the whole of the other seventy-one . Muhammad , according to the traditions , was one day heard to say , ' The time will come when my followers will he divided into seventy-three sects ; all of them will assuredly go to hell save one . ' Every one of the seventy-three sects believes itself to be the one happily excepted by their prophet , and predestined to paradise . I am sometimes disposed to think Muhammad was self-deluded , however difficult it might be to account for so much ' method in his madness ' . It is difficult to conceive a man placed in such circumstances with more amiable dispositions or with juster views of the rights and duties of men in all their relations with each other , than are exhibited by him on almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his divine mission was concerned . A very interesting and useful book might be made out of the history of those men , more or less mad , by whom multitudes of mankind have been led and perhaps governed ; and a philosophical analysis of the points on which they were really mad and really sane , would show many of them to have been fit subjects for a madhouse during the whole career of their glory . W. H. S. For an account of Muhammadan sects , see section viii of the Preliminary Dissertation in Sale 's Koran , entitled , ' Of the Principal Sects among the Muhammadans ; and of those who have pretended to Prophecy among the Arabs , in or since the Time of Muhammad ' ; and T. P. Hughes , Dictionary of Islam ( 1885 ) . The chief sects of the Sunnis , or Traditionists , are four in number .

The treatise of Professor Cesare Lombroso , entitled The Man of Genius ( London edition , 1891 ) , is devoted to proof and illustration of the proposition that genius is ' a special morbid condition ' . He deals briefly with the case of Muhammad at pages 31 , 39 , and 325 , maintaining that the prophet , like Saint Paul , Julius Caesar , and many other men of genius , was subject to epileptic fits . The Professor 's book seems to be exactly what Sir W. H. Sleeman desired to see . 12 . In the author 's time , when municipal conservancy and sanitation were almost unknown in India , the tyranny of the sweepers ' guild was chiefly felt as a private inconvenience . It is now one of the principal of the many difficulties , little understood in Europe , which bar the progress of Indian sanitary reform . The sweepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do their work to save his life , nor will he pollute himself even by beating the refractory scavenger . A strike of sweepers on the occasion of a great fair , or of a cholera epidemic , is a most dangerous calamity .

The convenient restriction of the name Vindhya to the hills north , and of Satpura to the hills south of the Nerbudda is of modern origin ( Manual of the Geology of India , 1st ed. , Part I , p. iv ) . The Satpura range , thus defined , separates the valley of the Nerbudda from the valleys of the Tapti flowing west , and the Mahanadi flowing east .

CHAPTER 9 The Great Iconoclast  --  Troops routed by Hornets  --  The Rani of Garha  - -  Hornets ' Nests in India . On the 23rd , 1 we came on nine miles to Sangrampur , and , on the 24th , nine more to the valley of Jabera , 2 situated on the western extremity of the bed of a large lake , which is now covered by twenty-four villages . The waters were kept in by a large wall that united two hills about four miles south of Jabera . This wall was built of great cut freestone blocks from the two hills of the Vindhiya range , which it united . It was about half a mile long , one hundred feet broad at the base , and about one hundred feet high . The stones , though cut , were never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given way in the centre , through which now falls a small stream that passes from east to west of what was once the bottom of the lake , and now is the site of so many industrious and happy little village communities. 3 The proprietor of the village of Jabera , in whose mango grove our tents were pitched , conducted me to the ruins of the wall ; and told me that it had been broken down by the order of the Emperor Aurangzeb. 4 History to these people is all a fairy tale ; and this emperor is the great destroyer of everything that the Muhammadans in their fanaticism have demolished of the Hindoo sculpture or architecture ; and yet , singular as it may appear , they never mention his name with any feelings of indignation or hatred . With every scene of his supposed outrage against their gods or their temples , there is always associated the recollection of some instance of his piety , and the Hindoos ' glory  --  of some idol , for instance , or column , preserved from his fury by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once to have recognized with all due reverence . At Bheragarh , 5 the high priest of the temple told us that Aurangzeb and his soldiers knocked off the heads , arms , and noses of all the idols , saying that ' if they had really any of the godhead in them , they would assuredly now show it , and save themselves ' . But when they came to the door of Gauri Sankar 's apartments , they were attacked by a nest of hornets , that put the whole of the emperor 's army to the rout ; and his imperial majesty called out : ' Here we have really something like a god , and we shall not suffer him to be molested ; if all your gods could give us proof like this of their divinity , not a nose of them would ever be touched ' . The popular belief , however , is that after Aurangzeb 's army had struck off all the prominent features of the other gods , one of the soldiers entered the temple , and struck off the ear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bull . ' My dear ' , said Gauri , ' do you see what these saucy men are about ? ' Her consort turned round his head ; 6 and , seeing the soldiers around him , brought all the hornets up from the marble rocks below , where there are still so many nests of them , and the whole army fled before them to Teori , five miles. 7 It is very likely that some body of troops by whom the rest of the images had been mutilated , may have been driven off by a nest of hornets from within the temple where this statue stands . I have seen six companies of infantry , with a train of artillery and a squadron of horse , all put to the rout by a single nest of hornets , and driven off some miles with all their horses and bullocks . The officers generally save themselves by keeping within their tents , and creeping under their bed-clothes , or their carpets ; and servants often escape by covering themselves up in their blankets , and lying perfectly still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which they throw themselves over precipices and break their limbs , or kill themselves . The grooms , in trying to save their horses , are generally the people who suffer most in a camp attacked by such an enemy . I have seen some so stung as to recover with difficulty ; and I believe there have been instances of people not recovering at all . In such a frightful scene I have seen a bullock sitting and chewing the cud as calmly as if the whole thing had been got up for his amusement . The hornets seldom touch any animal that remains perfectly still . On the bank of the Bina river at Eran , in the Sagar district , is a beautiful pillar of a single freestone , more than fifty feet high , surmounted by a figure of Krishna , with the glory round his head. 8 Some few of the rays of this glory have been struck off by lightning ; but the people declare that this was done by a shot fired at it from a cannon by order of Aurangzeb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Deccan . Before the scattered fragments , however , could reach the ground , the air was filled , they say , by a swarm of hornets , that put the whole army to flight ; and the emperor ordered his gunners to desist , declaring that he was ' satisfied of the presence of the god ' . There is hardly any part of India in which , according to popular belief , similar miracles were not worked to convince the emperor of the peculiar merits or sanctity of particular idols or temples , according to the traditions of the people , derived , of course , from the inventions of priests . I should mention that these hornets suspend their nests to the branches of the highest trees , under rocks , or in old deserted temples . Native travellers , soldiers , and camp followers , cook and eat their food under such trees ; but they always avoid one in which there is a nest of hornets , particularly on a still day . Sometimes they do not discover the nest till it is too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delighting in the prospect of the feast before him , as the smoke ascends in curling eddies to the nest of the hornets . The moment it touches them they sally forth and descend , and sting like mad creatures every living thing they find in motion . Three companies of my regiment were escorting treasure in boats from Allahabad to Cawnpore for the army under the Marquis of Hastings , in 1817. 9 The soldiers all took their dinners on shore every day ; and one still afternoon a sipahi ( sepoy ) , by cooking his dinner under one of those nests without seeing it , sent the infuriated swarm among the whole of his comrades , who were cooking in the same grove , and undressed , as they always are on such occasions . Treasure , food , and all were immediately deserted , and the whole of the party , save the European officers , were up to their noses in the river Ganges . The hornets hovered over them ; and it was amusing to see them bobbing their heads under as the insects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the carpets of their boats ; and , as the day was a hot one , their situation was still more uncomfortable than that of the men . Darkness alone put an end to the conflict . I should mention that the poor old Rani , or Queen of Garha , Lachhmi Kuar , came out as far as Katangi with us to take leave of my wife , to whom she has always been attached . She had been in the habit of spending a day with her at my house once a week ; and being the only European lady from whom she had ever received any attention , or indeed ever been on terms of any intimacy with , she feels the more sensible of the little offices of kindness and courtesy she has received from her. 10 Her husband , Narhar Sa , was the last of the long line of sixty-two sovereigns who reigned over these territories from the year A.D. 358 to the Sagar conquest , A.D. 1781. 11 He died a prisoner in the fortress of Kurai , in the Sagar district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One burnt herself upon the funeral pile , and the other was prevented from doing so , merely because she was thought too young , as she was not then fifteen years of age . She received a small pension from the Sagar Government , which was still further reduced under the Nagpur Government which succeeded it in the Jubbulpore district in which the pension had been assigned ; and it was not thought necessary to increase the amount of this pension when the territory came under our dominion , 13 so that she has had barely enough to subsist upon , about one hundred rupees a month . She is now about sixty years of age , and still a very good-looking woman . In her youth she must have been beautiful . She does not object to appear unveiled before gentlemen on any particular occasion ; and , when Lord W. Bentinck was at Jubbulpore in 1833 , I introduced , the old queen to him . He seemed much interested , and ordered the old lady a pair of shawls . None but very coarse ones were found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lordship said these were not such as a Governor-General could present , or a queen , however poor , receive ; and as his own ' toshakhana ' ( wardrobe ) had gone on , l4 he desired that a pair of the finest kind should be purchased and presented to her in his name . The orders were given in her presence and mine . I was obliged to return to Sagar before they could be carried into effect ; and , when I returned in 1835 , 15 I found that the rejected shawls had been presented to her , and were such coarse things that she was ashamed to wear them , as much , I really believe , on account of the exalted person who had given them , as her own . She never mentioned the subject till I asked her to let me see the shawls , which she did reluctantly , and she was too proud to complain . How the good intentions of the Governor-General had been frustrated in this case I have never learned . The native officer in charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left the place . Better could not , I suppose , be got at this time , and he did not like to defer giving them . Notes : 1 . November , 1835. 2 .

Similar lakes , formed by means of huge dams thrown across valleys , are numerous in the Central Provinces and Bundelkhand . The embankments of some of these lakes are maintained by the Indian Government , and the water is distributed for irrigation . Many of the lakes are extremely beautiful , and the ruins of grand temples and palaces are often found on their banks .

CHAPTER 10 The Peasantry and the Land Settlement . The officers of the 29th had found game so plentiful , and the weather so fine , that they came on with us as far as Jabera , where we had the pleasure of their society on the evening of the 24th , and left them on the morning of the 25th. 1 A great many of my native friends , from among the native landholders and merchants of the country , flocked to our camp at every stage to pay their respects , and bid me farewell , for they never expected to see me back among them again . They generally came out a mile or two to meet and escort us to our tents ; and much do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any part of the world , have the blessings of Heaven so fervently invoked upon him by so many worthy and respectable men as met us at every stage on our way from Jubbulpore . I am much attached to the agricultural classes of India generally , and I have found among them some of the best men I have ever known . The peasantry in India have generally very good manners , and are exceedingly intelligent , from having so much more leisure and unreserved and easy intercourse with those above them . The constant habit of meeting and discussing subjects connected with their own interests , in their own fields , and ' under their own fig-trees ' , with their landlords and Government functionaries of all kinds and degrees , prevents their ever feeling or appearing impudent or obtrusive ; though it certainly tends to give them stentorian voices , that often startle us when they come into our houses to discuss the same points with us . Nine-tenths of the immediate cultivators of the soil in India are little farmers , who hold a lease for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of their lands , which they cultivate with their own stock . One of these cultivators , with a good plough and bullocks , and a good character , can always get good land on moderate terms from holders of villages. 2 Those cultivators are , I think , the best , who learn to depend upon their stock and character for favourable terms , hold themselves free to change their holdings when their leases expire , and pretend not to any hereditary right in the soil . The lands are , I think , best cultivated , and the society best constituted in India , where the holders of estates of villages have a feeling of permanent interest in them , an assurance of an hereditary right of property which is liable only to the payment of a moderate Government demand , descends undivided by the law of primogeniture , and is unaffected by the common law , which prescribes the equal subdivision among children of landed as well as other private property , among the Hindoos and Muhammadans ; and where the immediate cultivators hold the lands they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract . When I speak of holders of villages , I mean the holders of lands that belong to villages . The whole face of India is parcelled out into estates of villages. 3 The village communities are composed of those who hold and cultivate the land , the established village servants , priest , blacksmith , carpenter , accountant , washerman , basket-maker ( whose wife is ex officio the midwife of the little village community ) , potter , watchman , barber , shoemaker , &c.,; &c.[4]; To these may be added the little banker , or agricultural capitalist , the shopkeeper , the brazier , the confectioner , the ironmonger , the weaver , the dyer , the astronomer or astrologer , who points out to the people the lucky day for every earthly undertaking , and the prescribed times for all religious ceremonies and observances . In some villages the whole of the lands are parcelled out among cultivating proprietors , and are liable to eternal subdivisions by the law of inheritance , which gives to each son the same share . In others , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold them on a specific lease for limited periods from a proprietor who holds the whole collectively under Government , at a rate of rent fixed either permanently or for limited periods . These are the two extremes . There are but few villages in which all the cultivators are considered as proprietors  --  at least but few in our Nerbudda territories ; and these will almost invariably be found of a caste of Brahmans or a caste of Rajputs , descended from a common ancestor , to whom the estate was originally given in rent-free tenure , or at a quit-rent , by the existing Government for his prayers as a priest , or his services as a soldier . Subsequent Governments , which resumed unceremoniously the estates of others , were deterred from resuming these by a dread of the curses of the one and the swords of the other. 5 Such communities of cultivating proprietors are of two kinds : those among whom the lands are parcelled out , each member holding his share as a distinct estate , and being individually responsible for the payment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those among whom the lands are not parcelled out , but the profits divided as among copartners of an estate held jointly . They , in either case , nominate one of their members to collect and pay the Government demand ; or Government appoints a man for this duty , either as a salaried servant or a lessee , with authority to levy from the cultivating proprietors a certain sum over and above what is demandable from him . The communities in which the cultivators are considered merely as leaseholders are far more numerous ; indeed , the greater part of the village communities in this part of India are of this description ; and , where the communities are of a mixed character , the cultivating proprietors are considered to have merely a right of occupancy , and are liable to have their lands assessed at the same rate as those held on a mere lease tenure . In all parts of India the cultivating proprietors in such mixed communities are similarly situated ; they are liable to be assessed at the same rate as others holding the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with which others are not encumbered . But this is not general ; it is as much the interest of the proprietor to have good cultivating tenants as it is that of the tenants to have good proprietors ; and it is felt to be the interest of both to adjust their terms amicably among themselves , without a reference to a third and superior party , which is always costly and commonly ruinous. 6 It is a question of very great importance , no less morally and politically than fiscally , which of these systems deserves most encouragement  --  that in which the Government considers the immediate cultivators to be the hereditary proprietors , and , through its own public officers , parcels out the lands among them , and adjusts the rates of rent demandable from every minute partition , as the lands become more and more subdivided by the Hindoo and Muhammadan law of inheritance ; or that in which the Government considers him who holds the area of a whole village or estate collectively as the hereditary proprietor , and the immediate cultivators as his lease-tenants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties without the aid of public officers , or interposing only to enforce the fulfilment of their mutual contracts . In the latter of these two systems the land will supply more and better members to the middle and higher classes of the society , and create and preserve a better feeling between them and the peasantry , or immediate cultivators of the soil ; and it will occasion the re-investment upon the soil , in works of ornament and utility , of a greater portion of the annual returns of rent and profit , and a less expenditure in the costs of litigation in our civil courts , and bribery to our public officers . Those who advocate the other system , which makes the immediate cultivators the proprietors , will , for the most part , be found to reason upon false premisses  --  upon the assumption that the rates of rent demandable from the immediate cultivators of the soil were everywhere limited and established by immemorial usage , in a certain sum of money per acre , or a certain share of the crop produced from it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fixed , but everywhere well known to the people ' , and might , consequently , have become well known to the Government , and recorded in public registers . Now every practical man in India , who has had opportunities of becoming well acquainted with the matter , knows that the reverse is the case ; that the rate of rent demandable from these cultivators never was the same upon any two estates at the same time : nor even the same upon any one estate at different limes , or for any consecutive number of years. 7 The rates vary every year on every estate , according to the varying circumstances that influence them  --  such as greater or less exhaustion of the soil , greater or less facilities of irrigation , manure , transit to market , drainage  --  or from fortuitous advantages on one hand , or calamities of season on the other ; or many other circumstances which affect the value of the land , and the abilities of the cultivators to pay . It is not so much the proprietors of the estate or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a readjustment of the rate demandable upon their different holdings . This readjustment must take place ; and , if there is no landlord to effect it , Government must effect it through its own officers . Every holding becomes subdivided when the cultivating proprietor dies and leaves more than one child ; and , as the whole face of the country is open and without hedges , the division is easily and speedily made . Thus the field-map which represents an estate one year will never represent it fairly five years after ; in fact , we might almost as well attempt to map the waves of the ocean as field-map the face of any considerable area in any part of India. 8 If there be any truth in my conclusions , our Government has acted unwisely in going , as it has generally done , into one or other of the two extremes , in its settlement of the land revenue . In the Zamindari settlement of Bengal , it conferred the hereditary right of property over areas larger than English counties on individuals , and left the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting the comfort and welfare of the village communities , or conciliating the affections of the cultivators , whom they never saw or wished to see ; and they let out the village , or other subdivision of their estates , to second parties quite as little interested , who again let them out to others , so that the system of rack-renting went on over the whole area of the immense possession . This was a system ' more honoured in the breach than in the observance ' ; for , as the great landholders became involved in the ruin of their cultivators , their estates were sold for arrears of revenue due to Government , and thus the proprietary right of one individual has become divided among many , who will have the feelings which the larger holders wanted , and so remedy the evil . In the other extreme , Government has constituted the immediate cultivators the proprietors ; thereby preventing any one who is supported upon the rent of land , or the profits of agricultural stock , from rising above the grade of a peasant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most essential elements . The remedy of both is in village settlements , in which the estate shall be of moderate size , and the hereditary property of the holder , descending on the principle of a principality , by the right of primogeniture , unaffected by the common law . This is the system which has been adopted in the Nerbudda territory , and which , I trust , will be always adhered to . When we enter upon the government of any new territorial acquisition in India , we do not require or pretend to change the civil laws of the people ; because their civil laws and their religion are in reality one and the same , and are contained in one and the same code , as certainly among the Hindoos , the Muhammadans , and the Parsees , as they were among the Israelites . By these codes , and the established usages everywhere well understood by the people , are their rights and duties in marriage , inheritance , succession , caste , contract , and all the other civil relations of life , ascertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend to alter such rights and duties in relation to each other , we merely change the machinery and mode of procedure by which these rights are secured and these duties enforced. 10 Of criminal law no system was ever either regularly established or administered in any state in India , by any Government to which we have succeeded ; and the people always consider the existing Government free to adopt that which may seem best calculated to effect the one great object , which criminal law has everywhere in view  --  the security of life , property , and character , and the enjoyment of all their advantages . The actions by which these are affected and endangered , the evidence by which such actions require to be proved , and the penalties with which they require to be visited , in order to prevent their recurrence , are , or ought to be , so much the same in every society , that the people never think us bound to search for what Muhammad and his companions thought in the wilds of Arabia , or the Sanskrit poets sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as well pleased everywhere to find us searching for these things in the writings of Confucius and Zoroaster , as in those of Muhammad and Manu : and much more so , to see us consulting our own common-sense , and forming a penal code of our own , suitable to the wants of such a mixed community. 11 The fiscal laws which define the rights and duties of the landed interests and the agricultural classes in relation to each other and to the ruling powers were also everywhere exceedingly simple and well understood by the people . What in England is now a mere fiction of law is still in India an essential principle . All lands are held directly or indirectly of the sovereign : to this rule there is no exception. 12 The reigning sovereign is essentially the proprietor of the whole of the lands in every part of India , where he has not voluntarily alienated them ; and he holds these lands for the payment of those public establishments which are maintained for the public good , and are supported by the rents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereign proprietor . When a Muhammadan or Hindoo sovereign assigned lands rent-free in perpetuity , it was always understood , both by the donor and receiver , to be with the small reservation of a right in his successor to resume them for the public good , if he should think fit. 13 Hindoo sovereigns , or their priests for them , often tried to bar this right by invoking curses on the head of that successor who should exercise it. 14 It is a proverb among the people of these territories , and , I believe , among the people of India generally , that the lands which pay no rent to Government have no ' barkat ' , blessing from above  --  that the man who holds them is not blessed in their returns like the man who pays rent to Government and thereby contributes his aid to the protection of the community . The fact is that every family that holds rent-free lands must , in a few generations , become miserable from the minute subdivision of the property , and the litigation in our civil courts which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general opinion of the people of India that no land should be held without paying rent to Government , or providing for people employed in the service of Government , for the benefit of the people in its defensive , religious , judicial , educational , and other establishments . Nine-tenths of the land in these Nerbudda territories are held in lease immediately under Government by the heads of villages , whose leases have been renewable every five years ; but they are now to have a settlement for twenty. l6 The other tenth is held by these heads of villages intermediately under some chief , who holds several portions of land immediately under Government at a quit-rent , or for service performed , or to be performed , for Government , and lets them out to farmers . These are , for the most part , situated in the more hilly and less cultivated parts . Notes : 1 . November , 1835. 2 . This observation does not hold good in densely populated tracts , which are now numerous . 3 . These ' estates of villages ' are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The topographical division of the country into ' mauzas ' , which may be also translated by the terms ' townlands ' or ' townships ' , has developed spontaneously . Some ' mauzas ' are uninhabited , and are cultivated by the residents of neighbouring villages . 4 . In some parts of Central and Southern India , the ' Garpagri ' , who charms away hail-storms from the crops , and ' Bhumka ' , who charms away tigers from the people and their cattle , are added to the number of village servants , W. H . S. ' In many parts of Berar and Malwa every village has its " bhumka " , whose office it is to charm the tigers ; and its " garpagri " , whose duty it is to keep off the hail-storms . They are part of the village servants , and paid by the village community , After a severe hail-storm took place in the district of Narsinghpur , of which I had the civil charge in 1823 , the office of " garpagri " was restored to several villages in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Brahmans , and take advantage of such calamities to impress the people with an opinion of their usefulness . The " bhumkas " are all Gonds , or people of the woods , who worship their own Lares and Penates ' ( Ramaseeana , Introduction , p. 13. note ) . 5 . Very often the Government of the country know nothing of these tenures ; the local authorities allowed them to continue as a perquisite of their own . The holders were willing to pay them a good share of the rent , assured that they would be resumed if reported by the local authorities to the Government . These authorities consented to take a moderate share of the rent , assured that they should get little or nothing if the lands were resumed . W. H. S. ' Rent ' here means ' land-revenue ' . Of course , under modern British administration the particulars of all tenures are known and recorded in great detail , 6 . Since the author wrote these remarks the legal position of cultivating proprietors and tenants has been largely modified by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rent Acts , which began with Act x of 1859 , are now numerous , and have been accompanied by a series of Land Revenue Acts , and many collateral enactments . All the problems of the Irish land question are familiar topics to the Anglo-Indian courts and legislatures. 7 . This proposition no doubt was true for the ' Sagar and Nerbudda Territories ' in 1835 , but it can not be predicated of the thickly populated and settled districts in the Gangetic valley without considerable qualification . Examples of long-established , unchanged , well-known rent-rates are not uncommon . 8 . In recent years this task of ' mapping the waves of the ocean ' has been attempted . Every periodical settlement of the land revenue in Northern India since 1833 has been accompanied by the preparation of detailed village maps , showing each field , even the tiniest , a few yards square , with a separate number . In many cases these maps were roughly constructed under non-professional supervision , but in many districts they have been prepared by the cadastral branch of the Survey Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt , and it constantly happens that beautiful maps become useless in four or five years . Efforts are made to insert annual corrections in copies of the maps through the agency of the village accountants , and the ' kanungos ' , or officers who supervise them , but the task is an enormous one , and only partial success is attained . In addition to the maps , records of great bulk are annually prepared which give the most minute details about every holding and each field . 9 . The Permanent Settlement of Bengal , effected under the orders of Lord Cornwallis in 1793 , was soon afterwards extended to the province of Benares , now included in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh . Illusory provisions were made to protect the rights of tenants , but nothing at all effectual was done till the passing of Act x of 1859 , which has been largely modified by later legislation . 10 . The general principle here stated of respect for personal substantive law in civil matters is still the guide of the Indian Legislature , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined with the action of codes , has effected considerable gradual change . Direct legislation has anglicized the law of contract , and has modified , though not so largely , the law of marriage , inheritance , and succession . 11 . In the author 's time the courts of the East India Company still followed the Muhammadan criminal law , as modified by the Regulations . The Indian Penal Code of 1869 placed the substantive criminal law on a thoroughly scientific basis . This code was framed with such masterly skill that to this day it has needed little material amendment . The first Criminal Procedure Code , passed in 1861 , has been twice recast . The law of evidence was codified by Sir James FitzJames Stephen in the Indian Evidence Act of 1870. 12 . This proposition , in the editor 's opinion , truly states the theory of land tenures in India , and it was a generally accurate statement of actual fact in the author 's time . Since then the long continuance of settled government , by fostering the growth of private rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The modern revenue codes , instead of postulating the ownership of the state , enact that the claims of the state  --  that is to say , the land-revenue -- are the first charge on the land and its produce . The Malabar coast offers an exception to the general Hindu role of state ownership of land . The Nairs , Coorgs , and Tulus enjoyed full proprietary rights ( Dubois , Hindu Manners , &c_.,; 3rd edition ( 1906 ) , p. 57 ) . 13 . Amir Khan , the Nawab of Tonk , assigned to his physician , who had cured him of an intermittent fever , lands yielding one thousand rupees a year , in rent-free tenure , and gave him a deed signed by himself and his heir-apparent , declaring expressly that it should descend to him and his heir for ever . He died lately , and his son and successor , who had signed the deed , resumed the estate without ceremony . On being remonstrated with , he said that ' his father , while living , was , of course , master , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land rent-free to whom he pleased ; but his successor must now be considered the best judge whether they could be spared or not ; that if lands were to be alienated in perpetuity by every reigning Nawab for every dose of medicine or dose of prayers that he or the members of his family required , none would soon be left for the payment of the soldiers , or other necessary public servants of any description ' . This was told me by the son of the old physician , who was the person to whom the speech was made , his father having died before Amir Khan . W. H. S. Amir Khan was the famous Pindhari leader . H. T. Prinsep translated his Memoirs from the Persian of Busawun Lal ( Calcutta , 1832 ) . 14 . The ancient deeds of grant , engraved on copper , of which so many have been published within the last hundred years , almost invariably conclude with fearful curses on the head of any rash mortal who may dare to revoke the grant . Usually the pious hope is expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he may rot in filth , and be reborn a worm . 15 . Revenue officers commonly observe that revenue-free grants , which the author calls rent-free , are often ill cultivated . The simple reason is that the stimulus of the collector 's demand is wanting to make the owner exert himself . 16 . These leases now carry with them a right of ownership , involving the power of alienation , subject to the lien of the land revenue as a first charge . Conversely , the modern codes lay down the principle that the revenue settlement must be made with the proprietor . The author 's rule of agricultural succession by primogeniture in the Nerbudda territories has survived only in certain districts ( see post , Chapter 47 ) . The land-revenue law and the law concerning the relations between landlords and tenants have now been more or less successfully codified in each province . Mr. B. H. Baden-Powell 's encyclopaedic work The Land Systems of British India ( 3 volumes : Oxford , Clarendon Press , 1892 ) gives very full information concerning Indian tenures as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the date of publication . CHAPTER 11 Witchcraft . On leaving Jabera , 1 I saw an old acquaintance from the eastern part of the Jubbulpore district , Kehri Singh . ' I understand , Kehri Singh ' , said I , ' that certain men among the Gonds of the jungle , towards the source of the Nerbudda , eat human flesh . Is it so ? ' ' No , sir ; the men never eat people , but the Gond women do . ' ' Where ? ' ' Everywhere , sir ; there is not a parish , nay , a village , among the Gonds , in which you will not find one or more such women . ' ' And how do they eat people ? ' ' They eat their livers , sir . ' ' Oh , I understand ; you mean witches ? ' ' Of course ! Who ever heard of other people eating human beings ? ' ' And you really still think , in spite of all that we have done and said , that there are such things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not we find instances of it every day ? European gentlemen are too apt to believe that things like this are not to be found here , because they are not to be found in their own country . Major Wardlow , when in charge of the Seoni district , denied the existence of witchcraft for a long time , but he was at last convinced . ' ' How ? ' ' One of his troopers , one morning after a long march , took some milk for his master 's breakfast from an old woman without paying for it . Before the major had got over his breakfast the poor trooper was down upon his back , screaming from the agony of internal pains . We all knew immediately that he had been bewitched , and recommended the major to send for some one learned in these matters to find out the witch . He did so , and , after hearing from the trooper the story about the milk , this person at once declared that the woman from whom he got it was the criminal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trooper , and commanded to cure him . She flatly denied that she had herself conjured him ; but admitted that her household gods might , unknown to her , have punished him for his wickedness . This , however , would not do . She was commanded to cure the man , and she set about collecting materials for the " puja " ( worship ) ; and before she could get quite through the ceremonies , all his pains had left him . Had we not been resolute with her , the man must have died before evening , so violent were his torments . ' ' Did not a similar case occur to Mr. Fraser at Jubbulpore ? ' ' A " chaprasi " 2 of his , while he had charge of the Jubbulpore district , was sent out to Mandla3 with a message of some kind or other . He took a cock from an old Gond woman without paying for it , and , being hungry after a long journey , ate the whole of it in a curry . He heard the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , he thought nothing of it , ate his cock , and went to sleep . He had not been asleep three hours before he was seized with internal pains , and the old cock was actually heard crowing in his belly . He made the best of his way back to Jubbulpore , several stages , and all the most skilful men were employed to charm away the effect of the old woman 's spell , but in vain . He died , and the cock never ceased crowing at intervals up to the hour of his death . ' ' And was Mr. Fraser convinced ? ' ' I never heard , but suppose he must have been . ' ' Who ate the livers of the victims ? The witches themselves , or the evil spirits with whom they had dealings ? ' ' The evil spirits ate the livers ; but they are set on to do so by the witches , who get them into their power by such accursed sacrifices and offerings . They will often dig up young children from their graves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed upon their livers , as falconers allow their hawks to feed on the breasts of pigeons . You " sahib log " ( European gentlemen ) will not believe all this , but it is , nevertheless , all very true . ' 4 The belief in sorcery among these people owes its origin , in a great measure , to the diseases of the liver and spleen to which the natives , and particularly the children , are much subject in the jungly parts of Central India . From these affections children pine away and die , without showing any external marks of disease . Their death is attributed to witchcraft , and any querulous old woman , who has been in the habit of murmuring at slights and ill treatment in the neighbourhood , is immediately set down as the cause . Men who practise medicine among them are very commonly supposed to be at the same time wizards . Seeking to inspire confidence in their prescriptions by repeating prayers and incantations over the patient , or over the medicine they give him , they make him believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient concludes that those who can command these powers to cure can , if they will , command them to destroy . He and his friends believe that the man who can command these powers to cure one individual can command them to cure any other ; and , if he does not do so , they believe that it arises from a desire to destroy the patient . I have , in these territories , known a great many instances of medical practitioners having been put to death for not curing young people for whom they were required to prescribe . Several cases have come before me as a magistrate in which the father has stood over the doctor with a drawn sword by the side of the bed of his child , and cut him down and killed him the moment the child died , as he had sworn to do when he found the patient sinking under his prescriptions. 5 The town of Jubbulpore contains a population of twenty thousand souls , 6 and they all believed in this story of the cock . I one day asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how the people could believe in such things , when he replied that he had no doubt witches were to be found in every part of India , though they abounded most , no doubt , in the central parts of it , and that we ought to consider ourselves very fortunate in having no such things in England . ' But ' , added he , ' of all countries that between Mandla and Katak ( Cuttack ) 7 is the worst for witches . I had once occasion to go to the city of Ratanpur8 on business , and was one day , about noon , walking in the market-place and eating a very fine piece of sugar-cane . In the crowd I happened , by accident , to jostle an old woman as she passed me . I looked back , intending to apologize for the accident , and heard her muttering indistinctly as she passed on . Knowing the propensities of these old ladies , I became somewhat uneasy , and on turning round to my cane I found , to my great terror , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute had elapsed , such were the fearful powers of this old woman . I collected my followers , and , leaving my agents there to settle my accounts , was beyond the boundaries of the old wretch 's influence before dark ; had I remained , nothing could have saved me . I should certainly have been a dead man before morning . It is well known ' , said the old gentleman , ' that their spells and curses can only reach a certain distance , ten or twelve miles ; and , if you offend one of them , the sooner you place that distance between you the better . ' Jangbar Khan , the representative of the Shahgarh Raja , 9 as grave and reverend an old gentleman as ever sat in the senate of Venice , told me one day that he was himself an eye-witness of the powers of the women of Khilauti . He was with a great concourse of people at a fair held at the town of Raipur , 10 and , while sauntering with many other strangers in the fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle age for some very fine sugar-canes . They asked double the fair price for their canes . The man got angry , and took up one of them , when the women seized the other end , and a struggle ensued . The purchaser offered a fair price , seller demanded double . The crowd looked on , and a good deal of abuse of the female relations on both sides took place . At last a sepoy of the governor came up , armed to the teeth , and called out to the man , in a very imperious tone , to let go his hold of the cane . He refused , saying that ' when people came to the fair to sell , they should be made to sell at reasonable prices , or be turned out ' . ' I ' , said Jangbar Khan , ' thought the man right , and told the sepoy that , if he took the part of this woman , we should take that of the other , and see fair play . Without further ceremony the functionary drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle ; and , pointing to both pieces , ' There ' , said he , ' you see the cause of my interference ' . We looked down , and actually saw blood running from both pieces , and forming a little pool on the ground . The fact was that the woman was a sorceress of the very worst kind , and was actually drawing the blood from the man through the cane , to feed the abominable devil from whom she derived her detestable powers . But for the timely interference of the sepoy he would have been dead in another minute ; for he no sooner saw the real state of the case than he fainted . He had hardly any blood left in him , and I was afterwards told that he was not able to walk for ten days . We all went to the governor to demand justice , declaring that , unless the women were made an example of at once , the fair would be deserted , for no stranger 's life would be safe . He consented , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river ; but they had conjured the water and would not sink . They ought to have been put to death , but the governor was himself afraid of this kind of people , and let them off . There is not ' , continued Jangbar , ' a village , or a single family , without its witch in that part of the country ; indeed , no man will give his daughter in marriage to a family without one , saying , " If my daughter has children , what will become of them without a witch to protect them from the witches of other families in the neighbourhood ? " It is a fearful country , though the cheapest and most fertile in India . ' We can easily understand how a man , impressed with the idea that his blood had all been drawn from him by a sorceress , should become faint , and remain many days in a languid state ; but how the people around should believe that they saw the blood flowing from both parts of the cane at the place cut through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am satisfied that old Jangbar believed the whole story to be true , and that at the time he thought the juice of the cane red ; but the little pool of blood grew , no doubt , by degrees , as years rolled on and he related this tale of the fearful powers of the Khilauti witches .

CHAPTER 12 The Silver Tree , or ' Kalpa Briksha '  --  The Singhara or Trapa bispinosa , and the Guinea-Worm . Poor old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent , and his two nice boys , without exactly knowing why , began to do the same ; and my little son Henry1 caught the infection , and wept louder than any of them . I was obliged to hurry over the interview lest I should feel disposed to do the same . The poor old Rani , 2 too , suffered a good deal in parting from my wife , whom , she says , she can never hope to see again . Her fine large eyes shed many a tear as she was getting into her palankeen to return . Between Jabera and Hardua , the next stage , we find a great many of those large forest trees called ' kalap ' , or ' Kalpa Briksha ' ( the same which in the paradise of Indra grants what is desired ) , with a soft , silvery bark , and scarcely any leaves . We are told that the name of the god Ram ( Rama ) and his consort Sita will be found written by the hand of God upon all. 3 I had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides of the road , and found the name of this incarnation of Vishnu written on everyone in Sanskrit characters , apparently by some supernatural hand ; that is , there was a softness in the impression , as if the finger of some supernatural being had traced the characters . Nathu , one of our belted attendants4 told me that we might search as deeply as we would in the forest , but we should certainly find the name of God upon every one ; ' for ' , said he , ' it is God himself who writes it ' . I tried to argue him out of this notion ; but , unfortunately , could find no tree without these characters  --  some high up , and some lower down in the trunk  --  some large and others small  --  but still to be found on every tree . I was almost in despair when we came to a part of the wood where we found one of these trees down in a hollow , under the road , and another upon the precipice above . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no traveller would take the trouble to go up to the tree above , or down to the tree below , merely to write the name of the god upon them ; and at once pledged myself to Nathu that he should find neither the god 's name nor that of his wife . I sent one man up , and another man down , and they found no letters on the trees ; but this did not alter their opinion on the point . ' God ' , said one , ' had no doubt put his name on these trees , but they had somehow or other got rubbed off . He would in good time renew them , that men 's eyes might be blessed with the sight of His holy name , even in the deepest forest , and on the most leafless tree . ' 5 ' But ' , said Nathu , ' he might not have thought it worth while to write his name upon those trees which no travellers go to see . ' ' Can not you see ' , said I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are they not all to be found on the trunk within reach of a man 's hand ? ' ' Of course they are ' , replied he , ' because people would not be able conveniently to distinguish them if God were to write them higher up . ' Shaikh Sadi has a very pretty couplet , ' Every leaf of the foliage of a green tree is , in the eye of a wise man , a library to teach him the wisdom of his Creator . ' 6 I may remark that , where an Englishman would write his own name , a Hindoo would write that of his god , his parent , or his benefactor . This difference is traceable , of course , to the difference in their governments and institutions . If a Hindoo built a town , he called it after his local governor ; if a local governor built it , he called it after the favourite son of the Emperor . In well regulated Hindoo families , one can not ask a younger brother after his children in presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family ; it would be disrespectful for him even to speak of his children as his own in such presence  --  the elder brother relieves his embarrassment by answering for him . On the 27th7 we reached Damoh , 8 where our friends , the Browns , were to leave us on their return to Jubbulpore . Damoh is a pretty place . The town contains some five or six thousand people , and has some very handsome Hindoo temples . On a hill immediately above it is the shrine of a Muhammadan saint , which has a very picturesque appearance . There are no manufactures at Damoh , except such as supply the wants of the immediate neighbourhood ; and the town is supported by the residence of a few merchants , a few landholders , and agricultural capitalists , and the establishment of a native collector . The people here suffer much from the guinea-worm , and consider it to arise from drinking the water of the old tank , which is now very dirty and full of weeds . I have no doubt that it is occasioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by wading in it : for I have known European gentlemen get the worm in their legs from wading in similar lakes or swamps after snipes , and the servants who followed them with their ammunition experience the same effect. 9 Here , as in most other parts of India , the tanks get spoiled by the water-chestnut , ' singhara ' ( Trapa bispinosa ) , which is everywhere as regularly planted and cultivated in fields under a large surface of water , as wheat or barley is on the dry plains . It is cultivated by a class of men called Dhimars , who are everywhere fishermen and palankeen bearers ; and they keep boats for the planting , weeding , and gathering the ' singhara ' . 10 The holdings or tenements of each cultivator are marked out carefully on the surface of the water by long bamboos stuck up in it ; and they pay so much the acre for the portion they till . The long straws of the plants reach up to the surface of the waters , upon which float their green leaves ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter part of the afternoon . The nut grows under the water after the flowers decay , and is of a triangular shape , and covered with a tough brown integument adhering strongly to the kernel , which is white , esculent , and of a fine cartilaginous texture . The people are very fond of these nuts , and they are carried often upon bullocks ' backs two or three hundred miles to market . They ripen in the latter end of the rains , or in September , and are eatable till the end of November . The rent paid for an ordinary tank by the cultivator is about one hundred rupees a year . I have known two hundred rupees to be paid for a very large one , and even three hundred , or thirty pounds a year. 11 But the mud increases so rapidly from this cultivation that it soon destroys all reservoirs in which it is permitted ; and , where it is thought desirable to keep up the tank for the sake of the water , it should be carefully prohibited . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the renewal of the lease , that no ' singhara ' shall be planted in the tank ; otherwise , he will never forgo the advantage to himself of the rent for the sake of the convenience , and that only prospective , of the village community in general .

Lieutenant Brown had come on to Damoh chiefly with a view to investigate a case of murder , which had taken place at the village of Sujaina , about ten miles from Damoh , on the road to Hatta. 1 A gang of two hundred Thugs were encamped in the grove at Hindoria in the cold season of 1814 , when , early in the morning , seven men well armed with swords and matchlocks passed them , bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their correspondents at Banda , 2 to the value of four thousand five hundred rupees. 3 The value of their burden was immediately perceived by these keen-eyed sportsmen , and Kosari , Drigpal , and Faringia , three of the leaders , with forty of their fleetest and stoutest followers , were immediately selected for the pursuit . They followed seven miles unperceived ; and , coming up with the treasure-bearers in a watercourse half a mile from the village of Sujaina , they rushed in upon them and put them all to death with their swords. 4 While they were doing so a tanner from Sujaina approached with his buffalo , and to prevent him giving the alarm they put him to death also , and made off with the treasure , leaving the bodies unburied . A heavy shower of rain fell , and none of the village people came to the place till the next morning early ; when some females , passing it on their way to Hatta , saw the bodies , and returning to Sujaina , reported the circumstance to their friends . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tanner was burned by his relations with the usual ceremonies , while all the rest were left to be eaten by jackals , dogs and vultures , who make short work of such things in India. 5 We had occasion to examine a very respectable old gentleman at Damoh upon the case , Gobind Das , a revenue officer under the former Government , 6 and now about seventy years of age . He told us that he had no knowledge whatever of the murder of the eight men at Sujaina ; but he well remembered another which took place seven years before the time we mentioned at Abhana , a stage or two back , on the road to Jubbulpore . Seventeen treasure-bearers lodged in the grove near that town on their way from Jubbulpore to Sagar . At night they were set upon by a large gang of Thugs , and sixteen of them strangled ; but the seventeenth laid hold of the noose before it could be brought to bear upon his throat , pulled down the villain who held it , and made his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went to the spot with all the followers he could collect ; but he found there nothing but the sixteen naked bodies lying in the grove , with their eyes apparently starting out of their sockets . The Thugs had all gone off with the treasure and their clothes , and the Raja searched for them in vain . A native commissioned officer of a regiment of native infantry one day told me that , while he was on duty over some Thugs at Lucknow , one of them related with great seeming pleasure the following case , which seemed to him one of the most remarkable that he had heard them speak of during the time they were under his charge . ' A stout Mogul7 officer of noble bearing and singularly handsome countenance , on his way from the Punjab to Oudh , crossed the Ganges at Garhmuktesar Ghat , near Meerut , to pass through Muradabad and Bareilly. 8 He was mounted on a fine Turki horse , and attended by his " khidmatgar " ( butler ) and groom . Soon after crossing the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest-looking men going the same road . They accosted him in a respectful manner , and attempted to enter into conversation with him . He had heard of Thugs , and told them to be off . They smiled at his idle suspicions , and tried to remove them , but in vain . The Mogul was determined ; they saw his nostrils swelling with indignation , took their leave , and followed slowly . The next morning he overtook the same number of men , but of a different appearance , all Musalmans . They accosted him in the same respectful manner ; talked of the danger of the road , and the necessity of their keeping together , and taking advantage of the protection of any mounted gentleman that happened to be going the same way . The Mogul officer said not a word in reply , resolved to have no companions on the road . They persisted  --  his nostrils began again to swell , and putting his hand to his sword , he bid them all be off , or he would have their heads from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrows over his shoulders , 9 a brace of loaded pistols in his waist-belt , and a sword by his side , and was altogether a very formidable-looking cavalier . In the evening another party that lodged in the same " sarai " 10 became very intimate with the butler and groom . They were going the same road ; and , as the Mogul overtook them in the morning , they made their bows respectfully , and began to enter into conversation with their two friends , the groom and butler , who were coming up behind . The Mogul 's nostrils began again to swell , and he bid the strangers be off . The groom and butler interceded , for their master was a grave , sedate man , and they wanted companions . All would not do , and the strangers fell in the rear . The next day , when they had got to the middle of an extensive and uninhabited plain , the Mogul in advance , and his two servants a few hundred yards behind , he came up to a party of six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead companion . They were soldiers from Lahore , 11 on their way to Lucknow , worn down by fatigue in their anxiety to see their wives and children once more , after a long and painful service . Their companion , the hope and prop of his family , had sunk under the fatigue , and they had made a grave for him ; but they were poor unlettered men , and unable to repeat the funeral service from the holy Koran-would his Highness but perform this last office for them , he would , no doubt , find his reward in this world and the next . The Mogul dismounted  --  the body had been placed in its proper position , with its head towards Mecca . A carpet was spread  --  the Mogul took off his bow and quiver , then his pistols and sword , and placed them on the ground near the body  --  called for water , and washed his feet , hands , and face , that he might not pronounce the holy words in an unclean state . He then knelt down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , loud voice . Two of the poor soldiers knelt by him , one on each side in silence . The other four went off a few paces to beg that the butler and groom would not come so near as to interrupt the good Samaritan at his devotions . ' All being ready , one of the four , in a low undertone , gave the " jhirni " ( signal ) , 12 the handkerchiefs were thrown over their necks , and in a few minutes all three  --  the Mogul and his servants  - -  were dead , and lying in the grave in the usual manner , the head of one at the feet of the one below him . All the parties they had met on the road belonged to a gang of Jamaldehi Thugs , of the kingdom of Oudh. 13 In despair of being able to win the Mogul 's confidence in the usual way , and determined to have the money and jewels , which they knew he carried with him , they had adopted this plan of disarming him ; dug the grave by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and made a handsome young Musalman of the party the dead soldier . The Mogul , being a very stout man , died almost without a struggle , as is usually the case with such ; and his two servants made no resistance . ' People of great sensibility , with hearts overcharged with sorrow , often appear cold and callous to those who seem to them to feel no interest in their afflictions . An instance of this kind I will here mention ; it is one of thousands that I have met with in my Indian rambles . It was mentioned to me one day that an old ' fakir ' , 14 who lived in a small hut close by a little shrine on the side of the road near the town of Moradabad , had lately lost his son , poisoned by a party of ' daturias ' , or professional poisoners , 15 that now infest every road throughout India . I sent for him , and requested him to tell me his story , as I might perhaps be able to trace the murderers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down while I listened with all the coldness of a magistrate who wanted merely to learn facts and have nothing whatever to do with feelings . This is his story literally : ' I reside in my hut by the side of the road a mile and a half from the town , and live upon the bounty of travellers , and the people of the surrounding villages . About six weeks ago , I was sitting by the side of my shrine after saying prayers , with my only son , about ten years of age , when a man came up with his wife , his son , and his daughter , the one a little older , and the other a little younger than my boy . They baked and ate their bread near my shrine , and gave me flour enough to make two cakes . This I prepared and baked . My boy was hungry , and ate one cake and a half . I ate only half a one , for I was not hungry . I had a few days before purchased a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a branch of the tree that shaded the shrine , when these people came . My son and I soon became stupefied . I saw him fall asleep , and I soon followed . I awoke again in the evening , and found myself in a pool of water . I had sense enough to crawl towards my boy . I found him still breathing , and I sat by him with his head in my lap , where he soon died . It was now evening , and I got up , and wandered about all night picking straws  --  I know not why . I was not yet quite sensible . During the night the wolves ate my poor boy . I heard this from travellers , and went and gathered up his bones and buried them in the shrine . I did not quite recover till the third day , when I found that some washerwomen had put me into the pool , and left me there with my head out , in hopes that this would revive me ; but they had no hope of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town ; but the landholders had begged me to say nothing about the poisoners , lest it might get them and their village community into trouble . The man was tall and fair , and about thirty-five ; the woman short , stout , and fair , and about thirty ; two of her teeth projected a good deal ; the boy 's eyelids were much diseased . ' All this he told me without the slightest appearance of emotion , for he had not seen any appearance of it in me , or my Persian writer ; and a casual European observer would perhaps have exclaimed , ' What brutes these natives are ! This fellow feels no more for the loss of his only son than he would for that of a goat ' . But I knew the feeling was there . The Persian writer put up his paper , and closed his inkstand , and the following dialogue , word for word , took place between me and the old man : Question .  --  What made you conceal the real cause of your boy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed , as well as eaten , by wolves ? Answer .  --  The landholders told me that they could never bring back my boy to life , and the whole village would be worried to death by them if I made any mention of the poison . Question .  --  And if they were to be punished for this they would annoy you ? Answer .  --  Certainly . But I believed they advised me for my own good as well as their own . Question .  --  And if they should turn you away from that place , could you not make another ? Answer. - Are not the bones of my poor boy there , and the trees that he and I planted and watched together for ten years ? Question. - Have you no other relations ? What became of your boy 's mother ? Answer. - She died at that place when my boy was only three months old . I have brought him up myself from that age ; he was my only child , and he has been poisoned for the sake of the blanket ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would break ; and I was obliged to make him sit down on the floor while I walked up and down the room . ) Question .  --  Had you any children before ? Answer .  --  Yes , sir , we had several , but they all died before their mother . We had been reduced to beggary by misfortunes , and I had become too weak and ill to work . I buried my poor wife 's bones by the side of the road where she died ; raised the little shrine over them , planted the trees , and there have I sat ever since by her side , with our poor boy in my bosom . It is a sad place for wolves , and we used often to hear them howling outside ; but my poor boy was never afraid of them when he knew I was near him . God preserved him to me , till the sight of the new blanket , for I had nothing else in the world , made these people poison us . I bought it for him only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out of my savings-it was all I had . ( The poor old man sobbed again , and sat down while I paced the room , lest I should sob also ; my heart was becoming a little too large for its apartment . ) ' I will never ' , continued he , ' quit the bones of my wife and child , and the tree that he and I watered for so many years . I have not many years to live ; there I will spend them , whatever the landholders may do  --  they advised me for my own good , and will never turn me out . ' I found all the poor man stated to be true ; the man and his wife had mixed poison with the flour to destroy the poor old man and his son for the sake of the new blanket which they saw hanging in the branch of the tree , and carried away with them . The poison used on such occasions is commonly the datura , and it is sometimes given in the hookah to be smoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to poison children as well as grown-up people , or women who do not smoke , they mix up the poison in food . The intention is almost always to destroy life , as ' dead men tell no tales ' ; but the poisoned people sometimes recover , as in the present case , and lead to the detection of the poisoners . The cases in which they recover are , however , rare , and of those who recover few are ever able to trace the poisoners ; and , of those who recover and trace them , very few will ever undertake to prosecute them through the several courts of the magistrate , the sessions , and that of last instance in a distant district , to which the proceedings must be sent for final orders . The impunity with which this crime is everywhere perpetrated , and its consequent increase in every part of India , are among the greatest evils with which the country is at this time affected . These poisoners are spread all over India , and are as numerous over the Bombay and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no road free from them , and throughout India there must be many hundreds who gain their subsistence by this trade alone . They put on all manner of disguises to suit their purpose ; and , as they prey chiefly upon the poorer sort of travellers , they require to destroy the greater number of lives to make up their incomes . A party of two or three poisoners have very often succeeded in destroying another of eight or ten travellers with whom they have journeyed for some days , by pretending to give them a feast on the celebration of the anniversary of some family event . Sometimes an old woman or man will manage the thing alone , by gaining the confidence of travellers , and getting near the cooking-pots while they go aside ; or when employed to bring the flour for the meal from the bazaar . The poison is put into the flour or the pot , as opportunity offers . People of all castes and callings take to this trade , some casually , others for life , and others derive it from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suit their purposes ; and the habits of cooking , eating , and sleeping on the side of the road , and smoking with strangers of seemingly the same caste , greatly facilitate their designs upon travellers . The small parties are unconnected with each other , and two parties never unite in the same cruise . The members of one party may be sometimes convicted and punished , but their conviction is accidental , for the system which has enabled us to put down the Thug associations can not be applied , with any fair prospect of success , to the suppression of these pests to society. 16 The Thugs went on their adventures in large gangs , and two or more were commonly united in the course of an expedition in the perpetration of many murders . Every man shared in the booty according to the rank he held in the gang , or the part he took in the murders ; and the rank of every man and the part he took generally , or in any particular murder , were generally well known to all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidence we required for their conviction  --  or the means of tracing it  --  among the families and friends of their victims , or with persons to whom the property taken had been disposed of , and in the graves to which the victims had been consigned . To give an idea of the system by which the Government of India has been enabled to effect so great a good for the people as the suppression of these associations , I will suppose that two sporting gentlemen , A at Delhi , and B in Calcutta , had both described the killing of a tiger in an island in the Ganges , near Hardwar17 and mentioned the names of the persons engaged with them . Among the persons thus named were C , who had since returned to America , D , who had retired to New South Wales , E to England , and F to Scotland . There were four other persons named who were still in India , but they are deeply interested in A and B 's story not being believed . A says that B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he gave it to C , who cut out two of the claws . Application is made to C , D , E , and F , and without the possibility of any collusion , or even communication between them , their statements correspond precisely with those of A and B , as to the time , place , circumstances , and persons engaged . Their statements are sworn to before magistrates in presence of witnesses , and duly attested . C states that he got the skin from B , and gave it to the Nawab of Rampur18 for a hookah carpet , but that he took from the left forefoot two of the claws , and gave them to the minister of the King of Oudh for a charm for his sick child . The Nawab of Rampur , being applied to , states that he received the skin from C , at the time and place mentioned , and that he still smokes his hookah upon it ; and that it had lost the two claws upon the left forefoot . The minister of the King of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gold ; that they had cured his boy , who still wore them round his neck to guard him from the evil eye . The goldsmith states that he set the two claws in gold for C , who paid him handsomely for his work . The peasantry , whose cattle graze on the island , declare that certain gentlemen did kill a tiger there about the time mentioned , and that they saw the body after the skin had been taken off , and the vultures had begun to descend upon it . To prove that what A and B had stated could not possibly be true , the other party appeal to some of their townsmen , who are said to be well acquainted with their characters . They state that they really know nothing about the matter in dispute ; that their friends , who are opposed to A and B , are much liked by their townspeople and neighbours , as they have plenty of money , which they spend freely , but that they are certainly very much addicted to field-sports , and generally absent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every year ; but whether they were or were not present at the killing of the great Garhmuktesar tiger , they could not say . Most persons would , after examining this evidence , be tolerably well satisfied that the said tiger had really been killed at the time and place , and by the persons mentioned by A and B ; but , to establish the fact judicially , it would be necessary to bring A , B , C , D , E , and F , the Nawab of Rampur , the minister of the King of Oudh , and the goldsmith to the criminal court at Meerut , to be confronted with the person whose interest it was that A and B should not be believed . They would all , perhaps , come to the said court from the different quarters of the world in which they had thought themselves snugly settled ; but the thing would annoy them so much , and be so much talked of , that sporting gentlemen , nawabs , ministers , and goldsmiths would in future take good care to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispute , should another similar reference be made to them , and so A and B would never again have any chance . Thug approvers , whose evidence we required , were employed in all parts of India , under the officers appointed to put down these associations ; and it was difficult to bring all whose evidence was necessary at the trials to the court of the district in which the particular murder was perpetrated . The victims were , for the most part , money-carriers , whose masters and families resided hundreds of miles from the place where they were murdered , or people on their way to their distant homes from foreign service . There was no chance of recovering any of the property taken from the victims , as Thugs were known to spend what they got freely , and never to have money by them ; and the friends of the victims , and the bankers whose money they carried , were everywhere found exceedingly averse to take share in the prosecution . To obviate all these difficulties separate courts were formed , with permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attaching to each portion , whether documentary or oral , whatever weight it might seem to deserve . Such courts were formed at Hyderabad , Mysore , Indore , Lucknow , Gwalior , and were presided over by our highest diplomatic functionaries , in concurrence with the princes at whose courts they were accredited ; and who at Jubbulpore , were under the direction of the representative of the Governor-General of India. l9 By this means we had a most valuable species of unpaid agency ; and I believe there is no part of their public life on which these high functionaries look back with more pride than that spent in presiding over such courts , and assisting the supreme Government in relieving the people of India from this fearful evil. 20 Notes : 1 . A town on the Allahabad and Sagar road , sixty-one miles north-east of Sagar . It was the head-quarters of the Damoh district from 1818 to 1835. 2 . The chief town of the district of the same name in Bundelkhand , situated on the Ken river , ninety-five miles south-west from Allahabad. 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more . 4 . An unusual mode of procedure for professed Thugs to adopt , who usually strangled their victims with a cloth . Faringia ( Feringheea ) Brahman was one of the most noted Thug leaders . He is frequently mentioned in the author 's Report on the Depredations committed by the Thug Gangs ( 1840 ) , and the story of the Sujaina crime is fully told in the Introduction to that volume . Faringia became a valuable approver. 5 . Lieutenant Brown was suddenly called back to Jubbulpore , and could not himself go to Sujaina . He sent , however , an intelligent native officer to the place , but no man could be induced to acknowledge that he had ever seen the bodies or heard of the affair , though Faringia pointed out to them exactly where they all lay . They said it must be quite a mistake  --  that such a thing could not have taken place and they know nothing of it . Lieutenant Brown was aware that all this affected ignorance arose entirely from the dread these people have of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts of justice ; and wrote to the officer in the civil charge of the district to request that he would assure them that their presence would not be required . Mr. Doolan , the assistant magistrate , happened to be going through Sujaina from Sagar on deputation at the time ; and , sending for all the respectable old men of the place , he requested that they would be under no apprehension , but tell him the real truth , as he would pledge himself that not one of them should ever be summoned to any district court to give evidence . They then took him to the spot and pointed out to him where the bodies had been found , and mentioned that the body of the tanner had been burned by his friends . The banker , whose treasure they had been carrying , had an equal dislike to be summoned to court to give evidence , now that he could no longer hope to recover any portion of his lost money ; and it was not till after Lieutenant Brown had given him a similar assurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The loss of the four thousand five hundred rupees was then found entered , with the names of the men who had been killed at Sujaina in carrying it . These are specimens of some of the minor difficulties we had to contend with in our efforts to put down the most dreadful of all crimes . All the prisoners accused of these murders had just been tried for others , or Lieutenant Brown would not have been able to give the pledge he did . W. H. S. Difficulties of the same kind beset the administration of criminal justice in India to this day . 6 . Of the Marathas . The district was ceded in 1818. 7 . More correctly written Mughal . The term is properly applied to Muhammadans of Turk ( Mongol ) descent . Such persons commonly affix the title Beg to their names , and often prefix the Persian title Mirza . 8 . Meerut , the well-known cantonment , in the district of the same name . The name is written Meeruth by the author , and may be also written Mirath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Muradabad and Bareilly ( Bareli ) are in Rohilkhand . The latter has a considerable garrison . Both places are large cities , and the head-quarter of districts . 9 . The bow and quiver are now rarely seen , except , possibly , in remote parts of Rajputana . A body of archers helped to hold the Shah Najaf building at Lucknow against Sir Colin Campbell in 1858 . Even in 1903-4 some of the Tibetans who resisted the British advance were armed with bows and arrows . 10 . An inn of the Oriental pattern , often called caravanserai in books of travel . 11 . Then the capital of Ranjit Singh , the great Sikh chief . 12 . ' This is commonly given either by the leader of the gang or the belha , who has chosen the place for the murder . ' It was usually some commonplace order , such as ' Bring the tobacco ' ( Ramaseeana , p.99 , &c.).; See also Meadows Taylor , Confessions of a Thug . 13 . The Jamaldehi Thugs resided ' in Oude and some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever and expert , and more stanch to their oath of secrecy than most other classes ' ( ibid. p. 97 ) . At the time referred to Oudh was a separate kingdom , which lasted as such until 1856 . A map included in the printed Thuggee papers reveals the appalling fact that the Thugs had 274 fixed burying-places for their victims in the area of the small kingdom , about half the size of Ireland . 14 . Fakir ( fakeer ) , a religious mendicant . The word properly applies to Muhammadans only , but is often laxly used to include Hindoo ascetics. 15 . So called because the poison they use is made of the seeds of the ' datura ' plant ( Datura alba ) , and other species of the same genus . It is a powerful narcotic . 16 . The crime of poisoning travellers is still prevalent , and its detection is still attended by the difficulties described in the text . In some cases the criminals have been proved to belong to families of Thug stranglers . The poisoning of cattle by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very prevalent forty years ago , especially in the districts near Benares , but is now believed to be less practised . It was checked under the ordinary law by numerous convictions and severe sentences . 17 . In the Saharanpur district , where the Ganges issues from the hills . 18 .

Some idea of them may be gathered from the collection of papers entitled Ramaseeana , the contents of which are enumerated in the Bibliography , ante . No. 2 . Colonel Meadows Taylor has given a more popular account of the measures taken for the suppression of Thuggee ( thagi ) in his Confessions of a Thug , written in 1837 ( 1st ed. 1839 ) . The Thug organization dated from ancient times , but attracted little notice from the East India Company 's Government until the author , then Captain Sleeman , submitted his reports on the subject while employed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1820 . He proved that the Thug crimes were committed by a numerous and highly organized fraternity operating in all parts of India . In consequence of his reports , Mr. F. C. Smith , Agent to the Governor-General in the Sagar and Nerbudda Territories , was invested , in the year 1829 , with special powers , and the author , then Major Sleeman , was employed , in addition to his district duties , as Mr , Smith 's coadjutor and assistant . In 1835 the author was relieved from district work , and appointed General Superintendent of the operations for the suppression of the Thug gangs . He went on leave to the hills in 1836 , and on resuming duty in February , 1839 , was appointed Commissioner for the suppression of Thuggee and Dacoity , which office he continued to hold in addition to his other appointments . Between 1826 and 1835 , 1,562 prisoners were tried for the crime of Thuggee , of whom 1,404 were either hanged or transported for life . Some individuals are said to have confessed to over 200 murders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose lives were spared , were detained in a special prison at Jubbulpore , where the remnant of them , with their families , were kept under surveillance . They were employed in a tent and carpet factory , known as the School of Industry , founded in 1838 by the author and Captain Charles Brown . If released , they would certainly have resumed their hereditary occupation , which exercised an awful fascination over its votaries . Most of the Thug gangs had been broken up by 1860 , but cases of Thuggee have occurred occasionally since that date . A gang of Kahars ( palanquin bearers ) committed a series of Thug murders in , I think , 1877 , at Etawa , in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh . The office of Superintendent of Thuggee and Dacoity was kept up until 1904 , but the officer in charge was more concerned with Dacoity ( that is to say , organized gang-robbery with violence ) in the Native States than with the secret crime of Thuggee . Secret crime is now watched by the Central Criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India , and has to deal with novel forms of evil-doing . In India it is never safe to assume that any ancient practice has been suppressed , and I have little doubt that , if administrative pressure were relaxed , the old form of Thuggee would again be heard of . The occasional discovery of murdered beggars , who could not have been killed for the sake of their property , leads me to suppose that the Megpunnia variety of Thuggee , that is to say , murder of poor persons in order to kidnap and sell their children , is still sometimes practised . Among the officers named by the author the best known is Sir Mark Cubbon , who came to India in 1800 , and died at Suez in 1861 . During the interval he had never quitted India . He ruled over Mysore for nearly thirty years with almost despotic power , and reorganized the administration of that country with conspicuous success ( Buckland , Dict. of Indian Biography , Sonnenschein , 1906 ) . The Hon. Frederick John Shore , of the Bengal Civil Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sagar and Nerbudda Territories . In 1837 he published his Notes on Indian Affairs ( London , 2 vols. 8vo ) , a series of articles dealing in the most outspoken way with the abuses and weaknesses of Anglo-Indian administration at that time . Mr. F. C. Smith was Agent to the Governor-General at Jubbulpore in 1830 and subsequent years . The author was then immediately subordinate to him . Messrs . Martin and Wellesley were Residents at Holkar 's court at Indore . Mr. Stockwell tried some of the Thug prisoners at Cawnpore and Allahabad as Special Commissioner , in addition to his ordinary duties : correspondence between him and the author is printed in Ramaseeana . Mr. Charles Fraser preceded the author in charge of the Sagar district , and in January , 1832 , resumed charge of the revenue and civil duties of that district , leaving the criminal work to the author . The Hon. Mr. Cavendish was Resident at Sindhia 's court at Gwalior . Mr. George Clerk became Sir George Clerk and Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces , Governor of Bombay , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great age in 1889 . Mr. Lancelot Wilkinson , Political Agent in Bhopal , was considered by the author to be ' one of the most able and estimable members of the India Civil Service ' ( Journey , ii . 403 ) . Mr. Bax was Resident at Indore ; Colonel ( afterwards Sir John ) Low , was Resident at Lucknow , and had served at Jubbulpore ; Colonel Stewart and Major-General Fraser were Residents at Hyderabad ; Major ( Colonel ) Alves was Political Agent in Bhopal and Agent in Rajputana ; Colonel Spiers was Agent at Nimach , and officiated as Agent in Rajputana ; Colonel Caulfield had been Political Agent at Harauti ; Colonel Sutherland was Resident at Gwalior , and afterwards Agent in Rajputana ; Colonel ( Sir C.

Besides the officers above named , others are specified in Ramaseeana as having done good service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , correctly , that the words Megpunnia and Megpunnaism ( ante , note 20 , and Bibliography No. 7 ) are corruptions of the Hindi Mekh-phandiya , from mekh , ' a peg ' , and phanda , ' a noose ' , equivalent to the Persian tasmabaz , meaning ' playing tricks with a strap ' . Creagh , a private in a British regiment at Cawnpore about 1803 , is said to have initiated three men into the peg and strap trick , as practised by English rogues . These men became the leaders of three Tasmabaz Thug gangs , whose proceedings are described by Mr. R. Montgomery in Selections of the Records of Government , N.W.P. , vol. i , p. 312 . A strap is doubled and folded up in different shapes . The art consists in putting in a stick or peg in such a way that the strap when unfolded shall come out double . The Tasmabaz Thugs seem to be identical with the ' Megpunnia ' ( N.I.N . &; Qu. , vol. i , p. 108 , note 721 , September 1891 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Megpunnia Thugs in Rajputana ( Some Records of Crime ( 1867 ) , vol. i , pp. 126-31 ) . CHAPTER 14 Basaltic Cappings of the Sandstone Hills of Central India  --  Suspension Bridge  --  Prospects of the Nerbudda Valley  --  Deification of a Mortal . On the 29th1 we came on to Patharia , a considerable little town thirty miles from Sagar , supported almost entirely by a few farmers , small agricultural capitalists , and the establishment of a native collector , 2 On leaving Patharia , we ascend gradually along the side of the basaltic hills on our left to the south for three miles to a point whence we see before us this plane of basaltic cappings extending as far as the eye can reach to the west , south , and north , with frequent breaks , but still preserving one uniform level . On the top of these tables are here and there little conical elevations of laterite , or indurated iron clay. 3 The cappings everywhere repose immediately upon the sandstone of the Vindhya range ; but they have occasional beds of limestone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strongly impregnated with carbonic acid gas . For the most part this is mere travertine , but in some places they get good lime from the beds for building . On the 1st of December we came to the pretty village of Sanoda , near the suspension bridge built over the river Bias by Colonel Presgrave , while he was assay master of the Sagar mint. 4 I was present at laying the foundation stone of this bridge in December 1827 . Mr. Maddock was the Governor-General 's representative in these territories , and the work was undertaken more with a view to show what could be done out of their own resources , under minds capable of developing them , than to supply any pressing or urgent want . The work was completed in June , 1830 ; and I have several times seen upon the bridge as many as it could hold of a regiment of infantry while it moved over ; and , at other times , as many of a corps of cavalry , and often several elephants at once . The bridge is between the points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the platform measures one hundred and ninety feet by eleven and a half . The whole cost of the work amounted to about fifty thousand rupees ; and , under a less able and careful person than Colonel Presgrave , would have cost , perhaps , double the amount . This work has been declared by a very competent judge to be equal to any structure of the same kind in Europe , and is eminently calculated to show what genius and perseverance can produce out of the resources of a country even in the rudest state of industry and the arts . The river Nerbudda neither is nor ever can , I fear , be made navigable , and the produce of its valley would require to find its way to distant markets over the Vindhya range of hills to the north , or the Satpura to the south . If the produce of the soil , mines , and industry of the valley can not be transported to distant markets , the Government can not possibly find in it any available net surplus revenue in money ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the precious metals can flow in only in exchange for the produce of the land , and the industry of the valley that flows out . If the Government wishes to draw a net surplus revenue from the valley or from the districts that border upon it , that is , a revenue beyond its expenditure in support of the local public establishments , it must either draw it in produce , or for what can be got for that produce in distant markets. 5 Hitherto little beyond the rude produce of the soil has been able to find its way into distant markets from the valley of the Nerbudda ; yet this valley abounds in iron mines , 6 and its soil , where unexhausted by cropping , is of the richest quality. 7 It is not then too much to hope that in time the iron of the mines will be worked with machinery for manufactures ; and that multitudes , aided by this machinery , and subsisted on the rude agricultural produce , which now flows out , will invest the value of their labour in manufactured commodities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their superior value , compared with their bulk , to pay the cost of transport by land . Then , and not till then , can we expect to see these territories pay a considerable net surplus revenue to Government , and abound in a middle class of merchants , manufacturers , and agricultural capitalists. 8 At Sanoda there is a very beautiful little fortress or castle now unoccupied , though still entire . It was built by an officer of the Raja Chhatar Sal of Bundelkhand , about one hundred and twenty years ago. 9 He had a grant , on the tenure of military service , of twelve villages situated round this place ; and a man who could build such a castle to defend the surrounding country from the inroads of freebooters , and to secure himself and his troops from any sudden impulse of the people 's resentment , was as likely to acquire an increase of territorial possession in these parts as he would have been in Europe during the Middle Ages . The son of this chief , by name Rai Singh , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an attack upon a town near Chitrakot ; 10 and having , in the estimation of the people , become a god , he had a temple and a tomb raised to him close to our encampment . I asked the people how he had become a god ; and was told that some one who had been long suffering from a quartan ague went to the tomb one night , and promised Rai Singh , whose ashes lay under it , that if he could contrive to cure his ague for him , he would , during the rest of his life , make offerings to his shrine . After that he had never another attack , and was very punctual in his offerings . Others followed his example , and with like success , till Rai Singh was recognized among them universally as a god , and a temple raised to his name . This is the way that gods were made all over the world at one time , and are still made all over India . Happy had it been for mankind if those only who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2nd we came on to the village of Khojanpur ( leaving the town and cantonments of Sagar to our left ) , a distance of some fourteen miles . The road for a great part of the way was over the bare back of the sandstone strata , the covering of basalt having been washed off . The hills , however , are , at this distance from the city and cantonments of Sagar , nicely wooded ; and , being constantly intersected by pretty little valleys , the country we came over was picturesque and beautiful . The soil of all these valleys is rich from the detritus of the basalt that forms or caps the hills ; but it is now in a bad state of cultivation , partly from several successive seasons of great calamity , under which the people have been suffering , and partly from over-assessment ; and this posture of affairs is continued by that loss of energy , industry , and character , among the farmers and cultivators , which must everywhere result from these two evils . In India , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the want of settled government , good or bad government really depends almost altogether upon good or bad settlements of the land revenue . Where the Government demand is imposed with moderation , and enforced with justice , there will the people be generally found happy and contented , and disposed to perform their duties to each other and to the state ; except when they have the misfortune to suffer from drought , blight , and other calamities of season. l2 I have mentioned that the basalt in the Sagar district reposes for the most part immediately upon the sandstone of the Vindhya range ; and it must have been deposited on the sand , while the latter was yet at the bottom of the ocean , though this range is now , I believe , nowhere less than from fifteen hundred to two thousand feet above the level of the sea . The marks of the ripple of the sea may be observed in some places where the basalt has been recently washed off , beautifully defined , as if formed only yesterday , and there is no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texture of the sandstone at the surface , where it comes in contact with the basalt , has in some places been altered by it , but in others it seems to have been as little changed as the habitations of the people who were suffocated by the ashes of Vesuvius in the city of Pompeii . I am satisfied , from long and careful examination , that the greater part of this basalt , which covers the tableland of Central and Southern India , must have been held for some time in suspension in the ocean or lake into which it was first thrown in the shape of ashes , and then gradually deposited . This alone can account for its frequent appearance of stratification , for the gentle blending of its particles with those of the sand near the surface of the latter ; and , above all , for those level steps , or tables , lying one above another horizontally in parallel bars on one range , corresponding exactly with the same parallel lines one above another on a range twenty or thirty miles across the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these are all mere flowing coulees of lava , which , in their liquid state , filled hollows , but afterwards became of a harder texture , as they dried and crystallized , than the higher rocks around them ; the consequence of which is that the latter has been decomposed and washed away , while the basalt has been left to form the highest elevations . My opinion is that these steps , or stairs , at one time formed the beds of the ocean , or of great lakes , and that the substance of which they are composed was , for the most part , projected into the water , and there held in suspension till gradually deposited . There are , however , amidst these steps , and beneath them , masses of more compact and crystalline basalt , that bear evident signs of having been flows of lava. l3 Reasoning from analogy at Jubbulpore , where some of the basaltic cappings of the hills had evidently been thrown out of craters long after this surface had been raised above the waters , and become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first discovery of fossil remains in the Nerbudda valley . I went first to a hill within sight of my house in 1828 , 14 and searched exactly between the plateau of basalt that covered it and the stratum immediately below , and there I found several small trees with roots , trunks , and branches , all entire , and beautifully petrified . They had been only recently uncovered by the washing away of a part of the basaltic plateau . I soon after found some fossil bones of animals. 15 Going over to Sagar , in the end of 1830 , and reasoning there upon the same analogy , I searched for fossil remains along the line of contact between the basalt and the surface upon which it had been deposited , and I found a grove of silicified palm-trees within a mile of the cantonments . These palm-trees had grown upon a calcareous deposit formed from springs rising out of the basaltic range of hills to the south . The commissariat officer had cut a road through this grove , and all the European officers of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without observing the geological treasure ; and it was some time before I could convince them that the stones which they had every day seen were really petrified palm-trees . The roots and trunks were beautifully perfect. l6 Notes : 1 . November , 1835. 2 . In the Damoh District , twenty-four miles west of Damoh . The name appears to be derived from the ' great quantity of hewn stone ( Hind . patthar or pathar ) lying about in all directions ' . The C. P. Gazetteer ( 1870 ) calls the place ' a considerable village ' . 3 . A peculiar formation , of ' widespread occurrence in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world ' . It is ordinarily of a reddish ferruginous or brick-dust colour , sometimes deepened into dark red . Apparently the special character which distinguishes laterite from other forms of red-coloured weathering is the presence of hydrous oxide of alumina in varying proportions . . . . ' Though there is still a great deal of uncertainty about the way in which laterite was formed , the facts which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distinct form of weathering , which is confined to low latitudes and humid climates ; its formation seems to have been a slow process , only possible on flat or nearly flat surfaces , where surface rain-wash could not act ' ( Oldham , in The Oxford Survey of the British Empire , vol. ii , Asia , p. 10 : Oxford , 1914 ) . It hardens and darkens by exposure to air , and is occasionally used as a building stone . 4 . The Sagar mint was erected in 1820 by Captain Presgrave , the assay master , and used to employ four hundred men , but , after about ten or twelve years , the business was transferred to Calcutta , and the buildings converted to other uses ( C. P. Gazetteer , 1870 ) . Mints are now kept up at Calcutta and Bombay only . The Bias is a small stream flowing into the Sunar river , and belonging to the Jumna river system . The name is printed Beeose in the original edition . 5 . Since the author 's time the conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The East Indian , Great Indian Peninsular , and other railways now enter the Nerbudda Valley , so that the produce of most districts can be readily transported to distant markets . A large enhancement of the land revenue has been obtained by revisions of the settlement . 6 . Details will be found in the Central Provinces Gazetteer ( 1870 ) . The references are collected under the head ' Iron ' in the index to that work . Chapter VIII of Ball 's Economic Geology of India gives full information concerning the iron mines of the Central Provinces and all parts of India . That work forms Part III of the Manual of the Geology of India . 7 . The soil of the valley of the Nerbudda , and that of the Nerbudda and Sagar territories generally , is formed for the most part of the detritus of trap-rocks that everywhere covered the sandstone of the Vindhya and Satpura ranges which run through these territories . This basaltic detritus forms what is called the black cotton soil by the English , for what reason I know not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely grown in the Nerbudda Valley , both on the black soil and other soils . In Bundelkhand the black , friable soil , often with a high proportion of organic matter , is called ' mar ' , and is chiefly devoted to raising crops of wheat , gram , or chick-pea ( Cicer arietinum ) , linseed , and joar ( Holcus sorghum ) . Cotton is also sown in it , but not very generally . This black soil requires little rain , and is fertile without manure . It absorbs water too freely to be suitable for irrigation , and in most seasons does not need it . The ' black cotton soil ' is often known as regur , a corruption of a Tamil word . ' The origin of regur is a doubtful question . . . . The dark coloration was attributed by earlier writers to vegetable matter , and taken to indicate a large amount of humus in the soil ; more recent investigations make this doubtful , and in all probability the colour is due to mineral constitution rather than to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may possibly be formed of ' wind-borne dust ' , like the loess plains of China ( Oldham , in The Oxford Survey of the British Empire , vol. ii , Asia , p. 9 : Oxford , 1914 ) . 8 . The land revenue has been largely increased , and the resources and communications of the country have been greatly developed during the last half-century . The formation of the Central Provinces as a separate administration in 1861 secured for the Sagar and Nerbudda territories the attention which they failed to obtain from the distant Government of the North-Western Provinces . Sir Richard Temple , the first Chief Commissioner , administered the Central Provinces with extraordinary energy and success . 9 . Raja Chhatarsal Bundela was Raja of Panna . The history of Chhatarsal is related in I.G. ( 1908 ) , vol. xix , p. 400 , s.v . Panna State . In 1729 he called in the Marathas to help him against Muhammad Khan Bangash , and when he died in 1731 rewarded them by bequeathing one-third of his dominions to the Peshwa .

Chitrakot , in the Banda district of Bundelkhand , under the government of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh , and seventy-one miles distant from Allahabad , is a famous place of pilgrimage , much frequented by the votaries of Rama . Large fairs are held there . 11 . The performance of miraculous cures at the tomb is not necessary for the deification of a person who has been specially feared in his lifetime , or has died a violent death . Either of these conditions is enough to render his ghost formidable , and worthy of propitiation . Shrines to such persons are very numerous both in Bundelkhand and other parts of India , Miracles , of course , occur at nearly every shrine , and are too common and well attested to attract much attention . 12 . These observations are as true to-day as they were in the author 's time . Disastrous cases of over-assessment were common in the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been sometimes traceable for generations afterwards . Since 1833 the error , though less common , has not been unknown . 13 . Since writing the above , I have seen Colonel Sykes 's notes on the formations of Southern India in the Indian Review . The facts there described seem all to support my conclusion , and his map would answer just as well for Central as for Southern India ; for the banks of the Nerbudda and Chambal , Son , and Mahanadi , as well as for those of the Bam and the Bima . Colonel Sykes does not , I believe , attempt to account for the stratification of the basalt ; he merely describes it . W. H. S. The author 's theory of the subaqueous origin of the greater part of the basalt of Central and Southern India , otherwise known as the ' Deccan Trap Series ' , had been supported by numerous excellent geologists , but W. T. Blanford proved the theory to be untenable , there being ' clear and unmistakable evidence that the traps were in great part of sub-aerial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fossils is conclusive proof that the lava-flows associated with such beds can not be submarine . The hypothesis that the lower beds of traps were poured out in a vast , but shallow , freshwater lake extending throughout the area over which the inter-trappean limestone formation extends appears to be extremely improbable . The lava seems to have been poured , during a long succession of ages , over a land surface , uneven and broken in parts , ' with intervals of rest sufficient for lakes , stocked with fresh-water mollusca , to form on the cold surfaces of several of the lava-flows ' ( Holland , in I.G. ( 1907 ) , i. 88 ) . A great tract of the volcanic region appears to have remained almost undisturbed to the present day , affected by sub-aerial erosion alone . The geological horizon of the Deccan trap can not be precisely defined , but is now vaguely stated as ' the close of the cretaceous period ' . The ' steps ' , or conspicuous terraces , traceable on the hill-sides for great distances , are explained as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or of those beds which resist best the disintegrating influences of exposure ' . The general horizontality of the Deccan trap over an area of not less than 200,000 square miles , and the absence of volcanic hills of the usual conical form , are difficulties which have caused much discussion . Some of the ' old volcanic vents ' appear to have existed near Poona and Mahableshwar . The entire area has been subjected to sub-aerial denudation on a gigantic scale , which explains the occurrence of the basalt as the caps of isolated hills . Much further investigation is required to clear up details ( Manual of the Geology of India , ed. 1 , Part I , chap . 13 ) 14 . The author took charge of the Jubbulpore District in March 1828. 15 . The fossiliferous beds near Jubbulpore , described in the text , seem to belong to the group now classed as the Lameta beds . The bones of a large dinosaurian reptile ( Titanosaurus indicus ) have been identified ( I.G. , 1907 , vol. i , p. 88 ) . 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fossil Palms and Shells lately discovered on the Table-Land of Sagar in Central India , in J.A.S.B. for 1833 , vol. ii , p. 639 ) and , subsequently to him , Captain Nicholls ( Journal of Asiatic Soc. of Bombay , vol. v , p. 614 ) , studied and described certain trunks of palm-trees , whose silicified remains are found imbedded in the soft intertrappean mud-beds near Sagar . . . . The trees are imbedded in a layer of calcareous black earth , which formed the surface soil in which they grew ; this soil rests on , and was made up of the disintegration of , a layer of basalt . It is covered over by another and similar layer of the same rock near where the trees occur . . . . The palm-trees , now found fossilized , grew in the soil , which , in the condition of a black calcareous earthy bed , we now find lying round their prostrate stems . They fell ( from whatever cause ) , and lay until their silicification was complete . A slight depression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some drainage-course , or any other similar and trivial cause , may have laid them under water . The process of silicification proceeded gradually but steadily , and after they had there , in lapse of ages , become lapidified , the next outburst of volcanic matter overwhelmed them , broke them , partially enveloped , and bruised them , until long subsequent denudation once more brought them to light ' ( J. G. Medlicott , in Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India , vol. ii . Part II , pp. 200 , 203 , 204 , 205 , 216 , as quoted in C. P. Gazetteer ( 1870 ) , p. 435 ) . The intertrappean fossils are all those of organisms which would occur in shallow fresh-water lakes or marshy ground . Besides the author 's friend and relative , Dr. H. H. Spry , Dr. Spilsbury contributed papers on the Nerbudda fossils to vols. iii , vi , viii , ix , x , and xiii of the J.A.S.B.

Dr. Spry was the author of a work entitled Modern India : with Illustrations of the Resources and Capabilities of Hindustan ( 2 vols. 8vo , 1838 ) . He became F.R.S . CHAPTER 15 Legend of the Sagar Lake  --  Paralysis from eating the Grain of the Lathyrus sativus . The cantonments of Sagar are about two miles from the city and occupied by three regiments of native infantry , one of local horse , and a company of European artillery. 1 The city occupies two sides of one of the most beautiful lakes of India , formed by a wall which unites two sandstone hills on the north side . The fort and part of the town stands upon this wall , which , according to tradition , was built by a wealthy merchant of the Banjara caste. 2 After he had finished it , the bed of the lake still remained dry ; and he was told in a dream , or by a priest , that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , then a girl , and the young lad to whom she was affianced , to the tutelary god of the place . He accordingly built a little shrine in the centre of the valley , which was to become the bed of the lake , put the two children in , and built up the doorway . He had no sooner done so than the whole of the valley became filled with water , and the old merchant , the priest , the masons , and spectators , made their escape with much difficulty . From that time the lake has been inexhaustible ; but no living soul of the Banjara caste has ever since been known to drink of its waters . Certainly all of that caste at present religiously avoid drinking the water of the lake ; and the old people of the city say that they have always done so since they can remember , and that they used to hear from their parents that they had always done so . In nothing does the Founder of the Christian religion appear more amiable than in His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and forbid them not ' . In nothing do the Hindoo deities appear more horrible than in the delight they are supposed to take in their sacrifice  --  it is everywhere the helpless , the female , and the infant that they seek to devour  --  and so it was among the Phoenicians and their Carthaginian colonies . Human sacrifices were certainly offered in the cities of Sagar during the whole of the Maratha government up to the year 1800 , when they were put a stop to by the local governor , Asa Sahib , a very humane man ; and I once heard a very learned Brahman priest say that he thought the decline of his family and government arose from this innovation . ' There is ' , said he , ' no sin in not offering human sacrifices to the gods where none have been offered ; but , where the gods have been accustomed to them , they are naturally annoyed when the rite is abolished , and visit the place and people with all kinds of calamities . ' He did not seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning , and perhaps three Brahman priests out of four would have reasoned in the same manner. 3 On descending into the valley of the Nerbudda over the Vindhya range of hills from Bhopal , one may see by the side of the road , upon a spur of the hill , a singular pillar of sandstone rising in two spires , one turning above and rising over the other , to the height of from twenty to thirty feet . On a spur of a hill half a mile distant is another sandstone pillar not quite so high . The tradition is that the smaller pillar was the affianced bride of the taller one , who was a youth of a family of great eminence in these parts . Coming with his uncle to pay his first visit to his bride in the procession they call the ' barat ' , he grew more and more impatient as he approached nearer and nearer , and she shared the feeling . At last , unable to restrain himself , he jumped upon his uncle 's shoulder , and looked with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seated . Unhappily she felt no less impatient than he did , and raised ' the fringed curtains of her eye ' , as he raised his , and they saw each other at the same moment . In that moment the bride , bridegroom , and uncle were all converted into stone pillars ; and there they stand to this day a monument , in the estimation of the people , to warn men and womankind against too strong an inclination to indulge curiosity . It is a singular fact that in one of the most extensive tribes of the Gond population of Central India , to which this couple is said to have belonged , the bride always goes to the bridegroom in the procession of the ' barat ' , to prevent a recurrence of this calamity . It is the bridegroom who goes to the bride among every other class of the people of India , as well Muhammadans as Hindoos . Whether the usage grew out of the tradition , or the tradition out of the usage , is a question that will admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only vouch for the existence of both . I have seen the pillars , heard the tradition from the people , and ascertained the usage ; as in the case of that of the Sagar lake . The Mahadeo sandstone hills , which in the Satpura range overlook the Nerbudda to the south , rise to between four and five thousand feet above the level of the sea ; 4 and in one of the highest parts a fair was formerly , and is , perhaps , still held5 for the enjoyment of those who assemble to witness the self devotion of a few young men , who offer themselves as a sacrifice to fulfil the vows of their mothers . When a woman is without children she makes votive offerings to all the gods , who can , she thinks , assist her , and promises of still greater in case they should grant what she wants . Smaller promises being found of no avail , she at last promises her first-born , if a male , to the god of destruction , Mahadeo . If she gets a son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained the age of puberty ; she then communicates it sic to him , and enjoins him to fulfil it . He believes it to be his paramount duty to obey his mother 's call ; and from that moment he considers himself as devoted to the god . Without breathing to any living soul a syllable of what she has told him , he puts on the habit of a pilgrim or religious mendicant , visits all the celebrated temples dedicated to this god in different parts of India ; 6 and , at the annual fair on the Mahadeo hills , throws himself from a perpendicular height of four or five hundred feet , and is dashed to pieces upon the rocks below. 7 If the youth does not feel himself quite prepared for the sacrifice on the first visit , he spends another year in pilgrimages , and returns to fulfil his mother 's vow at the next fair . Some have , I believe , been known to postpone the sacrifice to a third fair ; but the interval is always spent in painful pilgrimages to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Governor-General 's representative at the court of Nagpur , 8 great efforts were made by him and all the European officers under him to put a stop to these horrors by doing away with the fair ; and their efforts were assisted by the cholera morbus , which broke out among the multitude one season while they were so employed , and carried off the greater part of them . This seasonable visitation was , I believe , considered as an intimation on the part of the god that the people ought to have been more attentive to the wishes of the white men , for it so happens that Mahadeo is the only one of the Hindoo gods who is represented with a white face. 9 He figures among the dramatis personae of the great pantomime of the Ramlila10 or fight for the recovery of Sita from the demon king of Ceylon ; and is the only one with a white face . I know not whether the fair has ever been revived , but I think not . In 1829 the wheat and other spring crops in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hail-storm ; in 1830 they were deficient from the want of seasonable rains ; and in 1831 they were destroyed by blight . During these three years the ' teori ' , or what in other parts of India is called ' kesari ' ( the Lathyrus sativus of botanists ) , a kind of wild vetch , which , though not sown itself , is left carelessly to grow among the wheat and other grain , and given in the green and dry state to cattle , remained uninjured , and thrived with great luxuriance. 11 In 1831 they reaped a rich crop of it from the blighted wheat-fields , and subsisted upon its grain during that and the following years , giving the stalks and leaves only to their cattle . In 1833 the sad effects of this food began to manifest themselves . The younger part of the population of this and the surrounding villages , from the age of thirty downwards , began to be deprived of the use of their limbs below the waist by paralytic strokes , in all cases sudden , but in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth of this village of both sexes became affected during the years 1833 and 1834 , and many of them have lost the use of their lower limbs entirely , and are unable to move . The youth of the surrounding villages , in which the ' teori ' from the same causes formed the chief article of food during the years 1831 and 1832 , have suffered to an equal degree . Since the year 1834 no new case has occurred ; but no person once attacked had been found to recover the use of the limbs affected ; and my tent was surrounded by great numbers of the youth in different stages of the disease , imploring my advice and assistance under this dreadful visitation . Some of them were very fine-looking young men of good caste and respectable families ; and all stated that their pains and infirmities were confined entirely to the parts below the waist . They described the attack as coming on suddenly , often while the person was asleep , and without any warning symptoms whatever ; and stated that a greater portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the prevailing opinion of the natives throughout the country that both horses and bullocks , which have been much fed upon ' teori ' , are liable to lose the use of their limbs ; but , if the poisonous qualities abound more in the grain than in the stalk or leaves , man , who eats nothing but the grain , must be more liable to suffer from the use of this food than beasts , which eat it merely as they eat grass or hay . I sent the son of the head man of the village and another , who were among the young people least affected , into Sagar with a letter to my friend Dr. Foley , with a request that he would try what he could do for them ; and if he had any fair prospect of being able to restore these people to the use of their limbs , that measures might be adopted through the civil authorities to provide them with accommodation and the means of subsistence , either by private subscription , or by application to Government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor funds to maintain these people while under Dr. Foley 's care ; and several seasons of calamity had deprived them of the means of maintaining themselves at a distance from their families . Nor is a medical man in India provided with the means found most effectual in removing such affections , such as baths , galvanic batteries , &c.; It is lamentable to think how very little we have as yet done for the country in the healing art , that art which , above all others , a benevolent and enlightened Government should encourage among the people of India . All we have as yet done has been to provide medical attendants for our European officers ; regiments , and jails . It must not , however , be supposed that the people of India are without medical advice , for there is not a town or considerable village in India without its practitioners , the Hindoos following the Egyptian ( Misrani ) , and the Musalmans the Grecian ( Yunani ) practice . The first prescribe little physic and much fasting ; and the second follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with which they are all tolerably well acquainted . As far as the office of physician goes , the natives of India of all classes , high and low , have much more confidence in their own practitioners than in ours , whom they consider too reckless and better adapted to treat diseases in a cold than a hot climate . They can not afford to give the only fees which European physicians would accept ; and they see them , in their hospital practice , trust much to their native assistants , who are very few of them able to read any book , much less to study the profound doctrines of the great masters of the science of medicine. 12 No native ventures to offer an opinion upon this abstruse subject in any circle where he is not known to be profoundly read in either Arabic or Sanskrit lore ; nor would he venture to give a prescription without first consulting , ' spectacles on nose ' , a book as large as a church Bible . The educated class , as indeed all classes , say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in need of our surgeons . Here they feel that they are helpless , and we are strong ; and they seek our aid whenever they see any chance of obtaining it , as in the present case. 13 Considering that every European gentleman they meet is more or less a surgeon , or hoping to find him so , people who are afflicted , or have children afflicted , with any kind of malformation , or malorganization , flock round them sic wherever they go , and implore their aid ; but implore in vain , for , when they do happen to fall in with a surgeon , he is a mere passer-by , without the means or the time to afford relief . In travelling over India there is nothing which distresses a benevolent man so much as the necessity he is daily under of telling poor parents , who , with aching hearts and tearful eyes , approach him with their suffering children in their arms , that to relieve them requires time and means which are not at a traveller 's command , or a species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter thus to dash to the ground the cup of hope which our approach has raised to the lip of mother , father , and child ; but he consoles himself with the prospect , that at no distant period a benevolent and enlightened Government will distribute over the land those from whom the afflicted will not seek relief in vain. 14 Notes : 1 . The garrison is stated in the Gazetteer ( 1870 ) to consist of a European regiment of infantry , two batteries of European artillery , one native cavalry and one native infantry regiment . In 1893 it consisted of one battery of Royal Artillery , a detachment of British Infantry , a regiment of Bengal Cavalry , and a detachment of Bengal Infantry . According to the census of 1911 , the population of Sagar was 45,908. 2 .

Nagpur is now the head-quarters of the Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces . 9 .

Various explanations of the legend have been offered . Professor A. Weber is inclined to think that the various references to white teachers in Indian legends allude to Christian missionaries . The Mahabharata mentions the travels of Narada and others across the sea to ' Sveta-dwipa ' , the ' Island of the White Men ' , in order to learn the doctrine of the unity of God . This tradition appears to be intelligible only if understood to commemorate the journeys of pious Indians to Alexandria , and their study of Christianity there ( Die Griechen in Indien , 1890 , p. 34 ) . 10 . The Ramlila , a performance corresponding to the mediaeval European ' miracle-play ' , is celebrated in Northern India in the month of Kuar ( or Asvin , September-October ) , at the same time as the Durga Puja is solemnized in Bengal .

The Hindoo practitioners are called ' baid ' ( Sanskrit ' vaidya ' , followers of the Veda , that is to say , the Ayur Veda ) . The Musalman practitioners are generally called ' hakim ' . The Egyptian school ( Misrani , Misri , or Suryani , that is , Syrian ) never practise bleeding , and are partial to the use of metallic oxides . The Yunani physicians approve of bleeding , and prefer vegetable drugs . The older writers on India fancied that the Hindoo system of medicine was of enormous antiquity , and that the principles of Galenical medical science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Hindoo medicine , like Hindoo astronomy , is largely of Greek origin . This conclusion has been expressed in an exaggerated form by some writers , but its general truth appears to be established . The Hindoo books treating of medicine are certainly older than Wilson supposed , for the Bower manuscript , written in the second half of the fourth century of our era , contains three Sanskrit medical treatises . The writers had , however , plenty of time to borrow from Galen , who lived in the second century . The Indian aversion to European medicine , as distinguished from surgery , still exists , though in a degree somewhat less than in the author 's time . Many municipal boards have insisted on employing ' baids ' and ' hakims ' in addition to the practitioners trained in European methods . Well-to-do patients often delay resort to the English physician until they have exhausted all resources of the ' hakim ' and have been nearly killed by his drastic treatment .

Chlorodyne also is fully appreciated , but most of the European medicines are regarded with little faith . Since the author wrote , great progress has been made in providing hospital and dispensary accommodation . Each ' district ' , or unit of civil administration , has a fairly well equipped combined hospital and dispensary at head-quarters , and branch dispensaries exist in almost every district . An Inspector-General of Dispensaries supervises the medical administration of each province , and medical schools have been organized at Calcutta , Madras , Bombay , Lahore , and Agra . During Lord Dufferin 's Viceroyalty and afterwards , energetic steps were taken to improve the system of medical relief for females . Pandit Madhusadan Gupta , on January 10 , 1836 , was the first Hindoo who ventured to dissect a human body and teach anatomy . India can now boast of a considerable number of Hindoo and Musalman practitioners , trained in European methods , and skilful in their profession . Much has been done , infinitely more remains to be done . Details will be found in I.G. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Medical Administration ' , The article ' Medicine ' in Balfour , Cyclopaedia , 3rd ed. , 1885 , on which I have drawn for some of the facts above stated , gives a good summary of the earlier history of medicine in India , but greatly exaggerates the antiquity of the Hindoo books . On this question Weber 's paper , ' Die Griechen in Indien ' ( Berlin , 1890 , p. 28 ) , and Dr. Hoernle 's remarks on the Bower manuscript ( in J.A.S.B. , vol. lx ( 1891 ) , Part I , p. 145 ) may be consulted .

CHAPTER 16 Suttee Tombs  --  Insalubrity of deserted Fortresses . On the 3rd we came to Bahrol , 1 where I had encamped with Lord William Bentinck on the last day of December , 1832 , when the quicksilver in the thermometer at sunrise , outside our tents , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village stands upon a gentle swelling hill of decomposed basalt , and is surrounded by hills of the same formation . The Dasan river flows close under the village , and has two beautiful reaches , one above , the other below , separated by the dyke of basalt , over which lies the ford of the river. 2 There are beautiful reaches of the kind in all the rivers in this part of India , and they are almost everywhere formed in the same manner . At Bahrol there is a very unusual number of tombs built over the ashes of women who have burnt themselves with the remains of their husbands . Upon each tomb stands erect a tablet of freestone , with the sun , the new moon , and a rose engraved upon it in bas-relief in one field ; 3 and the man and woman , hand in hand , in the other . On one stone of this kind I saw a third field below these two , with the figure of a horse in bas-relief , and I asked one of the gentlemen farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He told me that he thought it indicated that the woman rode on horseback to bathe before she ascended the pile. 4 I asked him whether he thought the measure prohibiting the practice of burning good or bad . ' It is ' , said he , ' in some respects good , and in others bad . Widows can not marry among us , and those who had no prospect of a comfortable provision among their husband 's relations , or who dreaded the possibility of going astray , and thereby sinking into contempt and misery , were enabled in this way to relieve their minds , and follow their husbands , under the full assurance of being happily united to them in the next world . ' When I passed this place on horseback with Lord William Bentinck , he asked me what these tombs were , for he had never seen any of the kind before . When I told him what they were , he said not a word ; but he must have felt a proud consciousness of the debt of gratitude which India owes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop to this great evil , in spite of all the fearful obstacles which bigotry and prejudice opposed to the measure . The seven European functionaries in charge of the seven districts of the newly-acquired territories were requested , during the administration of Lord Amherst in 1826 , to state whether the burning of widows could or should be prohibited ; and I believe every one of them declared that it should not . And yet , when it was put a stop to only a few years after by Lord William , not a complaint or murmur was heard . The replies to the Governor-General 's inquiries were , I believe , throughout India , for the most part , opposed to the measure. 5 On the 4th we came to Dhamoni , ten miles . The only thing remarkable here is the magnificent fortress , which is built upon a small projection of the Vindhya range , looking down on each side into two enormously deep glens , through which the two branches of the Dasan river descend over the tableland into the plains of Bundelkhand. 6 The rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glens , and things are , in consequence , grown there that could not be grown in parts more exposed . Every inch of the level ground in the bed of the streams below seems to be cultivated with care . This fortress is said to have cost more than a million of money , and to have been only one of fifty-two great works , of which a former Raja of Bundelkhand , Birsingh Deo , laid the foundation in the same happy hour which had been pointed out to him by his astrologers. 7 The works form an acute triangle , with the base towards the tableland , and the two sides hanging perpendicularly over the glens , while the apex points to the course of the streams as they again unite , and pass out through a deep chasm into the plains of Bundelkhand . The fortress is now entirely deserted , and the town , which the garrison supported , is occupied by only a small police-guard , stationed here to see that robbers do not take up their abode among the ruins . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become filled by a dense stream of carbonic acid gas , which is found so inimical to animal life that those who attempt to occupy them become ill , and , sooner or later , almost all die of the consequences . This gas , being specifically much heavier than common air , descends into the bottom of such unoccupied fortresses , and remains stagnant like water in old reservoirs . The current of pure air continually passes over , without being able to carry off the mass of stagnant air below ; and the only way to render such places habitable is to make large openings in the walls on all sides , from the top to the bottom , so that the foul air may be driven out by the current of pure atmospheric air , which will then be continually rushing in . When these fortresses are thickly peopled , the continual motion within tends , I think , to mix up this gas with the air above ; while the numerous fires lighted within , by rarefying that below , tend to draw down a regular supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inhabitants . When natives enter upon the occupation of an old fortress of this kind , that has remained long unoccupied , they always make a solemn religions ceremony of it ; and , having fed the priests , the troops , and a crowd of followers , all rush in at once with beat of drums , and as much noise as they can make . By this rush , and the fires that follow , the bad air is , perhaps , driven off , and never suffered to collect again while the fortress remains fully occupied . Whatever may be the cause , the fact is certain that these fortresses become deadly places of abode for small detachments of troops , or small parties of any kind . They all get ill , and few recover from the diseases they contract in them . From the year 1817 , when we first took possession of the Sagar and Nerbudda Territories , almost all the detachments of troops we required to keep at a distance from the headquarters of their regiments were posted in these old deserted fortifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in some cases , they were converted into jails for the accommodation of our prisoners . Of the soldiers so lodged , I do not believe that one in four ever came out well ; and , of those who came out ill , I do not believe that one in four survived five years . They were all abandoned one after the other ; but it is painful to think how many hundreds , I may say thousands , of our brave soldiers were sacrificed before this resolution was taken . I have known the whole of the survivors of strong detachments that went in , in robust health , three months before , brought away mere skeletons , and in a hopeless and dying state . All were sent to their homes on medical certificate , but they almost all died there , or in the course of their journey . Notes : 1 . December , 1835 . The name of the village is spelled Behrole by the author . 2 . The Dasan river rises in the Bhopal State , flows through the Sagar district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lalitpur subdivision of the Jhansi District , United Provinces of Agra and Oudh . It also forms the boundary between the Jhansi and Hamirpur Districts , and falls into the Betwa after a course of about 220 miles . The name is often , but erroneously , written Dhasan . It is the Sanskrit Dasarna. 3 . This emblem is a lotus , not a rose flower . The latter is never used in Hindoo symbolism . The lotus is a solar emblem , and intimately associated with the worship of Vishnu. 4 . It rather indicates that the husband was on horseback when killed . The sculptures on sati pillars often commemorate the mode of death of the husband . Sometimes these pillars are inscribed . They usually face the east . An open hand is often carved in the upper compartment as well as the sun and moon . A drawing of such a pillar will be found in J.A.S.B. , vol. xlvi . Part I , 1877 , pl. xiv .

The ' newly-acquired territories ' referred to are the Sagar and Nerbudda Territories , comprising the seven districts , Sagar , Jubbulpore , Hoshangabad , Seoni , Damoh , Narsinghpur , and Baitul , ceded in 1818 , and now included in the Central Provinces . The tenor of the replies given to Lord Amherst 's queries shows how far the process of Hindooizing had advanced among the European officials of the Company . Lord Amherst left India in March , 1828 . See ante . Chapter 4 and Chapter 8 , for cases of sati ( suttees ) . For a good account of the suttee discussions and legislation , see D. Boulger , Lord William Bentinck ( 1897 ) , chap . v , in ' Rulers of India ' Series . No other biography of Lord William Bentinck exists . 6 . Dhamoni is in the Sagar district of the Central Provinces , about twenty-nine miles north of Sagar . The fort was taken by General Marshall in 1818 . It had been rebuilt by Raja Birsingh Deo of Orchha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . In the original edition , the author 's march is said to have taken place ' on the 24th ' . This must be a mistake for ' on the 4th ' ; as the last date , that of the march to Bahrol , was the 3rd December . The author reached Agra on January 1 , 1836 , 7 . The number fifty-two is one of the Hindoo favourite numbers , like seven , twelve , and eighty-four , held sacred for astronomical or astrological reasons . Birsingh Deo was the younger brother of Ramchand , head of the Bundela clan . To oblige Prince Salim , afterwards the Emperor Jahangir , he murdered Abul Fazl , the celebrated minister and historian of Akbar , on August 12 , 1602 , Jahangir , after his accession , rewarded the murderer by allowing him to supersede his brother in the headship of his clan , and by appointing him to the rank of ' commander of three thousand ' . The capital of Birsingh was Orchha . His successors are often spoken of as Rajas of Tehri . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Count von Noer , translated by A. S.

On the 5th1 we came to the village of Seori . Soon after leaving Dhamoni , we descended the northern face of the Vindhya range into the plains of Bundelkhand . The face of this range overlooking the valley of the Nerbudda to the south is , as I have before stated , a series of mural precipices , like so many rounded bastions , the slight dip of the strata being to the north . The northern face towards Bundelkhand , on the contrary , here descends gradually , as the strata dip slightly towards the north , and we pass down gently over their back . The strata have , however , been a good deal broken , and the road was so rugged that two of our carts broke down in descending . From the descent over the northern face of the tableland into Bundelkhand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Nerbudda must be a distance of one hundred miles directly north and south . The descent over the northern face is not everywhere so gradual ; on the contrary , there are but few places where it is at all feasible ; and some of the rivers of the tableland between Jubbulpore and Mirzapore have a perpendicular fall of more than four hundred feet over these mural precipices of the northern face of the Vindhya range. 2 A man , if he have good nerve , may hang over the summits , and suspend in his hand a plummet that shall reach the bottom . I should mention that this tableland is not only intersected by ranges , but everywhere studded with isolated hills rising suddenly out of basins or valleys . These ranges and isolated hills are all of the same sandstone formation , and capped with basalt , more or less amygdaloidal . The valleys and cappings have often a substratum of very compact basalt , which must evidently have flowed into them after these islands were formed . The question is , how were these valleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ! ' says Mr. Scrope ; ' grant me only time , and I can account for everything . ' I think , however , that I am right in considering the basaltic cappings of these ranges and isolated hills to have once formed part of continued flat beds of great lakes . The flat parallel planes of these cappings , corresponding with each other , however distantly separated the hills they cover may be , would seem to indicate that they could not all have been subject to the convulsions of nature by which the whole substrata were upheaved above the ocean . I am disposed to think that such islands and ranges of the sandstone were formed before the deposit of the basalt , and that the form of the surface is now returning to what it then was , by the gradual decomposition and wearing away of the latter rock . Much , however , may be said on both sides of this , as of every other question . After descending from the sandstone of the Vindhya3 range into Bundelkhand , we pass over basalt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and there beds and veins of pure feldspar , hornblende , and quartz . Takht Singh , the younger brother of Arjun Singh , the Raja of Shahgarh , 4 came out several miles to meet me on his elephant . Finding me on horseback , he got off from his elephant , and mounted his horse , and we rode on till we met the Raja himself , about a mile from our tents . He was on horseback , with a large and splendidly dressed train of followers , all mounted on fine sleek horses , bred in the Raja 's own stables . He was mounted on a snow-white steed of his own breeding ( and I have rarely seen a finer animal ) , and dressed in a light suit of silver brocade made to represent the scales of steel armour , surmounted by a gold turban . Takht Singh was more plainly dressed , but is a much finer and more intelligent-looking man . Having escorted us to our tents , they took their leave , and returned to their own , which were pitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small stream , half a mile distant . Takht Singh resides here in a very pretty fortified castle on an eminence . It is a square building , with a round bastion at each corner , and one on each face , rising into towers above the walls . A little after midday the Raja and his brother came to pay us a visit ; and about four o'clock I went to return it , accompanied by Lieutenant Thomas . As usual , he had a nautch ( dance ) upon carpets , spread upon the sward under awnings in front of the pavilion in which we were received . While the women were dancing and singing , a very fine panther was brought in to be shown to us . He had been caught , full-grown , two years before , and , in the hands of a skilful man , was fit for the chase in six months . It was a very beautiful animal , but , for the sake of the sport , kept wretchedly thin. 5 He seemed especially indifferent to the crowd and the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about in the dance with her red mantle floating in the breeze ; and , whenever his head was turned towards her , he cropped his ears . She at last , in play , swept close by him , and with open mouth he attempted to spring upon her , but was pulled back by the keeper . She gave a shriek , and nearly fell upon her back in fright . The Raja is a man of no parts or character , and , his expenditure being beyond his income , he is killing his goose for the sake of her eggs  --  that is , he is ruining all the farmers and cultivators of his large estate by exactions , and thereby throwing immense tracts of fine land out of tillage .

As soon as this officer had left him , the colonel wrote off a note to the doctor : ' My dear Doctor ,  --  I understand that that fellow , John the Baptist , has got into Sindhia 's service , and now commands an army  - -  do send me the newspapers . ' These were certainly the words of his note , and , at the only time I heard him speak on the subject of religion he discomfited his adversary in an argument at the mess by ' Why , sir , you do not suppose that I believe in those fellows , Luther , Calvin , and John the Baptist , do you ?

The flat-topped hills have been carved out of the basaltic surface by the agencies which wore away the massive sheet of lava . The basaltic cappings of the hills certainly can not have ' formed part of continued flat beds of great lakes ' . See the notes to Chapter 14 , ante . Mr. Scrope was quite right .

On the 6th1 we came to Sayyidpur , ten miles , over an undulating country , with a fine soil of decomposed basalt , reposing upon syenite , with veins of feldspar and quartz . Cultivation partial , and very bad ; and population extremely scanty . We passed close to a village , in which the children were all at play ; while upon the bushes over their heads were suspended an immense number of the beautiful nests of the sagacious ' baya ' bird , or Indian yellow-hammer , 2 all within reach of a grown-up boy , and one so near the road that a grown-up man might actually look into it as he passed along , and could hardly help shaking it . It can not fail to strike a European as singular to see so many birds ' nests , situated close to a village , remain unmolested within reach of so many boisterous children , with their little proprietors and families fluttering and chirping among them with as great a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves enjoy . In any part of Europe not a nest of such a colony could have lived an hour within reach of such a population ; for the baya bird has no peculiar respect paid to it by the people here , like the wren and robin-redbreast in England . No boy in India has the slightest wish to molest birds in their nests ; it enters not into their pastimes , and they have no feeling of pride or pleasure in it . With us it is different  --  to discover birds ' nests is one of the first modes in which a boy exercises his powers , and displays his love of art . Upon his skill in finding them he is willing to rest his first claim to superior sagacity and enterprise . His trophies are his string of eggs ; and the eggs most prized among them are those of the nests that are discovered with most difficulty , and attained with most danger . The same feeling of desire to display their skill and enterprise in search after birds ' nests in early life renders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal creation throughout their after career . The boy prides himself on his dexterity in throwing a stone or a stick ; and he practises on almost every animal that comes in his way , till he never sees one without the desire to knock it down , or at least to hit it ; and , if it is lawful to do so , he feels it to be a most serious misfortune not to have a stone within his reach at the time . As he grows up , he prides himself upon his dexterity in shooting , and he never sees a member of the feathered tribe within shot , without a desire to shoot it , or without regretting that he has not a gun in his hand to shoot it . That he is not entirely destitute of sympathy , however , with the animals he maims for his amusement is sufficiently manifest from his anxiety to put them out of pain the moment he gets them . A friend of mine , now no more , Captain Medwin , was once looking with me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he put aside the glass , saying : ' You may say what you like , S  --  , but the best landscape I know is a fine black partridge3 falling before my Joe Manton . ' The following lines of Walter Scott , in his Rokeby , have always struck me as very beautiful : - As yet the conscious pride of art Had steel 'd him in his treacherous part ; A powerful spring of force unguessed That hath each gentler mood suppressed , And reigned in many a human breast ; From his that plans the rude campaign , To his that wastes the woodland reign , &c.[4]; Among the people of India it is very different . Children do not learn to exercise their powers either in discovering and robbing the nests of birds , or in knocking them down with stones and staves ; and , as they grow up , they hardly ever think of hunting or shooting for mere amusement . It is with them a matter of business ; the animal they can not eat they seldom think of molesting . Some officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dogs , through my grounds . The animal passed close to one of my guard , who cut him in two with his sword , and held up the reeking blade in triumph to the indignant cavalcade ; who , when they came up , were ready to eat him alive . ' What have I done ' , said the poor man , ' to offend you ? ' ' Have you not killed the jackal ? ' shouted the whipper-in , in a fury . ' Of course I have ; but were you not all trying to kill him ? ' replied the poor man . He thought their only object had been to kill the jackal , as they would have killed a serpent , merely because he was a mischievous and noisy beast . The European traveller in India is often in doubt whether the peacocks , partridges , and ducks , which he finds round populous villages , are tame or wild , till he asks some of the villagers themselves , so assured of safety do these creatures become , and so willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the suburbs . They very soon find the difference , however , between the white-faced visitor and the dark-faced inhabitants . There is a fine date-tree overhanging a kind of school at the end of one of the streets in the town of Jubbulpore , quite covered with the nests of the baya birds ; and they are seen , every day and all day , fluttering and chirping about there in scores , while the noisy children at their play fill the street below , almost within arm 's length of them . I have often thought that such a tree so peopled at the door of a school in England might work a great revolution in the early habits and propensities of the youth educated in it . The European traveller is often amused to see the pariah dog5 squatted close in front of the traveller during the whole time he is occupied in cooking and eating his dinner , under a tree by the roadside , assured that he shall have at least a part of the last cake thrown to him by the stranger , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with complacency , as one that reposes a quiet confidence in his charitable disposition , and flings towards him the whole or part of his last cake , as if his meal had put him in the best possible humour with him and all the world .

CHAPTER 19 Feeding Pilgrims  --  Marriage of a Stone with a Shrub . At Sayyidpur1 we encamped in a pretty little mango grove , and here I had a visit from my old friend Janki Sewak , the high priest of the great temple that projects into the Sagar lake , and is called Bindraban. 2 He has two villages rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something more through his numerous disciples , who wander over the country ; and spends the whole in feeding all the members of his fraternity ( Bairagis ) , devotees of Vishnu , as they pass his temple in their pilgrimages . Every one who comes is considered entitled to a good meal and a night 's lodging ; and he has to feed and lodge about a hundred a day . He is a man of very pleasing manners and gentle disposition , and everybody likes him . He was on his return from the town of Ludhaura , 3 where he had been , at the invitation of the Raja of Orchha , to assist at the celebration of the marriage of Salagram with the Tulasi , 4 which there takes place every year under the auspices and at the expense of the Raja , who must be present . ' Salagrams ' 5 are rounded pebbles which contain the impressions of ammonites , and are washed down into the plains of India by the rivers from the limestone rocks in which these shells are imbedded in the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposit of fossil ammonites and belemnites8 in limestone rocks , now elevated above sixteen thousand feet above the level of the sea ; and from such beds as these are brought down the fragments , which , when rounded in their course , the poor Hindoo takes for representatives of Vishnu , the preserving god of the Hindoo triad . The Salagram is the only stone idol among the Hindoos that is essentially sacred , and entitled to divine honours without the ceremonies of consecration. 9 It is everywhere held most sacred . During the war against Nepal , 10 Captain B  --   --   --  , who commanded a reconnoitring party from the division in which I served , one day brought back to camp some four or five Salagrams , which he had found at the hut of some priest within the enemy 's frontier . He called for a large stone and hammer , and proceeded to examine them . The Hindoos were all in a dreadful state of consternation , and expected to see the earth open and swallow up the whole camp , while he sat calmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have cracked so many walnuts . The Tulasi is a small sacred shrub ( Ocymum sanctum ) , which is a metamorphosis of Sita , the wife of Rama , the seventh incarnation of Vishnu . This little pebble is every year married to this little shrub ; and the high priest told me that on the present occasion the procession consisted of eight elephants , twelve hundred camels , four thousand horses , all mounted and elegantly caparisoned . On the leading elephant of this cortege , and the most sumptuously decorated , was carried the pebble god , who was taken to pay his bridal visit ( barat ) to the little shrub goddess . All the ceremonies of a regular marriage are gone through ; and , when completed , the bride and bridegroom are left to repose together in the temple of Ludhaura11 till the next season . ' Above a hundred thousand people ' , the priest said , ' were present at the ceremony this year at the Raja 's invitation , and feasted upon his bounty . ' 12 The old man and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their effects upon the people ; and he said that bad governments would sooner or later be always put down by the deity ; and quoted this verse , which I took down with my pencil : Tulasi , gharib na satae , Buri gharib ki hai ; Mari khal ke phunk se Loha bhasm ho jae . ' Oh , Raja Tulasi ! oppress not the poor ; for the groans of the wretched bring retribution from heaven . The contemptible skin ( in the smith 's bellows ) in time melts away the hardest iron . ' 13 On leaving our tents in the morning , we found the ground all round white with hoar frost , as we had found it for several mornings before ; 14 and a little canary bird , one of the two which travelled in my wife 's palankeen , having , by the carelessness of the servants been put upon the top without any covering to the cage , was killed by the cold , to her great affliction . All attempts to restore it to life by the warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came nine miles to Bamhauri over a soil still basaltic , though less rich , reposing upon syenite , which frequently rises and protrudes its head above the surface , which is partially and badly cultivated , and scantily peopled . The silent signs of bad government could not be more manifest . All the extensive plains , covered with fine long grass , which is rotting in the ground from want of domestic cattle or distant markets . Here , as in every other part of Central India , the people have a great variety of good spontaneous , but few cultivated , grasses . They understand the character and qualities of these grasses extremely well . They find some thrive best in dry , and some in wet seasons ; and that of inferior quality is often prized most because it thrives best when other kinds can not thrive at all , from an excess or a deficiency of rain . When cut green they all make good hay , and have the common denomination of ' sahia ' . The finest of these grasses are two which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together-'kel ' and ' musel ' ; the third ' parwana ' ; fourth ' bhawar ' , or ' guniar ' ; fifth ' saina ' . 16 Notes : 1 . Spelled Siedpore in the author 's text . 2 . More correctly Brindaban ( Vrindavana ) . The name originally belongs to one of the most sacred spots in India , situated near Mathura ( Muttra ) on the Jumna , and the reputed scene of the dalliance between Krishna and the milkmaids ( Gopis ) ; also associated with the legend Rama . 3 . Twenty-seven miles north-west of Tehri in the Orchha State . 4 . The Tulasi plant , or basil , Ocymum sanctum , is ' not merely sacred to Vishnu or to his wife Lakshmi ; it is pervaded by the essence of these deities , and itself worshipped as a deity and prayed to accordingly . . . . The Tulasi is the object of more adoration than any other plant at present worshipped in India . . . . It is to be found in almost every respectable household throughout India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be cultivated in a good-sized flower-pot , and often placed in rooms . Generally , however , it is planted in the courtyard of a well-to-do man 's house , with a space round it for reverential circumambulation . In real fact the Tulasi is par excellence a domestic divinity , or rather , perhaps , a woman 's divinity ' ( M. Williams , Religious Thought and Life in India , p. 333 ) . 5 . The fossil ammonites found in India include at least fifteen species . They occur between Trichinopoly and Pondicherry as well as in the Himalayan rocks . They are particularly abundant in the river Gandak , which rises near Dhaulagiri in Nepal , and falls into the Ganges near Patna . The upper course of this river is consequently called Salagrami . Various forms of the fossils are supposed to represent various avatars of Vishnu ( Balfour , Cyclopaedia , 3rd ed. , s.v . ' Ammonite ' , ' Gandak ' , ' Salagrama ' ; M. Williams , Religious Thought and Life in India , pp. 69 , 349 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the tulasi plant will be found in Dubois , Hindu Manners , &c.,; 3rd ed. ( 1906 ) , pp. 648-51. 6 .

The north-eastern corner of the Punjab , an elevated valley along the course of the Spiti or the Li river , a tributary of the Satlaj. 8 . Fossils of the genus Belemnites and related genera are common , like the ammonites , near Trichinopoly , as well as in the Himalaya . 9 . This statement is not quite correct . The pebbles representing the Linga of Siva , called Bana-linga , or Vana-linga , and apparently of white quartz , which are found in the Nerbudda river , enjoy the same distinction . ' Both are held to be of their own nature pervaded by the special presence of the deity , and need no consecration .

In 1814-16. 11 . ' Sadora ' in author 's text , which seems to be a misprint for Ludora or Ludhaura. 12 . The Tulasi shrub is sometimes married to an image of Krishna , instead of to the salagrama , in Western India ( M. Williams , Religious Thought and Life in India , p. 334 ) . Compare the account of the marriage between the mango-tree and the jasmine , ante , Chapter 5 , Note 3. 13 . These Hindi verses are incorrectly printed , and loosely rendered by the author . The translation of the text , after necessary emendation , is : ' Tulasi , oppress not the poor ; evil is the lot of the poor . From the blast of the dead hide iron becomes ashes . ' Mr. W. Crooke informs me that the verses are found in the Kabirki Sakhi , and are attributable to Kabir Das , rather than to Tulasi Das . But the authorship of such verses is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as given in the text do not scan , and that the better version is : Durbal ko na sataiye , Jaki mati hai ; Mue khal ke sans se Sar bhasm ho jae .

Ram Chand Rao , commonly called the Sarimant , chief of Deori , 1 here overtook me . He came out from Sagar to visit me at Dhamoni2 and , not reaching that place in time , came on after me . He held Deori under the Peshwa , as the Sagar chief held Sagar , for the payment of the public establishments kept up by the local administration . It yielded him about ten thousand a year , and , when we took possession of the country , he got an estate in the Sagar district , in rent-free tenure , estimated at fifteen hundred a year . This is equal to about six thousand pounds a year in England . The tastes of native gentlemen lead them always to expend the greater part of their incomes in the wages of trains of followers of all descriptions , and in horses , elephants , &c.; and labour and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in England . By the breaking up of public establishments , and consequent diminution of the local demand for agricultural produce , the value of land throughout all Central India , after the termination of the Mahratha War in 1817 , fell by degrees thirty per cent. ; and , among the rest , that of my poor friend the Sarimant . While I had the civil charge of the Sagar district in 1831 I represented this case of hardship ; and Government , in the spirit of liberality which has generally characterized their measures in this part of India , made up to him the difference between what he actually received and what they had intended to give him ; and he has ever since felt grateful to me. 3 He is a very small man , not more than five feet high , but he has the handsomest face I have almost ever seen , and his manners are those of the most perfect native gentleman . He came to call upon me after breakfast , and the conversation turned upon the number of people that had of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ancient capital , which lies about midway between Sagar and the Nerbudda river . One of his followers , who stood beside his chair , said4 that ' when a tiger had killed one man he was safe , for the spirit of the man rode upon his head , and guided him from all danger . The spirit knew very well that the tiger would be watched for many days at the place where he had committed the homicide , and always guided him off to some other more secure place , when he killed other men without any risk to himself . He did not exactly know why the spirit of the man should thus befriend the beast that had killed him ; but ' , added he , ' there is a mischief inherent in spirits ; and the better the man the more mischievous is his ghost , if means are not taken to put him to rest . ' This is the popular and general belief throughout India ; and it is supposed that the only sure mode of destroying a tiger who has killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits of his victims , and thereby depriving him of their valuable services. 5 The belief that men are turned into tigers by eating of a root is no less general throughout India . The Sarimant , on being asked by me what he thought of the matter , observed ' there was no doubt much truth in what the man said : but he was himself of opinion that the tigers which now infest the wood from Sagar to Deori were of a different kind  --  in fact , that they were neither more nor less than men turned into tigers  --  a thing which took place in the woods of Central India much more often than people were aware of . The only visible difference between the two ' , added the Sarimant , ' is that the metamorphosed tiger has no tail , while the bora , or ordinary tiger , has a very long one . In the jungle about Deori ' , continued he , ' there is a root , which , if a man eat of , he is converted into a tiger on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can eat of another , he becomes a man again  --  a melancholy instance of the former of which ' , said he , ' occurred , I am told , in my own father 's family when I was an infant . His washerman , Raghu , was , like all washermen , a great drunkard ; and , being seized with a violent desire to ascertain what a man felt in the state of a tiger , he went one day to the jungle and brought home two of these roots , and desired his wife to stand by with one of them , and the instant she saw him assume the tiger shape , to thrust it into his mouth . She consented , the washerman ate his root , and became instantly a tiger ; but his wife was so terrified at the sight of her husband in this shape that she ran off with the antidote in her hand . Poor old Raghu took to the woods , and there ate a good many of his old friends from neighbouring villages ; but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his having no tail . You may be quite sure , ' concluded Sarimant , ' when you hear of a tiger without a tail , that it is some unfortunate man who has eaten of that root , and of all the tigers he will be found the most mischievous . ' How my friend had satisfied himself of the truth of this story I know not , but he religiously believes it , and so do all his attendants and mine ; and , out of a population of thirty thousand people in the town of Sagar , not one would doubt the story of the washerman if he heard it . I was one day talking with my friend the Raja of Maihar. 6 on the road between Jubbulpore and Mirzapore , on the subject of the number of men who had been lately killed by tigers at the Katra Pass on that road , 7 and the best means of removing the danger . ' Nothing ' , said the Raja , ' could be more easy or more cheap than the destruction of these tigers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tigers that kill men by wholesale , as these do , are , you may be sure , men themselves converted into tigers by the force of their science , and such animals are of all the most unmanageable . ' ' And how is it . Raja Sahib , that these men convert themselves into tigers ? ' ' Nothing ' , said he , ' is more easy than this to persons who have once acquired the science ; but how they learn it , or what it is , we unlettered men know not . ' ' There was once a high priest of a large temple , in this very valley of Maihar , who was in the habit of getting himself converted into a tiger by the force of this science , which he had thoroughly acquired . He had a necklace , which one of his disciples used to throw over his neck the moment the tiger 's form became fully developed . He had , however , long given up the practice , and all his old disciples had gone off on their pilgrimages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a violent desire to take his old form of the tiger . He expressed the wish to one of his new disciples , and demanded whether he thought he might rely on his courage to stand by and put on the necklace . ' Assuredly you may ' , said the disciple ; ' such is my faith in you , and in the God we serve , that I fear nothing . ' The high priest upon this put the necklace into his hand with the requisite instructions , and forthwith began to change his form . The disciple stood trembling in every limb , till he heard him give a roar that shook the whole edifice , when he fell flat upon his face , and dropped the necklace on the floor . The tiger bounded over him , and out of the door , and infested all the roads leading to the temple for many years afterwards . ' ' Do you think , Raja Sahib , that the old high priest is one of the tigers at the Katra Pass ? ' ' No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who have become imbued with a little too much of the high priest 's science  --  when men once acquire this science they ca n't help exercising it , though it be to their own ruin , and that of others . ' ' But , supposing them to be ordinary tigers , what is the simple plan you propose to put a stop to their depredations , Raja Sahib ? ' ' I propose ' , said he , ' to have the spirits that guide them propitiated by proper prayers and offerings ; for the spirit of every man or woman who has been killed by a tiger rides upon his head , or runs before him , and tells him where to go to get prey , and to avoid danger . Get some of the Gonds , or wild people from the jungles , who are well skilled in these matters  --  give them ten or twenty rupees , and bid them go and raise a small shrine , and there sacrifice to these spirits . The Gonds will tell them that they shall on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , goats , and pigs , every year at least , if they will but relinquish their offices with the tigers and be quiet . If this is done , I pledge myself ' , said the Raja , ' that the tigers will soon get killed themselves , or cease from killing men . If they do not , you may be quite sure that they are not ordinary tigers , but men turned into tigers , or that the Gonds have appropriated all you gave them to their own use , instead of applying it to conciliate the spirits of the unfortunate people .

Sarimant had been one of the few who escaped from the flames which consumed his capital of Deori in the month of April 1813 , and were supposed to have destroyed thirty thousand souls . I asked him to tell me how this happened , and he referred me to his attendant , a learned old pundit , Ram Chand , who stood by his side , as he was himself , he said , then only five years of age , and could recollect nothing of it . ' Mardan Singh , ' said the pundit , ' the father of Raja Arpan Singh , whom you saw at Seori , was then our neighbour , reigning over Garha Kota ; 1 and he had a worthless nephew , Zalim Singh , who had collected together an army of five thousand men , in the hope of getting a little principality for himself in the general scramble for dominion incident on the rise of the Pindharis and Amir Khan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great sovereigns of Central India . He came to attack our capital , which was an emporium of considerable trade and the seat of many useful manufactures , in the expectation of being able to squeeze out of us a good sum to aid him in his enterprise . While his troops blocked up every gate , fire was , by accident , set to the fence of some man 's garden within . There had been no rain for six months ; and everything was so much dried up that the flames spread rapidly ; and , though there was no wind when they began , it soon blew a gale . The Sarimant was then a little boy with his mother in the fortress , where she lived with his father3 and nine other relations . The flames soon extended to the fortress , and the powder-magazine blew up . The house in which they lived was burned down , and every soul , except the lieutenant sic himself , perished in it . His mother tried to bear him off in her arms , but fell down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His nurse , Tulsi Kurmin , 4 snatched him up , and ran with him outside of the fortress to the bank of the river , where she made him over unhurt to Hariram , the Marwari merchant. 5 He was mounted on a good horse , and , making off across the river , he carried him safely to his friends at Gaurjhamar ; but poor Tulsi the Kurmin fell down exhausted when she saw her charge safe , and died . ' The wind appeared to blow in upon the poor devoted city from every side ; and the troops of Zalim Singh , who at first prevented the people from rushing out at the gates , made off in a panic at the horrors before them . All our establishments had been driven into the city at the approach of Zalim Singh 's troops ; and scores of elephants , hundreds of camels , and thousands of horses and ponies perished in the flames , besides twenty-five thousand souls . Only about five thousand persons escaped out of thirty thousand , and these were reduced to beggary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their property . At the time the flames first began to spread , an immense crowd of people had assembled under the fortress on the bank of the Sonar river to see the widow of a soldier burn herself . Her husband had been shot by one of Zalim Singh 's soldiers in the morning ; and before midday she was by the side of his body on the funeral pile . People , as usual , begged her to tell them what would happen , and she replied , " The city will know in less than four hours " ; in less than four hours the whole city had been reduced to ashes ; and we all concluded that , since the event was so clearly foretold , it must have been decreed by God . ' 6 ' No doubt it was , ' said Sarimant ; ' how could it otherwise happen ? Do not all events depend upon His will ? Had it not been His will to save me , how could poor Tulsi the Kurmin have carried me upon her shoulders through such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family perished ? ' ' No doubt ' , said Ram Chand , ' all these things are brought about by the will of God , and it is not for us to ask why . ' 7 I have heard this event described by many other people , and I believe the account of the old pundit to be a very fair one . One day , in October 1833 , the horse of the district surgeon , Doctor Spry , as he was mounting him , reared , fell back with his head upon a stone , and died upon the spot . The doctor was not much hurt , and the little Sarimant called a few days after , and offered his congratulations upon his narrow escape . The cause of so quiet a horse rearing at this time , when he had never been known to do so before , was discussed ; and he said that there could be no doubt that the horse , or the doctor himself , must have seen some unlucky face before he mounted that morning  --  that he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a man was liable to see so many ugly or unfortunate faces ; and , for his part , he never left his house till an hour after sunrise , lest he should encounter them. 8 Many natives were present , and every one seemed to consider the Sarimant 's explanation of the cause quite satisfactory and philosophical . Some days after , Spry was going down to sleep in the bungalow where the accident happened . His native assistant and all his servants came and prayed that he would not attempt to sleep in the bungalow , as they were sure the horse must have been frightened by a ghost , and quoted several instances of ghosts appearing to people there . He , however , slept in the bungalow , and , to their great astonishment , saw no ghost and suffered no evil. 9 Notes : 1 .

CHAPTER 22 Interview with the Raja who marries the Stone to the Shrub  --  Order of the Moon and the Fish . On the 8th , 1 after a march of twelve miles , we readied Tehri , the present capital of the Raja of Orchha. 2 Our road lay over an undulating surface of soil composed of the detritus of the syenitic rock , and poor , both from its quality and want of depth . About three miles from our last territory we entered the boundary of the Orchha Raja 's territory , at the village of Aslon , which has a very pretty little fortified castle , built upon ground slightly elevated in the midst of an open grass plain . This , and all the villages we have lately passed , are built upon the bare back of the syenitic rock , which seems to rise to the surface in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean in a calm after a storm . A great difference appeared to me to be observable between the minds and manners of the people among whom we were now travelling , and those of the people of the Sagar and Nerbudda territories . They seemed here to want the urbanity and intelligence we find among our subjects in the latter quarters . The apparent stupidity of the people when questioned upon points the most interesting to them , regarding their history , their agriculture , their tanks , and temples , was most provoking ; and their manners seemed to me more rude and clownish than those of people in any other part of India I had travelled over . I asked my little friend the Sarimant , who rode with me , what he thought of this . ' I think ' , said he , ' that it arises from the harsh character of the government under which they live ; it makes every man wish to appear a fool , in order that he may be thought a beggar and not worth the plundering . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their government has made them in reality the beggars and the fools that they appear to be . ' ' God only knows ' , said Sarimant ; ' certain it is that they are neither in mind nor in manners what the people of our districts are . ' The Raja had no notice of our approach till intimation of it reached him at Ludhaura , the day before we came in . He was there resting , and dismissing the people after the ceremonies of the marriage between the Salagram and the Tulasi . Ludhaura is twenty-seven miles north-west of Tehri , on the opposite side from that on which I was approaching . He sent off two men on camels with a ' kharita ' ( letter ) , 3 requesting that I would let him know my movements , and arrange a meeting in a manner that might prevent his appearing wanting in respect and hospitality ; that is , in plain terms , which he was too polite to use , that I would consent to remain one stage from his capital , till he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ceremony . These men reached me at Bamhauri , 4 a distance of thirty-nine miles , in the evening , and I sent back a kharita , which reached him by relays of camels before midnight . He set out for his capital to receive me , and , as I would not wait to be met half-way in due form , he reached his palace , and we reached our tents at the same time , under a salute from his two brass field-pieces . We halted at Tehri on the 9th , and about eleven o'clock the Raja came to pay his visit of congratulation , with a magnificent cortege of elephants , camels , and horses , all mounted and splendidly caparisoned , and the noise of his band was deafening . I had had both my tents pitched , and one of them handsomely fitted up , as it always is , for occasions of ceremony like the present . He came to within twenty paces of the door on his elephant , and from its back , as it sat down , he entered his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this vehicle he was brought to my tent door , where I received him , and , after the usual embraces , conducted him up through two rows of chairs , placed for his followers of distinction and my own , who are always anxious to assist in ceremonies like these . At the head of this lane we sat upon chairs placed across , and facing down the middle of the two rows ; and we conversed upon all the subjects usually introduced on such occasions , but more especially upon the august ceremonies of the marriage of the Salagram with the Tulasi , in which his highness had been so piously engaged at Ludhaura. 6 After he had sat with me an hour and a half he took his leave , and I conducted him to the door , whence he was carried to his elephant in his litter , from which he mounted without touching the ground . This litter is called a ' nalki ' . It is one of the three great insignia which the Mogul Emperors of Delhi conferred upon independent princes of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon whom , or upon whose ancestors , they had not been so conferred . These were the nalki , the order of the Fish , and the fan of the peacock 's feathers . These insignia could be used only by the prince who inherited the sovereignty of the one on whom they had been originally conferred . The order of the Fish , or Mahi Maratib , was first instituted by Khusru Parviz , King of Persia , and grandson of the celebrated Naushirvan the Just . Having been deposed by his general , Bahram , Khusru fled for protection to the Greek emperor , Maurice , whose daughter , Shirin , he married , and he was sent back to Persia , with an army under the command of Narses , who placed him on the throne of his ancestors in the year A.D. 591. 7 He ascertained from his astrologer , Araz Khushasp , that when he ascended the throne the moon was in the constellation of the Fish , and he gave orders to have two balls made of polished steel , which were to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long poles . These two planets , with large fish made of gold , upon a third pole in the centre , were ordered to be carried in all regal processions immediately after the king , and before the prime minister , whose cortege always followed immediately after that of the king . The two kaukabas are now generally made of copper , and plated , and in the shape of a jar , instead of quite round as at first ; but the fish is still made of gold . Two planets are always considered necessary to one fish , and they are still carried in all processions between the prince and his prime minister . The court of this prince Khusru Parviz was celebrated throughout the East for its splendour and magnificence ; and the chaste love of the poet Farhad for his beautiful queen Shirin is the theme of almost as many poems in the East as that of Petrarch 's for Laura is in the West . Nuh Samani , who ascended the throne of Persia after the Sassanians , 9 ascertained that the moon was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ordered that the gold head of a lion should thenceforward accompany the fishes , and the two balls , in all royal processions . The Persian order of knighthood is , therefore , that of the Fish , the Moon , and the Lion , and not the Lion and Sun , as generally supposed . The emperors of the house of Taimur in Hindustan assumed the right of conferring the order upon all whom they pleased , and they conferred it upon the great territorial sovereigns of the country without distinction as to religion . He only who inherits the sovereignty can wear the order , and I believe no prince would venture to wear or carry the order who was not generally reputed to have received the investiture from one of the emperors of Delhi. 10 As I could not wait another day , it was determined that I should return his visit in the afternoon ; and about four o'clock we set out upon our elephant  --  Lieutenant Thomas , Sarimant , and myself , attended by all my troopers and those of Sarimant . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sorry figure compared with the splendid cortege of the Raja . We dismounted at the foot of the stairs leading to the Raja 's hall of audience , and were there met by his two chief officers of state , who conducted us to the entrance of the hall , when we were received by the Raja himself , who led us up through two rows of chairs laid out exactly as mine had been in the morning . In front were assembled a party of native comedians , who exhibited a few scenes of the insolence of office in the attendants of great men , and the obtrusive importunity of place-seekers , in a manner that pleased us much more than a dance would have done . Conversation was kept up very well , and the visit passed off without any feeling of ennui , or anything whatever to recollect with regret . The ladies looked at us from their apartments through gratings , and without our being able to see them very distinctly . We were anxious to see the tombs of the late Raja , the elder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of his son , which are in progress in a very fine garden outside the city walls , and , in consequence , we did not sit above half an hour . The Raja conducted us to the head of the stairs , and the same two officers attended us to the bottom , and mounted their horses , and attended us to the tombs . After the dust of the town raised by the immense crowd that attended us , and the ceremonies of the day , a walk in this beautiful garden was very agreeable , and I prolonged it till dark . The Raja had given orders to have all the cisterns filled during our stay , under the impression that we should wish to see the garden ; and , as soon as we entered , the jets d'eau poured into the air their little floods from a hundred mouths . Our old cicerone told us that , if we would take the old capital of Orchha in our way , we might there see the thing in perfection , and amidst the deluges of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the lightning and hear the thunder . The Rajas of this , the oldest principality in Bundelkhand , were all formerly buried or burned at the old capital of Orchha , even after they had changed their residence to Tehri . These tombs over the ashes of the Raja , his wife , and son , are the first that have been built at Tehri , where their posterity are all to repose in future . Notes : 1 . December , 1835. 2 . The State of Orchha , also known as Tehri or Tikamgarh , situated to the south of the Jhansi district , is the oldest and the highest in rank of the Bundela principalities . The town of Tehri is seventy-two miles north-west of Sagar . The town of Orchha , founded in A.D. 1531 , is 131 miles north of Sagar , and about forty miles from Tehri . Tikamgarh is the fort of Tehri. 3 . A kharita is a letter enclosed in a bag of rich brocade , contained in another of fine muslin .

Khusru Parviz ( Eberwiz ) , or Khusru II , reigned as King of Persia from A.D. 591 to 628 . In the course of his wars he took Jerusalem , and reduced Egypt , and a large part of northern Africa , extending for a time the bounds of the Persian empire to the Aegean and the Nile . Khusru I , surnamed Naushirvan , or ( more correctly ) Anushirvan , reigned from A.D. 531 to 579 . His successful wars with the Romans and his vigorous internal administration captivated the Oriental imagination , and he is generally spoken of as Adil , or The Just . His name has become proverbial , and to describe a superior as rivalling Naushirvan in justice is a commonplace of flattery . The prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fact . The alleged expedition of Naushirvan into India is discredited by the best modern writers .

European authors have , until recently , generally written the name Khusru in its Greek form as Chosroes . The name of Shirin is also written Sira . ' With the name of Shirin and the rock of Bahistun the Persians have associated one of those poetic romances so dear to the national genius .

The causes which led to the sign of Sol in Leo becoming the arms of Persia can not be distinctly traced , but there is reason to believe that the use of this symbol is not of very great antiquity . We meet with it upon the coins of one of the Seljukian princes of Iconium ; and , when this family had been destroyed by Hulaku A.D. 1258 , the grandson of Chengiz , that prince , or his successors , perhaps adopted this emblem as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since among the most remarkable of the royal insignia . A learned friend , who has a valuable collection of Oriental coins , and whose information and opinion have enabled me to make this conjecture , believes that the emblematical representation of Sol in Leo was first adopted by Ghias-ud-din Kai Khusru bin Kaikobad , who began to reign A.H . 634 , A.D. 1236 , and died A.H . 642 , A.D. 1244 ; and this emblem , he adds , is supposed to have reference either to his own horoscope or to that of his queen , who was a princess of Georgia .

An English officer , who served with these troops , informs me that those on whom these medals have been conferred are very proud of this distinction , and that all are extremely anxious to obtain them ( History of Persia , ed. 1829 , vol. ii , p. 406 ) .

The present Raja , Mathura Das , succeeded his brother Bikramajit , who died in 1834 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Raja Bahadur , whom he almost adored ; but , the young man dying some years before him , the father resumed the reins of government , and held them till his death . He was a man of considerable capacity , but of a harsh and unscrupulous character . His son resembled him ; but the present Raja is a man of mild temper and disposition , though of weak intellect . The fate of the last three prime ministers will show the character of the Raja and his son , and the nature of their rule . The minister at the time the old man made over the reins of government to his son was Khanju Purohit. 1 Wishing to get rid of him a few years after , this son , Raja Bahadur , employed Muhram Singh , one of his feudal Rajput barons , to assassinate him . As a reward for this service he received the seals of office ; and the Raja confiscated all the property of the deceased , amounting to four lakhs of rupees2 and resumed the whole of the estates held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and his father , when he resumed the reins of government , wishing to remove the new minister , got him assassinated by Gambhir Singh , another feudal Rajput baron , who , as his reward , received in his turn the seals of office . This man was a most atrocious villain , and employed the public establishments of his chief to plunder travellers on the high road . In 1833 his followers robbed four men , who were carrying treasure to the amount of ten thousand rupees from Sagar to Jhansi through Tehri , and intended to murder them ; but , by the sagacity of one of the party , and a lucky accident , they escaped , made their way back to Sagar , and complained to the magistrate. 3 The4 minister discovered the nature of their burdens as they lodged at Tehri on their way , and sent after them a party of soldiers , with orders to put them in the bed of a rivulet that separated the territory of Orchha from that of the Jhansi Raja . One of the treasure party discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rivulet in a deep grass jungle , he threw down his bundle , dashed unperceived through the grass , and reached a party of travellers whom he saw ascending a hill about half a mile in advance . The myrmidons of the minister , when they found that one had escaped , were afraid to murder the others , but took their treasure . In spite of great obstacles , and with much danger to the families of three of those men , who resided in the capital of Tehri , the magistrate of Sagar brought the crime home to the minister , and the Raja , anxious to avail himself of the occasion to fill his coffers , got him assassinated . The Raja was then about eighty years of age , and his minister was a strong , athletic , and brave man . One morning while he was sitting with him in private conversation , the former pretended a wish to drink some of the water in which his household god had been washed ( the ' chandan mirt ' ) , 5 and begged the minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood by the side of the idol in the court of the palace . As a man can not take his sword before the idol , the minister put it down , as the Raja knew he would , and going to the idol , prostrated himself before it preparatory to taking away the water . In that state he was cut down by Bihari , 6 another feudal Rajput baron , who aspired to the seals , and some of his friends , who had been placed there on purpose by the Raja . He obtained the seals by his service , and , as he was allowed to place one brother in command of the forces , and to make another chamberlain , he hoped to retain them longer than any of his predecessors had done . Gambhir Singh 's brother , Jhujhar Singh , and the husband of his sister , hearing of his murder , made off , but were soon pursued and put to death . The widows were all three put into prison , and all the property and estates were confiscated . The movable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boasted to the Governor-General 's representative in Bundelkhand of this act of retributive justice , and pretended that it was executed merely as a punishment for the robbery ; but it was with infinite difficulty the merchants could recover from him any share of the plundered property out of that confiscated . The Raja alleged that , according to our rules , the chief within whose boundary the robbery might have been committed , was obliged to make good the property . On inspection , it was found that the robbery was perpetrated upon the very boundary line , and ' in spite of pride , in erring reason 's spite ' , the Jhansi Raja was made to pay one-half of the plundered treasure . The old Raja , Bikramajit , died in June , 1834 ; and , though his death had been some time expected , he no sooner breathed his last than charges of ' dinai ' , slow poison , were got up , as usual , in the zenana ( seraglio ) . Here the widow of Raja Bahadur , a violent and sanguinary woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a weak old man , to take advantage of the funeral ceremonies to avenge the death of his brother . He did so ; and Bihari , and his three brothers , with above fifty of his relations , were murdered . The widows of the four brothers were the only members of all the families left alive . One of them had a son four months old ; another one of two years ; the four brothers had no other children . Immediately after the death of their husbands , the two children were snatched from their mothers ' breasts , and threatened with instant death unless their mothers pointed out all their ornaments and other property . They did so ; and the spoilers having got from them property to the amount of one hundred and fifty thousand rupees , and been assured that there was no more , threw the children over the high wall , by which they were dashed to pieces . The poor widows were tendered as wives to four sweepers , the lowest of all low castes ; but the tribe of sweepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widows of men of such high caste and station as wives , notwithstanding the tempting offer of five hundred rupees as a present , and a village in rent-free tenure. 8 I secured a promise while at Tehri that these poor widows should be provided for , as they had , up to that time , been preserved by the good feeling of a little community of the lowest of castes , on whom they had been bestowed as a punishment worse than death , inasmuch as it would disgrace the whole class to which they belonged , the Parihar Rajputs. 9 Tehri is a wretched town , without one respectable dwelling-house tenanted beyond the palace , or one merchant , or even shopkeeper of capital and credit . There are some tolerable houses unoccupied and in ruins ; and there are a few neat temples built as tombs , or cenotaphs , in or around the city , if city it can be called . The stables and accommodations for all public establishments seem to be all in the same ruinous state as the dwelling-houses . The revenues of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds ; and in such idle ceremonies as those at which the Raja and all his court have just been assisting  --  ceremonies which concentrate for a few days the most useless of the people of India , the devotee followers ( Bairagis ) of the god Vishnu , and tend to no purpose , either useful or ornamental , to the state or to the people . This marriage of a stone to a shrub , which takes place every year , is supposed to cost the Raja , at the most moderate estimate , three lakhs of rupees a year , or one-fourth of his annual revenue. 10 The highest officers of which his government is composed receive small beggarly salaries , hardly more than sufficient for their subsistence ; and the money they make by indirect means they dare not spend like gentlemen , lest the Raja might be tempted to take their lives in order to get hold of it . All his feudal barons are of the same tribe as himself , that is , Rajputs ; but they are divided into three clans  - -  Bundelas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry a woman of his own clan , he must take a wife from the Pawars or Chandels ; and so of the other two clans  --  no member of one can take a wife from his own clan , but must go to one of the other two for her . They are very much disposed to fight with each other , but not less are they disposed to unite against any third party , not of the same tribe . Braver men do not , I believe , exist than the Rajputs of Bundelkhand , who all carry their swords from their infancy. 11 It may be said of the Rajputs of Malwa and Central India generally , that the Mogul Emperors of Delhi made the same use of them that the Emperors of Germany and the Popes made of the military chiefs and classes of Europe during the Middle Ages . Industry and the peaceful arts being reduced to agriculture alone under bad government or no government at all , the land remained the only thing worth appropriating ; and it accordingly became appropriated by those alone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military classes collected around the heads of their clans , and powerful in their union . These held it under the paramount power on the feudal tenure of military service , as militia ; or it was appropriated by the paramount power itself , who let it out on allodial tenure to peaceful peasantry . The one was the Zamindari , and the other the Malguzari tenure of India. 12 The military chiefs , essentially either soldiers or robbers , were continually fighting , either against each other , or against the peasantry , or public officers of the paramount power , like the barons of Europe ; and that paramount power , or its delegates , often found that the easiest way to crush one of these refractory vassals was to put him , as such men had been put in Germany , to the ban of the empire , and offer his lands , his castles , and his wealth to the victor . This victor brought his own clansmen to occupy the lands and castles of the vanquished ; and , as these were the only things thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction of the former occupants . The new possessors gave the name of their leader , their clan , or their former place of abode , to their new possession , and the tract of country over which they spread . Thus were founded the Bundelas , Pawars , and Chandels sic upon the ruin of the Chandels of Bundelkhand , the Baghelas in Baghelkhand , or Riwa , the Kachhwahas , the Sakarwars , and others along the Chambal river , and throughout all parts of India. 13 These classes have never learnt anything , or considered anything worth learning , but the use of the sword ; and a Rajput chief , next to leading a gang of his own on great enterprises , delights in nothing so much as having a gang or two under his patronage for little ones . There is hardly a single chief of the Hindoo military class in the Bundelkhand or Gwalior territories , who does not keep a gang of robbers of some kind or other , and consider it as a very valuable and legitimate source of revenue ; or who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of assassins by profession who should bring him home from every expedition a good horse , a good sword , or a valuable pair of shawls , taken from their victims . It is much the same in the kingdom of Oudh , where the lands are for the most part held by the same Hindoo military classes , who are in a continual state of war with each other , or with the Government authorities . Three-fourths of the recruits for native infantry regiments are from this class of military agriculturists of Oudh , who have been trained up in this school of contest ; and many of the lads , when they enter our ranks , are found to have marks of the cold steel upon their persons . A braver set of men is hardly anywhere to be found ; or one trained up with finer feelings of devotion towards the power whose salt they eat. 14 A good many of the other fourth of the recruits for our native infantry are drawn from among the Ujaini Rajputs , or Rajputs from Ujain , 15 who were established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank of the Ganges. 16 Notes : 1 .

The numerous clans , more or less devoted to war , grouped together under the name of Rajputs ( literally ' king 's sons ' ) , are in reality of multifarious origin , and include representatives of many races . They are the Kshatriyas of the law-books , and are still often called Chhattri ( E.H.I. , 3rd ed. , pp. 407-15 ) . In some parts of the country the word Thakur is more familiar as their general title . Thirty-six clans are considered as specially pure-blooded and are called , at any rate in books , the ' royal races ' . All the clans follow the custom of exogamy .
