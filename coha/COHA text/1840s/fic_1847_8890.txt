EDITORIAL INTRODUCTION . It requires a most rare combination of abilities to write a play that shall not only satisfy the demands of a rigorous literary taste , but , at the same time , in the more mechanical construction of plot and invention of incident , possess those qualities which shall make it pleasing in the representation to a modern undience . A union of the meditative with the worldly-practical and active faculties , would seem to be required to insure this species of success ; and the author of this beautiful play is one of the few who have achieved it . Judged either as a dramatic or a literary production , " Love 's Sacrifice " may be pronounced worthy of the most palmy days of the English drama . The sketches of character are spirited and well defined . Lafont is a jewel of a villain , and affords great scope for the genius of an actor , although a part in which little applause can be won . Jean Ruse , the unfortunate clerk , carries much of the humor of the piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The best genteel comedian will find a congenial part in St. Lo ; while in Matthew Elmore the " heavy tragedian " of a company will recognize a character calculated to task all his powers . The two principal female characters are pleasing and well contrasted . Herminie is a life-like picture of a gay , self-possessed , young widow , who knows her power over the opposite sex , and exercises it . Margaret is all that is lovely in her relations of daughter ; and the sympathies of ninety-nine persons in a hundred will go with her in her mediated " sacrifice . " But to our mind , she is wrong in consenting for a moment to marry Lafont . A woman may abstain from matrimony in order to serve a parent ; but in consenting to wed a man , whom she detests , she is deeply criminal . No plea can justify such an act , any more than it could justify an act of legally unsanctioned prostitution . But in the case of Margaret , the heart will excuse her , though the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defect in her character , constitute a defect in the play . We should not look for " perfect monsters , which the world ne'er saw , " in heroes and heroines . " Love 's Sacrifice " was first performed at the Covent Garden . Theatre , London , Sept. 12th , 1842 . Its success was unequivocal . The Matthew Elmore of Mr. Vandenhoff is said to have been " finely conceived and nobly sustained " ; while his daughter 's Margaret was " feminine gentleness wrought upon by stern necessity , and sublimed by duty and affection . " For some inexplicable reason , this play has not yet received the attention from managers in this country , which its undisputed merits entitle it to . It can afford , however , to bide its time . It can not be displaced , by the apathy of either actors or managers , from its rank among the best acting plays of the age . In the gradual addition of such pieces as this to our limited stock of dramatic productions of a high and pure order , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accelerating the dawn of that era , when the abhorred and utterly superfluous abuses now connected with the theatre shall be abolished , in the indignant veto of all true lovers of the beautiful in art . We believe that public opinion is fast maturing towards that point when such abolition will be universally and conclusively demanded ; and that the time is near at hand when the manager who shall venture to brave the just and enlightened anger of the community , by contaminating an institution designed for good ends with unhallowed associations , and vile , collateral subsidiaries to speculation , excrescent and monstrous , shall receive the reward of his opposition to reform in empty benches and the undisguised disapprobation of the humblest upholder of the drama .

St. Lo . Saint Lo And how replied your fancy ? Eug . Eugene de Lorme With a sigh ! A father !  --  Oh ! there is a magic charm In the mere name of kindred , other words Can not supply !  --  How I have stood and watched When Elmore gazed upon his daughter 's face , While their souls seemed to cling about each other , And from their eyes , like two opposing mirrors , The images received were given back , Again to be returned , again reflected , In endless interchange :  --  but upon me His calm and chastened smile , though ever kind , Is cold and saddened , too . Yet both are love  --  That  --  the proud father 's fondness for his child ; This  --  the good man 's compassion for the orphan . St. Lo . Saint Lo Oh , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a like compassion upon me ! I would not quarrel with his looks . Inquire If Elmore wants another protg !

Then look at me !  --  I 'll go and woo your sister More hotly now than ever .  --  Follow me ! And , as I prosper , make me your example . Eug . Eugene de Lorme laughing . You an example ! St. Lo .

Herminie de Vermont Choice ! Give a maid a choice ! The good man doats ! Why , ev'n a widow scarcely gets as much ! Oh , this is heresy against all custom ! Elm . Matthew Elmore Then we will make new customs , Herminie . If I would buy my child a house , a horse , A trinket , bauble  --  should I not consult Her taste on what would pleasure her ? And yet Might each be soon exchanged , if she disliked it . Or if I would bring home some youthful friend As her companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice in what should be The character of that selected friend ? Yet might she snap at will the slender tie .

ACT II . Scene I.  --  A Court before Elmore 's House . Enter Eugene De Lorme from the House , L. F. Eug . Eugene de Lorme I can not stay within ! It drives me mad To see them clustering round her , and to hear Their glib tongues chattering their shallow vows ; While I , who love her with a depth of love That might engulph them all , can speak no word , But stifle in my fulness . They can offer  --  Ay , even the meanest  --  rank and wealth ; while I Have less than nothing ; for whate'er I have Is filched from stores that else were all her own . O poverty , gaunt poverty !

Alone , too : that is well . But why this sunken aspect ? Does he feel The enervating bond that circles him ? Is nature true , in spite of circumstance ? Does subtle instinct rise , and bid him hate The hand from which he feeds ? Eug . Eugene de Lorme Perceiving him . Your blessing , father . Desire you aught in which you may be furthered By one who has some influence in this house ? Friar . Friar Dominic Aside . Some influence in this house ! He boasts his thraldom ! His thoughts are sunk and abject as his state . Peace to Eugene  --  the nameless ! Going , R. Eug . Eugene de Lorme Stay , good friar ! Advances , L. To know me as Eugene , at least should argue An equal knowledge of that other title My ancestors bequeathed . I am not nameless , But called Eugene de Lorme . Friar . Friar Dominic Fie , fie , young braggart ! I knew De Lorme , whom thou wouldst claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haughty soul , And pride untameable : his boiling blood Could never so cool down in one remove , As with this sluggish pace to creep content In a dependent 's veins . Eug . Eugene de Lorme Dependent , sir !  --  You say you knew my father : knew you , too , His early death  --  my orphaned infancy  --  The doubtful guardianship that seized my means ? Friar . Friar Dominic Something of this , too , reached my distant convent . But when its business called me here to Paris , And I sought out the children of my friend , I thought to find a stubborn courage striving With an opposing fate ; and ready , like The olden giants , to tear from their bases Even rocks and mountains , so they might pile up A road to reach the persecuting gods . Eug . Eugene de Lorme I pray you , mock not thus my helpless state . Perhaps my nature owns a higher flight , But I have had my pinions early clipped , And have been made familiar with the perch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but an eagle , Hatch it where'er you may . Could a De Lorme Believe that he was wronged , yet calmly leave The wrong unchallenged ? Eug . Eugene de Lorme What could I effect Against my guardian 's wealth ? Friar . Friar Dominic What hast thou tried ? Nothing ! Oh , thou rare puppet for these knaves To play with !  --  Of endurance past belief ! But , stalled and crammed to drowsy lethargy , How could I think a common wrong could move thee ? When even thy father 's murder can not stir Thy sluggish phlegm : but his assassin roves The world , unsought for ! Eug . Eugene de Lorme Not so , sir . The man Who took my father 's life  --  the Count du Barr  --  Scarcely survived his victim . Friar . Friar Dominic Who says so ? Eug . Eugene de Lorme The ship in which he fled from human justice , Was tracked by the divine ; and on her way Foundered and sank . Friar . Friar Dominic Who tells thee so , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friar . Friar Dominic I 'll bring thee new report , Better than common ! I have travelled much , And I report to thee , Du Barr lives ! Eug . Eugene de Lorme Where ? Friar . Friar Dominic Not too distant for a son 's revenge , Though ' t were at the antipodes . Eug . Eugene de Lorme Yet where ? Friar . Friar Dominic Tush ! what imports it thee ? Thou darest not seek him . Eug . Eugene de Lorme I dare not ! Who shall stay me ? Friar . Friar Dominic Who ? Thy patron  --  Thy merchant patron ! That same crafty trader , Who tames so cunningly the noble 's blood . Eug . Eugene de Lorme Thou would'st not speak of Elmore ! Friar . Friar Dominic Ay , of Elmore  --  The subtle , specious Elmore . Eug . Eugene de Lorme Turning away . Then thou'rt mad ! Friar . Friar Dominic Not mad , thou doting boy ! And yet I say , The crafty Elmore  --  he whose subtle arts Have wound their numbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palsied . His seeming bounties are but tricks  --  Eug . Eugene de Lorme Hold , sir ! Advances rapidly and firmly . Though your words sorted ill with a profession Which teaches pardon , not revenge of wrongs , I yet endured your speech so far unchecked , Because you called yourself my father 's friend . But now I tell thee , he whose venomed lip Slanders with but a breath the name of Elmore , Grows , from that moment , to my enemy . Friar . Friar Dominic Infatuated boy ! Eug . Eugene de Lorme Peace , peace , I say ! Some foe of mine has set you on to this , To rob me of my last remaining prop . Friar . Friar Dominic Wilt thou be blind to proof ? Eug . Eugene de Lorme I tell thee , monk , Though that which seemed to my own sense most just , Were backed by every other tongue on earth , With Elmore 's only to the contrary , I would call Elmore right , and all the world , With my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past cure , Of all but sharp experience ; and to that I 'll leave thee . Thou wilt one day learn thine error , And know me better . We shall meet again . Exit , R. Eug . Eugene de Lorme Better ! I know thee now , and well enough ; I know thee for a busy , meddling monk  --  Some agent of Lafont 's . ' T is like his art ! And yet he railed against my guardian , too ! A cloak !  --  a cloak to hide the deeper purpose ! Yet part he said was truth  --  I am too sluggish  --  Submit too grossly to the worst of wrongs , Elmore appears on steps of House , C. , looking off , R. And live content in ignominious ease , Till e'en a stranger feels a right to taunt me With biting comments . I will speak with Elmore , And he shall guide me . Yes , I 'll speak with Elmore . Eugene turns up and meets Elmore , who is slowly advancing , L. Elm . Matthew Elmore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find thee thus Shunning society , to brood alone On thoughts that do not make me their companion ? I deemed thy heart was mine . Eug . Eugene de Lorme ( R. ) And so it is : Alas ! ' t is all I have to offer you , That was not yours before it was my own ! Oh , Elmore , I am far too much your debtor ! The weight of obligation bows me down . I can not meet with independent brow The bold eyes of the world , where every man Is rightful heir or maker of his means , And holds them without blushing . I alone Live upon sufferance  --  on charity ! Elm . Matthew Elmore What phantasy is this ? Who tells thee so ? Eug . Eugene de Lorme All I encounter  --  all look down upon me ! The harsh with scorn , the gentle with compassion ; Yet still all do look down  --  and some proud blood Which I inherit , prouder than my fortunes , Rebels against it . Elm . Matthew Elmore What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right myself , and call my plunderer To an account . Elm . Matthew Elmore Tut , tut , thou silly boy ! Canst thou believe a puny arm like thine Could shake Lafont ? Eug . Eugene de Lorme Ay , in a righteous quarrel ! There lies a hidden strength in a just cause , That nothing can resist . The Syracusan Boasted , had he but where to fix his lever , He 'd move the earth :  --  a righteous cause does more  --  Fixed on the earth , it sways the heaven itself , And bows it to his aid . Elm . Matthew Elmore No more , no more ! I will not hear of this . What wouldst thou ask More that thou hast ? What is there thou couldst win From Paul Lafont , that Elmore has denied thee ? What have I left undone ? I 've grudged thee nothing , Have lavished freely on thee every pleasure The pulse of youth could pant for ; have allowed thee Means without limit : say , what is there more I still can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eugene de Lorme Nothing : I ask not bounty , but my rights . Oh , Elmore , pause are you forbid my efforts ! Reflect how thus , to a censorious world , You seem to cast a shield over my foes , And draw suspicion even on yourself . Elm . Matthew Elmore Suspicion ! what suspicion ? What is this ? Who has been tampering with thee ? Oh , my child ! As thou wouldst prize thy young heart 's dearest peace , Guard from thy breast that moral pestilence ! Suspicion , like the fabled upas , blights All healthy life , and makes a desert round it . " Nothing so fair , nothing so pure can live , But by suspicion may be marred and blasted ; No path so straight , but to suspicion 's eye Looks tortuous and bent from its true end ; Away with it !  --  We know it not in youth , When we come freshest from the hand of heaven . It is an earth-engendered monster , springing From the rank slime of our polluted years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , A thousand times deceived , than wrongly once Wound with ungenerous doubt the breast of truth ! Elm . Matthew Elmore Then why  --  Eug . Eugene de Lorme Impatiently . Why ?  --  Boy , must I lay bare to thee My merchant heart , and show its hidden weakness ? Canst thou not see , without express confession , That peace is necessary to the trade By which I live ?  --  that I must not make foes , And least of all of men like this Lafont ; Whose cunning , wealth , connexions , influence  --  Eug . Eugene de Lorme Stay ! This is the first time I have ever heard A selfish word issue from Elmore 's lips ; And I would spare myself the shame to think I forced it from him  --  Elm . Matthew Elmore Boy  --  unfeeling boy ! Thou dost not know my state . In the world 's crowd I stand alone  --  an isolated man Amidst a land of strangers . True , I have Dependents , flatterers , needy hangers-on : " But yet , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a man of them , whose eager eye Keeps not a jealous watch upon my steps : There is not one whose heart would not rejoice To see me stumble on my dizzy height , Because I am a stranger , and have grown To wealth beyond their own . " I have a child , too , Whose tender helplessness I must protect  --  Eug . Eugene de Lorme No more  --  no more , sir .  --  Call me satisfied :  --  I blush to think I should have moved you thus . Elm . Matthew Elmore Dost think I ask thee to forego thy right For my advantage ?  --  Name the utmost sum Thou deem'st thy guardian has withheld from thee  --  Calculate freely  --  give thy fancy rein  --  And if it lie within my farthest means  --  Eug . Eugene de Lorme What do you think me , Elmore ? Elm . Matthew Elmore Nothing worse Than all the world .  --  There was a time , Eugene , I thought thee something better . " Do I pain thee ?  --  Nay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peevish  --  I know I am  --  but there are things that vex me Beyond my calmer self  --  and this is one . Give me thy hand ! So  --  we are friends again . And now , as I refused thee a request  --  I think for the first time  --  find out some other With which I may content thee . Do not fear To ask a large one  --  for I doubt if now There rests that thing I own upon the earth Which thou canst ask , and I deny to thee . " Come  --  thou hast still a wish ! Eug . Eugene de Lorme Hesitating . I have . Elm . Matthew Elmore Smiling . I knew it ! " Aside . His timid love shrinks even from the sound Of its own breath ! but Margaret 's heart already Has heard and answered it . " Aloud .

Matthew Elmore No  --  But once To-day we met before  --  and then he stopped And whispered one beside him  --  when his eye Shot such a glance on mine , that the quick instinct Which wakes antipathies within our blood , Told me he was a man to shun . Eug . Eugene de Lorme That 's strange ! For he declared himself my father 's friend . Elm . Matthew Elmore A trick to win thy confidence ! Eug . Eugene de Lorme And said , Du Barr , the assassin of my father , Still lived  --  Elm . Matthew Elmore Ha !  --  What !  --  Du Barr lived !  --  Thou'rt mad ! A thousand tongues will certify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , what is't to thee ! Is it for thee to snatch the hangman 's office ? How canst thou tell what bitter provocation May have impelled the deed ? Eug . Eugene de Lorme Shall provocation Be found to justify a murder ? Elm . Matthew Elmore Thou Thyself : Dost thou not seek a life  --  and what hast thou To plead but provocation ? Eug . Eugene de Lorme Blood for blood ! A murdered father to his child bequeaths A holy legacy in his revenge . Elm . Matthew Elmore Fie ! fie ! Shall twenty years not quench this thirst ? I thought I had reared thee better . " Thou , who own'st All blessings that affection can heap on thee , Canst thou not rest content in their enjoyment , Unless thou may'st hunt down a wretched outcast , Proscribed of all the world  --  who , if he lives , As they would have thee think  --  lives steeped in fears , Listening in terror to each passing sound By the light car of innocence unheeded ?

To feel the curse of Cain upon thy steps  --  To meet the blood-glazed eye in every object  --  To hear the dying groan in every sound ? For years  --  years  --  years  --  to start from restless sleep . And find the phantom standing by thy bed ? Go where thou wilt , to bear about with thee A hidden wolf gnawing thy shrinking entrails  --  Eug . Eugene de Lorme Hold  --  hold !  --  The passion of these burning words Curdles my blood  --  Elm . Matthew Elmore Passion !  --  no , boy  --  not passion . I am calm  --  quite calm .  --  I did but reason with thee As of an unknown wretch , whose state might ask More pity than abhorrence . Eug . Eugene de Lorme Let him live ! A life like this is penalty enough . Elm . Matthew Elmore Ha ! That 's my own Eugene again ! This Friar Shall miss his aim . Eug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ay , this Friar !  --  " Dost thou not see he thought , by setting thee On some vain , endless quest , to sever us ?

I will not think of him  --  and yet ' t is strange ! Resumes book . Eug . Eugene de Lorme to Mar . Marvellous art  --  and marvellously plied ! To watch those fairy fingers rove the canvass ; They show like Flora 's footsteps through the fields , Dropping a flower at every touch .

Or flowers or hearts droop first . A thousand buds , Perfumed with sweetness , ere the summer ends , Shall wither , fade , and fall  --  while these fair fictions Shall never die . Mar . Margaret Smiling . Because they never lived ! A barren boast . I would not wear my heart Upon such dull conditions to secure A life of centuries ! All that is bright Trembles in quick and sensitive vibration  --  All that is beautiful moves to a change .

I am beat back From household consultations  --  plans of pleasure  --  Matters of grave debate  --  all are pushed by For some new speculation on this Friar ! Nay , even when , as now , I listen to The prettiest common-places love can utter , In comes your Friar again , and scatters all To the unpitying winds ! Retires up , L. Elm . Matthew Elmore Well , well : ' t is folly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangely . Hast never seen a face you could be sworn You 'd met before  --  yet know not when nor how ? It might be in a dream , so vaguely floats The memory of it : yet , if such it were , It was a painful dream . A face that wakes More an impression than a recollection : Such is that Friar 's face to me . I felt it When first I met him .  --  Next I found him busy Tampering with the quiet of my house  --  And now I trace him to the doors of one Whom many circumstances tempt to be My active enemy .  --  At least ' t is strange ! Enter Servant , L. Ser . Servant Monsieur Lafont , sir , waits below , and prays The favour of a private interview . Elm . Matthew Elmore Starting up . Lafont !

Come , love ! But keep within his call . Exit , R. , leading out Mar. , who continues to look back , anxiously watching her father . Elm . Matthew Elmore After walking about irresolutely flings himself into a chair . Well , sir ? Laf . Paul Lafont My friend Forgets his ordinary courtesy . Elmore points to a chair , and turns his head away Will you forgive me  --  I 've a foolish habit That , when I talk , I like to see the faces Of those I talk with . Humour me so far ! Elm .

Elm . Matthew Elmore I do . Laf . Paul Lafont It seems This Friar knew his father  --  Count De Lorme  --  In Brittany  --  was it not strange ? Elm . Matthew Elmore ' T is likely Many in Brittany knew Count de Lorme . Laf . Paul Lafont True  --  very true . But then this worthy Friar Told all his history with such minuteness ! He knew Du Barr , too  --  and he repeated How they both loved one lady  --  but her friends Gave her De Lorme.  --  You really do n't attend ! Elm . Matthew Elmore I have told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lafont And then he added , How , after marriage , dear De Lorme grew jealous Of Count Du Barr 's interest with his wife  --  ' T was said not without cause . Elm . Matthew Elmore Starting up . ' T was false as hell ! And she as pure as angels fresh from heaven ! Laf . Paul Lafont You knew her , then ? Elm . Matthew Elmore Checking himself . I have heard her history : And manly sympathy may well protect The reputation of an injured woman  --  Still more , the sacred honour of her grave . Laf . Paul Lafont Hm ! That 's so generous , so charitable ! I love you for it so ! I do , indeed . Ay , as you say , the poor young lady died In bearing our Eugene :  --  on which , Du Barr Distracted , let us hope , by this new grief , Turned all his rage on the bereaved De Lorme . They met one night upon the river 's bank  --  Elm . starts . You need not stir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; And there Du Barr stabbed him to the heart , And flung him in the stream to hide the murder .

Elm . Matthew Elmore What then ? The tale is common on a thousand lips  --  What wonder I have heard it , too ? What wonder My version differs somewhat from your own ? Laf . Paul Lafont Hm ! Oh , no wonder . Yet Du Barr fled ; He might be innocent , though , notwithstanding  --  But most thought otherwise ; and the law judged him , And sentenced him to meet a felon 's death , If ever he were found  --  How pale you look ! This moves you very much ! Elm . Matthew Elmore Gasping . No  --  no  --  go on ! Laf . Paul Lafont You know , my dearest friend , how much I love you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late decision ! Give me leave again To plead my suit with lovely Margaret , And lend your voice to help me ! Wo n't you , Elmore ? Elm . Matthew Elmore As before . What 's this to me , or Margaret ? Laf . Paul Lafont Hm ! The Friar  --  How very strange he should have come to me , Who am so much your friend !  --  he says Du Barr Still lives , in spite of his reported loss  --  Lives here in France , under another name ; That he has much to make life precious to him  --  Great wealth , and a young , lovely , helpless daughter . He says that now this murderer  --  this felon  --  This out law , with a price set upon his head  --  This count du Barr  --  is called  --  Matthew Elmore !

Paul Lafont Do n't take it so to heart  --  your tears distress me ! They grieve me very much  --  they do , indeed ! It 's true your father murdered  --  that is , slew  --  The gentleman ; for , after all , in fairness , Perhaps it should not be called murder  --  may be , A duel , without witnesses  --  Mar . Margaret looking up . It might ! They rise , and come forward . Lafont , at least I thank thee for that hope . Hope ! Oh , that I must seek my hope in that Which is but guilt a little less uncommon ! Laf . Paul Lafont And yet one would be glad to think it so . It 's always pleasant to believe the best , When our friends err . It 's true that the stern law  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can not Feel as we feel , who love the criminal )  --  The law decreed it murder , and condemned him To death ! Mar . Margaret He was judged unheard ! How knew they What provocation drove him to the deed  --  What wrong received purged it of half its guilt ! Oh , had they heard him , what now seems offence , Necessitated by the strong occasion , Might then have shown like virtue . Laf . Paul Lafont So it might  --  Yes , certainly , it might . It was a pity , A thousand pities , that he fled . You know That really looked so very much like guilt  --  It did , indeed  --  you must admit it did . Margaret buries her face in despair . He might have else even escaped suspicion , For no one saw the deed itself . ' T was known That he and the slain man were enemies , And they had met that night ; but nothing more .

But then , you see , your father took to flight ; Was met , unluckily , with clothes all stained , And eyes wild staring with remorse and horror . They tracked him to the coast , where he took ship For England :  --  really , now , this hardly looked Like innocence ! Mar . Margaret who has been writhing with agony , starts up . Who was the murdered man ? Lives there a wife and children , whose deep wrong Cries for revenge  --  whose pardon may be bought With such weak recompense as gold can offer For such a loss ? They shall have all we own . From hence I 'll live on crusts  --  I 'll be their servant , Their drudge , their slave  --  an humble , willing slave , So they but spare my father ! " Tell me all .

Mar . Margaret I think I understand  --  yet I am dull  --  Let me be quite assured . My father 's guilt , then , As yet is unsuspected , save by you And one beside , whose tutored tongue , you say , Speaks or keeps silence as you may direct ? Laf .

They may have told , perhaps , How one I hated wedded one I loved , But none could ever tell thee how I loved her  --  The wild , the maddening passion  --  let it pass ! Perhaps she answered to it :  --  he , at least , Who won her , thought so  --  till his jealous doubts Reproached her innocence .

Matthew Elmore It was the night Fixed for her burial  --  and I sat alone : I was not mad , for I had consciousness , And knew my desolation . The deep toll Of the loud convent bell , with measured stroke , Fell on my ear , till its repeated sound Gnawed , like a living thing , upon my brain . And then there came the flat and heavy tread Of those who bore her  --  they must pass my house ; Convulsed , I started up and fled !  --  Close by , Sullen and black  --  tempting to thoughts as dark  --  The plashing river lay . I neared its bank  --  Perhaps with sinful purpose  --  ay , thou tremblest  --  But sinful thoughts , indulged , bring sinful acts Before unthought of .

"  --  I fled , And knew not whither , till I found myself In a strange land , with strangers gathered round me : And there was one who watched and pitied me , Pouring the balm of woman 's tenderness Upon my bruisd spirit , till I grew To love her  --  not as I had loved before , But with the quiet of a calm affection That leaned upon her soothing gentleness , As on a place of rest from my ' scaped shipwreck : She was thy mother , child  --  Mar . Margaret Sighing . Go on , go on . Elm . Matthew Elmore But blood was spilt , and the avenger 's wing Hovered above my house . It was on her That the blow fell : she drooped , and she , too , died ; But still her memory remained in thee . Oh , how I prayed to have thee spared to me ! How watched , how toiled for thee ! My prayer was heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My child was spared , That I might see her , now , shrink from my sight , And shudder at my touch ! Mar .
