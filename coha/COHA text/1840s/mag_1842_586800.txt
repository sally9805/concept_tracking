txt THE volume before ns is a kind of natural history of the German student . In many other books , of a more or less recent date , we find descriptions of the singularities which characterize that peculiar variety of youths , written en passant , by the tourist , on his way from Rotterdam to Switzerland , or from Strasbourg to Berlin . But Mr. Howitt , the author of this volume , is the first writer who visited Germany with a view to study the customs and manners of the German student , and to publish the result of * The Student-Life of Germany : by William Howitt , author of " The Rural Life of England , " " Book of the Seasons , " &amp;c. , from the unpublished MS. of Dr. Corneius , containing nearly forty of the most famous Student Songs . Philadelphia : Carey &amp; Hart . // his observations . A countryman of ours , it is true , has preceded him in publishing , under the title of " Morton 's Hope , " a kind of biographical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero at the University of Gottingen . In this work we see the student as he was some years ago , in a series of tableaux par lants , full of the liveliest interest , and perfectly true to nature . But the present is the first methodical descriptive work which , to our knowledge , was ever published on the subject , not only in the English , but in any language . To him who reads with a wish to get positive and credible information , we can recommend it ; we might even recommend it to those who seek more for entertainment than instruction , if we were altogether satisfied that great part of the pleasure which we derived from its perusal is not to be ascribed to our own recollections . The name of " German student " awakens in the minds of most readers a confused idea of duels , beer drinking , extravagant dress . es , porcelain and meershaum pipes , fair hair hanging down the shoulders , and mustachios as dense and as long as possible . It is in connexion with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described in conversation . Being known only by his follies and extravagances , he is considered as a kind of semibarbarian , who obstinately preserves the gross manners of former times , amid all the changes daily taking place in civilized society . Nor is this opinion altogether unfounded ; it can not be denied that the manners which characterize the younger members of the German High Schools belong much more to the barbarous times of the Thirty-years War than to the fourth decennium of the nineteenth century . But are not also in the English universities . to be found remnants of former times l A little attention will show that both Cambridge and Oxford have remained much more stationary since the Reformation , than Gottingen and Heidelberg , though the English student dresses like a gentleman , without aiming at singularity ; though he neither fights regular duels , nor smokes pipes in the street , nor frequents beer-houses . The difference between the German universities , and the English , of which our own are more or less close imitations , we can scarcely attempt to exhibit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be summed up in the following words : In Germany the students enjoy an almost unrestrained liberty with regard to their conduct and studies . They may select among the numerous professors , or lecturers , those whom they prefer ; they live in private houses according to their means and tastes , provided they attend each term two or three courses of lectures , on any subject of the faculty to which they belong ; // March , Pie Student-Life of Germany . no one inquires how they employ their time ; provided they do not disturb the public order , no one interferes with their conduct , moral or religious . They do not acknowledge any authority but the academical laws ; they act like men of full age ; like citizens of a free country . In England it is quite the contrary . Each student belongs to some one college , where he has to take a room , and where he is placed under the care of a tutor . He is treated like a minor , with regard to his studies as well as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the common ball , goes to church when the bell rings , and must retire to his cell at certain hours . At the first glance , few fathers , if they had to choose , would give a preference to the German universities . The dangers which they present are obvious . But an attentive consideration would soon change their opinion . The final result of the great freedom which the German student enjoys can not but be a beneficial one . True , being left to himself with regard to his studies , as well as conduct , he may lose time and squander money . But , on the other hand , his character will not be debased , because , acting always in open daylight , he never loses his self-esteem . He has never to resort to secrecy , in indulging in his amusements . He sings in the streets , visits his beerknipe and public gardens at all hours of the day , sinokes on his way from his chamber to the lecturing-room , and his pipe is lying by his inkhorn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to the professor . His parents and the professors are acquainted with his conduct , the follies of which are known and winked at as necessary ebullitions of youth . And experience has indeed shown that the most wild and extravagant student , acting thus without restraint , very soon becomes weary of a noisy life , of the tyranny of those connexions to which he has to submit ; and in most cases , his conduct of the second year will be as good , as it was agitated the preceding one . Yet , it must seem that , being left entirely to his own guidance , he loses time , and on the day of his leaving the university , is but insufficiently prepared for the part which he has to play in the society of which he becomes a member . And so it would be , if a young man who is his own master at the age of twenty years , in a small city , where , after all , the most fearful dangers are unknown , were left to the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be supposed that the better feelings , of which he brought a rich store with him from the parental house , will either prevent him from being misled , or lead him again into the right path if he happens to deviate from it l Does not the imnge of the sober approbation of his father , the love-smile of his mo // ther , the wish to be worthy of a virtuous sister-do not these , and similar feelings , watch over him as guardian angels ? And should not his heart prevent his being wrecked in the storms of the dangerous sea on which he is floating , his reason will warn him in time to resort to the life-boat before all hope is lost . He knows that his station in society , his success in life , depend entirely upon the knowledge he acquires at the university . He knows that no one will consult him as a physician , or as a lawyer , merely because he has spent three or four years at the university ; he knows that before he can get any situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it is especially his preparation for the university which guards him against its dangers at the same time as it enables him to be benefited by the education he there receives . Before going to the university , he has been disciplined in the gymnasium , where he is as closely watched as he might be under the eye of his father . Here nothing is left to his own choice ; his amusements as well as his studies are carefully regulated by his superiors . Here he goes through a long trial , in which his talents , his disposition for study , and his moral character show themselves every day : if they are not satisfactory , he will never reach the university . Before leaving the gymnasium , he has to pass a severe examination , which must decide the question of his admission or rejection . The wish to increase the number of pupils of the university , and its revenues , can not have any influence on the decision of the examiners , because they personally can neither gain nor lose by it , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared , that after having distinguished himself during eight years by his good conduct , his talents , and his industry , a young man should fall a victim to the liberty which he finds at the university i Accustomed to seek his greatest enjoyments in his studies , he will return to his books as soon as the diversions , the excitement of which threw him into a momentary giddiness , will have lost that novelty which is one of their greatest attractions . From that moment he becomes more and more studious , and before his three years are over , he has made up for the half year in which he sowed his wild oats ; at any rate , his character remains one of frankness and uprightness , which is much more than could be said of institutions where the same liberty does not exist . In England , for instance , it is well known that many of the vices which are openly exhibited by the German students are indulged in , in secret : which of the two systems is the most dangerous i Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deserves some credit with reference to this question . We copy the following from page 10 of the preface . VOL . X. , No . XLV. - 3l. // " One thing , however , as an Englishman , I may say , and that is , that when reading of the beer and sword duels of these students , we must take into account what are the weapons and the perils in both cases ; we are not to suppose , then , that their beer is anything like the London XXX , or their wine like sherry or port , three fourths brandy . No ; they who know German wine , know that it is a very gentle and innocent , rather acidulous and rather cooling fluid , and that their beer is far more mighty of the hop than of the malt . It is a well-bittered and amiable table beer , which even Father Matthew might take as a healthy stomachic , and which one might rather expect , in Sam Weller 's phrase , to make its swallower swell wisibly before our wery eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add to this , that the sword duel is rather a trial of skill in fencing than any thing dangerous , and that a scratch across the cheek , or prick into a stuffed jerkin , is in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the worst of its accidentsfears on the subject diminish at a rapid rate Shall I advise them to imitate the students of Cambridge ? Let any one read the StudentLife of Cambridge , ' in a late number of the Westminster Review , and say whether that would be reasonable Why Kneips* and the Hirschgasset are heaven and innocence to them . Shall I advise them to quit their songs for the grossness es sung by the wild portions of the students of Cambridge and Oxford ? No . . . . It is here that the tables must be turned , and that we must call on the English to imitate the Germans , and not the Germans the English . If the English will drink , let them drink wine as cooling , and beer as thin and bitter , as the Germans ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a man and let the soul out after them  --  and be content with a scratched nose or a punctured padding . If they will sing over their wine , let them not sing the vile trash that is heard in the haunts of our students , hut the spiritual effusions of such writers as Schiller , Goethe , K6rner , Arndt , Claudius , Uhland , etc . " This language may surprise any one who has been during a few days a visiter at Cambridge or at Oxford , where he must have been pleased with the conduct of the gownsmen , as the students call themselves , whenever they appear in public . As noisy as are the streets of Heidelberg , or Berne , or Gottingen , as quiet are those of Cambridge and Oxford : but in the former places , one meets the student very often in his nightgown and slippers , while in the latter he is always covered with his academical gown and cap , or surplice : what the English student does at home , or wherever he does not expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret to the traveller . Yet there is one danger to which the German student is exposed and often falls a victim . We mean the facilities which are afford * The houses where the students spend their evenings in smoking pipes and drinking beer . t A house near Heidelberg , where all the regular sword duels are fought . // ed to him by his social life to form political connexions . Educated as he has been in the gymnasium , where the heroes of the republics of Greece and Rome are constantly upheld before his eyes , as the prototypes of men and citizens , he is filled with the love of liberty , and hatred of tyranny ; animated by the wish to fight for the oppressed against the oppressor , and anxious to follow the example of those men , in the midst of whom he has lived , as it were , so many years , the incompatibility of liberty with the political state of his own country , he unfortunately overlooks . His whole life has been spent in a land of dreams ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gymnasium to the university . Here he finds , to a certain degree , that liberty which has become so dear to him . It gives him confidence and boldness . His constant gymnastic exercises and his duels , lead him to consider himself a kind of knight , intrusted by God with the sacred office of defending the feeble against the strong . He is always ready to draw , in a common cause , the sword which hitherto was only stained with the blood of his companions and friends . Let the national liberty be threatened by a foreign foe , he will volunteer his services and die in the defence of his country . As is so powerfully expressed in the song called " Landes Vater : " - " Life and living to thee giving , We are all prepared to bleed ; Ready at each hour for dying , Death with all his wounds defying , If our father-land it need . " ( Page 301 . ) Thus far there is no harm . But , unfortunately for him , these same noble feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , induce him also to espouse the general cause of liberty , and to sharpen his schhger against the government of his country . For this untimely love of liberty , many a noble hearted , hopeful youth has found his ruin at the university ; for it , many are now suffering in the state prisons of their country , or are exiled into foreign climes . But who would condemn the German universities for kindling and nourishing , even at that cost , the holy flame of patriotism , but the potentates of the small aud large states of Germany l Perhaps we might wish that in the gymnasium , the conviction might be enforced upon the young man , that he ought merely to admire , but not to imitate the patriots of antiquity , and the Posas , Tells , Egmonts , and Goetzes of his favorite poets Schiller and Goethe . Our present object does not allow us to dwell any longer on this subject , which we however consider as deserving the most // earnest attention of our fellow-citizens . Our fathers adopted , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English system of high schools : whether consistently with our own political constitutk , n , so immensely different in its nature from the English , was perhaps never examined . In England , Cambridge and Oxford are most richly endowed ; there is but one religion . How different in our own country , where all shades of Christian denominations are represented and entitled to equal rights , and all institutions are supported by private contributions . Whether the German system would not have been much more consistent with our republican institutions than one which is calculated to support a powerful aristocracy , is scarcely to be asked . In the German universities , there are usually upwards of fifty professors and teachers , out of whom a very few have any salary ; the others depend entirely upon the fees which the students pay for their lectures . The principle which has proved most beneficial in its application , consists in paying high salaries , in attaching , at any price , some great celebrities to the institution . They form a nucleus around which other professors soon will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the professors live in private houses , each one according to his means . The lectures are given usually in rooms hired for that purpose by the professors . No building is necessary ; no money wasted in marble , granite , or bricks . Not until very recently , universities which had existed for centuries inaugurated their university buildings ; Halle and Gottingen , for instance . The following extract from the " Student-Life " presents an excellent sketch of the plan to which German universities owe their actual organization . " The great wheel of the mechanism of the German university is , next to the payment for the lectures , the division of the teachers into ordinary and extraordinary professors , and private teachers ( privat docenten ) . Through the income appropriated by the government , the professor is not dependant on his hearers , and is not tempted to care more for his income than for science . The first duty of a professor is toward science , not toward the students . That is the principle of all genuine university professors ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gymnasium . The state must secure a moderate income to the professor , independent of the number of his hearers ; since a lecture which has only seven or eight attendants , may be of invaluable benefit to science ; as , for instance , those on the higher analysis , or the higher philology . A great mathematician ought not , in order to acquire emolument merely , waste his time in teaching the inferior branches of his science . But , on the other hand , the state is not bound to give to every individual a scientific education gratuitously , and to its own ruin ; and it would be unjust to extract money from the pockets of all citizens for the benefit of only a very small // number . A suitable and secure income , which furnishes a professor with what is necessary and with leisure , and paid lectures , which in proportion to his success shall better his condition-these , in this respect , constitute the true means : since a professor should never forget the higher interests of science , nor in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain degree of success , and only a moderate number of hearers . There is also this advantage to be added , that the students frequent with more zeal and perseverance the lectures for which they pay . " The three degrees of teachers at the high schools of Germany are in the happiest manner divided from each other , and yet bound together . The foundation , the root of the professorship , the inexhaustible and everspringing nursery of the German university , are the young doctors , to whom it is allowed , under certain conditions , and with the permission of the faculties , to deliver public lectures . Every able young man may thus arrive at the higher offices of teaching , but none without raising , at least , good expectations . He is tried , but without entering into any actual engagement with him ; without anything being promised to him , or given him . If he does not , by correspondent results , realize the hopes which have been entertained of him ; if he fails to attract hearers and to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen that a vain anticipation has been attached to him , and he is not raised to the rank of extraordinary professor . He himself , after some years , withdraws himself from the hopeless pursuit , which brings him few hearers and little profit , and betakes himself to some other career . On the contrary , if he fulfil the hopes raised by him ; if he gather numerous hearers , and write works which excite attention ; he is then declared extraordinary professor , a title which is irrevocable , and which gives him a small fixed salary , which , with the income derived from his hearers , encourages him and supports him in his career . If he maintain this happy progress , if he prove himself an able man , the state , in order to retain him , increases by degrees his income , and finally names him ordinary professor . " The remark in this passage , that the professors at the university are supported by the state for the sake of service , while those at the gymnasium for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention : because of the former it is expected that they should distinguish themselves by scientific contributions , while the latter must devote themselves exclusively to the education and instruction of the boys put under their care . The gymnasiom is the institution for the general education of all young men , of all ranks , and of all professions ; the end of the university is to give that special instruction which the learned professions require , and to form men of science . In the gymnasium all students receive the same instruction , in Latin , Greek , French , mathematics , geography , history , and religion , and natural sciences-whatever may be their ultimate destination . At the university they select the faculty they choose ; whether they propose to become public officers , agriculturists , physicians , // lawyers , professors , or theologians . The gymnasium gives in a high degree what is called a classical education . The university gives to each one his special education , preparatory to his practical life in society . Nor is there at the university any one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political sciences as the most useful to them ; land-owners law , and agricultural economy , and so on ; but the number of young men who visit the university is but small compared to those who are educated at the gymnasia : a single institution of the former class is sufficient for several of the latter ; of which one is usually to be found in each city of moderate size . Smaller cities have what is called progymnasia , which correspond exactly to the four first years of the gymnasia . In this manner it becomes easy to all classes to send their children to school without heavy expenses . We copy the following passage , as one which shows one of the distinctive characters of German universities . " In order to make support at the university easy to those without property , many regulations are established . To those who can bring certificates of inability to pay , the lecture fees are remitted . Besides this , in the diP ferent universities exist endowments , derived in part from an ancient period , for such as can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities are rich in such endowments , or stipends . It is a popular joke , that any student who arrives at Greifswald , well known as the smallest Prussian university , is asked at the gates whether he will accept a stipend ; and if he declines , they hesitate to admit him ; since , unless , students enough will come and take them , the university does not know what to do with the endowments . " The university he alludes to divides annually among the poor students 4600 Prussian dollars : the whole number of students at the university oscillated at about two hundred . In this respect there is again a great difference between the English colleges and the German universities . While in the latter all endowments are for the benefit of poor young men , of studious habits and irreproachable conduct , in the former they are bestowed upon masters of arts and fellows . Which of the two institutions makes the best use of its money , we shall not attempt to decide . If much has been objected to the idle life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not less just reproaches have been made to the German institutions for the facilities which are afforded to poor young men to elevate themselves into a class of society , in which their poverty renders them very often most unhappy . We refer our readers to another passage . " Free is the Burseli , " Exclaims a beautiful student song . And true is the cry ; or tell me who is freer than he ? Where see we the idea of freedom so beautifully real . // ized as in the German student-life l He who has learned to know this life , may even doubt the truth of that otherwise true expression of Schiller 's " Freedom is only in the realm of dreams . " We say , on the contrary , that we doubt whether the student who has most indulged in the liberty which reigns at the university , has not many a time repeated the preceding line with the same conviction which dictated it to its immortal author . The following is perhaps more true " Nor let any one , especially a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his wealth , or his high birth ; or that he tnay expect from his university acquaintance particular homage on that account ; thereby would he particularly expose himself to ridicule and annoyances . Nobility holds in Germany no longer such absurd estimation ; few Germans seek a man 's acquaintance exclusively on account of its possession , and those few are despised . " This remark is quite natural for an Englishman . in the universities of his country , the students are divided into three classes , according to their wealth and birth : viz. , commoners , gentlemen commoners , and noblemen-distinguished by the gowns they wear in public , by their tables in the hall , and even by their seats in church . It is revolting for an American , unacquainted with privileges , to see those distinctions , which money or rank procures , and which the proud and free Englishman witnesses and tolerates . We have confined ourselves especially to the most serious parts of the volume of Mr. Howitt , though the author treats them rather more superficially than the amusements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We must send to the book itself ; those of our readers who would wish to become acquainted with the student 's social life , or to " Morton 's Hope , " of which we have spoken at the beginning of these pages . We shall now add a few remarks about the songs of the university . Of all books , the German student values most his book of songs , until he knows its contents by heart . In this collection there are specimens of all shades , from the most solemn to the most frivolous , appropriated to all possible circumstances of the singer 's life , and of course a majority about drinking and smoking . Mr. Ho*vitt 's book contains about forty of the most famous . There is this to be said in favor of the translations , that the original measure is preserved in all of them . This is a great recommendation for the English edition , which contains the melodies and the German text ; but ceases to be so in the American edition , which does not give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be blamed for this , because the translations were evidently made to be sung , and not destined to be read.
