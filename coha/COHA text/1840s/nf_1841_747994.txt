txt we arrive at conclusions is simply this . We have three thoughts ; each differs from the other , and each is included vvithin a certain limit . But while all differ , one is capable of uniting the two others , and of removing this difference . Thus two thoughts are reduced to one class by a third one connecting them . To make use of an example frequently adduced , the dog once whipped , fears as soon as he sees his master take the cane with which he has been beaten on a former occasion . The cane is one thing , the master 's intention another , and the pain proceeding from the whipping , a third . Now it would be foolish in the extreme , to say , that the dog connects the idea of pain with the cane by the intention of the master . He has but a confused impression , and without any conclusions or judgments , he darkly connects things as they formerly were connected , and anticipates consequences , without being conscious of such a connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause and consequence . Hunters , it is true , tell many anecdotes about the acuteness and ingenuity of animals , as do sailors also voyaging to distant countries . The fact , however , is , that unless their game were bound by the invariable laws of instinct in all its actions , unless one fox would dig its hole as the other , and all stags would go to the water , and seek food at regular hours , and live in certain places at different seasons , the hunters would not be able to entrap them . Animals , finally , can not have any emotions ; neither joy nor grief , neither hope nor fear . The external expressions of these emotions are weeping and laughing , neither of which has as yet been observed in animals . We indeed all remember from Homer 's Iliad , that when the noble Patroclus , alone and at a distance from his true friend Achilles , fell by the hands of the Trojans , his horses shed big tears and refused to obey , because they missed the well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to poetry ; they are the tears which Homer himself wept at the death of the hero his fancy had created . So poetry attributes innocence to the lily , because it is of the purest white ; modesty to the violet , because it blooms and exhales its fragrance unseen ; love to the rose , because the cheeks of the maiden blush like it , when for the first /z/ time she feels this noble emotion . What is joy in man , springing from a feeling that connects itself with some thought , in animals , is but a physical sensation or bodilypleasure , the agreeable re-action of the muscles against some external influence , the satisfaction of some want . And so what is grief in man , is but a physical pain , or suffering in the animal . The dog , that lays himself upon the grave of his master and remains there until he dies , does so not from deliberation and free choice , but being forced by the chain of habit , which he is unable to break . Nor do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future nor the past is known to them . A dark anxiety which they do not understand , a confused anticipation , is all of which they are susceptible . /z/ It is not my intention , in this Chapter , to show what life is in itself , but only to exhibit some of its most striking phenomena , and the different stages of its general development throughout nature . Thus only can we gain a clear idea of the rank occupied by man among animated beings . Of Life in general . In the following three points , the living differs from the dead or hfeless , the organic from the inorganic. 1 . Whatever is aUve , must be a union , a totality of many organs or members , and so united with them , that they can not be separated from each other , nor from the whole , without being destroyed . The crystal , however transparent , and beautiful , and regular in its form , is not alive , for it is not an individual being , nor a whole , whose parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . The many forms of the crystal are not indeed produced by a power foreign to its matter , not by an external contrivance , but by a plastic power , which , resting in its matter , always calls forth the same symmetrical forms according to eternal laws , whenever the conditions under which it can be active are present . But the organization of the whole into parts , as for example , that of the plant into trunk and branches , being wanting , we should hesitate to call the crystal alive . Every one of its qualities is contained in each particle of the mineral , and though there may be many qualities , they are all of them so included in each other , that where one is the other is also . Hence there is no union of many members or organs , each of which , while pervaded by the same life , has a particular /z/ office ; but the smallest piece of the mineral is as perfect as the whole . The plant , on the other hand , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These parts are not merely connected as the links of a chain , which can not support itself , but must be supported by the nail in the wall ; they grow forth from and depend on each other , and on the life of the whole . Roots , trunks , branches , twigs , leaves , blossoms and fruits , all differ from each other ; each has a peculiar office ; each assists and promotes the life of the whole ; and while the one depends on the other , all depend on the individual , whose organs they are . The leaf torn from the branch , loses its freshness , its sap , its color , and withers . The branch , hanging only by a few fibres to the trunk , is no longer a part of the tree . One of the characteristics , therefore , of Hfe , is that its parts do not merely cohere externally and mechanically , like those of a machine , but are inseparably connected by concrescence or a common growth , so that they can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small particles or atoms by the file , still remains iron . The parts of a house , as they are heterogenous and only collected from the different portions of nature , and then put together , so they will remain what they are , stone , timber , mortar , and glass , though they should be taken apart and applied to another building . But the trunk severed from the root , is dead ; the hand , lopped from the arm , grows black and decays. 2 . The second characteristic of life is the continued process by which , whatever lives , preserves itself . As no living being begins to be by external union , i. e. by a mere mechanical composition of its parts , but grows forth from a spontaneous coalescence , so it can not be supported and upheld by a foreign power , but must preserve itself by its own vitahty . The chemist may have all the elements of which a plant consists , and yet it will be wholly out of his power to produce the plant , or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a plant . The parts of which the machine consists were in existence before the machine was made , but the parts that constitute the plant , as the roots , branches , bark , and sap of the tree , were not before the tree was . Hence the organic or living indivi- /z/ dual produces all its parts by a power within itself , and by this power it also preserves itself . In regard to this selfpreservation , however , a great difference appears in the different animated beings . The plant by its roots absorbs those elements which are congenial to its nature ; it may therefore be said to eat and drink , to preserve itself . But the activity of the plant is purely external . It does not preserve an organism that may he said to have finished growing , but by assimilation every spring , it produces new limbs , leaves , and blossoms . It grows as long as it lives , and yet every new hmb is but a repetition of the original trunk , as are the new leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , reaches a point , where all its members are complete and full-grown , and at this stage it preserves its organism by nutriment . In the animal , one limb differs from the other , the nose from the mouth , the eyes from the ear , the legs from the body ; but they do not grow in succession , like the branches of the plant , but contemporaneously . Hence it is that the life of the plant is merely external ; it presses constantly to the surface , and exhibits itself in color , bark , fragrance , fruit and seed . And as its life , so its self-preservation is external , not felt by it . The life of the animal is more internal , it feels itself , and feels a pleasure in preserving its hfe. 3 . A third characteristic of life is , that form and matter , which constitute a hving being , are not brought together externally , so that the matter somewhere exists , and the form is given it by an external power . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist impresses the picture of his imagination upon it . So this picture exists in the mind of the artist before his chisel carves the stone . But it is otherwise in a living being . This grows forth from an invisible power , according to certain , unchangeable laws . This power on the one hand materializes , attracts matter , assumes volume , produces fibres , roots , bark , branches or nerves , muscles , sinews , bones , &c.; ; on the other it is plastic , giving form to the matter . It is however only one power , that acts under two different forms , so that while it assumes volume , it at the same time changes the particles received into that form in which alone its nature can admit them . It is therefore correct /z/ to say , that in a living being the matter does not precede its form . The air we exhale , is no longer what it was when we inhaled it ; the light absorbed by the plant is changed into color , and consequently does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins when the element is received by the plant . The wormwood , the rosebush , the tube-rose , may all of them stand on the same soil , receive the same moisture , the same atmosphere , and the same degree of heat , and consequently live on the same elements ; yet the different taste and medical power of their sap , the different color of their leaves , the different fragrance of their flowers , sufficiently show , that while the same elements enter into their nature , they do not remain the same , but are changed and peculiarly modified by the form under which they enter it . Though the elements as such precede the plant , they become elements of the plant only by that plastic power , which in converting them into constituent parts of the plant gives them at the same time form . The light flows into the eye of the mole no less than into that of the eagle , but it exists in the one as it does not in the other ; there is a specific difference between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mole . From these remarks it must be manifest , that the various forms of life do not proceed from dead matter , nor from chance or any blind impulse , but that they are fashioned by a plastic power placed in matter by the divine will , and that this is the power which upholds the species and individuals , and universally produces the same forms according to the same unchangeable laws . This power , then , is the very soul of life , and the question is . What can we know concerning it ? /z/ We daily see thousands of beings begin to be ; we see them arise from the ground of the earth , from seeds and /z/ sprouts , and eggs in the water and on the continent , on the soil and in the air . Each new being bears the form of the species to which it belongs , and though favorable or unfavorable influences may render this form more or less perfect , no external power can change its specific character . From the seed universally will proceed the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaves and branches , roots and trunk , blossom and fruit , may be anticipated with all certainty . Considering all this , we must admit that there is a type , which precedes the opening and growing being , and which fashions it with so unchangeable a necessity , that the individuals of any species have continued substantially the same in size and form , in nature and qualities , ever since the creation of the world . This can not be owing to accidental circumstances ; nor can form emerge from chaotic matter , nor Hfe from death , nor light from darkness , nor the organic from the inorganic . The theory of Thales , therefore , who made water the mother of all life , or the Aristotelian hypothesis of a generatio aequivoca in opposition to a generatio sexualis , could no longer stand , even if Redi 's experiments had been less decisive . This hypothesis considered matter as possessed of power to produce the various forms of life . We see worms and insects generated in decaying flesh ; mushrooms and other plants make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherever soil and climate are favorable to them . Certain plants are always found around salt springs and nowhere else ; the pinus pumilis is met with on the top of the Silesian mountains , and again on the Carpathian ; hov/ , it has been asked , could these plants be found so uniformly under the same circumstances , if the same qualities of matter did not always produce the same forms of life ? So we discover , in the intestines of animals , worms which differ specifically according to the different parts in which they are found , so that they can not have been generated by such as might have been swallowed in water . Thus the theory . Redi , however , by his simple yet ingenious experiment , completely refuted it . He filled three pots with flesh and exposed them to the sun . One of these pots he sealed up tightly , another he covered merely with paper , and the /z/ third he left open . Upon examining all of them , he discovered that the one left open was filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a few , and the third none at all . But suppose insects might originate from matter , could the larger animals , the horse and the stag , the zebra and cameleopard , and above all , man , originate in the same way ? And if they could , by what power of matter ? From the time of Redi , the proverb of the celebrated Harvey , that every being originates from seed or eggs , omne animal ex ovo , became daily more acceptable : yet * whether I examine with the microscope the germ in the acorn , or whether I view the oak of a hundred years , I am equally far from its origin . ' The seed is already the product of a plastic power , which formed it , as it must produce the form that shall grow forth from the seed . The Greek question  --  whether the egg was before the hen or the hen before the egg , must lilcewise present itself . The egg is the chicken in possibility , and the chicken is the realized possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different and many hypotheses on the origin of individual life , gave way to that which was called the theory of involution , or theoria preformationis . This asserted that all forms exist from the beginning of the world , only infinitely small , all of them preformed , the one included in the other , and many millions of germs in one . Growth is nothing else than evolution or enlargement of these preformed germs . This theory was supported by many strange arguments ; but however well supported it might have been , it transferred the difficulty in question only from one place to another . For whether I view the tree in its full size or in its infinitely small preformation , here as well as there I see it already formed , and must ask , whence these forms ? When we , however carefully , and by the most accurate instruments , examine the egg of a butterfly , we can not discover any thing except a white fluid , which is of the same color and substance in all its parts , and fills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen as yet of the body of the butterfly , nothing of its beautifully colored wings , nothing of its proboscis , which the future fly will thrust into the cups of flowers , nothing /z/ of its limbs and many eyes . And yet the possibility of producing all of them , slumbers in the egg , and no sooner is it exposed to the necessary and favorable conditions , than an invisible power will develop member after member in this simple and identical fluid . The celebrated Blumenbach , who for a long time had taught this theory of involution , was accidentally led to discover its fallacy , and to start one which will be found of much greater importance to our subject than any former one . While spending a part of a vacation in the country , he met with a green armpolypous in a rivulet . He mutilated it repeatedly , and whenever he cut off a part , the vrhole animal would become thin for a time , and an effort to reproduce the lost part became evident . On the second or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts were fully grown again . Soon after , he had to attend upon a man , from one of whose limbs had to be cut a large portion of flesh ; the wound soon healed , and the system directly showed a tendency to cover the cavity . When these phenomena were brought in connection with others ,  --  for example , that the feelers of snails , when cut off , or the limbs of spiders , when lost , are soon restored again ,  --  it could not but- strike him , that all living beings carry in themselves a plastic power , from which not only they themselves proceed , but which has a tendency to produce and preserve those forms which are essential to them . The correctness of this view may be perceived even in the vegetable kingdom ; for it is not the germ in the seed , from which the plant originates . This germ is already of a visible and decided form , the result of the flower . In the flower we may discover a whitish , globular fluid , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , becomes more solid , and when ripe , is thrown off from the mother-plant as seed . In this seed is contained the germ , the first formation of the future plant , as roots and leaves may be considered the second and third formations . Whence then is the germ ? It is the product of a plastic power , which is the principle of individual life and its preservation , which forms in the plant the seed , the fibres and the roots , the leaves and the branches ; which makes the roots seek for moisture , and the leaves for the air , and /z/ the flower for the light of the sun , and which will confine the form of each individual to its species , so that the seed of the palm-tree will never grow up and become an oaktree , nor the acorn grow up a pabn-tree . This plastic power reigns wherever there is life : whether it be in the depths of the ocean , where it works secretly and unseen , or in the cavities of the earth , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bud and blossoms of the plant , which it clothes with beauty , or in the sensations and perceptions of animals , in which the light of intellect seems to dawn . It can no more be seen with the eye , than any other power . But as we conclude from effects as to causes , so we conclude here from the products as to the power that produces them . These products are the forms of individual life , and consequently we must admit a plastic power , which produces them . To the thinking and observing man , its existence is no less certain than the sound that falls upon his ear , or the dazzling light that is reflected upon his eyes . The necessity of admitting and knowing this plastic power , will appear more fully when we consider separately the principal phenomena that can not be explained without it . They are . First , a living motion . When we compare the different possible motions with efllh other , we can not but acknowledge a great difference between them as to their cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling from place to place , changes only its locality , is universally caused by a power not contained in the object in motion , but by one that is external to it . The ball on the billiard table , struck by the rod , will roll on until the impulse given it has exhausted itself . The arrow , shot from the bow , is set in motion by a power which does not rest in it , and which gives it the direction it takes . All mechanical motion so wholly depends on an external cause , that where it ceases , it must likewise stop . The cannon ball , discharged into the air , can not continue to rise , ad infinitum but must sink back upon the earth in a parabolic line . With chemical motion it is somewhat otherwise . Its cause is contained in the peculiar relation or affinity of two bodies to each other ; each of which presupposes /z/ in the other , what is wanting in itself . Iron filings and vitriolic acid , put together , will affect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the production of a third body . Mechanical motion leaves a body as it found it , but chemical motion effects an entire change . Again , when we see the seed of a plant , sown in a favorable soil , and exposed to the light , swell and move , the motion , though dependent on proper conditions , is not caused by a power without , but by one within the seed , and the effect is not a new chemical combination , but a living body , growing out from within . We may observe the same , when we compare the motion of an infusorium with any other merely mechanical loco-motion . The lowest class of animals , which are so small that five thousand millions may live in one drop of water , and that can only be rendered visible by a microscope , magnifying one hundred times , which indeed have only become known since the invention of Leuwenhoek 's microscope and may be produced by pouring water upon decaying substances ( inf under e , infusorium ) , are called infusoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living points , atoms that eat and drink , but have no organized bodies . And yet these living atoms have a motion of their own . The feather , that floats in the air , the dust that is raised by the attraction of light , the piece of wR ) d that swims down the river , are all carried and moved by the elements , in which they are : but these little , living animals , move with or against the current , and in whatever direction they choose . Their motions , therefore , depend not on any thing external , but on a power within themselves , strong enough to resist the current of the air . Secondly , a separation of the living being from the element in which it is horn . The drop of water that flows along in a river , is not separated in any way from the element of which it forms a part . The single grain of sand is separated from all other grains , but it is not separated by its own innate power , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , in the plant a globular fluid is formed , and when this fluid at length hardens and in the form of seed by its own activity , thrusts itself forth or falls from the mother-plant , we must conclude that there is a simple , /z/ secretly-working power , causing the fluid  --  which originally is a part of the plant , and in as close a contact with it as a drop of water with its volume ,  --  to separate itself and constitute a being of its own . This is the case with the punctum saliens in the animal , and with all living beings throughout nature . All commence in such a simple activity , all begin to move , and to grow forth from it and receive members and form by it . Through it , the being that is active , is active in reference to itself Whatever has an existence of its own must be active , and it must be so either with reference to itself or to something else . An example may illustrate this : when the blacksmith suffers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall upon the anvil , and strikes it with his hammer , the shadow can not be affected , because it has no existence of its own , its motions , and its whole shadowy , lifeless appearance depending on the iron . But when instead of the shadow , the iron is placed upon the anvil , it will stretch itself out under the heavy strokes of the hammer . It is active , yet not for itself , but only for the hammer . The sun , that shines upon the sand and heats it , is active , yet not for itself , but for something else ; the sand , that is heated and perhaps converted into glass , is active hkewise , but not for itself either , but for some other purposes . The germ , on the other hand , that under the mild influence of sweet moisture and of a genial warmth , begins to move , to swell , to break the cover and to sprout , is not active for any thing else , but for itself ; for the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As such it preserves itself , breathes , eats and drinks with its roots and leaves . By the simple activity in question , therefore , a living being begins to exist as an individual ; as such it is related to itself in all its parts ; branches and twigs , roots and trunk , are all of them related to each other , and their union is the plant or the individual life , whose organs they are . Thirdly , a specific form . This originally simple power or activity , contains the possibility of producing such forms , as the prototype of a genus necessarily demands . When we observe an egg , from which the future young is to come forth , we are forced to admit this possibility . At first , nothing is visible but the fluid ; afterwards a beating /z/ point is seen ; soon the heart begins to have pulsation ; the blood to become red ; the head makes its appearance ; eyes , mouth , and members shoot forth . Limbs , as yet slender as the threads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible . The being in a state of formation , already sleeps and wakes , moves and rests . It seeks light , and without assistance opens the shell . Is here no form-giving power ? Must not this power have in itself the type of the formation which it is to produce , and is it not correct therefore to say , that it contains the possibility of producing specific forms ? This possibility is not a mere fiction of our fancy , it is a physical possibihty , that when all the conditions are present , must pass over into reality . As the forms , proceeding from the possibility , can not be accidental , but must all of them represent their prototype , or the image which seems to slumber in that originally simple activity , this possibility or plastic power has been called nisus formativus . By nisus is indicated the tendency of a power to effect a certain , definite object . By /ormativus is to be understood the quality of the object , its form and whole organism . There is no such tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there is one in the acorn , when sown , to form an oak-tree . It is the same power too , that forms the being , which preserves it . No sooner is the young born , than all the functions of this power are in operation . The mouth opens itself , the lungs breathe , the stomach digests , and the lips seek their food . Leaves fall every autumn , but every spring adorns the trees with new ones . It is this power that causes a wound to heal , and that in inferior animals , restores lost limbs . Not the individual only , however , is thus preserved by it  --  for sooner or later it must decay  --  but after it has fully formed and matured the individual , it takes care by it of the genus , and becomes a tendency of propagation . The period , when it takes this different direction , is indicated externally . The muscles swell rounder and fuller , the face blooms , and vigor and feeling of a youthful freshness is spread through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , the principal phenomena of which we have considered , determines also /z/ the motions of the organs , and the use to be made of them . It causes the sap to rise and to sink in the plant , the branches to extend themselves towards the light , the roots to move from the centre towards the nourishing moisture , and the leaves to expand and contract in proportion as the cellular textures are filled with juice . So the stamina of many plants move of their own accord , as soon as they are formed ; the cups of others close when the sun sets , as those of many tulips ; others shut their leaves when a storm threatens , as the Scotch sycamore , and others again sink into the water when the sun sinks , and re-appear when it rises , as the lotos . The light may act here by way of excitement , but can not act as the sole cause ; and as plants have no sensations and perceptions , these motions must be attributed to the plastic power , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it . More instructive , and more to our purpose , however , are some phenomena , which we observe exclusively in the animal world . Here all the productions of the plastic power are more perfect and more regular . They are more perfect ; for if we compare the most beautiful flower with the eye the latter will strike us at once as being infinitely more artistical and complete . They are more regular ; for the animal has but two lungs , but two eyes , but two ears , while the plant has thousands of leaves , and buds , and flowers . The more nearly animals are allied to the vegetable world , the greater will be the number of their limbs ; some reptiles have more than one hundred feet ;  --  yet the number of limbs in any is no longer left indefinite , as in the plant , but determined by the species . The more animals approach man or the sphere of reason , the more perfect their forms , and the less numerous their limbs . And as this power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumes a higher character . When we see the vine seek with its tendrils the large tree , and when we see them wind themselves around it , we at once attribute these motions to that power by which the plant grows . But not so when we see that the tortoise , hatched by the sun a mile from the shore , no sooner leaves the shell , than it runs without a guide , in a straight line to the /z/ ocean , or when we see ducks hatched by a hen , not listening to her clucking , plunge into the water , and without having learned to swim , enjoy this element with innate skill , or when we see the ox select two hundred and seventy-six herbs for his food , but universally shun two hundred and eighteen , though he never studied botany . The sphex fahulosa , before laying her eggs , hollows out a little cell for every one ; then fetches half-killed spiders , drags one into each cell , and lays her eggs on them , so that the future young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digs a channel into the earth , about two feet deep , and closes it very artificially by a trap-door . This door is round , formed of different layers of earth , which are held together by threads ; its outside is rough , but the inside smooth and lined with a thick texture , from the upper part of which , threads run to the surface of the channel , so that the door hangs on a string , and falls by its own weight into a fold as accurately as if the whole had been effected by mathematical skill . This door the spider has the skill to keep shut by its bodily exertions , when an enemy tries to open it . When we see such phenomena , we must admit a far higher agency than that which works and lives in plants , and this higher agency is iiistinct. /z/ What comparative anatomy is for the study of the anatomy of man , that , instinct and an investigation of its nature is for the study of Mental Philosophy . Within its sphere we discover phenomena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those of reason , and yet reason being wanting , will and self-consciousness being entirely absent , we can not attribute these designs to animals , but must ascribe them to him who works by eternal laws through their instinct ; yet a knowledge of these phenomena will be found extremely useful to the psychologist . The physiologist finds it necessary , in order to understand INTRODUCTIOxV. 35 fully the different organs of man , to compare them with those of animals . He must trace them from their first indications in the lower classes of animals , through all their different gradations up to man . Thus may he discover the importance of each part , by perceiving what degree of sight or hearing those parts of the eye or the ear afford , which are met with in animals that have not those organs perfectly formed . There are animals that consist of a single organ , which , while in its connection with a complicated organism in man , it is subordinate to higher ones , is the only one in them or at least prevails over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a being , we may see what kind of Hfe a single organ is capable of producing , and what its share must be in the constitution of man . So we know , that in muscles and snails , the liver and heart alone are fully formed ; in many insects the wind-pipe ; in others the lungs ; in the polypous the stomach ; in infusoria the gut . Nature contains all the parts of man , but not as man has them . In the lowest animals , single parts are sufficient to form the whole being ; more of them become united at the higher stages of animal life , until finally all appear well-proportioned in man , the tree , whose leaves are scattered throughout nature ; and as a machine can be known only when its parts are viewed singly , so man can be understood only , when we are acquainted with the inferior tribes in nature , which present to our inspection the different parts composing his system . Thus it is likewise with the psychological life of man . In viewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental life sensation and perception , independent of reason and will , are able to produce , and thus we may learn how to value reason and will as we should . It is not the identity , but the difference , not the sameness but comparison , from which we may learn most , and whenever in a science we have gained a prominent point adapted to exhibit these differences , it will be well for us to pause for a moment over it . Such points are for science , what mountains are for travellers , who desire to observe a country . They will see more , when standing on mountain-tops , than any where else . The nature of plastic power in the vegetable world , and that of instinct in animals , will accordingly teach us /z/ more concerning Psychology , than any other portion of human science . The different general phenomena of instinct have been arranged by the celebrated Reimarus , in no less thdin fiftyeight different classes . It will be sufficient for the present purpose , to mention only a few . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with perfect skill from one place to another , and use all their hmbs in a perfectly correct manner , and for the right purpose , without having received instruction . So the squirrel uses its fore-paws at once properly ; so the fish swims without teaching . Amphibious animals will move from one element into the other ; and birds , insects , fishes , and even quadrupeds will seek , and unerringly find , distant countries , in order to enjoy the degree of heat or cold favorable to their constitutions . Other animals bury themselves when winter approaches . All animals select their food not only skillfully , but also seek it in the proper places , at the proper season , and at the proper time , by day or night ; many are extremely cunning in catching their prey , and in laying up provision for inclement seasons ; others know how to heal their wounds , how to erect dwellings for themselves , how to defend themselves from their enemies either by houses , as the beaver , or by regular wars , aS some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , may be reduced to three great classes , one of which will comprehend all those that have reference to the nutrition , another those referring to the motion , and the third , those relating to the propagation of animals , for the end of all instinct is the preservation of the individual and of the race . Instinct pre-supposes , what is not found in the sphere of vegetation , sensation and perception ; and while the plastic power of the vegetable kingdom extends also to the animal , instinct is confined to such beings as can feel . The plant grows and ripens , but it would be improper to say , except poetically , that it sleeps , or that it is fatigued , hungry and thirsty . It is true , that plants hang their leaves when they suffer from want of moisture ; that , like the lotus omithopedioides , which folds its flowers at night and opens them again in the morning , they seem to sleep , yet when all is well investigated , we shall discover that we /z/ speak but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are never awake , so they can not properly be said to sleep . But hunger and thirst , a tendency for motion and rest , and for the propagation of the race , are the peculiar phenomena of instinct , which we shall now investigate . It is natural to every living being to sustain itself by food . But neither man nor animals would think of taking nourishment , did not the system and operation of digestion force them to do so . When by exercise or atmospheric influence , digestion is regularly promoted , the stomach will become empty , and the gastric juice will gather . The power of this juice will seek something to act upon , and finding no food , it will attack the coats of the stomach . If no food is administered , the stomach will make an attempt by contractions to remove this juice , and not succeeding in this , death is inevitable . It is the nature of instinct ,  --  1st , To feel the pain thus caused by the activity of this gastric juice , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course painful , and is generally called hunger .  --  2d , Instinct , as hunger , will impel the animal to attack the world around and seek for food . This appears already from the connection of hunger and an irresistible tendency to motion . The horse stamps whenhungry , and were it not chained , it would go in search of food . The boa constrictor is constantly active when in want of food , but as soon as its hunger is satisfied , it lies sluggishly down and may be chased by a child .  --  3d , Instinct will direct the animal to its proper food , and no sooner is this perceived by the particular sense that prevails in the animal and stands in the service of instinct , than a prophetic feeling of pleasure will at once induce the animal to seize upon it . Hence it is , that the sheep , without choice or consideration , will select salt from amongst arsenic , which would be impossible to man . Instinct then is , on the one hand , a feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sympathy existing between this want , and the objects by which it is to be satisfied . This sympathy expresses itself in the animal by an internal urgency to seek , and by the pleasure it feels when guided by its prevaiUng sense it perceives its proper food , so that /z/ no reflection is required to distinguish one herb from another . If it were necessary to illustrate the nature of instinct , a number of examples might be given . Analogous to it is the attractive power in the magnet , which from among many thousand grains of different substances , attracts none but iron filings . The root absorbs only certain elements of the soil , and excludes others , as appears from the fact that plants set in an unfavourable soil wither . So we see animals of imperfect formations , confined to one single food , which they select from among many different materials . The fact , however , that instinct pre-supposes feeling , sensation , and perception , raises it above the power in the magnet , and gives it a higher character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its nourishment . And how can it be supposed that instinct is rather an intelligent power , than that it is a sympathy between the whole nature of the animal and the objects which are congenial to it 1 Especially when we consider that the ox eats two hundred and seventy-six herbs , but rejects two hundred and eighteen ; that the goat finds four hundred and fortynine palatable , but feels averse to one hundred and twentysix ; the sheep , three hundred and eighty-seven , not touching one hundred and forty-one ; the horse , two hundred and sixty-two , leaving two hundred and twelve untasted . When we consider , too , that they not only distinguish different herbs , but that with the same readiness they discover their food , though it should be under ground . The reindeer lays itself down , scrapes away the deep snow with its horn , and its fore-feet , and finds its aliment . Do these animals do so from a knowledge of these herbs , and of the locality favorable to their growth , or from a sympathetic relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere machines , as Descartes maintained , but neither are they thinking beings , as many sensualists would fike us to believe . Their life is confined to sensation and perception , and all their activity proceeds not from will , but from a feeling of pain or pleasure . /z/ I hope , however , to throw still more light upon this interesting topic , by considering some productions of animals which seem to manifest ingenuity . Of this kind , are all those that on the one hand , answer as means for a certain purpose ; for example , the web , by which the spider catches his prey , flies and insects , as skillfully as the fisher entraps in his net the inhabitants of the rivers . Whereever we perceive an adaptation of means to the end , there we allow ingenuity to be active . On the other hand , they must be something separate from the animal by which they were produced . The shell of the snail , that of the tortoise , and of the armadilla , are very artistlike and beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the influence of the atmosphere , and constituting parts of the animals themselves , they do not belong to the class of productions of which we speak . We do not think of ingenuity when we admire the beautifully coloured wings of the butterfly , or when we delight in viewing the regular and beautiful formations of leaves , of buds and flowers , for all of them form parts of the beings in which we discover them , and are the products of the same plastic power which formed the animals or plants themselves ; but when we see the cell of the bee , the larva of the caterpillar , or the nest of the tailor bird , we are at once struck with their ingenuity . When we examine the cover in which the chrysalis of a caterpillar awaits its future transformation , we find it full of design . Some of these coverings have a crown on one end , made of erect and stiflf threads that form in the inside a smooth and comfortable surface , but offer stiflf knots and points on the outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within , but make it diflicult to be pressed in from without . Here is design , here is preparation for a change which the animal has to undergo but once in its life , and as we can not feel willing to ascribe these phenomena to the knowledge and will of the animal , we must attribute them to a peculiar modification of instinct . This we feel ourselves the more /z/ strongly forced to do , when we ascertain that this tendency for artificial productions is not met with in the more perfect animals which possess all the senses in considerable perfection . The elephant does not show a trace of it ; the horse , the reindeer , the ibex , the zebra , are not possessed of it . But the tortoise , a stupid , sluggish , and awkward creature , paddles to the shore , digs with her clumsy feet a hole , and after having deposited her eggs in it , she covers it , levels it with the soil , and creeps several times over it , so that not a trace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear , that this modification of instinct is not found every where in the animal world , especially not in that part which by its completeness of the senses approaches most nearly the intellect of man , and the question offers itself ,  --  Where is it met with ? It is not found among such animals as maintain a decided independence of the elements in which they live , such as have five senses , as the buffalo , the bison ; nor again , among such as depend almost wholly on the element surrounding them , and are of weak and imperfect organization . It is frequently met with among insects that appear and disappear with certain plants , or live principally on plants ; and among birds and fishes that depend on certain seasons , and observe them in their going and coming from one region to another . These facts are of considerable importance to the question under consideration . For who does not at once perceive a connexion between the plastic power which produces the plant and its beautiful formations , and the insect in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces here , the cell of the bee , and there , the pyramid of the ant . These remarks may aid us in discovering the nature of animal ingenuity . The mere plastic power , as it reigns in the vegetable kingdom , is entirely external and objective in its productions ; through it the seed germinates , sprouts , and sends forth the root , stem , and leaf , the bud , the flower and the seed ; but from the germ to the seed all is external , the plant breathing forth its most internal life into color and fragrance . Instinct , on the other hand , is internal conditioned by feeling , by sensation , and perception . The phenomena of the plastic power and those /z/ of instinct are the same , the preservation of the individual being , and of the race . The plant needs nourishment rnotion , and rest 3. nd piopagates itself by seed or sprouts . The animal is subject to the same wants but with this difference : the roots of the plant absorb moisture , its leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree conscious of it ; the animal feels its wants , and guided by sensation , it seeks and finds the means by which to remove them . The plant , a mere external growth , can not move from its place ; the animal is enabled by feeling itself , to go in search of its food . Instinct , then , raises the animal as much above the plastic power , as reason raises man above instinct . Yet while instinct and the plastic power differ , they are contained in each other ; instinct could not exist for a moment without the plastic power and its irresistible tendency to hve ; it is the plastic power , only modified by feeling . Again , the plastic power reigns throughout all nature ; it is the soul of all life without exception , while instinct is confined to animal Hfe . We have now arrived at the point at which animal ingenuity must become clear . It is the medium between instinct and plastic power . It is stronger than the latter and weaker than the former . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the same time feels its wants , and separates what it produces , from itself by feeling . Its productions are impossible without instinct , and no less so without the plastic power ; they are their joint product . When the bee , without the least knowledge of flower or juice , buries itself in the cup and sucks in the sweet nectar , it is filled with feelings of pleasure ; but when it builds the cell , its activity resembles that of the plant , for it is the plastic power that is active in and through it . The cell is external hke the flower , but the flower constitutes part of the plant ; the cell is separate from the bee , for the bee , feeling itself , will not grow together with such external materials . The plastic power , as has been before remarked , prevails throughout all nature ; compared with instinct it is the general , while instinct , belonging only to ani- /z/ mals is the specific . Now instinct , i. e. feeling , perception , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the element in which the animal lives , is not permitted to effect anything in and through it , the nervous strength of the animal resists such a tendency  - -  the plastic power enters into the animal , but does not affect its independence . Or , the instinct , feeling , independence of the animal may be too weak for the plastic power to work through it . Or , finally , the animal is on the one hand susceptible of resisting the unlimited influence of the plastic power , and on the other of receiving it into itself , of being penetrated by it , so that when it is active by instinct , this power is permitted to act through it and to give form and shape to its productions . Animal ingenuity then , is the measure of independence given to these little creatures , and of their dependence on those elements in which they principally live . Now what can be more comprehensible than animal ingenuity ? There are some thoughts that will always require thinking to be understood ; and as Httle as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be possible , by even the clearest representation , to make such thoughts understood by all . But what can be more easily understood than the skill with which some birds make distant journeys 1 The element in which the bird hves is the air , and it is so entirely pervaded by this element , that the wings and feathers are filled with it , so that even when the windpipe is closed up , the bird will still be able to live if an opening is made in the bone of the wing , and the air thus permitted to communicate itself to the lungs . No doubt the changes of the air must be quickly felt , and the sympathy between the bird and its element must be very strong . When , now the bird , after her young are reared , feels a desire to wander because nutriment has become scarce , the warmth diminished , and the whole state of the atmosphere changed , she will be attracted by the warm south wind , and following it , will find her new home . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that directs her , but the warm winds alluring to the south , penetrate and bear her onward , as the fish feels itself drawn by the sweet waters of the rivers . The bee lives princi- /z/ INTRODCCTIoy. - " Ca pally in the vegetable kingdom , in which the plastic power alone reigns . This power enters the bee , and by its laws the cell is formed . There are two reasons that make us gaze with so much wonder at the productions of animal ingenuity . In the first place we discover in them an adaptation of means to an end , and whenever we perceive this , we presuppose reason and design . And yet there is the same adaptation of the root to the flower in the plant ; and in perceiving it , we feel by no means astonished , merely because we consider the one the product of the plastic power , which is wholly external , and the other that of meditation . In the second place , most of us are in the habit of considering nature and its manifold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought together by some mechanic , and whose powers exist side by side , without having any affinity to , or connexion with each other . But the opposite of all this is the case . Nature is . a system , not a conglomeration ; alive and active in all its elements and atoms , it is filled with powers , from the mechanical , chemical , magnetic , and galvanic up to the organic , all of which flow invisibly into each other , affect and determine each other . Eternal laws dwell in them , and provide that while these powers receive , and work with and through each other , none interferes with the other , or in any degree changes its nature , but supports and upholds it . Thus we have a constant life , powers flow up and down , to and fro . The drop of water falling from the cloud is shapeless , exposed to the cold , it radiates into a beautiful flake of white snow . Nothing is isolated ; nothing disconnected ; the air preserves the elasticity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere . It may be instructive to compare these artificial productions of animals with the works of human art . The great contrast between them will show the true nature of the former . 1 . Animals are born not only with the capacity , but with the ready skill to produce artificial works . This is manifest from the fact , that these little creatures not only execute these works immediately after their birth , but also in the same way throughout their lives , without in the least // improving them . The spider feels a tendency to weave his weh before he has seen the flies , to ensnare which he spins the thread . The ant-eater can scarcely yet move , when his nature already impels him to prepare the funnel , for the purpose of catching ants and other insects . To say that they learned this from seeing their parents do the same , would be contrary to experience . For , as Aristotle remarks , if we have three eggs hatched by artificial heat , one of a bird , one of a duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young bird try to fly , before its wings are grown ; the duck to swim , and the serpent to creep into the earth , before they have seen any one of their kind do the same . What man does , he must have learned by trial , but the caterpillar has only once in his life to undergo a transformation , and yet he knows how to spin a covering that will suit his future state , of which he can not have the least idea . The work , to be produced , seems to bear a prophetic character , for while the larva is still of a cylindric form , he weaves a covering fitted to the form of the chrysalis , as if he had his future state before his eyes . Man is not born with any ready skill , like the animal ; his arm allows the mere possibility of performing thousands of different operations , but this possibility must be exercised and developed . Exercise demands both time and repetition , and produces experience ; but experience is impossible without reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on instinct ; those of man on reason , will , and consciousness , and hence it is that the former have reference only to physical wants , but the latter to intellectual . 2 . Some animals construct their artificial works of materials which they prepare themselves . The paper wasp builds its nest of pasteboard fabricated by its own ingenuity . The celebrated Oken says of it , " This pasteboard not only resembles our pasteboard , but it is really the same ; equally as close , white , and strong as man is able to make it . Put one of these nests into the hands of a paper maker without telling him anything about it , and he will press , and turn , and tear it , without once imagining that any except one of his own profession could have prepared it . " The aquatic spider , that can not live under water without /z/ air , draws forth from its nipple a moist substance , a kind of varnish , covers itself with it , and bursting this bladder , it forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large as half a pigeon 's egg ; by a few threads it fastens it to some solid object in the water , its opening hanging downward , and then filling it with air , it may sit in it below the water for a long time , and watch its prey . So the bee gains honey and wax by digestion , and forms its cells of them . A little bee , called the paper-hanger ( antophora argentato ) bores perpendicular holes into the earth , and lines its house with pieces of the soft red leaves of flowers , as handsomely as persons of wealth cover their rooms with carpets . The antophora entuncularis builds its very artificial nest of leaves that are cut perfectly round ; it folds them into the form of a thimble , and shoves six or seven into each other . Man and animals may , however , use the same materials , and yet there remains this great difference . The animal uses these substances without knowing their qualities , without having the least idea , of the powers that fit them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not use them , therefore , from choice or consideration , but being directed to them by instinct . The swallow builds its nest of the same materials now , which it used in the time of Pliny . Man , on the other hand , knows the powers of different substances , and their fitness for various purposes ; he , therefore , selects and judges . Stones may be good for one , wood for another building . He has works written on the different building materials , and architects must be well acquainted with the nature of timber and stone , if they desire their works to be durable . 3 . Animals produce all their works by their own Hmbs , for they have no instruments . " In order to understand the works of animals , " says the most celebrated natural historian of our time , the distinguished Oken , " we must know the organs with which they are provided by nature . " How artificial seems to us the preparation of wax and honey ; how many ingenious instruments would we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gather pollen , and how easy is all this for the bee . Its whole body , even what is supposed to be its eyes , is so covered /z/ with hair , that viewed with a strong lens it resembles a piece of moss . The hairs are formed for gathering pollen ; the head is a flat triangle , running downward to a point ; its feelers are extremely flexible . The horny upper jawbones meet in front of the mouth like tongues , they are hollow , and can approach each other like hands ; below is the proboscis , bent backward , and well formed , to be thrust into the nectar cups of flowers , and in addition to all , the limbs , that move involuntarily without reflection or will , of which the two behind answer the purpose and bear the name of brushes . These limbs are so shaped , that their natural motions have a tendency to produce the works that seem to us so remarkable . The German rat has a bag below the chin , into which it gathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the fish has fins and a broad , upright , standing tail , to swim . But man , according to Frankhn , is an animal that can invent machines . The savage , fastening a sharp stone to a club , uses it as an axe ; he does not defend himself by his Hmbs , but by the bow , the arrow , and the tomahawk . Man has invented the saw and the hatchet , the sword and the gun , the furnace and the mill , and is daily increasing the number of machines . There is no animal that ever attempted to fabricate its works by the use of self-invented machines , or by fire . Monkeys , that are generally admitted to be ingenious , never think of keeping up the fire by adding wood , though they evidently delight in its warmth ; nor of firing woods , or of destroying the property of those that injure them , or of preparing instruments of iron by the aid of fire . 4 . The arts of animals have no history , as have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective sense of the word ; they have no gradual development , no cultivation , no improvement ; they are stationary , they are the same now that they always were . The arts of animals can not have a history in the subjective sense of the term history , for there can be no historical narration where nothing is to be narrated , and animals can not be conscious of an improvement , when there is none . But it is the character of history , that on the one hand it develops gradually all the capacities of a nation , or of our race ; and on the other , makes us conscious of them by narrating /z/ them ; and hence it is , too , that history objectively means the actions related , res gestae and subjectively the relation of them , historia rerum gestarum . On the other hand , there was a time when man knew of no arts , not even of such as are now considered indispensable . But animals have always had the same arts in the same degree of perfection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to invent his , and he changes and improves them daily . The arts of men differ in different regions , while the same animals will always produce the same works , wherever they are . And so men of different capacities in the same region , will have different success , while animals of the same kind will have the same . 5 . Finally , the purpose for which animals produce works of art , is limited to the sustenance of individual life and the preservation of the race . Hence their works are few in number . The spider can only spin a web ; the bee can only build a cell . Hence it is too , that the bird does not build its nest before the time of propagation . The purposes , for which man exercises his ingenuity and inclination to art , are manifold . By mechanical art he invents instruments , to serve his desire for knowledge . The press , the paper , the ink , the watch , the electrical machine , the compass , the telescope , give sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the landmark and the coin , show that his ingenuity is made subservient to his sense of justice . By the fine arts he enters the sphere of beauty and the compositions of Mozart and Beethoven , of Handel and Haydn ; the pictures of Raphael and Titian , the poetry of Shakspeare and Homer must serve to satisfy his longing for intellectual entertainment . From the above remarks it sufficiently appears , that , though the works of animals are full of intellect and design , it is not their design , we admire , but that of the Creator , who accomplishes it through the animals . /z/ The plastic power , as it exists and operates in the plant is blind , for it has neither sensation nor perception . The instinct of animals is like the twilight , not clear , but confused in itself , for it can neither comprehend , judge , nor conclude ; it distinguishes only by sensations , and such distinctions are faint , unaccompanied by consciousness , and not resulting from comparison , but depending wholly on the strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the animal . The instinct of insects and of those animals that produce artificial works , is interesting , and so regular in its productions , that they seem to be living arithmeticians ; yet they thus only appear to us , for in reality these little creatures are not conscious of their powers . Man has the power of thought ; here every thing becomes transparent , clear , distinct and manifest ; where pure thought prevails , there instinct loses its power . Though the animal is separated from the vegetable kingdom by sensation and perception , the plastic power of plants is continued in it , and the animal is formed by it , grows , matures and decays according to its laws . So man is separated from the animal by reason , but on the one hand , he is formed by the same plastic power , and on the other , instinct still appears in the new-born child , whose lips long instinctively for nourishment , and in many of the actions of savages . The principal manifestations of instinct in man , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rest , and of care for the race . But , as has been said above , man is separated from the animal by reason ; he can think , he can will , and by these powers he reigns over his instinct , and subjects it to his discipline . He must live , in order to think ; he must eat and drink , in order to live ; but while the animal is wholly under the control of instinct , and while hunger is a tyrant whose dictates must be obeyed , man can not only eat what he pleases , but also wholly abstain from food , and though urged by an excessive appetite he may nevertheless give away his food , or like Atticus starve himself in the midst of plenty . The animal must eat when /z/ hungry , and it must eat what its instinct directs it to use . The lion can not eat hay , the horse will not eat flesh . Nor will the animal eat more than is sufficient to appease its wants , but man may eat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A glutton is said to have eaten before the Emperor Aurelian a wild hog , a young pig , a whole lamb , one hundred pieces of Roman bread , and to have drank besides , a bucket full of wine . Such too , is the case with all the other natural powers of man . He may live or commit suicide ; the animal must live , and though the rein-deer is said to kill itself by dashing its head against the tree , its death is accidental , for it intends only to free itself from pain , caused by the glutton which fastens upon its head . The whole Hfe of the animal is a slavish one . The sight of the hunter puts the stag to flight , and he must bound over hill and valley , over bush and brook . But when the cannon-ball fell into the room of Charles XII , and he remained calmly in his chair , when the Dutch admiral , in the moment he was about to take a pinch of snuff* , and lost the extended hand by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a British cannonier , whose right hand was torn off " by a ball as he was about to discharge his cannon , used the left with the words , " does the enemy think that I have but one hand ? " they showed , that they by their will , were above the necessity of yielding to fear or the influence of pain . Man possessing reason , has an innate desire for knowledge , which the animal has not . This desire is more than instinct , and not any part of it . This may be easily made clear . The gratification of instinct is pleasure , connected with sensation and perception , with the taste of food , with the motion of muscles or their rest . But the gratification of a desire for knowledge , is pleasure connected with our apperceptions , with our cognitions , with our comprehensions , judgments , and conclusions . In the sphere of instinct all is confined to sense , in the sphere of our intellectual desires , our pleasures , are derived from thought , from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extends not beyond the sphere of sensation , our desire for knowledge includes instinct , and it is this which leads many of us to the objects suited to the exercise of our /z/ peculiar talents . So Linnaeus , when yet an infant , could be silenced by no other toy so quickly , as by a flower put into his hands . So Mozart , when only six years old , would make distinctions between different notes , which his father , likewise a musician , could not perceive . Instinct mingling with our desire for knowledge , constitutes in union with it , talents and natural capacities . The life of man and that of the animals , it must be evident , differ widely , not only in degree , but in kind . Where that of man commences , the animal is left behind . A chasm separates the one from the other . The animal may gaze on man , but it can not understand him , for it is unable to think or to comprehend , and the words spoken to the dog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for man , sounds full of meaning , they are mere signs to him . The life of the animal is like a dream ; and even while waking it dreams . But the life of man is fully awake , it is possessed of self-consciousness , and gifted with the capacity to originate constantly new thoughts , and assisted by the powers of nature to realize them . /z/ Mental philosophy has to consider the mind of man , 1 . In its connection with the body , in its dependence upon it , and through it upon nature . 2 . In its relation to itself . In the former case its doctrines may be embraced under the general term Anthropology , and in the latter that of Psychology . The object of Anthropology is to examine the external influences to which mind is subject , and its modifications produced by them . The object of Psychology is to investigate the nature of mind , as it is conscious of itself and of the difference between it and nature , and as it has rendered these natural influences more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to the influences of physical nature only by its connection with the body . Whatever affects the latter permanently , will also influence the former . The qualities of the mind , produced by these influences , are therefore , likewise permanent . The Mongol , the Malay , and the Negro , are the same at present , physically and psychologically , that they were at the time of Herodotus , who describes them as Scythians , Indians , and Black People . The disposition of the Laplander can not be changed into that of the Frenchman , by emigrating to the South , any more than a transplanted peach-tree can become a palm-tree . This general modification of the mind may , however , be altered by the peculiar capacities of an individual , by temperament , by age , or by exchanging one region for another . Nor is the mind wholly subjected by its connection with the body to these influences of situation /z/ and circumstances . Possessed of consciousness and will , it may subject the body and all its peculiarities , and also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least in a great degree . Anthropology may , therefore , be divided into three parts : or those which treat , I. Of the permanent influences of nature , of race , sex , &c.; upon the mind . II . Of the transient influences of age , sleep , dreaming , &c.; III . Of the power of the mind over the body . /z/ It can not escape the observation of any , that every organic fonrt of Hfe is so affected by the quality of the elements surrounding it , that a certain region of the earth , with the plants and animals growing in it , and characterizing it , seems to form one inseparable whole . No sooner does the student of Natural History perceive a salt spring , than he looks for the plants peculiar to springs of this kind . As the osteologist may judge , from a single bone , of the whole animal , so a single plant may indicate to the scientific botanist , the face and soil of the earth , and the elements in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The seed depends for its growth on a favorable soil , no less than on a favorable season . The plant that luxuriates in a mild and rich soil , when transplanted into another , will wither . The elements that called forth its life are required for its support . With animals the same is the fact ; some of them , like plants , appear and disappear with certain seasons ; others with certain plants . The whole existence of the cherry-worm continues only as long as the cherry ; it then buries itself in the earth , re-appears in the following May as a little black fly , lays its egg in the cherry , and dies . The power that renews the life of the cherry-tree , seems also to revive the cherry- worm . No animal but the dog can live except within certain geographical boundaries , so that we may /z/ have a geography of plants and animals . The connection of certain animals with plants , and that of plants with some peculiar spot on the face of the earth , is truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both found in the south of Africa , and nowhere else . The elements too , in which animals principally live , very essentially affect their natures . The fish , living in the water , is mute , cheerless , serious , and phlegmatic . Insects , on the other hand , playing and spending their lives in the light , are agile , beautifully colored , some of them transparent as light , and most of them courageous , choleric , and very destructive . Little insects will destroy whole woods ; a little ant in the south frequently ruins the finest furniture . Homer was aware of the boldness of insects . When Achilles protects the body of his friend Patroclus , from the Trojans , Homer compares them to flies , which though constantly chased away by the mother sitting by the cradle of her babe , perseveringly repeat their bold attacks . Again , birds live in the air , and the effects of this element on them is expressed in their cheerfulness , their delight in singing , and their sailing about in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . He too must feel the effect of seasons and times , of heat and cold , and of the elements in general . His body develops itself by the laws which the Creator has given to the earth . The earth supports man by the air he breathes , by the food he eats ; it clothes him by furnishing the materials which art prepares ; it protects him from storm and rain , from heat and cold , by affording him stone and timber , furs , skins , and his fuel . The earth and its productions arouse his senses , impress his mind , excite his desires , and exercise his activity . The sight of scanty or luxuriant vegetation on the one hand , and the intercourse of man with animals on the other , as that of the Arabians with their horses , of the Laplanders with their rein-deer , of the Greenlanders or Samoiedes , with their seals , or that of the Moors with their camels , must affect variously his disposition . Man , as long as he lives , depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and characteristic powers must not only influence him , but leave certain traces and permanent impressions on his mind . /z/ The earth , however , became the residence of such a being as man , by the position it occupies in our planetary system . By this position it stands in a relation to the sun , the moon , and to itself . On these relations all Ufe on earth depends . 1 . The particular relation of the earth to the sun produces a higher or lower degree of heat and cold . The general consequence in this respect is , that too great heat arrests the development of mind by relaxing the nervous and muscular system , and that too great cold has the same effect by contracting those systems , so that the Pesheraes in the south fully resemble the Esquimaux in the farthest north , both as to size and form of body , and as to intellect . Again , too sudden transitions from one temperature to another , are less favourable to the health of body and mind , than more gradual ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed with the regular four seasons , so that spring and autumn are interposed between summer and winter , must be more favorable to the intellectual life of man , than one where either summer or winter continues almost without interruption . The same must be said of the transitions from day to night . Where they are very sudden , a relaxation of the system will take place ; where they are more gradual , so that day and night are separated by the twilight of the evening and the dawn of the morning , there the system will feel invigorated by a cool evening after a warm day , and will , by degrees , pass over from the freshness of a balmy morning to the heat of noon . The morning is the threshold of expectation , the day is the season of labor and activity , the evening that of enjoyment and satisfaction , and the night that of rest . The interruption of this natural course , is injurious to body and mind . The temperate zones for these reasons will always be the seat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soft , vernal breezes , the charms of a tender verdure , resting on hills and valleys , which appear gradually , call forth hopes and anticipations and a vigorous activity . As they disappear , a melancholy seriousness and earnestness , a desire for the past , and a consciousness of the vanity of all things will arise in the breast , when forests , and hills , and valleys are gradually stripped of their beauty , /z/ when the country sinks into a deep gloom , and the life of animated nature becomes mute and finally dies away . In the temperate zones , however , are differences worthy to be noticed . " In the East , " says the distinguished Ritter in his well known Geography , " the sun rises , and describes in its royal course the eradiating arch through the South to the West , and thus , considered with reference to the sun , the fountain of all earthly life , this great cosmical relation indicates from the beginning , the first natural division of the surface of the earth . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential character is pronounced in the name Orient ; here is Europe its opposite , the Occident , which is characteristically designated in all the parts of its nature and history in every period . Not only their countries and sky but their plants and animals confirm it ; the voices of all nations express it , by their songs , by the history of their cultivation , by their religions , philosophies and languages . Truly , says a highly gifted writer , the Oriental and Occidental nations are turned away from each other , those with their faces towards morning , these towards the sunset or evening ; those faithfully preserving the seats of antiquity ; these seeking a momentous future in spite of the constant changes of all forms of existence . " The worshippers of the sun are met with in Asia . The brightness of his light is so great , that man , in gazing at it , is lost in admiration and does not notice the things rendered visible by the light , because the glorious light itself too much attracts his eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun sets ; his brightness is less brilliant , though frequently sublime and beautiful . Man is not overcome by it , and when the setting-sun sinks behind the mountain before our eye , the idea that he will illuminate other worlds and return , involuntarily offers itself ; and if we are reminded of our own departure , our breast will be cheered by the hope , that we likewise shall rise again . Hence it is , that the West is the proper field for science , art and history , for there alone man obtains full possession of himself , and a clear consciousness of the world around him . Says Hegel , " These is an East for the history of the world , though East is in itself something relative , Asia is the East /z/ for history , there the external physical sun rises , and in the West he sets : but here the internal sun of self-consciousness rises , which sheds a higher splendor . " It is remarkable , that as the sun rises in the East , so many sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed to man . But nothing gained its full maturity there . The Chinese claim the honor of having discovered gunpowder , but the Jesuits had to furnish them with cannon . They pretend to have invented the printing press , but m yet they have only presses of wood with immoveable letters . What Greece and Rome were in ancient times , Europe and America are in modern . 2 . The influence of the moon on the mind of man . Certain as the influence of the moon is upon the earth , it is very Hmited on man . Some diseases of the mind are undoubtedly modified by the moon , and physicians are of the opinion that bodily diseases are much affected by it . Yet on the whole its influence is not sufficiently ascertained , and we have to confine it here to the effects produced by its light on our imagination . These effects may be seen in the poetry and mythology of nations , and , whenever perceptible , are highly fantastical . The dim light of the moon does not delineate objects accurately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Greenlander imagines the heavenly bodies , sun and moon , pursuing each other in despair of success . " The earth , " they say , " rests on immense pillars of ice , that constantly threaten ruin . Demons of darkness desire its destruction , and they are only restrained from dashing the tottering fragment to pieces by the howl of Angekoks , which fill the night with their shrieks from dark , icy and barren regions . " Such fancies come upon us from the hour of midnight , that begets the fear of spectres , and that in dim moonlight makes us see a ghost in every object . 3 . The local influence of the earth upon the mind of man . The influence of the sun depends upon the union of his light with the activity of the earth . The rays , that fall upon morasses , will produce poisonous vapors ; those , that in the same region fall upon sand , deadly heat ; and those that are absorbed by moist oases , a cheerful vegetation . The nature of the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth surrounds man , and possesses him and keeps him , whithersoever he goes , as long as he enjoys the light of the sun . But the surface of the earth is in different regions peculiarly modified by soil , by productions , by scenery , by the serenity and color of the sky , by air and atmosphere . Man must be born on some particular spot , and its whole character will impress itself strongly upon his youthful mind . All his desires , every thought of his soul , every one of his wishes , every hope is more or less interwoven with this impression of his home , and his whole disposition greatly depends upon the region of his birth . So much is this the case , that when man leaves the home of his youth , and when new scenery , new objects , new customs are contrasted with those by which his early desires and habits were modified , and from which they in some measure proceeded , he becomes sick with longing for his home . His feelings and views , desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his early home , are still the same in his breast , but the visible world around him no longer corresponds with them , and this contradiction induces him constantly to recall the image of his native country . This great influence of locality may further be seen in the modifications which it imparts to the character and disposition of men . If we compare the Abyssinians and Shangallas , who live in the same zone , we shall be most forcibly struck with the truth of this assertion . The former , seeking the high Alps of north Africa , which are covered with rich prairies , keep large herds of cattle , make use of the horse , of iron , &c.; and are a noble race , strong , versatile , acute , active , and possessed of a chivalrous disposition . Living under a serene sky , in a pure atmosphere , and a mild temperature , they are cultivated and humane , and would be much more so , were they not surrounded on all sides by enemies , so that they themselves , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful flower , but like the thistle beset with thorns . The Shangallas on the other hand , dwelling in the morasses and swamps along the river Mahareb , inhaling poisonous vapors , submitting to all kinds of diseases , living on lizards , on the flesh of the ostrich , rhinoceros , elephant , and on fish , never think of improving their /z/ homes , or exchanging them for a better region . Thick woods with large trees , that afford an easy protection from the heat of the sun and wooden lances , is all they desire . When the rainy season commences , they , as do the rainworms when the sun shines , disappear in caves , which they quickly dig in the soft sand-stone along the steep , inaccessible walls of the high rocks . " The negroes along the coasts , " says the celebrated Ritter , " differ as widely from those of the mountains , as the inhabitants of cities from those of the country , and so the negroes that live on mountains , differ widely from the negroes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of the earth , are those of the Highlands , Plains and Coasts : ( 1 . ) Highlands . The purity of the air , and the liberty with which the inhabitants roam on their highlands , gives them the spirit of independence , that makes them reluctant to be restrained by laws . They feel depressed when they descend into the valleys ; they can not breathe freely , their eyes can not pierce the depths of distant horizons ; the color of the sky , plants , and animals are all so different , that they pine away with home-sickness . Wandering from place to place , free as the bijds of the air , they lead a careless and cheerful life . Right and justice rest in the strength of the arm ; hospitality and robbery spring up with equal ease , and in the same breast . No tie keeps the Highlanders together , except that of family connection . They split into small clans , and though wars should unite them for a time , they are dispersed in a moment after their battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and like it disappear . Living in the bosom of nature , however , being strangers to the luxuries of cities , their characters are strong , noble and high-minded . The Foulahs dwelling on the high Alps of Africa , stand as high in this respect above their neighbors living below them , as the natives of Cashmere above the Hindoos. ( 2 . ) Plains and Valleys , on the other hand , by the richness of their soil , and numerous streams , invite to a settled life . Agriculture is carried on , and its success being dependent on the regular return of seasons , it leads to order and regularity . The idea of property becomes more developed , for no one would be willing to bestow labor upon /z/ the cultivation of land , unless he were sure of the exclusive possession of it , and of a permanent protection of his claims . A regularly established government becomes indispensable . Valleys have at all times been the seats of large empires . Man , by the power of mind subdues the wildness of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold and snow of winter loves to dwell , he improves the climate , and having once satisfied the necessities of life , he turns his attention to science and art . ( 3 . ) Coasts form a strong , bold , independent and kindhearted people . The ocean was not intended , as Horace sings , to separate nations and sections of the earth . Mountains and not waters , Hegel remarks in his Philosophy of History , are barriers to the intercourse of different people , and Cesar , in crossing the Alps , caused a new epoch in history . Waters between different countries , though vast as the Atlantic , do not keep nations asunder , but as man builds bridges over rivers , so he erects moving bridges , or as Homer says , creates horses of the deep , that will unite one coast with another . Europe and America have more intercourse than Spain and France , though the latter are only separated by the Pyrenees . The mind and disposition of man , living along the coast , near the surface of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immensity of the ocean fills the breast with an idea of the infinite , the rising and sinking waves , the constantly changing bosom of the deep , remind him of the uncertainty of all earthly things , of their changeableness , and of the necessity of assisting one another . The watery element invites us , for it offers wealth and a knowledge of distant countries . Its dangers render bold and intrepid , prudent and brave , and give us a feeling of the power of man , who successfully combats the rage of storais and billows , while standing on a mere plank . Before dismissing this topic we have to add a word on the elementary influence of the earth on man . It is well established , that a clear sky , and a pure mountain air invigorate , while a gloomy and moist atmosphere depresses . The sky of Italy and that of England differ no less than the dispositions 0f their inhabitants . The vapors arising from the soil , ar of importance . Pythia , chewing a few leaves /z/ and sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece , to become so inspired by the vapors of the grotto , that she could foresee the future .  --  Next to the atmosphere , the food we take , will influence our disposition . If our digestive power is strengthened by it , our spirits will rise . The black soup of the Spartans , which their youth had to prepare for themselves by mixing bread with water and a few herbs , was simple but strong , as was the character of the Lacedemonians . An Athenian could not relish it ; he desired more refined food . When after having been deprived for a considerable time of a favorite dish , we partake again moderately of it , we feel cheered ; or when after having endured for hours a burning thirst , we approach a Httle grove and lay ourselves down by a clear and cool fountain under shady trees , we feel happy and cheerful , and if while thirsty , we would scarcely have listened to the petitions of a beggar , we then feel full of sympathy and kindness . Man may eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not do , he may overcome the natural aversion that he has to certain kinds of food . The soldiers of Napoleon fed on cats and horse-flesh . The principal food , however , taken by man , is derived from the animal and vegetable kingdoms , and consists of meat or vegetables , or jlour , milk and fruit . Each of these have different effects upon him . Meat increasing the activity of bile , renders him choleric and passionate . Food prepared of flour , favors a phlegmatic disposition , and is therefore recommended by physicians as a wholesome dish in warm climates , where the digestive activity is much accelerated . Milk , and what is prepared of it , preserves a child-like and harmless disposition , as may be seen from shepherds . The Foulahs on the Alps of Africa , living principally on milk and butter , are said to be a mild and gentle nation ; they honor father and mother above all , and their highest title is that of Father and Mother , which they use as we do that of Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally vegetables have been commended at all times by persons of sedentary habits . Pythagoras recommended them to his disciples , and Newton abstained from meat when he wished to study deeply , and Hved almost entirely on colewort . Some fruits are said to strengthen /z/ the memory , and some herbs to excite the organs of speech . It is admitted by all , that strong drinks , and especially distilled liquors , weaken the memory , deprive of self-possession , undermine health , make men quarrelsome and passionate , and call forth brutal desires in a shocking manner . Some of them paralize the whole power of the soul , take away all remembrance , and while they excite bodily activity and set all the members in motion , they annihilate the capacity of man to control and direct his steps , and as though an evil genius had gained a magic dominion over the motions of the body , the soul sees the dangers , into which the body is driven by an evil demon , and can not rescue it from them . The effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too well known to demand a particular notice here . As man may eat and drink what he chooses , so he may eat much or little . He may eat more , and bear hunger better than any animal . A dog supported merely by sugar died after a few weeks ; geese fed on starch were found dead after twenty-four days . But the Arab , without any injurious effects , lives cheerfully on a little gum for many weeks in his desert ; Johanna Naunton supported herself for seventy-eight days by the juice of lemon . Renaud , on the other hand , Archbishop of Bourges , slept only two hours , but had eight meals a day . Among the Kirgises a man of good appetite , eats a whole lamb , the tail of which alone weighs twenty pounds . Yet we must be careful , lest our wish to acknowledge the dependence of man on these influences , should induce us to over-value them . The mild Ionian sky with its soft and gentle breezes no doubt breathed many an image into the songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled the breast of Ossian with the remembrance of by-gone ages , and with visions of fantastic forms produced by the dim moonlight sleeping on the heaths , or by the moaning winds , as they swept over them ; but neither the Ionian sky nor the heaths of Scotland were sufficient to call forth the genius of Homer or of Ossian . The Otomake , bordering the Oronoke , are blessed with a beautiful cHmate and a rich soil , and yet they prefer living on potter 's clay , /z/ 7EESn /z/ which they roast , to cultivating the land . On theother hand , we find a noble set of men , of great stature , of high principles of honor , and of a scientific spirit , high in the north , in Scandinavia . The sky is cold , the soil is poor ; the winter never recedes from the high rocks ; the summer appears only in the valleys , and for a short time calls forth a dark green along the declivities . Yet while an uninterrupted silence reigns over nature , the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science and nobleness of character love to dwell there , and a firm , resolute will knows how to meet the power of an unfriendly climate . The constitution of man fits him to five every where under heaven , and to support his innate dignity . No region is destitute of him ; though individuals may suffer from emigration , and find it difficult to become acclimated , the human race is at home every where on the face of the earth . Up to the eightieth degree of North latitude , along the Polar ice , the Greenlander and Esquimaux live ; down to the sixtieth degree of South latitude , the Pesheraes exist on the Terra del Fuego . Where mercury becomes malleable , where birds fall down dead from the air , where animals howl from the effects of cold , there man may live ; and he can also endure a heat , that is above the warmth of blood .  --  It can not be denied , however , that much depends on these influences for the disposition of man , though different people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same soil , exhibit quite a different aspect . The Foulahs , Gallas , and Abyssinians live on the same high Alps , and yet a considerable difference is perceptible in their cultivation and disposition . The Mandingoes , a numerous nation , of beautiful form , open , frank and cheerful , refined and simple in their manners , have a republican government , and are the merchants of Northern Africa . Close to them live the Negroes , stupid and rude , voluptuous and cowardly , rapacious , and without regard for justice or law .  --  Considering such facts , we must acknowledge , that it is not the climate alone , nor the soil , nor the food , nor the manner of living , which causes such differences in mankind , but that there must be some cause in man himself , a cause , which will incline him to form certain habits , to seek for a home that will correspond with his feelings and de- /z/ sires . Correct as it is , to consider customs and habits as dependent on the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that a prevailing inclination attracts man to a particular region . /z/ Man is every where the same , and there is no specific difference in the human race , as there is in animals . AH men , wherever they live , to whatever race they belong , have reason ; they eeZ , they Am/ : , they will . We can not speak therefore of different kinds of men , as we speak of different kinds of animals , because that which constitutes man , is the same in all individuals , and only exists in a modified form . The differences that exist between the races men do not proceed from the absence or presence of certain faculties or bodily organs but from their peculiar strength or modification , which can not be explained by the influence of climate , but must be ascribed to an innate difference . Such is the color of man ; cold regions will not bleach the negro , and the southern heat of Africa will not convert the Moor into a black man . The disposition of the mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proportions of the face and language , exhibit likewise such strongly marked differences , as will enable us to distinguish by them one race from another . These different qualities may be anticipated before the birth of a child , and nothing can extinguish them except amalgamation . Yet while these differences can not he denied , they are not such as exist between two species of the same kind . Hence it is , that while in the world of animals every individual , the infusoria excepted , is connected with its genus by the species to which it belongs , as the single ourang-outang by his species with the monkey-kind , every individual man is in connection with mankind , directly through himself and not by a species . We can not speak therefore of different species of mankind , but only of various races . By the term race , we understand that union of individuals , which is brought about by mere propagation , independent of history , or /z/ affection , or common interest . The English and Germans are of the same race , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivation and interests . It is certain that these races exist , but it is difficult to say how they all spring from one pair . This difficulty has led many to consider the different races as having sprung from so many different roots , which it would be impossible to reduce to one common origin and which are united only by intellectual and moral elements , by reason and will . There have not been wanting those , however , who with great acuteness have philosophically proved , what we know through revelation concerning the origin of the human race . No less difficult is it to determine the exact number of the human races , because the varieties of tribes , and the transitions from one race to another are so many , that they become easily confounded with each other , when we attempt to classify them . Hence it is , that there are so many different divisions made by the learned ; while Linnaeus , and Leibnitz admitted four races , Meiners accepted only two ; Pownal , three ; Hunter , four ; Buffon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blumenbach and Virey , five . The latter is the more commonly adopted view . According to this we have the Caucasian , American , Malay , Mongol and Negro races . A delineation of their bodily forms belongs rather to the science called Natural Description of Man than to Anthropology , as the question concerning the origin of the human race , xchere ? ivhen ? how ? and by what means it was called into existence belongs to the Natural History of Man , two sciences that have received the particular attention of the celebrated Blumenbach . It would be superfluous here to give a characteristic of the disposition , intellect , and moral capacities of the different races , as every good geography , and especially every philosophy of history , furnishes one more complete than our space would permit us to give . All that is required here , is to acknowledge a permanent distinction between the races , which not only affects the body , but also the mind . /z/ National Differences . 1 . Cruelty and an absence of love and mercy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrariness , and oppression of the weaker , characterize the the savage . Morality , a sense of obligation and duty , are not acknowledged ; and the barbarian , as he does what is pleasing and useful to him , so he prevails by the arm of strength . Nor has he any feeling of personal respect or any regard for truth , beauty , and honor , but destroys whatever will not serve his sensual desires . The first step to civilization is a willingness to submit our individual will to laws and duties , and to seek for liberty no longer in our own arbitrariness . To the savage this step seems to involve the loss of his Hberty , for genuine liberty is unknown to him . A limitation of selfish desires and passions , a restraint of arbitrariness and mere good pleasure , is to him a limitation of liberty , and hence he hates laws and duties . Fond of his liberty , he can not think of relinquishing his stage of cultivation for one , that in his views offers the opposite of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of nature , that he does not distinguish between its activity and that of mind , but views both as merged into each other . We , accustomed from youth to separate soul and body , mind and nature , find it almost impossible to transfer ourselves into the life of the savage in this respect ; and yet this sphere of thinking and feeling in reference to nature , constitutes the most essential portion of the intellectual existence of the savage . From the mountains to the valleys and brooks , all is full of meaning and possessed of will and reason to him . The forms of the mountains , the one being tableformed , another piercing the clouds with its peaks , a third round ; all this is not accidental ; now clouds gather around them , mist covers them , lightnings flash about them ; and now again they lie clear and open in the sun , and their outlines are fully exhibited by the distribution of light and shade . This , in the imagination of the savage , is all dependent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from dark grottoes , refreshing them when thirsty , and dancing over stone and pebble , constantly in /z/ motion must be full of life and spirits . The plant , that full of energy and vigor , proceeds from its own seed and luxuriantly spreads and grows as if by its own power , terminating in a beautiful cup , which bursting , unfolds the choicest colors that rest among the dark green leaves of the branches , attracts his attention and admiration . There must be a life like that which animates himself , or even better ;  - -  he worships the plant :  --  But above all he adores the animal ; it is silent , it communicates not , and yet it walks about , eats and drinks ; it builds its nest artificially on lofty branches , has holes like the fox , houses like the beaver ; catches the fly by a web , and leads a life full of mystery to the savage . Some Indian tribe traces its origin to a certain species of the bear , and whenever they kill one , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know he loves his grand children and is willing to satisfy their hunger . In this life of the savage , sensual desire rules over him , his attention can be elicited only by objects that may have immediate reference to himself . It is always a single object , this or that horse , this or that dog , that interests him . His desire is without measure , it is not satisfied until its object is annihilated ; his enemy is not only killed , he must be eaten too . In the strength of this desire , magic has its origin , for it is subjectively the desire to realize what we wish by the mere expression of our will , without any intermediate causes . 3 . Savages have no organized government . All life is perfect in proportion as it is well organized . The animal life begins with that of the infusorium , but it is highly imperfect in that stage , and equally as imperfectly organized . There is no heart visible , no brain , no liver , there are no functions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in these httle animals . So it may be said the savage has a , government , but it is only the beginning of that of civilization . Whatever is organized lias , on the one hand , identity of life or a common soul , a common spirit , and on the other , a variety of members , through which this one life is diffused , and all of which represent it . These members or organs differ from each other , as the branch from the trunk , and yet they have the same life . Each has a peculiar office , and yet all serve but one /z/ purpose . A well organized government has likewise but one soul  --  morality and liberty . The energy of this soul must show itself by creating a number of distinct institutions and offices , each of which differs from the other by a particular activity allotted to it , while all activities and all offices are united by proceeding from the same common soul , and in being pervaded by it . In such a government all are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in such a government alone , it is possible that occupations and ranks in the greatest variety can co-exist without any interference , and that all the wants of man may be satisfied , for in it each want has its corresponding organ by which it receives its satisfaction . Farmers and merchants , teachers and politicians , mechanics and all other classes of men are so many organs of civil life , all of which , while each has an existence of its own , and seems to be active for itself like the leaves of a large tree sustain and support the whole . Plato illustrates this beautifully by showing the evil consequences that would result to one who while he had capacity and skill for making shoes , would also have to be his own tailor and carpenter and blacksmith . He certainly would do nothing properly . But if he makes shoes for himself and others , and if others , skilled in tailoring , in the business of the carpenter , &:c.; make his dresses , and build his houses , all will be better* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has a pecufiar talent . 4 . Savages have no history . History is the intellectual process that begins with the less perfect , and passes over to the more perfect , for it develops what is in man . The plant exists already as a possible existence in the germ , but undeveloped . Its development exhibits , by various forms from the root up to the seed , all that is contained in the germ . Though the seed gains nothing by this process , since it terminates merely in a multiplication of seed like itself , we having observed it once , we may know all the possible forms which it has the power of producing . Yet the life of the plant is monotonous , always passing through the same course ; and hence it can not be said to have a history , because it does not improve nor deteriorate , and one plant is as complete and perfect /z/ as any other of the same species . But man can increase in perfection unhmited ; the last stage he has attained in the cultivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . This may be made clear by an example from nature . For here we see , that the plastic power of the plant first produces a single leaf ; but this leaf grows up into a trunk ; this again branches out into twigs , and the twigs produce leaves , &c.,; so that always the last production contains the germ of a new one . Yet in the vegetable kingdom , the last production only repeats the preceding one ; the plant is and always will be confined to particular limits . History , on the other hand , has a constant tendency to remove the limits of the present , to go beyond them , to improve and to advance . This progress does not disregard the contents of the past , but it will include them when nations do not become stationary , and fix themselves on the customs and habits of the past as the Chinese . So the trunk does not annihilate the root , though it is a higher development , but it truly preserves it . History includes the past by making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we live in the spirit of an age , interest in it and predilection for it will not permit us to perceive its real worth , but we generally overvalue it . When from the elements contained in it , the spirit is forced to assume a new form and produce new customs and views ; we become conscious both of what was good or objectionable in the old , because then we shall be free and impartial in our judgment . So when a strong inclination , love , for example , holds us chained , we shall not be conscious of its nature while it reigns over us , but no sooner are we freed from it , than it becomes known and manifest to us in all its qualities . From all this it follows , that when the many intellectual capacities slumbering in man are historically developed , he must become conscious of them , and that what before he possessed only by nature , will then come within the sphere of his voluntary action . He thus not only gains , but is essentially changed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost , but is constantly pressing onward . Man is born free , but unless he is conscious of his freedom he does not possess it . Again , in nature every thing develops itself peaceably without a struggle ; but man , conscious of // every change in himself , has to undergo conflicts in making these changes . The idea of development ever pre-supposes some thing to be developed ; this must exist previously , and remain the same in the development , only that what there is in it is drawn out . With man , reason and will are to be unfolded in all their riches . Both , in the savage , are sunk in the life of nature , which by its energy , and by the fullness of its sensual enjoyments , keeps him in bondage . Reason and will ought to break loose from this life , but being satisfied with their state , they would act against themselves in doing so . JHence the savage has no history , for he is what he always has been . Civilization is connected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . History is , in what it records , the development of mind ; it shows how the savage consciousness became more and more disciplined , its powers drawn out , its mere possibilities realized ; and how a rude , passionate , arbitrary will , became refined and subject to the control of higher authority . The history of a nation is its character ; if it be humane , the nation will be so ; if bloody and rude , Hke that of Rome , the nation will be cruel ; for history only develops what is in man . Civilized nations differ then from savages by morality in its most extensive sense , by organized governments , and by having a history . Nations differ from each other as races and tribes , but their national differences are historical and consequently known to themselves , and thus they lose their strangeness and inimical power of opposition . These differences are expressed in the national manner of thinking and acting , in literature and art , language and style , customs and habits , morals and civil laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter into the habits of man , and whether a person is born of one or another nation , is by no means a matter of indifference . The Roman , even though the doctrine of a metamorphosis were true , could not at once be an Englishman . Anthropology has , therefore , to acknowledge a modification of mind , pro . duced by national difference ; and we shall give a short characteristic of the following nations , the French , the Italians , the English , and the Germans . /z/ 1 . The French . The Frenchman has been distinguished ever since the time of Caesar for vivacity and excitability . He is full of enthusiasm , and easily roused . His cheerfulness can not be eradicated even by misfortune , for the quickness and elasticity of his mind makes him seek by every possible means , either to remove the evil , or to render it more light . He deserves particular praise for refinement , socialness , and a great desire to anticipate the wishes of all those with whom he has intercourse . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delicate feeling of propriety and decency , and in natural taste . Even when he disagrees with a person , or disapproves of any thing , he tries to express himself politely . With regard to intellect , clearness of understanding prevails in him ; he submits every thing in science and poetry to its laws , and is particularly fond of mathematics . Though he is an admirer of poetry , his imagination , subject to the cool deliberation and calculation of his understanding , is not permitted to produce the mystical , nor to be active , by a kind of inspiration , but all its productions are accompanied by reflection , and hence they have more the character of oratory and eloquence , than that of pure poetry . The Frenchman is penetrating , spirited , sprightly , and witty , but he wants soul and solidity , and reverence for existing relations . The Frenchman however is no less proud of his Troubadours than of Lafontaine ; of Racine , of Corneille and Moliere ; of Descartes and Pascal , of Crebillon , Destouches and Marivau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The weakness of the Frenchman is his want of deep , decided individuality ; his desire to be generally acceptable prevents the formation of a very determined character , for such an one will always stand more or less harshly opposed to society . He wants earnestness , seriousness , and depth of feeling , which the liveliness of his wit , light joviality , that interest only by their constantly changing elements , render impossible . His whole character , as Kant remarks , is expressed in his language , for what language can translate words like these : frivolite ; galantrie : petUniaitre ; coquette ; bon mot ; naivete ? /z/ 2 . The Italians . The name of the Italian reminds us at once of the land of beauty , of serene skies , and lovely scenery , of splendid sunsets and sunrises ; and as if the genius that has thrown such loveliness over his country , had erected a dwelling in the breast of the Itahan , animated his hand , and formed his imagination : we see his public saloons and churches and buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , painting and sculpture , have all met with a friendly reception under that mild sky , and it is in Italy , where even now , we must seek for their finest models . It has justly been remarked , that as the Frenchman is distinguished for good taste in society , and for refined manners , so the Italian is characterized by a most refined taste in art . Imagination is prominent in his intellectual powers ; it is nourished by the charms of nature , and easily excited by a hot and fiery temperament . Dante 's poem of the Universe ; Petrarca 's songs of love ; Boccaccio 's novels ; Ariosto 's smoothness of style , and flow of images and ideas ; Tasso 's Jerusalem Delivered ; Gozzi 's Comedies ; Alfieri 's Tragedies , and Manzoni 's lyric and dramatic poetry , are all of them known to all the world . The Italian is , however , less celebrated for his scientific spirit . The dark side of the Italian character is his great selfishness , and his unbridled desire for gain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and checks . He is fond of pomp , of public processions , carnivals , masquerades , public buildings , and is willing to endure poverty if he can only have these pleasures . In general it may be said , that no where do the greatest poverty and riches live in closer connection than in Italy . The Italian is revengeful , and his knife is always ready for use . Banditti may be hired at all times . Cruelty is well marked in his character , and expresses itself even in his physiological experiments . We need only advert to those instituted by Spallanzani. 3 . The English . The Englishman possesses a manly , solid , and great disposition . He has spread his political power over a large /z/ portion of the earth , and by his commercial life he seems to be destined to cultivate rude nations . This gives him a strong feeling of importance . He is devoted to principles of honor and gentlemanliness , and always supports a lofty character . The greatness of his character expresses itself in all his enterprizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale . A feeling of independence pervades all Englishmen ; surrounded by the ocean , England is protected from inimical attacks , while its familiarity with that element enables it to make itself important in the eye of every political power in the world . The Englishman has a deep feeling of personal dignity , and maintains it with strong emphasis . A good , strong , common sense is his inheritance , and he is practical by nature . He comprehends quickly and accurately ; perceives at first glance the combination of circumstances , and the most intricate complication of things , and in a moment devises means and ways to remove difficulties , and even to turn them to advantage . His judgment is acute and penetrating , and in whatever direction he desires to extend his business , he has the skill to do so . He is resolute and persevering , always active , and intent on his business . Nor is the Englishman destitute of true and genuine imagination ; he has a full share of it . He loves the sublime more than the beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the greatest poet not only of England , but of all nations , unites the beautiful and sublime . He loves to name Milton , Scott , Fielding and Goldsmith , Moore and Byron , etc. , all of whom are poets of great genius . The English poetry is full of seriousness , of melancholy , and again of humor , and the most splendid imagery . Every where do we discover a desire to solve the great enigmas of life , or to meditate on and examine them . In science the Englishman is solid and accurate . He distinguishes well , and investigates accurately , and observes with a great deal of sound judgment . The French are clear and ingenious thinkers , but often superficial ; the English are no less clear , but more profound , more solid writers , and stand in point of science and literature , decidedly above their rivals in politics . The weak side of the English is a certain exclusiveness. /z/ and a national pride , that too often prevents them from acknowledging the good qualities of other nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Germans . The German is not characterized by traits in disposition or intellect that are very showy or striking , hke the ItaUan or Frenchman , but he unites in himself a number of good qualities , that are met with in other nations , and possesses them in such a harmony , that none prevails decidedly above the other , but all are permitted to be active . Yet there are a few features in his character which distinguish him decidedly . He is devoted to order and regularity , and always anxious to acknowledge the authority of law . He is therefore a good , quiet , and peaceable citizen , opposed to innovation , and full of a pious reverence for antiquity , for the views and customs of his ancestors . With this reverence he connects much prudence and circumspection , a regard for the future , and nothing is more foreign to him than frivolity or levity . Serious and earnest by nature , inclined to deep and solid meditation , and to lasting and warm emotions , he seeks for a worthy and noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one that terminates in time , or even in the sphere of his own existence . His genuine disposition it would be difficult to express by English words , for its consists in treuherzigkeit , ( trueheartedness ) gemuthlichkeit , bedenklichkeit , ( considerateness , ) gruehellust , and in a ahnungsvollen , geistrichen Ueherschwinglichkeit und Schwaermerei . His talents are of a high order , but need long and much poHsh . Like the diamond , however , they will throw their light in all directions , when once called forth . W. V. Humboldt remarks , that those grapes which are not rapidly , but gradually ripened by a moderate heat , yield the best wine ; experience teaches , that the richer a being is , the more it has to develope , the more time it will require to mature . The German certainly becomes by a long training , more conscious of all his mental powers than he would if his intellectual developement were more rapid . He loves truth , and seeks for it , independent of any selfish consideration . He is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most faithful and perfect translations of all the most celebrated works in the world . The English enjoy all the productions of the earth and of every climate , the German appropriates to himself all the products of genius of all nations . As the Englishman is devoted to gentlemanlinessj so the German reveres honor . With him the " word of honor " is equivalent to an oath , and any one that breaks it is considered an outlaw . The Germans were at all times fond oi personal Xiheriy , and their history can not be understood without acknowledging this fact . This fondness for liberty was one of the sources of the Reformation , as it also animated the nation in 1813 . The German is proud of the Niehelaagen lied , of his Minne Singers , of Lessing and Klopstock , of Wieland and Herder , of Schiller and Goethe and Jean Paul Frederick Richter . He numbers among his philosophers a Leibnitz and Kant , a Fichte , Schelling , and Hegel . He claims a Herschel and Kepler ; a John V. Mueller and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Painting , Duerer and Cornelius are known to all the world ; in Sculpture , Dannecker , Ranch , etc. ; in Music , Sebastian , Bach , Haydn , Handel , Mozart , and Beethoven are greatly distinguished . The German style of art , when compared with the Italian may be said to be significant , while the Italian is expressive . The weak side of the German is his pedantry in science and art , his too great dependance on external circumstances , which no doubt results from his regard for the customs and views of his ancestors and of all with whom he has any intercourse . The Englishman feels all the importance of his personality , and speaking of himself , says : " / my self . The German is willing to forget himself in the presence of others . It is Shakspeare 's delight to represent persons ; Goethe 's great forte is to characterize the objective world around him , and the different situations , in which persons might have to live . From his devotion to honor , the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from his thorough and innate love of liberty , he frequently when passing over from a monarchical to a republican government , becomes rude , and ready to set all authority at defiance . /z/ JNo two other nations in the world have exercised a more continued influence upon each other , than the Germans and the English . Their characters resemble each other in many respects , in seriousness , in fondness for deep and solid meditations , and in devotion to principles of honor and faithfulness . There vere times , when English literature and English institutions were imitated throughout Germany ; and there were others , when England drew richly from German works . The German law is still the basis of the English ; and Scott and Byron show by their writings , that they were warm admirers of Goethe . It may be asked : what is the exact difference , where there is so great an affinity 1 The general answer will be this ; " The English are more practical , the Germans more theoretical . " This answer is however insulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The English have their Cudworth , Locke , Bacon , David Hume , and many others ; they have their great Divines and their Toets , all of whom were theoretical . The Germans on the other hand have changed , not by theory , but by their practical exertions the face of politics , by the invention of gun powder ; that of practical religion , by the great reformation and that of science and general cultivation by the Printing Art . It is evident that the words and theoretical , * are used improperly . They are placed in opposition to each other by the above judgment , while they are intrinsically united . Real practice needs much theory and the better the latter , the more solid will be the former . Genuine theory will always have practice in view as its end and chief object . Practice and theory are related to each other and the question is : what is the difference between them ? 1 . Practice is altogether as impossible without knowledge , as an action without a will . But this knowledge may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to application in life and contains the rules for it . As knowledge it must differ from action . All action has always a single , particular case in view ; knowledge the general , that will apply to many individual cases ; the objects of action are peculiarly modified by manifold circumstances , by local and temporary influences ; the rules of knowledge are the same and action and knowledge do not entirely cover each other . But with all our actions we have in view something general too and thus action and knowledge are united . We desire either to realize the good , the true , the noble , the beautiful in our lives by action , and in this case we must know what is good and true . This is the fact with practical religion ; without a theoretical acquaintance with the Old and New Testaments , or with the nature of God , our practical religion would be idolatry or heathenism , which is practical but has no theory ; and it would therefore introduce vice and falsehood rather than the true /z/ and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yet riches also are something general , and without an idea of property , of time and its duration , of right and laws , that guarantee an exclusive possession , we could not acquire wealth . But a code of laws , like the English , presupposes much knowledge . Rightly understood then action and knowledge do not contradict , but presuppose one another and it is only want of a teleological or theoretical judgment , awkwardness in applying it , a want of harmonious cultivation of all the faculties of mind , when the theorist is no more successful in his practice , than the quack . 2 . As practice is impossible without knowledge , so theory is worth nothing without practice . The difference between practical and theoretical knowledge is this . The one contains the elements of an immediate application , the other not . The one asks : what use can be made of this truth 1 the other : what is this truth ? wherein does it consist The former seeks truth on account of the benefit , to be derived from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for the sake of something else , which it is to serve as means . In the one case , truth is rendered subservient to selfish interests , in the other it is considered more valuable than any thing else , the supreme good . Practical knowledge , having only usefulness in view , must spread itself over a large field ; it thus becomes superficial . But no knowledge is less practical , than that which does not exhaust its subjects . Truly practical knowledge is solid and thorough ; but all solid knowledge must be theoretical , must be acquired for its own sake , and as it is in itself , since every relation to something else renders it impure . No knowledge is more practical than that of mathematics , and yet it is entirely ilieoretical . So is no language more philosophical and theoretical than the German , and yet it expresses every shade of feeling and is extremely practical . Without examining here the origin of knowledge , we will only exhibit in a few words two kinds of theory . Both are united @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner of representing them . The one begins with single facts , observes and examines them , unites such as exhibit essential affinities under a common head , and as those excluded will show something common with each other , new classes will be formed , and a number of classes more allied to each other , than others will again become subordinate to a higher one . Every day adds new facts , and as the whole exists in its parts , this can not be seen until all the latter have been collected . No one can say when this will be effected . According to this theory all heads and classes , or rather principles seem to have been gained by observation , and by uniting those facts , that show similarity . Yet unless man had formed an idea of union previous to his making experiments , he would and could not think of investigating single cases , since his investigations could not have any scientific object . This object is the union sought for . The other theory begins therefore with the principle of science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It does not suffer itself to be drowned in the constantly increasing number of facts , nor to become confused by them . The principle is the life of all experiments , and is the same to science , that the centre is to a periphery . All the parts of science are organized by it and filled with it , as every member of the body indicates the presence of the soul . It attracts , what belongs to sciences and arranges it , and excludes what is foreign to it . This principle giving the science a systematical character , throws light upon all its parts by the mutual support , they afford to each other , and which proceeds from their position and relation to each other . This theory , it can not be denied , has little reference to practice ; it will exhaust truth , it will exhibit science as a whole ; it does not desire to give rules for action . What then is its value 1 The former theory is engaged with single actions , for which it gives the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The former reduces the many single instances of language to general rules , the latter unfolds before us the principles of grammar , gives us the philosophy of it , and shows the necessity and connexion of the many single rules . Both kinds of grammers are necessary . They are related to each other as history and philosophy of history . The latter can not be written without the former ; yet the former is a mere collection of dry bones without the latter . The one demands great discrimination and penetrating acuteness ; the other a productive genius . The one makes fine ' distinctions in given /z/ This difference is one that in the most decisive manner affects both body and mind . It is not transitory , but remains the same throughout life , so that many theologians have been led to ask whether the two sexes  --  something analogous to which we discover in the Negative and Positive poles , in contraction and expansion , in the relation of the sun to the earth ,  --  will not be continued after death . The sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization in all , and not only in some of its parts is different in man and woman . Bones and muscles are stronger and more angular in man , and more tender and round in woman , while some are larger in the latter than in the former . Again , not only /z/ the anatomical and organical systems , but also their functions differ in both . In man the arterial and cerebral systems prevail , and with them irritability ; in woman the venous and ganglion systems and with them plasticity and sensibility . So the lungs are stronger , and hence the voice fuller , and respiration more copious in man , while the liver and its activity prevails in woman . Skin and hair are more soft in woman than in man , and it is evident , that the body of the one is better qualified than that of the other to endure labor . 2 . Psychologically , Man and woman differ both in moral disposition and in mental qualities , as will appear from the following comparison . Woman . As it respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chastity in feeling and imagination , in word and action , is the principal virtue that either of choice or unconsciously reigns in the bosom of woman . It is tender and delicate , like an exotic plant , andrcannot endure exposure . Hence woman shrinks from appearing in public , whether in the pulpit or the rostrum , or with the sword in the hand , as the Maid of Orleans . The family is her sphere of action , there she arranges and orders what man gathers , and with propriety and taste embellishes the house , and renders it attractive . She desires whatever increases domestic comfort , as furniture and dress , order and cleanliness , full chests and drawers .  --  Love is the second prevailing virtue , that adorns her character . Without it she is like a closed blossom which exhibits neither its beauty or tts fragrance ; love reveals her inward mystery . She may love and not be aware of it , and such love is tender and innocent . But when once she loves , she gives her whole qwq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown around her by nature . Secondly , as it respects mental qualities ; here Feeling predominates ; she receives easily , and appropriates quickly ; she forms what she receives and feels herself attracted by all that can touch the heart . Her thinking rests more on feeling than on faith , and is not directed to skeptical investigations . It is not distinguished for productiveness , for if we look at the fine arts , we can not discover a single woman who has established a new school either in painting , in music , or sculpture . Some women have become celebrated for their skill in imitation , as Angelica KaufFman in painting , or as the nuns of the Netherlands in musical concerts ; but imitation as well as learning rests on faithful reception . In architecture no woman ever attempted anything ; in music we have no female composer of celebrity ; in poetry , the ancients knew one Sappho , but no female Homer or Pindar , and our modern female poets have done little in the highest departments of poetry , the Drama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beauty , she is not expected to become learned but cultivated . Cultivation is no less valuable and difficult of attainment than learning ; the former rests on taste , the latter often merely on memory . Yet there have been learned ladies , that had good taste , fine judgment , and quick intuition , as Madame de Stael . Law and juridicial knowledge seems particularly attractive to them , perhaps because they love order . At all events it is remarkable , that it was a woman who presided over right and order among the Greeks , Themis , the mother of the Horae and Parcae . Her servants likewise , were women , the Erinnyae , Dike and Nemesis Adrastea . Demeter gave statutes to cities , and Egeria furnished Numa Pompilius with his laws . Welleda did the same in the north , and the old Germans commenced no war without having consulted their women . Deborah gave judgment during forty years under the palmtrees on Mount Ephraim . And in modern tims we see a Mathilda of Tuscany encourage the revival of the Pandects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two daughters of professor Andreas , both of them married to lawyers , lectured to large audiences from /z/ the rostrum , when their husbands were absent . So two other ItaHan ladies were known to appear in disguise on the rostrum , and their lectures on law were well received by numerous students . Many women have obtained the degree of LL . D. , and in France many have published large works on Law . In mathematics on the other hand , astronomy , metaphysics , history or medicine , none scarcely have acquired celebrity . And this is not accidental , not because no opportunity has offered itself to their productive genius ,  --  genius will always find its way  --  but because it is their highest happiness to be mothers . Man . Moral disposition . In man thought and will prevail , and a desire for liberty and honor . He must act and work , toil and labor , and can preserve his dignity and standing in the world only by acting from principles and clear comprehensions . He is to provide for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and respectability . If patience adorns woman , courage belongs to man . In some languages his name is derived from the same root from which the words for courage and virtue were taken . Public life is the sphere of man ; there he is to labor and to execute his ideas . As he is to drain swamps , to clear woods , to subdue wild nature , to destroy rapacious animals , and render climates mild , and inhospitable regions habitable , so he is to adorn the pulpit and the rostrum , the judge 's bench and the art of the physician , and to cultivate music , painting , sculpture , architecture , poetry , and science . As Hercules represents the former , so Apollo the latter employment . If woman is mild and forgiving , man must be just in governing himself , his family , and all intrusted to his charge . If woman always observes what is right from a sense of propriety , man must insist on the execution of the laws , when they have been violated . Independence renders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires what strengthens his feeling of importance . The horse , the sword , the chase and war , riches and titles , honors , influence and power , are welcomed by him . Woman may shed tears without words , man must connect action with them . Mental qualities . Productiveness , which has no limits in any science or art , as far as they are accessible to the hu- /z/ man mind , characterizes the mind of man . Every invention in mechanical art , every style of the fine arts , every advance in science has as yet been effected by man . It is his office to produce and realize ideas in pohtics , in arts , and science ; to know and investigate , - understand and represent . Only one government has as yet been found that " was entirely managed by women , and this among the negroes in Africa . When we look on the characters of man and woman , we can not but perceive that neither is perfect by itself , but that each needs the other for its perfection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hence only their union forms a complete character . Neither can endure therefore to remain by itself . Strength and courage rest in man , mildness and tenderness in women ; united , these qualities form one whole , separated , the former will degenerate into rudeness and ferocity , and the latter into inconsistency and fickleness . Hence the one must be softened by tender emotions , and the other strengthened by firmness.  --  Again : Cold understanding may easily become too calculating , too arithmetical , too selfish , when not refined by generous emotions of kindness and love . The timidity of woman on the other hand , her fearfulness needs a prop on which to rest .  --  The union of both in one is externally represented by marriage . Through it the strength of man is rendered mild by the gentleness of woman , his courage is moderated by her softness and timidity , and his understanding receives warmth of feeling . So the qualities of woman receive their finish by their union with those of man , for her feeling obtains proper nourishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely on his strength . Thus both intended for each other are truly what they ought to be when united , and the object of the original difference between man and women , is the richest and closest union of both . This union , which commences with love , has its pledge and visible appearance in the child ; for the mental qualities and moral capacities of both father and mother , continue themselves in their children , and these appear as an individual identity , so that , what before was given to twoj is now represented by one . This we perceive daily /z/ by recognizing in a child some qualities of the father , and others of the mother . Tlie consciousness of this fact constitutes family attachment . It is true , that the sons of celebrated men often appear to be without extraordinary degrees of talont , and again that sons of men , little known , exhibit uncommon capacity . But it must be admitted that in the former case the father may have exhausted the inheritance of his nature , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a measure , by which to judge of the talents of the son ; as was the case with the sons of Goethe and Schiller . In the latter case the natural capacities of the father may not have been developed , or the son inherited his bright genius from the mother . So Goethe says that he inherited his love of poetry from his mother , and many other traits in his character , as , for example , an aversion to all violent impressions , a rich vein of everteeming wit , of humour , &c.; ; these we recognize in that of his mother . Madame Letitia Bonaparte had four sons , all of whom were energetic and men of talents ; her husband is little known , and no doubt the sons inherited what they possessed from her . Hence the great importance of knowing the mother , her disposition , her character and talents , when we desire to judge correctly of distinguished men . We come then , to the natural qualities of the individual . These depend on all the influences we have before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including those of race , nation , occupation , &c.; The qualities that exclusively belong to the individual are temperaments , mental capacities and idiosyncracy. /z/ The soul is not only connected with the body , but they are interfused so that the nature of the one must affect that of the other . When- all the functions of assimilation are fresh and vigorous , when respiration is easy , when digestion and circulation of blood , excretion and secretion are regular and natural , then the sensations will be full and /z/ lively , the whole mind will be youthful , and feel , think and ivill with energy . When , on the other hand , we suffer much from rheumatism , headache , from shortness of breath or dyspepsy , the spirits will be low , the mind feel depressed , and especially the system of sensibility must become weakened . The will and resoluteness of man may , in some degree , overcome such difficulties and sufferings . Tieck is much afflicted with rheumatism , and yet his poetry is cheerful and humorous . Beethoven lost his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sublime works . Buttman could not bear the slightest breath of cold air , and nevertheless he was constantly engaged in revising , correcting , and completing his excellent Greek grammar and other works . Such instances are , however , rare , and are exceptions to the general rule . The body of man consists of three principal vital systems . The first of them is thEit of sensibility . By it man feels himself and the world around him . Its principal organ is the brain and nervous system . The second is that of irritabilitij . Its tendency is to resist the influences exercised by external objects upon man , and at the same time to bring them into subjection to him . Its organ is the heart and muscular system . The third is that of reproduce tiveness . By it our body preserves itself , and in so doing , seizes on whatever may serve it as food . Its organ is the liver and intestinal system . Through these systems the body is connected with the soul , and the peculiar manner in which this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , is called temperament . This word is derived from temperare , which means to unite or moderate two extremes ; and hence the term temperature as applied to the atmosphere . Temperament might , therefore , be defined to be the peculiar connection of soul and body in an individual . This connection becomes peculiar by the prevailing fluids of the body , their lymphatic sanguine , choleric , and bilious nature ; by the prevailing elements , as water , air , fire , or earth ; by the nature of the blood , which is either cold or warm , light or heavy ; by that of the fibres , which are either lax or firm soft or hard . All these must affect oxxv feeling , this our thinking , and this again our will , v . /z/ It is easy to understand the origin of temperaments . All empirical knowledge and sensual desires are qualified by sensation . Sensation is impossible without the senses , and these are impossible without nerves . All our knowledge is accompanied by feeling , and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more perfect and easy the functions of the nervous system are , the less they are interrupted or interfered with , the greater , stronger and livelier will be the power of feeling , thinking and willing . For the more easy it is to excite our senses , the more clear our sensations must be ; the more clear the sensations , the more definite and accurate our knowledge , and the stronger the feeling connected with it , and the volition proceeding from it . Now if the muscular system prevails , the nervous will be proportionally weak . Hercules , in the Grecian mythology , had strong muscles , but was not distinguished for strength of mind . Apollo , on the other hand , was physically weaker , but prevailed by clearness of thought . If the system of reproductiveness prevails over the others , a tendency to rest or inactivity becomes perceptible . We have four different temperaments ; the sanguine stands connected with the system of sensibility ; the melancholic with that of reproductiveness ; while the system of irritability by its twofold relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the arterial , and the phlegmatic , when the venous blood prevails . The temperaments do not directly originate in the individual , but in circumstances preceding its existence , in climate , locality , in the season of birth , &c.; Hence many feel incHned to consider them as accidental . Every man , they say , must have a temperament , but which of the four seems to be wholly accidental . So every man must have eyes , but whether they are blue or black is accidental . Children of the same parents may have very different temperaments , as , for instance , those of Madame Letitia Bonaparte . Though it may be accidental , whether a man is born with the choleric or melancholic temperament , he will retain it through life , and though the phlegmatic may modify his temperament by change of climate , by food , and drink , he can not change it into the sanguine . Yet /z/ while none can change his temperament , he may subdue it , and exercise it as he pleases . With some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was choleric , or sanguine , or phlegmatic . Nor does any temperament appear in its perfect purity , but as the prevalence of one system does not exclude the functions of the others , so the phlegmatic does not destroy entirely the symptoms of the melancholic , but frequently they approach so near each other , that it is difficult to distinguish the one from the other . And again , the same temperament will be differently modified in different persons . The Sanguine Temperament . This is the temperament of enjoyment and pleasure . It has great susceptibility to impressions of every kind so that the person is ready and longs to receive them ; but many impressions can not take possession at the same time of the same breast ; one extinguishes the other and the last is always the most vigorous . This temperament partakes of the nature of the air , which by its great elasticity yields to every pressure , and directly afterwards regains its former state . Liveliness , cheerfulness , and a never-ceasing desire for enjoyment characterize it , and its mobility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and are filled with the air . An individual of sanguine temperament finds it difficult to govern his temperament , to conquer its tendency to levity and to trifling employment .  --  Persons of this temperament incline strongly to Belles- Lettres , but prefer the brilliant , the pleasant , and the copious to the more solid , the truly beautiful and simple . It is the temperament of the French nation ; though fond of the fine arts , they have not produced anything very remarkable either in Painting , Sculpture or Music . The system of materialism is principally favored by them in Philosophy . Their courage is full of fire for the moment , but soon passes by ; their emotions are quick , but short ; they are careless , communicative , benevolent , but feel averse to labor and pain . La Fontaine was sanguine . His poetry bears the stamp of this character . /z/ The Choleric TemperamenU This may be called the temperament of action . It resists external impressions , and re- acts on every thing that affects it . Feeling its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much energy and perseverance . Its nature resembles that of fire ; nothing is more energetic and more active than fire ; its activity does not bluster like that of the wind , it does not stagnate like water , but continues without interruption , until the elements of existence are consumed . So , little insects that depend much on the warmth of the sun , are indefatigable in their ruinous activity , and though small , they are very destructive . The choleric temperament is excitable , yet not by little things , as the sanguine ; but when excited , it perseveres in the plan which it has chosen . Strong in its inclinations it is faithiul , but no less subject to great passions , to ambition , to despotism , to wrath and other vehement impressions . Its activity thus vibrates between life and death , between producing and destroying . It is the temperament of despots , and of such men , as seem to be destined for the chastisement of nations , for , magnanimous and brave , courageous and proud , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstinacy . Its bent is to practical pursuits ; it is quick of understanding , acute in judgment , clear and precise in its expressions , and its productions in the arts are manifold and expressive . This is the temperament of the Spaniards and Italians , and was that of Napoleon . " Every action excited him only to a new one . When at war , he thought of the advantage to be gained from a truce ; when he had effected it , he thought of the ways and means to break it . In France he thought of Russia , in Russia of India . Even at St. Helena he was engaged in dictating a history of his own adventures , or in reviewing those of others , as those of Caesar or Alexander . " If the sanguine lives wholly for the present , in which alone he can enjoy himself , the choleric is forced to dwell with his plans in the futu7'e , for all action is preceded by a resolution and separated from it by the lapse of time . /z/ The Melancholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retire or withdraw into itself , are the characteristics of this temperament . All its activity receives its impulse from reflection on the past , on the vanity of all things , and especially of human affairs . The ruins of former days exhibit on the one hand the greatness of man , and thus rejoice the heart , and on the other they indicate the decay of all that is sublunary , and fill the heart with sadness ; thus joy and sadness commingle , and give a tendency to seriousness , to meditation , and frequently to speculation . To the melancholy all that is near and clear to others is still at a distance , and as the blue color of the sky , which presents itself to our eye when it gazes into the immense depth above us , or which envelopes distant mountains , awakes a longing for something unknown , so every thing , however well- ascertained , serves only to call up in the breast a desire for something still deeper and higher and purer . It dehghts to live in the regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the romantic . It feels indifferent to the sensual world , and the eye , turned inwardly , indicates this by its coldness and want of animation . In science it is deep and inclined to skeptical researches . In art it aims at expression , as in the German school of music . We find a remarkable instance of this temperament in Chateaubriand . " Brought up in an old castle in Bretagne , his melancholy was nourished , even in his youth . During the revolution he dreams in the woods of America ; he sings of the introduction of the christian religion into Gaul ; he makes a pilgrimage to the holy sepulchre ; examines the haven of old Carthage ; reads Milton 's Paradise Lost in England ; full of romance , he attempts to defend the old stage by writing his Moses , a drama that was never exhibited ; he upholds the legitimacy of Henry V. , retires from public life , writes the history of France , and in his memoirs complains of ennui , while the world around him is undergoing new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfy him except the past , the ancient Uterature of Greece , &c.; /z/ The Phlegmatic Temperament . In this , self-possession prevails , which does not suffer itself to be carried away by external impressions , nor does it permit any of the one-sided characteristics of the previous temperament to reign , but retains its full dominion over all the influences exercised upon it , and over all its re-actions . It has therefore the capacity of entering into every situation and feeling , and is accessible on all sides . It is moderate in all things , in joy and grief , in mirth and sadness , in labor and rest . This perfect equilibrium renders it possible to retain at all times its liberty and personal dignity . The sanguine temperament is dependent on external impressions ; the choleric on its internal passionateness , which does not allow cool reflection ; the melancholic on its longing , that ever fills all its thoughts and feelings ;  --  but the phlegmatic is independent of all of them . It has its centre and union in itself , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and while in the other temperaments the consciousness of the world is principally active , in this self-consciousness prevails . In proportion as our consciousness is related to something external , we are dependent on it ; but in proportion as it is related to itself , and independent of any thing apart from itself , we are free . The phlegmatic temperament has frequently been wronged , and looked on as inferior to the others , because its features are not so striking ; and yet it alone renders it easy to man to preserve to himself his liberty , and to move without prejudice and pre-determination , in whatever direction of science or art he chooses . Its seeming indifference and rest is not without activity and deep interest , but like the lake , the waters of which seem motionless on the surface while rivulets and fresh waters are constantly flowing in , and though unseen , keep up a gentle but healthy and lovely activity , so this is always devoted to some action , without much display . Its talents are highly respectable , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but profound and accurate . In art it is faithful , as in the Dutch school with its landscapes and family-pictures . Its possessor is in danger of becoming indolent , indifferent , and fond of eating and drinking . /z/ Aristotle asserted that the melancholy temperament was most favorable to science and art . He quotes among the rest Socrates , of whom Plato says , that in the midst of the noise of an encampment , he fell into a deep meditation , and stood immovably in one place , from one morning to another , until the rising sun roused him , to offer his prayer . Empedocles , Plato , Homer , Phidias , Dante , Raphael , Handel , and other distinguished scholars had the same temperament . Yet it is the will that reigns in man , and not the temperament ; the former , and not the latter , forms the character , nor does talent and genius depend on it . Moses and Paul were choleric . Oberlin was sanguine , and the celebrated Rembrandt phlegmatic . One temperament will make it more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined principles , or to enter on some scientific or practical pursuit . The choleric , for instance , is favorable to practical business , for it is the temperament of action ; the sanguine to Belles-Lettres , for it is that of enjoyment ; the melancholy to deep speculation , for it is that of desire ; and the phlegmatic to thorough and universal learning , for it is that of self-possession and patience . The temperaments will thus connect themselves with mental capacities , and infuse into them liveliness or ease ; zeal or indifference ; quickness or slowness ; cheerfulness or dullness ; resoluteness or tardiness . /z/ Of these a twofold view is to be taken , with regard to the intensity of their strength and energy , and with regard to the objects to which they are instinctively directed . I. In respect to energy , and degree of strength , our mental faculties are to be divided into three classes , that of docility or mere capacity , of talents , and o genius . 1 . Docility . Eveiy man is born with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ground in God , the Creator . Hence Plato , when he was about to die , thanked the gods , /z/ that they had created him a man and not an animal . This general possibiHty may be called the capacity of mind to receive ideas or knowledge , and every one , who is conscious of himself , is endowed with it . It is therefore something general and quahfies every one who has it , to become a moral agent , and to feel religious affections . Religion and moral character being the two greatest accomplishments of man in this life , no one has a right to complain that his talents are less distinguished than those of others . Some of us are rich , others poor , but all may live and realize the end of life , if they are diligent and faithful . To learn is to be active ; but learning , as the act by which we acquire knowledge , is an intellectual activity , that has a certain end in view and is subject to certain rules , excluding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciplined . To learn , means therefore in the first place to receive what is communicated . But that which is communicated by instruction is not a single thing , nothing sensual , but a general idea , a general notion or a general rule . Learning , therefore , demands not only the power of perceiving clearly and distinctly single objects , but of perceiving that which is common to many of them , or it demands the power of comprehending the many in one . The animal may be broken in or taught to perform certain services , but it can not comprehend principles or general laws . To perceive the general nature of a single object means nothing less than to refer it to its class . I ask , What is this ? And receive this answer , A rose . Thus the single plant is classified , and I henceforth shall know every other flower of the same species . To learn in the second place means to judge theoretically . We must distinguish between our perceptions and the objects perceived . There are many objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to itself , that is , has parts which are related to each other , and these again must be distinguished . Finally , a distinction must be made between substance and accidents , the essential , and unessential , &c.; To notice all these , we must pay close attention . To learn in the third place means to he attentive . And in the last it means to remember that which has been received . /z/ 2 . Talent . When the mere capacity becomes an ability , so that we are not only receiving , but in being taught , teach ourselves and feel an inclination to apply rules and principles and to produce effects ve may call it talent . The man endowed with talent , has acute perceptions and comprehends quickly , precisely , easily ,  --  hence facility from facile  --  adds nothing and overlooks nothing . He distinguishes accurately not only between the different qualities , but also between the essential and accidental , and he discovers connections and separations , differences and unions , harmonies and contradictions , causes and effects , grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not observe them . His attention is easily attracted and interested in all that presents itself in the sphere of his science ; and his memory is not only faithful , but prompt and vivid . To improve a science , demands talent ; but mere talent is confined to certain spheres as to the extent of its productiveness ; nor is it new and original , but fixes itself always on materials that are historically handed down to it . It transforms , imitates , or leads out . So Virgil imitated Homer ; Horace imitated Pindar ; Cicero the Greek philosophers . 3 . Genius . When any one possesses all the qualities of talent in a still higher degree , he is said to have genius  --  from genus .  - -  Here acuteness of judgment is united with depth , which dives into the nature and being of all things , and is not satisfied with their nearest , but always , demands their last hidden element or foundation . Acuteness and depth are seldom united , but where we meet both in one person , we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is flexible and capable of entering with ease into the views , feelings and character of any one , so that a few words spoken by a person will enable it to understand and represent the whole character of that person ; or a single outline will cause it to produce the whole picture . Attention is constantly awake and active ; and memory , aided by imagination , is not only prompt and vivid , but productive , giving a new , and more attractive form to every thing /z/ intrusted to it . Thoughts present themselves without labor ; and the progress in art and science demands but little exertion to astonish any one who observes it . Even in times of rest true genius is on the advance . The character of genius is therefore evidently productive and inventive . It is new , and frequently comes in contact with established rules . Yet it is not arbitrary in its productions , but follows a rational necessity , the ground and reason of which it can understand . Nor is it correct to think , that genius needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas , we must also know how to express them well . But this demands exercise . Leonardo Da Vinci said , " If your son has genius , put him to a master after he has studied anatomy and perspective . " It is for this reason that poverty is more favorable to genius than wealth , for it renders exertion necessary . Goethe rose every morning at an early hour , and studied regularly the whole day . Leibnitz sat for weeks in his chau ' without taking any exercise . Nothing can be more perverse , than the notion that genius works altogether like instinct . Shakspeare is generally adduced as an example , and though it must be admitted that he had not a complete education , his works show a great amount of knowledge which he must have acquired in some way or other . He Hved in an age , which being filled with romantic views , was highly favorable to poetry , and cultivated the genius of the great poet much more than an age like ours , wholly given to practical pursuits could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public exercised a much greater mutual influence on each other than they now do . True genius is rare , and hence it is a gift that is desired by many . But as a few only possess it , many may be seen to make pretensions to it , while they have scarcely talent . II . In respect to the objects to which our mental capacities or talents have a peculiar tendency , we say that a man has the aptitude , or ability , or qualification for the performance of something , or for a study when his talents are perfectly adapted to a certain sphere of activity . Thus far we have only spoken of the energy of mental capacities ; here we shall treat of the sphere of action , to which /z/ they are directed by nature . At the same time the degree of their energy will exhibit itself in the greater or less ease , with which persons perform the labors for which their talents qualify them . Many may therefore have an inclination to the same art or science or practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though they should all of them be equally diligent . The objective spheres for the subjective capacities of man may be divided into three general fields : Science ; practical pursuits ; and the fine arts . Each of them may be subdivided again , and every subdivision will demand a peculiar qualification . The qualifications for science in general are an innate desire for knowledge , sound judgment , and a good memory . Now it may be that a man has memory as a talent , but judgment merely as capacity , and then he will easily receive and retain knowledge and accumulate a great amount of it , but his knowledge will be only held together by the order of succession externally , as beads are united by the string that passes through them . Here judgment requires much exercise . Or a man possesses judgment as a talent and memory as a mere capacity . Such a man has a limited knowledge , but what he knows , he knows well and according to logical order of cause , and effect , and ground , and consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon each other , memory ought to be exercised . Or finally a man possesses both memory and judgment as talents , and then he will not only learn well and much , but improve science and enrich the store of general knowledge . The study of history requires a strong , prompt and faithful memory , a lively imagination , that can enter into the spirit of past ages , and the characters and situations of historical heroes , impartiality of judgment , and an ardent interest in the human race . And here , again , mere chronology rests more on memory , than on judgment ; the representation on the other hand , of the customs , manners , arts , sciences , politics and laws of different nations , their characters , the design of historical actions , their results and historical criticism demand much teleological judgment ; and the philosophy of history is impossible without great talent and genius . So the study of metaphysics is founded on a desire for knowledge , that is not satisfied with knowing many things , /z/ but seeks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge such a systematical connection , as will give to every portion its proper place . And the study of Natural sciences ; geology , geography , botany , zoology , pre-suppose great powers of observing , skill in arranging our perceptions logically , readiness in naming and describing them well ; it requires too , the gift of invention , of making experiments , and of construing , developing and applying them . The practical talent has hkewise its different objects , as agriculture , mechanical arts , trade , political , medical , juridical pursuits , &c.; The qualifications for them may range from mere capacity to genius . The latter will invent newways and means , new instruments and machines , new institutions and regulations . Every business demands tact , that is the gift to perceive quickly and correctly the point on which all depends ; dexterity in choosing at once the right means ; resoluteness to act promptly and without delay or fear ; expeditiousness in dispatching work cheerfully and energetically , and finally an enterprising spirit . The qualifications for the fine arts must always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy the productions of art without having a talent for them , or without being blessed with genius , but the artist can not produce any thing worth having without a high degree of talent . The object of art is to represent truth in a sensible form . Three things are indispensable for the artist , a strong and productive imagination , the inspiration of a great and noble idea , and skill to realize this idea either in marble or on the canvass . And here again , the different arts pre-suppose different quahfications . Architecture with its labyrinths , obelisks , pyramids , temples and palaces , rests on a sense of regularity , symmetry and harmonious proportions . Sculpture is confined to the white marble , which colorless receives the idea of the master , only by having it fully expressed on its surface . A sense ov form , and a particular dexterity in wielding the chisel , constitute the particular qualifications for sculpture . Painting adds the eye to its pictures , and thus is able to represent man in all his relations , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense for colors , for light and shade , indicate talents for it . /z/ Music expresses only sensations and feelings , and its material is sound . A fine and delicate ear , an inclination to rhythm , harmony and melody will qualify for it . Poetry , from the epic to the dramatic , demands genius in the highest degree and an unlimited power over language . Not every artist is capable of moving in every sphere of his art with the same ease . Homer was great in epic , Sophocles in tragic , Pindar in lyric poetry . Petrarch gained immortal glory by his sonnets , and not by those works , from which he expected to enjoy his greatest fame . Shakspeare on the other hand , and Goethe were universal .  --  Much less still can one artist judge correctly of all the arts or be equally successful in them . Goethe never presumed to judge of music ; Michael Angelo 's sonnets are forgotten , as are the works of sculpture produced by the hands of Socrates . Roos was an excellent hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thing out of his sphere . There is a relation between the talents of an artist and their proper objects , which makes them completely transparent to the artist , and grants him an insight into their nature , that enables him to transfer himself wholly into their situation . Where this natural relation is wanting , the artist ought to acknowledge the limits of his productive powers . We have thus seen , that our natural capacities differ not only with regard to their energy , but also to the external sphere of activity for which they qualify man , and the question remains , What is it that causes this difference ? As the animal has instinct , so man has an innate tendency to acquire knowledge . The greater or less strength and excitability of this natural tendency , will call forth the activity of reason , which is the principle of all talents and genius , in a higher or lover degree , either as a capacity or as a talent . When that tendency is strong enough to remove all difficulties with regard to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere capacity . When on the other hand it requires but little excitement from without to act in full energy , we have talent . When finally that natural tendency is not only strong enough to remove all difficulties , but excites to productiveness , and animates , for example , the fingers of the painter , to create forms and /z/ proportions , or the imagination of the musician , to compose melodies and harmonies , we have genius . In the next place it is the same innate tendency , to acquire knowledge , which directs our talents to certain objects . This tendency in its lowest stage includes instinct , which points out to it its proper sphere . The sphere of instinct is sensation , that of the tendency to acquire knowledge , is apperception , consciousness . But all talents presuppose strong and acute senses , and consciousness is impossible without sensation . As instinct directs the animal by one or the other sense to its proper food , so it silently influences the direction , which the desire for knowledge in man takes to certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musician a delicate ear ; both are instinctively directed to their arts by their senses . Mozart , when only six years old , on hearing a violin , stated that its sound was one-eighth lower than that of one which he had heard the day before . When both were compared , his remark was found to be correct . Some talents show themselves earlier in life than others . That for music needs no nourishment from without , but draws all its compositions from its own resources , and hence it early manifests itself . Mozart was but five years old when he entertained large companies with his performances . Beethoven did so in his eighth year , and Hummel in his ninth . As talents depend on the strength and activity of our desire for knowledge , so this must be awakened by our sensations , by the sight of objects , and acquaintance with them , to which they are adapted . Correggio , on seeing a picture of Raphael , exclaimed , " Anch io sono pittoreJ I too am a painter . Thucydides hears a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he becomes conscious of his latent talent . La Fontaine hears , for the first time in his twenty-second year , a few verses of Malherbe 's poems , and awakes from a long dream , perceiving at once his innate qualification for poetry . The early or late development may , therefore , frequently depend on circumstances . But a difference in this respect is also produced by the object on which genius is to exercise Ovid , when yet a boy , made verses whenever he wrote . Melancthon received the degree of A. M. in his /z/ fourteenth year , and in his eighteenth he was professor of the Greek language in a celebrated university . /z/ By idiosyncrasy we understand that peculiarity of a constitution , by virtue of which the individual feels either sympathy with a certain object , or antipathy against it , or indifference towards it . This peculiarity is based on the correspondence of our nervous system with certain objects or persons . Idiosyncrasy does not belong to the whole race , its character is therefore not generic ; as , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , or that of man to serpents , but it belongs exclusively to certain individuals , and because of its singularity , it is difficult to account for it . Sometimes a sudden fright of the mother may leave a never-dying impression on the soul of the child , and idiosyncrasy may frequently take its rise in that early state of life , as was the case with James I. , who could not endure the sight of a naked sword , or with the Grand Duke of Epernon , who swooned at the sight of a young hare . In all instances it is certain , that the utterance of sympathy or antipathy rest not on judgment , but on mere feeling . In common life the attraction of different persons to each other rests either on an internal equality or resemblance which is recognized in spite of all external difference , or on a common interest which is determined by the capacities of those that feel it . In both cases we are guided by judgment . Sympathy or antipathy , on the other hand , while they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individuals , are the immediate utterance of feeling , and not of a clear judgment . Persons meet for the first time , and feel themselves attracted without knowing each other , or they feel themselves repelled like balls tossed against each other . It is as if this internal equality or inequality were more perceived by a kind of presentiment than any thing else ; it resembles the attractive power of magnet and of iron , of the negative and positive pole . In the world of morals , /z/ the like loves to associate with like , the gd$4- with the good , and the bad with the bad ; but sympathy , founded on mere feeling , demands always some polar difference in two persons that otherwise resemble each other in habits and taste . Two persons , perfectly alike , frequently feel an aversion to each other , as two keys , near each other on the piano , harmonize less than two separated by a third . But when there is a polar relation between the two , so that the one possesses positively what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . This is the case between persons of different sexes . Such a difference is not opposition , but proceeds from an original union . Sympathy then rests on a natural correspondence between the nervous systems of two persons or their disposition . This correspondence is only felt , and not clearly known . Hence it is that frequently a single movement of the lips , or a peculiar glance of the eye may call forth sympathy or antipathy . An interesting fact is related of two monks , who so sympathised with each other , that when the one was taken sick , the other would feel unwell ; and when the former recovered , the latter would be deHvered from pain . Petrarch states , that when once Laura suffered much from pain in her eyes , and he felt very much for her , his eyes began to experience the same pain . Antipathy must be explained on the same principles , and we will therefore only give a few remarkable instances from Schubert in his history of the soul . The celebrated Erasmus became feverish when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a water-cress , trembled in his whole body . Simon Ponli felt strong palpitation of the heart when fresh apples were brought into his room . A little opium laid in the ear of a patient caused his death , and the sight of white horses acted as a powerful cathartic with another . A man , that had recovered from a long disease , swooned , when he smelt bread , and another felt himself violently purged when he smelt broth . Baco swooned during an eclipse of the nioon ; and P. Boyle , when he heard Ihe noise , which is caused by water , pouring forth from a spigot . Honey with some persons has the /z/ effect of poison ; and the aversion felt by many to caterpillars , spiders , mice , and toads , is well known . It is usual to speak also under the general head of idiosyncrasy of apathy . Physically , this is the state of the system when no medicine can reach it . A man much engaged in alchemy could take four ounces of sweetened and sublimated mercury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every kind of interest in many things which attracts others easily . . ' is /z/ All the modifications of mind which we shall have to consider in this chapter , are such , as are not permanently the same , but subject to changes , and periodical . The first are those produced by age . /z/ They are not permanent . The child does not remain a child , but grows and becomes a youth ; and the youth developes itself , matures and becomes man or woman . None of these stages is therefore fixed , but the one passes over into the other . Yet with these transitions , changes both of the physical and psychological nature take place , and as may be anticipated , not accidentally , not without some good design . As in the plant , those leaves which appear first and are nearest to the soil , are also least formed , and their substance more rude , so man in his childhood shows physically little expression in his face , and psychologically is confined to mere sensations and perceptions . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more exposed to the air , and the influence of the light , the juice becomes more refined , the color more fresh and tender and all the forms grow more perfect , until finally on the top of the plant many delicate leaves cluster around one centre and form the bud , from which the flower in all its beauty bursts on us . This is the youth of the plant . When the flower fades , the seed will begin to ripen , and when the seed is /z/ matured , the fruit will decay . Here we have the picture of man . His youth is the flowering season of the plant . Sensation and perception have been well exercised and now the powers of imagination , of fancy , of memory , and the capacity to receive and digest new ideas , are to be cultivated , for they are principally active , and indicated in the bloom of the face , in the fire of the eye , and by all the emotions of the heart . When these powers of the mind , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reflection , thought , and practical activity grow forth from them , until the ripened soul causes the body to decay , as the seed the plant . Should we now venture to pronounce the design of the ages , we should say ;  --  the soul enters the world in a state of involution , and its destiny is to unfold and manifest what it contains . Whenever one great manifestation has been made , it turns to another , leaving the former behind , and this change is indicated by the transition from a lower to a higher age , until when all its developements are effected , it turns from time to eternity , and forsaking its body , which is no longer of use to it , leaves it to decay . For the body , without the soul , can as little support itself , as the rainbow , created by the sun , can continue , after the sun turns away from it to a different part of the globe . Different periods of this gradual developement have been exhibited by physiologists . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty one weeks and six days ; Shakspeare speaks of seven , but most writers , following the division of the seasons , admit only four . To divide these periods according to years , is a difficult undertaking . Not only , because as the seasons , so our ages differ in the various climates , but they vary with different persons in the same region . That which exists and grows , can not be fixed in certain stages , but like a stream , that continually flows and can not be stopped by putting a pole as a landmark into its waters , one stage will flow imperceptibly into the other . Haller collected more than one thousand instances of persons , who lived more than one hundred to one hundred and ten years , and some of such , as died in the one hundred and fiftieth and one hundred and seventieth year ; ten periods , each of six years , thirty /z/ one weeks and six days would of course not be sufficient in such cases . We shall in a short characteristic of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , the influence of which on all that live is analagous to that of the four ages on our life . These divisions are strongly marked by our mental and physical power , and also by a pre-disposition to certain diseases . In childhood our nature inclines to inflammation of the brain ; in youth to disorders of the pectoral system ; in manhood to bilious diseases and fevers , and in old age to palsies . Childhood . This exhibits three distinct stages , that of the infant , that when the child begins to walk and to speakj and that when it begins to understand the world around it . During the first of these three periods the child exists more in the form of vegetative life . It sleeps about eighteen hours a day , and like plants , grows rapidly , and is altogether a sleeping monad , for the morning of intellect is not yet dawning on it . It is , however , born a sensitive being , and feels every where on its body , except on the sole of the foot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tender body , it moves its limbs and cries ; when it is touched , its muscular power attempts to re- act . As the lungs breathe as soon as the air falls upon them , so its lips point themselves and seek for nourishment , when it feels hunger . Drinking and eating are yet united in one act . The pleasure , accompanying the satisfaction of want , runs like an electric spark through all its limbs , and soon not only the lips , but also its little hands seek the favored food . The touch of the hands will attract the eye , which begins to be active four or five days after birth , and thus one sense will awaken and aid the other . Hearing develops itself later , as it is said to continue longest in the dying . It distinguishes first the voice of the mother , for this proceeds from the same breast from which it receives its nourishment . The second period announces itself by the- attempts of the child to walk and to speak . With them it raises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that of /z/ consciousness . A desire to play indicates a will in its lowest stage . This desire makes the child seize with its little hands , what is offered to them ; it grows fond of what it has once seized and pays attention to toys and those , which it sees and handles oftenest , it will soon be able to distinguish from others . This appears from the fact , that it will not suffer one toy to be taken out of its hands and another to be put in its place , but it insists on the one , that was taken from it . Thus it learns to distinguish and to choose . The interest felt by the child in certain objects will be expressed by its hands , and some inarticulate sounds , until finally , after having heard them named repeatedly , it imitates words . The child indeed had sounds before ; it wept , and laughed , and cried ; but to form sounds into tones and pronounce them as words demands intellect . Its original sounds were principally vowels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animal has likewise , but its sounds have no variety . The goose hisses , the hen clucks , the sheep bleats . The voice of man is capable of forming all these sounds , as was Madame Catalani to compass three octaves and a half . The child at first indicates by a few words a great many objects ; every stranger is an uncle or an aunt . After some time it forms words of its own , that frequently are full of significance .  --  With the language the child becomes conscious of the world , and of itself , especially when it ceases to speak of itself in the third person , and begins to name itself by the term I. This conception of itself is Hke a light in the midst of darkness . Now the child plays with itself , as if it were sufficient to itself . It sleeps less , and is unwilling to be put to bed , &c.; The third period is that in which the child desires to become acquainted with the world . The impressions it receives are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retains them easily . The fondness for play increases ; the boy runs about , wrestles , climbs trees and makes mischief ; the girl delights in adorning a doll , and attending to a kitchen apparatus in miniature . Pleasure and displeasure seize the young heart with much vehemence and the will excited by them , attaches the action without deliberation to desires . These change quickly and influence to many actions , that /z/ must be imprudent . Not distinguishing between genuine and false pleasures , the child will give the more valuable for a trifle which attracts its attention . The rash and inconsiderate life of the child meets therefore a contradiction in the well regulated and principled life of grown persons , and this contradiction manifests itself as discipline . The virtues of gratitude obedience , and petitioning , can be cultivated in the earliest childhood by withholding and granting at proper seasons . Cleanliness in dress and moderation in food , are the basis of all education . Exercise of the higher senses , the ear and eye , and limitation of the pleasures of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children live wholly in the present ; the future does not yet trouble them . One day passes by like the other . As yet boys and girls play with each other ; but soon they flee in order to seek each other again . The girl turns in upon herself and grows modest and silent , the boy shunning her seeks the company of boys , and becomes awkward and rude . Youth . Sera Venus  --  inexhaustajuvenius.  --  Tacitus . Now all formations of the body are fully developed ; the proportions of all parts to each other , are in their highest perfection ; the nerves are vigorous and the muscles swell softly over into each other . The beard and the change of voice in the young man ; the delicacy and bloom in the face of the girl indicate this period no less , than a higher respiration and a greater warmth of the whole body . Psychologically this period may be known from a prevalence of the imagination , memory , and judgment , and an irresistible inclination to dive into the future , lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast is filled with hopes and ideas , with expectations and wishes , with undertakings and plans to reform the world . Love and friendship are the two principal inclinations of youth ; perseverance and courage , firmness and nobleness , magnanimity and selfdenial , are in their train . Love ennobles and often forms the transition from a silent and idle life , to a most generous and noble activity . Dante 's love to Beatrice ripened into /z/ his Divina Commedia ; Petrarch 's love entered into his sonnets ; Goethe 's into his Faust . In a moral respect Honor becomes the guiding principle . Manhood . The growth of the body has ceased , though its intensive strength may still grow higher . The face exhibits impressions of certain fixed inclinations , and passions and expressions of character ; the glance of the eye is firm , the support of the body manly and noble , and the walk dignified and serious . The ideals of youth depart , and the reality of life claims the undivided attention of man . In the place of the pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment and knowledge , firmness of will , ripeness of experience , and a resolute but dehberate activity become indispensable . Purposes must be realized ; something must be effected to secure to man a position in society . Wife and children must be taken care of , the government and the welfare of the whole human race demand the interest of man . As thinking becomes more logical , the single thoughts clearer , so the emotions of the heart are viewed more correctly , and no longer suffered to exercise an influence on the will proportional to their vehemence . And so all actions are accompanied by circumspection and prudence , and must proceed from a sense of duty , and from a consideration of their consequences in the future . Man must know how to resign and endure , how to persevere and to act . Old Age . Jucundissima est aetas devexajam , non iamen preceps.  --  Seneca . The frailty of old age has been the theme of many a poem , and of much complaint . Homer early compared the voice of old men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not destitute of its high pleasures . Desires and passions , those tyrants of youth no longer rage in it ; past experience , and many changes and occurrences , rising and sinking wealth and power , the destructive and reviving facts of history , have taught the aged neither to tremble at dangers nor to overprize things earthly . He can no longer be deluded ; his counsel is sought for and valued . /z/ Old age may therefore be called that of peace and serenity ; for quick impressions no longer disturb it , unseasonable desires no longer torture it , and its principal attention is generally directed to its eternal home . The more familiar it grows with the home above the stars , the more it becomes estranged to the concerns of life , and this gradual estrangement may be called a gradual dying , and death nothing else than a transition of the soul from time to eternity leaving the body behind . As the soul dives into the other world the colors of this earth grow pale and less interesting . Yet some old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and continued to feel youthful , and labor with energy . Goethe continued his usual activity until a few days before his death ; Ruben 's Last Judgment , and Raphael 's Transfiguration , were the best and last works of those great men . Many feel neglected in old age , because they have ceased to take any interest in those around them ; many lose their memory because they do not exercise it . Robert Constantino had an excellent philological memory in his one hundredth and third year . Many become childish , because they live altogether in the days of their childhood , and pay no attention to the affairs of the day . But when all is as it ought to be , then the old man will rejoice in his age , and as the horizon of his earthly sun grows more narrow , that of his heavenly sun will become more expanded and more brilliant . For the soul that comes from God , having fulfilled its destiny on earth , desires to return . /z/ Sleeping and waking are the " ebb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our life . " They are related to each other as night and day , darkness and light , consciousness and unconsciousness . In proportion as any being may be said to be awake , it will be able to enjoy sleep . We propose to answer the following questions : 1 . What is sleeping , and what is waking ? 2 . Where is sleep met with 7 /z/ 110 AiSTHROPOLOOY. 3 . What is its design 1 4 . What are its conditions ? 5 . What is a regular sleep ? 6 . What is a falling asleep ? and 7 . What is waking 7 1 . What is sleeping f and what is waking ? Sleep , The words used in different languages to signify the state of Hfe under consideration , express generally a relaxation . Somnus in the Latin no doubt is derived from supinus , lying on the back , and this from sopio , to deprive of feeling or sense , and from which the modern term sofa comes ; the Greek term TUTivog is equal to imvog and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and means likewise lying hack ; the English sleep comes from the Saxon slepan , and the German schlafen whose root is schlaff , and whose meaning is lax or relaxed , and which is used of the bow-string when loosened . Sleep in general is , therefore , a state of relaxation . This definition is not , however , sufficient , and we must add that is the negation of consciousness of the world and of ourselves . Yet consciousness is not annihilated , but continued as dreams indicate , and as the possibility of awaking at a certain hour , sufficiently proves . The nervous system , which influences the activity of the soul when directed outward , is asleep , and hence the communications of the soul with the world is interrupted for a time . We must further add , that sleep is the rest of the activity of the organs of sensibility ; yet the functions of sensibility , of sensation and perception , are not suppressed , but only limited in their clearness and accuracy ; they are veiled and put to rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this respect , they reproduce their life , and re-invigorate themselves . Again we must add , that sleep is the prevalence of the functions of bodily re-production , or digestion , respiration , circulation of the blood over those of sensibility . Though breathing , and the pulsation of the blood becomes slower , they are the former more deep , and the latter fuller . Hce it is , that many snore when asleep , for they draw in the air more deeply . Secretion is diminished , but is richer and more energetic , and digestion is more perfect . Persons grow principally during sleep , and wounds heal more at ANTHROPOLOGY . Ill night than during the day . The plant grows quicker than any thing else in nature , and it is therefore considered as the true representative of re-production . A twig broken off and planted , produces a new tree . Now , the life of man during sleep is principally vegetative , as Aristotle remarked , and Leibnitz called man when asleep a vegetable monad . In sleep man is turned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; hence HeracUtus said ,  --  in sleep every man has a world of his own , but when awake all men have one in common with each other . Sleep has been considered by ancient poets as the sister of death ; Homer calls death a brazen sleep , invog xaXxeos ; but if sleep is rest in activity , and death as it is generally viewed , a cessation from all activity , then sleep and death are not sisters , nor are they in any way related to each other . Waking . This is the opposite of sleeping , or that state of life in which the system of sensibility reigns over that of re-production , or in which the soul and consciousness prevail over the body . All the functions of sensibility are fully active , as seeing , hearing , smelling , tasting , and feeling ; we think , and judge , and will ; we distinguish between ourselves and the world , between our perceptions and the things perceived ; we remember , direct attention whithersoever we please , and determine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in opposition , and yet they are not , for the one is founded on the other . While we sleep , something in us is awake , and while we are awake , some powers in us are at rest . 2 . Where is sleep met with ? As sleeping and watching are closely related to each other , we may at once say , that a being can enjoy sleep only in proportion to the degree in which it may be said to be awake . Beings that are wholly reproductive , that live and grow only externally , and have neither feeling nor sensation , can not sleep . It can not be denied , that there are many plants , which under the influence of light and warmth close their cups at night , and open them again in the morning , or protect their flowers by folding their leaves /z/ around them , and by forming a bower , or by rolling up their leaves in the form of a cornet ;  --  yet their sleep , if it may be called so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is nevertheless remarkable , that some flowers are so regular as to the time of falling asleep , that Linnaeus conceived the thought of establishing a Horologium Florae , that is , a dial of flowers . Animals , on the other hand , have feeling and sensation ; they feel themselves , and they feel and perceive the things around them ; they are consequently awake in some degree at least , though their state of waking resembles that of dreaming , and hence Leibnitz called them dreaming monads . Here it will be well to notice , that living and being awake are different states of existence . The plant lives , but is not awake ; the animal is awake , but has no clear consciousness . Animals , being awake , they also sleep . The ibex , which climbs from mountain to mountain , when the time of its retirement approaches , seeks for a silent and isolated place to rest and enjoy sleep . The eagle that sailed during the day in the air , and passed over hills and valleys , is satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some animals sleep not only during night , or for a short part of the day , but through a whole season , or during a smaller or greater portion of it . Some fall asleep when the cold , others when the warm , or others when in some regions the rainy season makes its appearance . The German rat , the marmot , the badger , the hedgehog , the bear , all of which love cold climates , sleep more or less during the whole winter ; the hedgehog in Madagascar , and the tanrec in the East Indies , sleep during the greater part of summer ; and so does the crocodile , which remains stiff in in the mire , hardened by the sun until a few drops of rain start it , and make it burst the mud and go in search of its prey . Among the birds the swallow , the nest of which is eatable , and some few other kinds are subject to this long sleep , which is also met with among men , but there always as a disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep ? Some of the lower classes , as infusoria polypi , that have either no nerves at all , or very few only , can of course sleep but little , because they are awake but little , and their existence is more vegetative than animal . /z/ Other animals live constantly in a dull mixture of sleeping and waking , as the amphibious ; and some insects sleep so slightly , that their sleep might better be called a kind of drowsiness , for they observe every thing going on around them . Fish have been seen following a ship for seven days , and as yet it is doubted by many , whether the dull life of aquatic animals stands in need of sleep . From these remarks , it may be sufficiently seen , that the sleep of animals differs not only from that of man , but in the different animals according to the degree in which they may be said to be awake . 3 . What is the design of sleep ? Rest and activity are so separated in every being which lives on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no being can be active and rest at the same time . But what can not take place simultaneously may do so in succession , and as the night follows the day , so rest follows activity , and this again rest . Whenever our activity continues for a long time , it must result in exhaustion , and thus render itself impossible ; and when rest is enjoyed beyond a proper measure , disgust and weariness are experienced . The necessity for the alternate transition from waking to sleeping , and from sleeping to waking , lies in the above law , and is contained in the life of man . It is the union of mind and body , and though its activity is originally one , it is organized and utters itself by different systems . These determine and limit each other , so that while each is going on in the same body , neither interferes with the other . Among these systems some serve more the growth and strength of the body , others more directly the activity of the mind . But all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , equally in need of rest . They can not consequently be all of them active in an equal degree at the same time , but they must relieve each other , so that while the one is principally active , the others will be at rest , and for the time being , yield their dominion . Were both kinds of systems equally active at the same time , they would have to fall asleep at the same time , and then nothing would remain active in man to awaken him again ; while , on the other hand , a continued activity of the vegetative system /z/ of the body would finally stifle the life of the mind , and a continued activity of the mind by the brain , nerves , and muscles would volatilize the body as light volatilizes burning matter . An uninterrupted wakefulness renders the brain soft and watery , and causes insanity , as long sleep suffocates by the growing and accumulating fat . Here , then , we may discover the true reason why plants can not sleep . They can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in need of rest , as the planets and stars , which are ever moving , never experience fatigue . Should we nevertheless call the growth of plants an activity , it would be necessary for us to say , that their activity and rest is so united that the one can not be distinguished from the other . Without any disturbance , their juices rise and sink ; without labor the bud unfolds itself in the light of the sun and scatters its fragrance . But the life of the animal has sensation through it , it is attracted by the objects around or repelled by them and its originally peaceful , and harmonious activity , is elicited and spent in all directions , and hence exhaustion follows and rest becomes necessary . And all this takes place in a still higher degree in man . The equilibrium of his mental life is wholly disturbed by the occurrences of the day , by the emotions of fear and hope , of joy and pain , of solitude and anxiety , of love and hatred ; by self-interest and interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by cares and troubles , by the constant exertion of thinking and willing . Thus rest becomes in a high degree necessary , and the design of sleep as regards the intellect is , To grant rest to the mind . For if during the state of waking , the mind may be compared to a living spring , whose reviving waters are constantly gushing forth and flowing into many rivulets ; during sleep it gathers and collects itself , draws in its manifold activities ; and thus , for a time , it frees itself from the contrast and opposition to itself into which it is brought by the opposite nature of the objects , claiming its power and attention during its waking . The mind returning to itself , delivers itself from the stretch on which it is during the whole day and thus it is at rest . It not only ret- in sleep , that is , ceases from labor , hut /z/ it is positively invigorated and strengthened , and this restoration of mental pover is another part of the design of sleep . It descends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embryo and like Antaeus , who by throwing himself on the earth , gained new strength , so it recovers what it has lost by its activity in the world . It is as if it drew a new supply of strength from the source of its existence , and hence the expressions that one feels like a new creature after a healthy sleep or balmy sleep , are highly significant . According to the view here taken of the design of sleep , it would seem that the mind sleeps and not the body alone , or that such is the case of the system of sensibility , and irritability , and this is true . Sleep is not death , nor a separation of the soul from the body ; in sleep they remain closely united . The mind sleeps ; it is for a time in a state of unconsciousness , while at the same time it has not in the least lost its consciousness , this has only become latent or is for a time veiled . This state of mind has been compared to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foreign language , and could call them forth at any time , and yet does not remember one for years because the person whose memory it is no longer speaks that language . This state is similar to another activity of the soul , which in order to reflect on a new idea , dismisses for a time a previous one without loosing or forgetting it . It will be understood that the mind is spoken of here in its connection with the body , and especially with the nerves by which it is principally active . When these become exhausted , the activity of the mind will not cease , but will be greatly diminished and consequently rest . This rest is what we call sleep . 4 . What are the conditions of sleep ? 1 nese are many and various , and that without which all the others would be insufficient , is the law according to which life can not remain in one and the same state longer than a certain time , and according to which its existence vibrates between activity and rest , sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree at least , with the mind . /z/ Here we find , that after serious labors , the mind inclines strongly to something of a lighter nature . Leibnitz , when fatigued with study , delighted in meditating on the improvement of wagons ; Kepler turned from his astronomical investigations to music . The more the mind has been productive and self-active in one direction , the more it will desire to be merely receptive in another . After writing much it will be delightful to read for a while . The next condition of sleep is a certain degree of exhaustion caused by activity . He only sleeps well who wakes well . Any thing that weakens the nervous system , great cold or heat , or whatever too greatly raises or depresses the activity of the sensibility , or what even wearies by not affording sufficient excitement , by being too uniform or tedious will make us feel sleepy ; while any thing that strongly engages the mind will keep it awake . A certain degree of indifference to the world and to our business is indispensable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also promote sleep . Hence the night with its darkness and silence is the time for sleep , for the absence of light suffers the eye , through which the objects of the world receive form and shape and gain our attention , to be at rest . Again , whatever promotes the growth of the body is favorable to sleep . Fat , corpulent and growing persons , especially children , sleep more than old persons . And finally sleep may be caused by strong odors or medicines taken from the vegetable kingdom , as opium , by strong food , which renders a higher degree of digestion necessary , as may be seen from serpents , that after having eaten their prey , fall asleep ; by strong drinks , which force the blood inward , while such as tea , that propel it to the surface , keep us awake . 5 . What is a regular sleep ? That sleep we should not hesitate to call regular and healthy , and refreshing , in which the functions of digestion or of the system of reproduction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are not disturbed by dreams or by cares . So is waking regular and healthy , when we scarcely know that we have a body , when no limb hurts /z/ US , and when the process of digestion is not in the least perceived . Sleep is irregular when it is disturbed by unpleasant , feverish , or distressing dreams , and when we often awake during the night . The nature of sleep will differ according to its prevailing causes . Sleep , produced bystrong drinks , will be heavy and unhealthy ; that produced by cold , will be benumbing ; that by too great fatigue , will be deep , &c.; Some instances of lethargy remind us of the long sleep of animals . Schubert relates the case of Guiseppe Ciaborri , who was buried during an earthquake by the corpse of his friend , and there lay for fourteen days under the ruins of his native city almost constantly sleeping . A sick person slept for seventeen weeks with but a few interruptions , and after this long sleep recovered from his disease . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for seventy days and then recovered from an illness ; and Fichet records a case in which a man slept for four years , only waking when he felt hungry . Equally extraordinary are the instances in which persons have fallen asleep while on the rack . The nerves being so weakened that they could no longer re-act , began to die , while the rest of the body seemed yet to live . Sleep and death not unfrequently pass over the one into the other . Poison , introduced into the blood , frequently causes first a deep sleep and then death . As we have many instances of such a heavy , lethargical sleep , so we have some of an uncommon wakefulness . A murderer , according to Schubert , remained awake for fourteen days , and though he took gradually forty grains of opium , his eyelids would not sink and grant him a balmy sleep . 6 . What is Falling Asleep ? To say all in one word , we may reply : a gradual inactivity of the different senses . First of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it closes ; then taste and smell become insensible ; the ear yet hears , but does not understand ; the mouth yawns , the members stretch themselves , the head , as in the embiyo , sinks down on the breast , and while for a short time the life of the mind seems to rest under the surface of the body , so that a little excite- /z/ ment will call it forth again , it soon sinks deeper until it wholly disappears . So the English soldiers on the fort of St. Philip heard no longer the thunder of the cannons , but slept standing at their posts . Physically , falling asleep is frequently indicated by a feverish pulsation of the blood , and always by a rest of the muscles , by a decrease of animal warmth , by slower , but deeper breathing . As the thinking power becomes relaxed , and loses accuracy and acuteness as the motion of the muscles grows less energetic , so all activity is turned off from the world and sinks back into the life of the body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed the millions of golden stars above , and roamed in immeasurable space lets fall the lid  --  and stars and space are no more seen . 7 , What is Awaking ? When sufficient strength has been gained , one sense after another becomes active again , and man becomes conscious of himself , and the world around . A feeling of strength and of vigor , of cheerfulness and alacrity , accompanies our awaking , as that of relaxation accompanies our falling asleep . Our connection with the world is renewed , and the last thoughts , before falling asleep again present themselves .  --  When life is vigorous , the transition from sleeping to waking is short , though generally preceded by a short morning sleep . The dark feeling , in which our intellectual life was resting , becomes gradually more light ; figures like thoughts make their appearance , and an electric stream of power passes through limbs and muscles , until we are fully awake . The process of awaking is generally complete , when the eye opens , for through it the objects around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment and thinking , and our desire for renewed activity . /z/ The word dream , by a transposition of the letters o and r , comes from the Latin , Dormio , which word means both to sleep , and to dream , as the noun somnium , means both sleep and dream . In connection with sleeping we have to consider that state of the mind , in which it dreams . Dreaming is generally described as an involuntary action of the soul . By involuntary is meant , that the pictures , images and ideas , running through our sleep , are not subject to our critical judgment , nor to our conscious will , but that they come and go , appear and disappear , as if sent by another power than that of the soul . Yet this definition of dreaming does not exhaust the subject . Dreaming is a state of mind , that is made up of sleeping and waking . The soul , when it dreams , is neither wholly asleep nor wholly awake . We are awake , when we judge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between our activity and its results , between the world and ourselves and when we know that we make these distinctions . We are asleep , when we are no longer aware of these differences and when we cease to judge . Dreaming is the flowing together of ourselves with the objective world ; for while in sleep this is wholly merged in a state of unconsciousness , in dreaming it emerges from it ; not having however the power of a clear and distinct judgment , we are not able to keep the objective world separated from ourselves , but all our activities flow confusedly together with their results , our perceptions with the things perceived , and our imagination with its own productions . Dreaming then is that state of mind , in which we are not conscious of ourselves or of our personality . We are conscious of ourselves when we clearly distinguish between our soul and body and acknowledge their union . In dreaming this distinction is gone , and hence we are unconscious of our person . This shows itself in all dreams , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of another . Johnson , in his dreams , frequently disputed with an opponent , and felt chagrined , that he had himself the poorest arguments . An old Professor di-eam- /z/ ed , that he was again a student , and when examined could not answer the question to which his classmate , sitting near him , fully and readily replied . In both these instances it is evident , that the dreamers had no self-consciousness . And so it is in all our dreams , for if we were clearly conscious of ourselves , we should not dream , but be awake . Without personality there can be no liberty , no volition , no will . In dreaming then we are incapable of willing decidedly . This it will not be difficult to prove . For when we dream that we are pursued by a mad dog , or any rapacious animal , we can not , however much we may try to do it , discover the means of escape . Our muscles seem powerless , they will not move from the place , they deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we feel that running could be the only way of safety and yet we can not take a step . Nor is understanding and judgment active and free in dreaming , but both are merged in mere feeling . Some remarkable instances may seem to lie in the way of this assertion , and yet it is nevertheless true . If by understanding we comprehend the many in one , and if by judgment we distinguish between the different qualities of a thing , and separate one class of beings from another , we can not exercise either power without self-consciousness , and where this is active , there , as has been stated , we do not dream , but wake . Condillac , we are told frequently finished treatises in his dreams , which while he was awake , offered insurmountable difficulties . Maignan , a mathematician of the seventeeth century , in his dreams , solved problems , which he found correct , when he judged of them after he awaked . Reinhold discovered in a dream the deduction of the logical categories , and so all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , that we have clearer ideas on some subjects than we had , when we retired . Strong as these instances are in favor of a quickened understanding and judgment in dreams , they do not after all prove what they seem to establish . For there is no doubt but the essays of Condillac and the problems of Maignan , and the categories of Reinhold , had not in vain engaged the minds of these men , but they were well matured and ripe , long before they lay down to sleep . It often so happens , that while many impressions , and many /z/ activities engage our mind at the time , when we attend to a difficult subject , the resuhs of our meditation and study will not become manifest to ourselves , because some feeling , some impression veils it or does not suffer it to present itself freely , and separate from the other views and ideas , that may occupy our thoughts . After we retire and dismiss the many cares and interests , which divide our mental enc-rgies , the principal subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the other impressions that accompanied it having disappeared , the result of our study will be permitted to show itself disencumbered . So noise around us frequently prevents us from remembering a certain occurrence , which is certainly treasured up in our memory . When the noise ceases , our recollection of it is at hand . The mountains are there , but the mist renders them invisible ; as soon as the mist sinks , they rise . We experience the same , when , having been for a long time engaged in some labor unsuccessfully , we return to it , after recreation . Then we are often astonished at the ease with which we finish the work . No new efforts have been made , no ' new attention has been paid to it , and the greater facility must therefore result from the removal of something , that before obstructed our efforts . The state of mind , in which it neither comprehends nor judges , nor is conscious of itself , must be that of Feeling . The mind , as has been shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fows forth when awake . Yet its rest is not inactivity , for this is death . Whatever has life must be active , and only what is active is alive . The activity of the mind during sleep is sunk into form of feeling . This , without judgment , is an entire union of subject and object , of the activity which feels , and the thing that is felt ; a union , not resulting from the difference of both , but one that knows of no difference whatever . Thus all differences in the activity of the soul are dropped , and the soul places itself wholly and undivided in every feeling and emotion , or in every word and action . When we are awake , we judge of our actions as well as of our words and feelings ; our mind , when entering into them , is conscious of their relation to itself , of their consequences and propriety . During sleep no part of the /z/ mind is above our feelings or words , but the whole mind rests in an undivided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . Hence we may explain how words spoken in our dreams are frequently much more beautiful , much more appropriate than those we should have chosen when awake ; hence it is too , that our emotions in our dreams are more whole-souled , and consequently more animated ; and that our sympathies and antipathies are more vehement than they would be in a state of wakefulness . As the muscular strength of insane persons is very greatly increased , when their whole mind enters into a passion , so are our feelings in sleep , and their utterances in dreams . Some of the feelings , that we thus have in dreams , will be stronger than others ; these stronger feelings will cause a difference in the simple and harmonious activity of the mind , and disturb it . Every difference will lead to variety , and hence the mind will flow forth again with its activity into different channels , as in its state of waking . Yet not conscious that these differences in its activity are its own productions , imagination , the principal power " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as something external , something not proceeding from the activity of the mind , but from some other source . Thus the identity and harmony of the mind is preserved in its dreams , for whatever might interfere with it is thrust out under the form of a strange being or power . On the one hand the mind seems to distinguish , while on the other it remains still under the influence of mere feeling . But the activity of the mind which thus unites thinking and feeling is Imagination . This mental power does not demonstrate nor produce pure thoughts , and make us conscious of them , but it gives all ideas in a sensual form , in a sensible image . While we are awake , its operations are accompanied by critical judgment ; we reflect on the images and their appropriateness to render a thought visible . In our dreams this critical judgment is absent , and though we may compose poems while dreaming , their value can be judged of by us only when we are awake ; and frequently what may please us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our waking judgment . Imagination is therefore /z/ active , without our being conscious of it ; this is sometimes the cas with poets , who write without cool reflection , but then they write by inspiration , and may be compared to a burning torch which illuminates all around , but does not see itself , nor understand its own nature . As it is the province of the imagination to express a general thought or truth , or that which is common to many things of the same kind by a single concrete and individual image or symbol , so in our dreams it produces images , concrete signs or symbols by which it speaks or acts . The course of an unfortunate life , for example , it will describe by a high mountain which we have to ascend . Agreeable or disagreeable feelings which connect themselves with the labor we have in climbing up the mountain , will call forth the images of beautiful flowers or disgusting animals . Hence it is , that we can not only speak in verses while we are dreaming  --  because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown into it  --  but that the language of dreams in general is replete with poetical beauty , with energy , and appropriateness . Instead of words , we have a fine imagery ; thus , pearls indicate tears . The w ife of Henry IV . of France dreamed a few days before the murder of her husband , that two splendid diamonds had been changed into pearls . So Goethe , shortly before he visited Italy , had a dream of a symbolical character . He dreamed that he landed from a large boat on an island , fertile and richly covered with vegetation , where he knew the most beautiful pheasants were offered for sale . He directly traded with the inhabitants for these beautiful creatures , which they brought killed , and in large quantities . They were genuine pheasants , but as dreams usually transform every thing , they had long , colored-eyed tails like those of peacocks or birds of paradise . They were brought by scores into the vessel , their heads turned inward and arranged so ornamentally , that the long , variegated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilhant arches imaginable ; and so richly indeed , that room was scarcely left in the front and rear for the oarsmen and helmsman . Thus they cut the peaceful waves , and Goethe named to himself the friends to whom he intended to present these gay treasures . Though Goethe neither sent nor /z/ brought pheasants from Italy to his friends , he sent many a letter , filled with the riches of his poetical genius , which received new impulses and new materials from the world of art surrounding him .  --  Knowing the power of imagination , we can not feel astonished at the choice which it makes in our dreams of images , by which to convey its dark notions . A man , suffering from cramps in his breast , saw himself attacked and wounded by cats whenever his disease was about to return . Nor shall we consider it strange that it frequently makes use of images , which are directly opposite of what they are to indicate . Weeping in dreams is said to announce great joyousness ; cheerfulness in dreams foretells mourning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprize us of scorn which we shall have to endure from the world . Marriage- feasts in dreams are the messengers of misfortune , as funeral processions those of joyful occurrences . Romeo in a dream sees himself elevated to the dignity and splendor of an emperor , shortly before he hears of the death of his Juliet . In these images of our dreams a certain law prevails , when we think them to be arbitrary . This law is , that extremes elicit each other . Cheerfulness a:nd mournfulness , marriage and death , the sounds of joy and those of grief , are found more closely together in nature , than we are inclined to admit . Nearly allied to imagination is the activity of memory . This likewise is often active in our dreams , and when not divided , and when it is animated by the whole activity of the mind it will of course be more lively , more vivid , and perhaps more faithful in the detail of occurrences . Thus a gentleman dreamed that a person appeared before his bed , offering to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He agreed on having his past Hfe represented to him . The person then gave him a review of all that had occurred to him , the greater part of which he would not have been able to recall when awake . To explain this dream , we must remember a remark made above , that memory as well as every other power is subject to dissipation , and that it may treasure up occurrences , which the manifold employments of the day prevent it from bringing to our recollection , while dreaming , its whole activity dwells on one point only . It therefore represents past actions more in /z/ the detail , and not merely recollects them , but gives them all the novelty of recent occurrences . Dead persons die again before us ; we , in old age , go again to school with our books under our arms . Yet memory in our dreams is mechanical ; not subject to our will , so that we might demand certain things intrusted to it . It gives them according to the association of ideas , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory in its state of waking . Consciousness does not accompany its operations . When awake , we classify the contents of memory , and call upon it to give them according to general heads and classes ; this tendency to generalize , renders the memory less inclined to depict and delineate . In our dreams memory dwells more on the individual nature of occurrences , it loves the concrete , and hence its greater vividness and detail . There are some dreams that continue successively for a number of nights , to complete a long story . Here it must be remembered that similar feelings and circumstances will produce a type of a dream , which will continue as long as its causes and conditions are the same , until its subject is exhausted . 1 . The Form of Dreams , One delights in the illusions of dreaming because originating in ourselves they must have some analogy with the rest of our life and our fate ,  --  Goethe . Dreams being destitute of a clear self-possessed consciousness , they of course can have no logical connection . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of space and of time . In space one place can not be where another is , for different places occupy different positions ; and so whatever exists in a bodily form , while it must be somewhere , can not be every where . Dreams know nothing of these laws , but the persons and beings in them have a kind of ubiquity . In the twinkling of an eye we now are in Asia , and now in Africa . Our imagination may likewise travel fast when awake , but then the critical consciousness is closely following it . And so in dreams the laws of time are wholly neglected , such as those of succession of the past present and future . This succession /z/ enters into our thoughts and actions . Before we act we resolve ; our resolution , as something present , is referred to its execution as something future . In our dreams , resolution and action coincide in one moment ; the future is present . Thus all logical and all voluntary connection is destroyed . To have clearness and distinctness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of space and time ; we must , for instance , cause our memory to give up its contents in the regular order in which they occurred . And not only so , we must perceive the relations of cause and effect , ground and consequence . Where the things contained in dreams have nevertheless a strictly logical connection , it is not produced by our dreaming imagination or memory , but merely repeated by an involuntary association of ideas , or by our mechanical memory . In this limited sense it may well be said , as it has been asserted , that there is both an objective and a subjective connection in our dreams . Dreams arising in ourselves must have a subjective connection , an analogy with our disposition , knowledge , talents , and skill . There must be too an objective connection , for our dreaming imagination must have materials for its activity ; these must be given to it , and their original connection may preserve itself in our dreams . Such a connection , however , is mechanical ; it is like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attach themselves to each other on the ground , or like leaves that flow down the same rivulet , and are united not by their nature , but by the water that carries them . The subjective connection of our dreams demands , however , our particular attention , for these very frequently betray our true disposition and moral character . If during the time of busy activity our conscience is not permitted to speak , it will frequently burst its chains in our dreams and announce loudly to all that hear it , and especially to ourselves , what is in us . Shakspeare represents the dreams of conscience very beautifully in Lady Macbeth . A celebrated professor , who for some time had omitted offering his morning and evening worship , prayed in his dreams a number of nights in succession , and repeated all the bible prayers which he had learned by heart in his youth . The dream may be an illusion , but the disposition from which /z/ it arises will be true . It was on this principle , that a Greek emperor had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed him . 2 . Causes of Dreams . These are manifold , and it would be difficult to enumerate all of them and arrange them in classes . We shall therefore point out only a few , and among the most fertile ones are , 1 . Impressions on our senses . Thus we feel cold , and our imagination leads us into ice-fields ; light falls upon our eyes , and we exclaim Fire ! A philosopher dreamed that thieves were about to kill him , and to render his death more cruel , they introduced a large pole between his toes , and tried to break them out . He awoke and found a straw in the place of the pole . Sometimes a disordered system , any thing lying undigested in the stomach will cause dreams . 2 . Whatever has much engaged us during the day , whether it has been agreeable or disagreeable , will become a source of dreams during the night . Perhaps a strong emotion , suppressed by our will , while we were awake , disturbs our sleep ; or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment consider possible when waking , presents itself as realized . Persons desirous to be rich , dream that they are so . Talents , that are not permitted to exhibit themselves , because our daily employment is hostile to them , will seek for an opportunity in our dreams of exercising themselves . And so whatever impedes any activity , whatever disturbs body or mind , will cause our dreams and enter into them . The nightmare is a remarkable instance of the kind . A thick and impure air renders breathing difficult , and our imagination , which views every thing under the aspect of a concrete form and being , perceives a bear or a cat lying on our mouths . Carus . Junior , relates a case from Sedillot 's Journal de Medicine , which is to the point here . Laurent , the physician of the first battalion of the regiment . Tour d'Augergne , was lodged during a night in a deserted monastery at Palmi , in Calabria , when suddenly some persons , lying togeth- /z/ er in narrow rooms on straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in much frightened , all saying that they had seen a ghost-like , long-haired black dog , and had distinctly felt him running over their breasts . During the next night Laurent with some other officers , remained watching , after the soldiers had been persuaded to retire , and without their seeing any thing suspicious , the soldiers were frightened by the same dream , and could not be induced again to return to their lodging place . 3 . When our intellectual activity has been exercised but little or at least less than its power would demand to become relaxed , when consequently it stands in no need of recreation and sleep , then dreams will follow one after another , in case we retire to rest . Our senses close , but our mind feels reluctant to sleep . As a general rule it may be stated , that we never dream more , and sleep worse , than when we wake little . 4 . The nervous state of the system when weakened , may produce many dreams . Persons in fever , in delirium will imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nervous persons are full of them . If in this state of health we have no clear and distinct dreams , we toss about , groan and sigh , and it frequently takes us a long time to awake . Dreams , springing from the same causes , may be much modified by the disposition and character of the dreamer . The natural difference of the imagination , its degree of hveliness and strength , and its cultivation , will considerably affect its images and productions . The imagination of the painter , and that of the musician , of the poet , and that of the sculptor will certainly preserve their peculiar characteristics in their dreams . If the imagination is naturally productive and plastic , the materials furnished it in the dream , will be connected in new ways , and as the judgment is absent , these combinations wall frequently be of strange character . The most opposite things will be united , caricatures will be formed , animals speak , serious persons will appear in ludicrous situations and countries will present the most beautiful combinations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . From these few remarks , it must be evident , that the dreams of children , and those of old persons , must differ widely not /z/ only in their substance , but also in reference to their form , liveliness and distinctness ; and so again the dreams of savages and those of cultivated persons . The former will consider them too as being sent by a higher power and regard them as possessed of divine authority . Animals too dream ; but their dreams stand in the same relation to those of man , in which their instinct stands to the clear thinking of man . They may dream of pursuing a hare or chasing a stag , but their dreams can not go beyond the sphere of sensation ; they can not produce new images , &c.; /z/ Somnia sunt alia physical alia divina alia diaholica.  --  Melancthon . We propose to consider these different states of mind together , for they are to be explained on the same general principle . When speaking of sleep , we found it useful to glance at the phenomena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have when asleep , and presentiments which are the dreams of our waking mind will mutually explain and interpret each other . What we mean by prophetic dreams , will be easily seen from one or two examples . And here we can not help thinking of one , handed down by Cicero , who , as is well known , was by no means credulous . Two Arcadians came to Megara and took different lodging-places . The one of them appeared twice to the other in a dream , first seeking aid and then murdered , and stating that his corpse would be taken early in the morning on a covered wagon passing through a certain gate out of the city . This dream agitated the other , and going at the appointed time towards the gate , he met the murderer with the wagon and handed him over to the police . A lady of the writer 's acquaintance , was from home , when a little brother of hers was killed by an ox . The night after this occurrence she dreamed that an ox-cart was sent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This dream affected her spirits so much , that she expressed /z/ her apprehensions to her friends in the morning . When informed of the misfortune she directly understood her dream . The dream of Mr. Williams of Scorrierhouse , near Redruth , in Cornwall , is fully related in the London Times of the 16th of August , 1829 . He saw the Chancellor killed in the vestibule of the House of Commons , and having had the same dream thrice in one night , he communicated it to many of his acquaintances all of whom were living when the Times gave the account . Afterwards it was ascertained , that on the evening of the same day Mr. Percival was assassinated by a certain Bellingham . This dream resembles the second sight of Mr. Lodin , who in the hour of death saw the murderer of James V. From these few examples it will appear , that prophetic dreams are such as give us information concerning things which would seem to be inaccessible to our common senses at the time . It can not be denied , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet it must be admitted , that there have been dreams of the kind . To refuse belief in them altogether , would not annihilate them , but merely remove them from our consideration . It is more easy to disbelieve a thing that is difficult to explain , than to attempt to understand it . No doubt many dreams have been exaggerated , and to receive all without a critical judgment , would indicate great credulity . We shall therefore divide prophetic dreams into two classes ; the one embraces those dreams , the subject of which is the dreamer himself , his health , his state of mind , his conscience ; the other comprises all such as foretell something foreign to the dreamer , but always something that will stand in a necessary relation to the present , so that if nothing occurs to prevent it , it must develop itself from it . Dreams of the first class have never been much doubted , for physicians have too many opportunities of testifying to their truth . Persons while yet well receive by a dream an impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken sick with an inflammation of the brain , dreamed that her heart was changed into a serpent which rose with awful hissing up to her head . Her imagination represented her disease symbolically . Diseases do not all at once and suddenly seize our system . They have their beginning and course , /z/ and frequently develop themselves veiy gradually . Yet however small the beginning of a disease , it is the disease begun . If a strong nervous and muscular constitution may not perceive it until it has grovsn considerably , there is no reason to doubt the possibility , that a person whose nervous system is out of tune and highly sensitive when asleep , and when his whole mind is sunk into the state of a general feeling and raises and animates this , should perceive a future disease even in its very infancy . This will become more credible , when we consider that our body is a system , which consists not of parts as the machine , but of organs , each of which while it has a peculiar office represents our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs through the veins of the eye , will soon pass through every vein in the body . In the state of health , when all the organs are active in perfect harmony , no difference is felt ; but when one of them is about to separate its life from that of the others , a difference between itself and these must be exhibited , and this will be noticed . Our explanation of prophetic dreams , it will easily be perceived , strips them entirely of the power of prophecy , for they do not foretell that which is not yet , but that which is , and which in our common state of mind would be imperceptible , because it could not sufficiently affect our strong nerves . The dreams of the second class , on the other hand , that seem to foretell future occurrences or to have a sensation of things going on at the ' time , but at a great distance , like the dream of Mr. Williams , are founded either on sympathy as we shall see when we speak of presentiment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundation and that which rests upon it . So Franklin often perceived in his dreams the results of the labor to which he had attended during the day . These results were owing to the faithfulness with which he executed his business . The plant lies likewise in the seed as to possibility , and any one who sees the seed may prophecy what the plant will be that shall grow forth from it . Only those occurrences may , therefore , be foretold by our dreams , the premises of which are known to us , but it would be mere superstition to believe that we could anticipate in dreams the actions of a free-will. /z/ The whole subject before us will become more plain by considering the nature of presentiment , vision , and second sight . We shall also here preface each of these states of mind by giving one or two examples : Jung Stilling , in his Almanac of 1808 , relates a remarkable presentiment of a minister , who was taking a walk with the intention of visiting a rocky mountain near his house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While approaching the summit of the mountain he felt restless and uneasy ; unable to explain this feeling , he asked himself , whether it was right for him to spend his time thus idly , and busied in such thoughts , he stepped aside for a moment to seek a cool place under a wall formed by the rock . He had scarcely left the narrow path leading to the top of the mountain , when a large stone , breaking loose from the rest of the rock , with great vehemence struck the spot , where one moment before he was standing . The Reverend John Dodd , one evening , when already undressed , felt a great agitation in his mind which was wholly unaccountable to him . It seemed to him , that he ought to go and visit a friend , who lived a mile or two off from him . His family tried to dissuade him from going that night , but . their efforts were in vain . Mr. Dodd went , dark as it was , and on arriving at the house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His unexpected visit and counsel prevented the deed forever , and his friend became converted by divine grace . Schiller , the great poet , was in the habit of walking with his steward ; at one time , when passing on a rugged path through a pine wood and between high rocks , he was seized by a feeling that some person must be buried there . Some time after he was informed of the murder of a wagoner committed at the place , on which he had the presentiment . Presentiment-if now we should define it  --  is the dark foreboding of something taking place either in ourselves or around us . This foreboding is a dark feeling not understood by us ; a general feeling of restlessness , strange and altogether uncommon . Its possibility must not be considered as a privilege of the mind , to dive into futurity or distance , but as a disease and weakness , by which it sinks from its state of clear ' waking into that of dreaming and /z/ drowsiness , or from its state of human life into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more or less plunged into the general life of nature , and penetrated by it , and whose feeling is that of sympathy with the elements in which they live , have a high degree of presentiment . They seek , like the fish , distant waters , or like the bird , countries afar off ; they announce , while the sky is yet serene and clear the approach of a shower , and when the inhabitants around Vesuvius feel secure , the nightingale prophecies a near eruption , and flutters about , sending forth heart-rending notes . The less a being is independent of the element in which it lives , the more quickly it will perceive the changes going on in it , and again the less it can counteract an impression , the more vehemently it will be affected by it . If in a state of health we handle metals as we please , and perceive no effect from them , the mere touch of a ruby on the hand will cause to some diseased persons pain in the arm , or a feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an erroneous idea to think , that we can perceive by our common senses all the powders of nature . Many of them have only lately become known to us . The celebrated Brown divided substances into parts so infinitely small , that they were smaller than the four-thousandth part of an inch ; he then scattered them into the air , while not a breath was stirring , and observed them moving about . As the motion could not be their own , he concluded that there was a power which communicated it to them . This power is now ascertained to be in constant motion , and to pervade us , but we have in a healthy state of our nervous system no sense by which we may perceive it . This magnetic stream is nevertheless equally as certain , as the electric influences upon us , though we can not discover by our senses the polar relations in many chemical affinities . These activities , however , exist , and may become known to us in two different ways , either by a change taking place in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptible to us , which can afiect our senses , because it is strong enough to resist their activity . If the senses are excitable , the impression needs not be strong to be perceived ; if they are healthv , it must be energetic . We are penetrated by /z/ electric powers , without our feeling them . The eye . when it is pressed against any thing flashes forth electrical sparks , and the skin of the cat , when rubbed , emits them . As soon as this electric power approaches us with sufficient energy , we perceive it . So when we touch an electrical fish or eel . From this it follows , that when the external state of a natural power is changed , we may receive impressions from such as left us perfectly free before . And so it is when our own nervous system becomes more excitable ; then natural agencies will be perceived , though their energy should remain the same . The distance from which these agencies reach us , can not form any objection , or even cause any difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the medium of light , may be set in connection , for example , with the Sirius , which is so many thousand miles distant from us ; if the ear , so small an organ , hears the sound that originated twenty or thirty miles from us , and if we can not conceive the possibility of all this , what right have we to refuse belief in the possibility that magnetic and electric powers , may impress us from a greater or shorter distance ? If these remarks are correct , it can not escape us , that the more we are merged in the general life of nature , the more we shall sympathize with all its changes , and the more distant activities with which its agencies are connected , will become perceptible to those whose nervous system is capable of receiving impressions from them . On a similar ground we must explain presentiment concerning friends ; they rest on deep sympathy with them , on a kind of polar relation . Should a presentiment become more clear , and assume the form of prediction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin in the present , and that it must spring up from this source , as does the tree from the seed . Presentiments may become visions when our imagination gives them form and shape . They then will appear to us from without as images , which to the visionary seem to have reality . The images will not be produced arbitrarily by our imagination , but they will emerge from our feelings and be calculated to represent their general nature , which is either agreeable or disagreeable . When they proceed from the feelings , that accompany the activity of con- /z/ science , then they will often assume the forms of good or evil spirits , because they will symbolically represent feelings , flowing forth from a quiet or disturbed conscience . Yet before we define vision , it may not be disagreeable to give a general notion of it by a few instances : Petrarch , when at Vaucluse , saw Laura approach him at three different times during one night ; fear seized his limbs , and the blood returned to his heart . Trembling he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed a rock , he walked through the woods and looked around on all sides to see whether Laura was following him . " No one will believe me , but it is true ; I saw her in remote places , where I thought to be alone ; from the trunk of a tree , from the basin of a fountain , from the cave of a rock , from clouds , &:c.; Fear made me immovable , I knew not what would become of me , and whither I should go T* Torquato Tasso during the last years of his life , was firmly convinced that a friendly ghost was in the habit of appearing to him . His friend , the knight Manso , expressed his unbelief to him , and was requested to convince himself by being personally present at one of his conversations with the apparition . Manso agreed to it , but while Tasso conversed with his spectre , he could see nothing at all . One of the finest visions ever seen by any man , is no doubt that of Benvenuto Cellini , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goethe 's works . Cellini , the Italian artist , during his last imprisonment frequently prayed to God , that he would show him in a dream once more the disk of the sun . One morning he arose early and prayed fervently that God , by divine inspiration , would communicate the cause to him , why he was not worthy of seeing the sun even in a dream . While praying , and lost in the wish of seeing the sun , the Lord seized him in the manner of a wind , and led him into a large room , where he appeared to him in the form of a beautiful youth . He then saw a great number of persons , through the midst of which he had to force his way . At length he arrived at a narrow door , by which he entered a small street . Raising his eyes he perceived the sun . shining upon a high wall . The Lord then told him to walk up to a high edifice by a few steps , where he saw the sun in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light inclined to the left of the sun , and the disk became pure and clear , and appeared like a bath of purest gold . Soon after this , the middle of the golden circle expanded and became elevated , when ail at once Christ on the cross became visible , of the same pure gold , of which the sun was , and so beautiful and so benign , that no human mind could have imagined the thousandth part of such beauty . Then Christ moved to the left , and the centre of the circle again expanded and showed the beautiful figure of the holy virgin . She sat elevated , her son in her arms , and a smile on her face . On both sides two angels stood of great beauty . " All this I saw clearly and really , and thanked God constantly with a loud voice . " The images of vision originate in the same way , as those of our dreams . Here also it is a strong feeling , by which our whole mind is absorbed , by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind resting wholly in this feeling -- as for instance that of Petrarch in the feeling of love  --  will animate and raise it . Thus this feeling will re-act in uncommon strength , or render every other emotion subject to it , and as the mind is lost in it , imagination , which is nearest allied to feeling , will represent it in a concrete form , under an individual image , and place it without us . This is indeed the case with every artist , with the painter , the sculptor , the poet . Their imagination transfers a thought or feeling into an image , which of course they must see as clearly before them , as if it existed in reality . Yet there is this difference between the images of the artist and the visionary . The artist controls his imagination by a conscious judgment ; he distinguishes between it and its productions , and comprehends the latter as his own . The visionary looks upon them as possessed of reality ; he views them not as proceeding from him , but as approaching him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feeling , which gives rise to such a vision , may again be represented as being itself caused by the vision . So a woman entertained , for a considerable time , the idea of committing suicide ; but the voice of her conscience unnerved her arm . One morning however she plunged herself into a deep well , and while standing up to the chin in the water , she suddenly perceived a guardian spirit , that extended /z/ his hand to assist her in getting out of the well again . This friendly apparition no doubt was the voice of her conscience , whose words were put into the mouth of an image , which her own imagination had produced . So it is known that the celebrated Blake , the English painter , frequently saw before him the forms of Dante , Milton , Virgil and Pindar , as if they were his contemporaries . Once Milton communicated to him a poem , that had not been published before in his collected works . The poem was by Blake , but his vision made it appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from visus , sight , are not confined to the eye only , but all the senses may share them . Suso , for instance , ate strawberries that were offered him in neat baskets . Nicolai felt all the pain , caused by a bristly serpent , winding itself around his body . Jacob Boehme , in the hour of death , heard beautiful music , which was inaudible to every one of the bystanders . Yet the eye is most favourable to visions . It easily produces phantoms . Irregular points , indistinct outlines , confused spots will induce it , especially during moonlight , to draw them out into regular forms . If our imagination be strong , and our judgment weak , and our conscience not perfectly at peace with us , we shall see spectres and ghosts of all kinds , and thus tremble at the creations of our own mind . The eye is the sense too , that more readily obeys the internal urgency of imagination , and will more easily see those images , which imagination necessitates it to form . Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration . It differs from presentiment and vision , and again contains both united . Vision has but rarely any thing to do with predictions and future events ; it considers its images to be present and not future . Presentiment , on the other hand , is a dark foreboding of something distant , either in space or time . Second sight while it differs from both , has much in common with each . It unites in itself the forebodings of presentiment , and the clearness and distinctness of vision . Or it is a presentiment , that exhibits its foreboding in such an image , as its substance demands . Hence it is a vision , that without much imagination , indicates exactly what it represents . A lady , whose husband was from home , saw him return on the public road , when all at once /z/ he disappeared before her eyes . Afterwards she received information of his death , while travelHng homeward . The explanation of second sight seems at first to be extremely difficult ; but if the theory of presentiments and visions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain concealed from us , for it is nothing else than the union of both . Here as well as in presentiments , nothing can be foretold that has not its foundation in the elements surrounding us , or in the intimate and close sympathy which we feel w4th near acquaintances , friends , and relatives . There have been little islands on which the second sight was extremely common . Thus Faro Island , the islands around Scotland , and some valleys in other parts of Europe , the Steinthal , &c.; have been long known for their number of seers . The inhabitants of these islands and valleys are much separated from the rest of the world ; the silence and retirement of their residences makes them meditate much on themselves , and live more in each other ; their cultivation is not that of the mind in general , not that of judgment and reflection , but more that of feeling ; hence their relation to each other is based on the heart more than on the calculations of the understanding . Circumstances well known to the seer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly in feeling , affect deeply the latter ; this affection of the feeling , instead of reflecting on it and expressing its substance clearly , will be pronounced darkly , and in the form of presentiment by the seer , whose imagination will see the future in the present , and the effect in the cause , and represent it as vision does . Or the probability of an occurrence is to be ascertained by judgment ; but the seer , not exercising it , perceives it by mere feeling , and his fears or hopes set his imagination into operation , and he sees as real and present what his fears and hopes anticipated . This explanation will be found correct , at least with regard to one kind of second sights , when we consider tnat the seers in Scotland have been generally of very low rank and almost without any cultivation , wholly living in the state of nature ; and when we add , that those clans which had seers were frequently isolated , living entirely within the sphere of their own families . In such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member would easily communicate itself to all . As the cultivation of the mind becomes more refined , and the intercourse with the world greater , second sight becomes less frequent . When we have often a presentiment that some friend or other will pay us a visit , the seer adds the image and such other circumstances as may render themselves probable to his feeling . The more retired we live , the more important the visit from a friend would be , and the more it will engage our imaginr.tion . If our presentiment is called forth by circumstances that render such a visit probable , for instance by fine weather , or by the idea of leisure , or any thing known to be favorable , the seer does not leave it with this dark impression , but perceives the ship at great distance and the persons in it , and even the dress they wear . Thus the seer perceives at a distance what in reality he only sees in himself . Second sight , no doubt , in many instances is produced by magnetic or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , horses ; but there is certainly nothing miraculous about it . Another remark may not be out of place here . Thousands of impressions , ideas , notions , pass through our mind , and are no longer remembered ; they seem to be gone , without having left a trace . And yet while every sensation appears and disappears , none is lost , but each affects the mind , and exercises an influence upon its character . This influence will be felt long after the individual impression is forgotten . Though never remembered again as single impressions , they may nevertheless breathe life into our words , and a peculiar power into the productions of our minds . The elements lie in the soul , unknown to him , whose soul it is ; how much might be explained concerning visions and second sight , if these dark elements were always known to us . Second sight is not any thing arbitrary . Some seers it is true , received payment for second sights , but their visions were frequently full of deception . Seers can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor keep them off when they approach them . A seer who was warned by his minister , and admonished not to indulge second sights , saw during a sermon the corpse of a person then alive on the same place where that person afterwards was buried . /z/ Second sight is principally met with among the uncultivated , as Johnson has remarked , and as will appear from the history of idolatry ,  --  the Shaman are a remarkable instance  --  Swedenborg , however , though a learned and cultivated man , imagined himself to have travelled into other worlds , and thus mistook the productions of his own mind for genuine realities . So it was with the pious Oberlin , who was in possession of a map , on which he was in the habit of showing to the family that had lost one of its members , where the soul of their departed friend was to dwell . Savages , like Swedenborg , say that their souls are traveling when they dream . The idea that the soul can leave the body and wander into distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always by such as were a little diseased in their minds . The fear of ghosts and spectres , so common among all nations , and especially in their infancy , originates in a manner similar to visions . The spectres are but the productions of the imagination , sometimes called forth by an external impression on the senses . The state of the conscience will render them more or less terrible , so that in proportion as we fear these ghosts , we in reality fear ourselves . If our hearts are pure , and we are heavenly minded , the fear of ghosts will vanish , as legends give us to understand , when they require nothing more than a prayer to disperse spectres . When our conscience is troubled we shall feel alarmed , especially at night , by the supernatural world and its inhabitants . As we see ourselves in part when we see spectres , so we may see ourselves wholly , and such a sight of ourselves generally is thought by the credulous to indicate death . Goethe saw himself on the public road near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he really eight years afterwards rode on the same spot , but continued to live a long time afterwards . /z/ There is " scarcely a subject of Psychology more contested , than the one which we now approach . While some reject it , without having cooly examined it , others superstitiously and without any discrimination receive every fact related , if it is only uncommon and miraculous . It may be well to glance at both parties . The one of them rejects animal magnetism , because its phenomena are extraordinary or out of the common experience . They do not faithfully investigate and then judge , but determined to admit to be true only what can be handled , and what will easily be explained on common principles , they are ready to condemn whatever is not analogous to their own experience . They wholly forget , that nothing is true , because we experience it ; but that we experience it , because it is true or because it has reality . Experience does , therefore , not affect the truth of any thing , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Thomas Campanella , who died in 1639 , and who attempted to prove that Charles the Great never lived , wrote an essay , the object of which was to show how , by historical scepticism , the life of Napoleon might be considered a fiction , he could expect to succeed only on the principle of Sallust , according to which men are willing to admit what is common , but always inclined to respect what in the least extends beyond their ov/n capacities . These persons who prove everything by facts , and consider facts the basis of all knowledge , will reject them as soon as they do not correspond with other facts known to them . Satisfied with the use of the world , they never dream of any thing besides that which is visible , and yet every production of nature rests on an invisible power , everything that is perceptible on something that is concealed . The other party is always locking out for facts of magnetic sleep , that will astonish the world . If these phenomena could be explained , their interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , as anxious to receive all facts without reflecting on them , as the others are to denounce them . The former party thinJis , but thinking makes /z/ it an unbeliever ; the latter believes , but fears to think , and thus want of thought makes it superstitious . To it the facts are too high and too strong ; it can not grasp them , but must admit them and hence feels an unbounded respect for them , almost considering them of divine origin and as divine communications . Both parties , it may be easily seen , render it difficult to themselves to get a correct idea of magnetic sleep . If the thinker could once convince himself of magnetic phenomena in sleep , he could certainly no longer continue his opposition ; if the superstitious believer could understand their laws , he would cease to gaze with reverence upon them . But how can the one become convinced of facts , and the other of their laws , if both either do not investigate the subject or examine it with preconceived notions ? Whfen persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to the magnetizer , and then find that manipulation will effect nothing with them , they will at once have done with the matter . And yet they forget , that the relation between the magnetizer and the magnetized is a polar one , that on the part of the magnetized it is a disease , both bodily and mentally , that it demands confidence and faith , without which persons , subject to animal magnetism will feel an antipathy and yet be thrown into convulsions if an attempt is made to put them asleep . A sympathy between the magnetized and magnetizer is indispensable , and such a relation between both , that the nervous system of the latter is neither too strong nor too weak , but of the exact energy required to excite that of the former . If too strong , it produces cramps and pain ; if too weak , it can not cause any effect . When , on the other hand , the believer is constantly prepared to receive stories of all kinds of visions , of apparitions , of departed spirits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else can this predilection , which fears critical judgment , lead than to superstition ? Neither of these two parties take a correct position in reference to animal magnetism , and we shall have to deviate from both . On the one hand it will become candid examiners to exercise their full power of judgment , as one of the parties does , and on the other , to admit all well-authenticated facts , as the other does , with /z/ this difference , that we distinguish between well authenticated facts , and those relations that are the fictions of an imagination which delights in the supernatural and mystical . We do not propose to give a full theory here  --  this would be presumptuous and out of place . Nor is it our design , to include at present the artificially produced magnetic sleep or Mesmerism . We shall therefore confine ourselves to the natural magnetic sleep , which was in existence long before Mesmer discovered it , and which , if somnambulism is taken in its widest sense , may be called Idio or Autosom7iambulism . Much that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to magnetic sleep , for what presentiments are in our state of waking , the phenomena of magnetic sleep are in our state of sleeping . These phenomena are in general the following ; Persons speak , act , and walk about in their sleep ; they see themselves , their viscera , anticipate diseases , have presentiments of things future or at a distance , and frequently have apparitions . Their moral disposition seems to be raised , they speak a purer language and are in general elevated above their common character . The phenomena of the artificial and natural magnetism are nearly the same , for the socalled clairvoyance is peculiar to both ; but there are a few that belong exclusively to the former .  --  Such are the effects of manipulation , when the eyes close , the pupil turns upward , pain is assuaged , breathing becomes more easy , the face brightens up , and all heaviness departs from the limbs . Again : the dependence of the magnetized upon the magnetizer is so great , that it has been compared to that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the magnetizer are said to communicate themselves to the magnetized , who if the magnetizer is a physician , will prescribe medicines for themselves according to his system , or if he is a poet , write in his style . These phenomena will take place in natural somnambulisiii , in which persons likewise prescribe for themselves , and foresee the course their disease is likely to take . A few instances of magnetic sleep or somnambulism may throw light upon its nature : When the archbishop of Bordeaux was in the Seminary , he knew a young minister /z/ who was a somnambulist . In order to become acquainted with this singular disease , he went every night into his room as soon as the minister was asleep , and observed among the rest the following facts .  --  The young man arose , took paper and ink and wrote sermons . Whenever he had finished a page , he read it over from the top down to the bottom with a loud voice , and without making use of his eyes . When a passage did not please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with much accuracy above it . The beginning of a sermon pleased the bishop much . It was elaborate and well-written . In order to ascertain whether he had made use of his eyes or not , a piece of pasteboard was placed under his chin , so that he could not see the paper on which he wrote . He continued , however , to write without noticing anything that the bishop did . Again , in order to ascertain how the somnambulist could perceive the presence of objects , his paper was exchanged for another of a different size . He directly discovered it , while a paper of the same size laid in the place of his own , did not in the least disturb him . This case is related in the French Encyclopedia . From another remarkable case it appears , that somnambulism is not confined to the night , but may take place during the light of the day . A girl of fourteen years of age was seized by somnambulism while attending divine service . She rose and went home with her eyes closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bed . All attempts to awaken her were in vain ; after some time she went to a table , took a hymn book , sought and found the hymn which had been sung in the church , and with closed eyes she continued to sing where she had stopped when at the service . The same girl was sent by a minister , in whose service she was , to a Doctor Mueller , who lived at a distance of about three miles . She went while under the influence of somnambulism . The Doctor , aware of her disease , ordered something for her and sent her to his apothecary . There she waited for the medicine . Having received it , she went homeward while still asleep . Doctor Mueller followed her for more than a mile and a half , to observe her . She noticed every impediment in the path , and cai'efully avoided wagons and persons . When she awoke and noticed the Doctor , she /z/ was frightened , and knew not how she had come there . See Cams Junior , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned case proves that it is not the influence of the moon which gives somnambulists so much safety in climbing roofs of houses , and passing through dangerous places . The feeling of perfect safety , to anticipate this remark , is derived from their ignorance of the danger in which they are . A foot requires but a little small spot to stand on with perfect safety ; whether this spot be given on the roof of a house or on the solid ground , is a matter of little consequence to somnambulists , who do not judge while they are asleep . As soon as they perceive the danger , when suddenly awakened , they fall down or injure themselves . The above examples might be sufficient , were we not anxious to exhibit the strength of sympathy and antipathy in the state of somnambuUsm , and the great excitability of the nervous system . And here we shall allude to a woman of Prevorst in Wurtemberg , whose case has lately caused much sensation in Germany . Minerals when touched by somnambulists , will frequently produce the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is remarkable , that these effects not only differ widely from each other according to the different minerals , but also according to the different parts of the body with which they are brought in connection . They will produce convulsions , cramps , lameness , they will exhilarate or make desponding . With the woman of Prevorst , salt put into her hands immediately caused salivation ; copper , colic and nausea . Without taking it into her mouth , she felt the acid taste of spar . Crystal laid upon her , awoke her when asleep , but when placed upon her heart , it made her whole body stiff . Other metals made her laugh , and others again cry . It is certainly worthy of our notice and may aid us in some considerations hereafter , that she seemed to feel the nature of these metals , as she could enter into the views and feelings of persons . Very hard metals , universally caused her muscles to grow stiff and hard ; soft spar produced the contrary effect . Somnambulists , as has been seen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the head are asleep . How then /z/ is it possible , that they can walk or write or act ? How is it possible , that a somnambulist , with closed eyes , can run faster through a large dark cellar , than other persons , with a light in their hands , can follow her ? The following theory , accepted by many , is offered to the consideration of the reader : Here we must remember what has been said on the nature of sleep and dreaming in general , that the life of the soul is merged in that of the body , and rests principally in in the ganglion nervous system . This now is so much excited in its activity , that to some degree it may be substituted for the upper senses . The sense of feeling as spread over the whole skin , is the source of the four senses of the head , as may easily be seen from comparative anatomy . With the crab for instance , the ear is nothing else than a skin , softer than the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves . The eye of flies consists only of a thin skin , to which runs a filament of a nerve . Oken , in his Natural History says : " at the sides of the head are two eyes , composed of many single ones , which have a great many surfaces  --  the eyes of the butterfly have seventeen thousand . These eyes are only the arched and thin skin , to which extend nerves , that lead out single filaments to each surface . " With snails no organ of sight can be observed , and yet according to Oken they distinguish , like some maggots , between darkness and light . Flies have undoubtedly a good scent , and yet they have no nose . Some have therefore thought that they smell with their windpipes , others with a soft place behind their lips , and others with their feelers . These remarks fully establish the truth , that our common way of perceiving things is not the only one , and therefore what is not analogous to it , deserves not to be rejected for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the whole body , is heightened and changed into a capacity of perceiving . The mere feeling of any thing within or without becomes a sensation or perception ; hence somnambulists see their own viscera , and especially those which are much excited during the state of somnambuhsm . The power of perceiving thus produced will be strongest , wherever many nerves are concentrated , as on the cavity of the heart and /z/ Other parts of the body . The nature of this sensation is , however , indistinct and confused , since it is only by the division of the sensitive power into five distinct senses , that we can obtain clear and transparent ideas of things around us . Salt , for example , is white to the eye , sharp to the taste , and angular to the touch ; we observe these different qualities , by bringing one after the other in contact with our different senses . When all the senses are merged in one , that is , when the divided activity of sensation , is reduced and without order to one simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else than dark and confused . It would therefore be wrong to say of somnambuUsts that they see and hear , taste and smell , but like snails they have only a dim impression of light and darkness , and like animals that have no regularly formed ears , they have but a dull , dreamlike sensation of sound . With this view of the sensual life of the somnambulists , it may safely be said that the general sense , which develops itself from feeling , takes the place of the others , as does feeling in some degree that of sight with the blind . The blind , though by mere feeling he may distinguish between black and red , can get no idea of color by it . So the somnambulist can get no clear idea of objects , but only perceives their presence and general difference . When Spallanzini cut out the eyes of bats , and then set them free , he observed with astonishment , that they avoided every obstacle in their way . How could they do this ? Certainly only by the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such a general sense , because we can not conceive of its nature and activity ;  --  though both may be understood from the general nature of sleep . Such an objection would be in no wise better , than if the blind should object to a sense like that of sight , merely because all our explanations will not give him an adequate idea of it , he having nothing analogous to it in his experience . The strength of sympathy and antipathy may now be easily explained . When we have the full use of all our senses , we can govern the impressions made upon us , at least to a certain extent . We may exclude the light from the eye , the noise from the ear . But when the life of the /z/ soul is sunk into that of the body , and has resigned its dominion for a time , when the distinctness of sensation is gone , and when instead of many senses , but a general sense is active , then we are more receptive , more passive , more under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us pleasantly , we either sympathize with the object from which it comes , or feel an antipathy to it . The nature of feeling always expresses itself directly , without reflection . The fact , that somnambulists frequently prescribe correct medicines for themselves rests on the feeling of disease , which makes them seek for relief , and though man is not under the dominion of instinct in somnambuHsm , something analogous to it makes its appearance . Their sympathy with vegetables known to them , will guide them . The dog when sick finds an herb to cure him . The disease in him impels , by a feeling of want and pain , to seek for something , and finding the herb , he will be made certain by the impression he receives from it through scent , that it will afford what his diseased system demands . As the magnet attracts the iron , as the negative pole attracts the positive , so a relation between the disease and the natural remedy will force the dog to seize the latter . With regard to perceptions of distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects as above . With a few modifications all will pertain to the present case . We only add an extract from Goldsmith 's history , which may give us a case analogous to the perception of distant objects in animals . Speaking of the pigeon , he says : " the letter is tied under the bird 's wing , and it is then let loose to return . It is seen on such occasions , flying directly into the clouds to amazing height , and then with the greatest certainty and exactness directing itself by some surprising instinct towards home , which lies sometimes at many miles distance , bringing its message to those to whom it is directed . By what marks it discovers the place , by what chart it is guided in the right way , is to us utterly unknown . " The carrier pigeon can not possibly see the place whither it is to go , and yet it is certain of it , though we can not comprehend how it became so , because the sense by which it is made certain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to somnambulists. /z/ Our body as has been already remarked is not a machine , but an organism . A machine is externally composed ; its parts are joined in each other by a power not resting in it ; the idea of the mind producing it , is not contained in it but in the mechanic , and precedes it as all its parts exist , before it is finished as a whole . This external composition , in which one part is connected with the other , not by its internal nature or by otw life pervading all the parts , but by mechanical cohesion renders it possible , that when one part of the machine gets out of order , it may be mended or another substituted for it . With the body this is different . Its members are not merely parts , but organs for they are alive , and their life is that of the body , as the life of the body exists only in them . All the organs together constitute the organism ; the former do not precede the latter , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the seed the plant . In such an organism each organ has a peculiar position and importance or design ; both position and design are given it by the general life of the organism , so that the root as of the plant can not be where the stem is , nor the stem where the flower , and so that the stem has a design different from that of the root . But it is one life that unfolds itself in the root , stem , and flower which connects them , and which is the same in every one of them . This life they have to manifest , and while each organ is active for itself , it is so only in reference to the whole , from which it derives existence and activity . Thus it is with our body . Each nerve is connected with all the nerves . The body may be said to be well , only when all its organs are harmoniously active . By the term harmoniously we understand that there are different organs , but that they all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , therefore , no organ obtains an ascendancy over all the others , or isolates its activity , or absorbs that of the rest ; when , however , any organ does become active without reference to the whole  - -  by what cause is here entirely indifferent  --  then the body /z/ is diseased , the organism is deranged : this is indicated bypain , for pain is the feeling of a conflict or separation between parts belonging together . The definition of bodily disease will render that of mental derangement easily understood . The mind is pure activity , and as such a perfect union . But this activity takes different directions and unfolds itself in different ways , and thus it may be said to be the union of manifold activities , all of which are internally united , each being what the other is , and all serving the same whole , yet each in a specific manner . When these activities harmonize , that is , when each in its place fulfils its design , and no one interferes with the other , so that while many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their tendency to serve the whole to which they are subordinate , the life of the mind may be said to be healthy . Or in other words the activities of the mind are many , but when they are co-ordinate to each other and subordinate to the mind as their whole , so that all are equally penetrated and governed by the whole mind , then the latter is well . But when this co-ordination is interrupted , when one of the mental activities succeeds in gaining the exclusive interest of the mind , and thus by an increased strength absorbs all the others or suppresses them , the mind is out of order . There is none of the activities wanting , but the order in which each ought to be active in its sphere without interfering with the other , and in which all should aid and support each other is deranged . When , for instance , the imagination is active without or independent of judgment , it will produce phantoms and fantastical notions . With the poet , imagination is likewise principally active , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the memoiy , and by the judgment . The latter pervades it , for a poet must know what beauty is , and to know this he must judge much and constantly , compare his productions with the laws of beauty known to him , and control his imagination . Division principal activities that may be diseased , and thus have considered melancholy as a disease of feeling , insanity as a disease of the understanding , and mania as a disease of the will . Yet /z/ the activities of mind so relate to each other , that the disease of one will affect all the others . The maniac is not only diseased in his will , but also in his imagination and judgment , for how can any one will any thing without a knowledge of it ? And how can he know it without judgment ? Another principle of division has therefore been proposed , one derived from the relation of the mentally diseased to the objective world around him . This principle must be correct , if it is right to say that derangement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental activities being out of order , we live only in our own ideas and notions , in the fictions of our brain , and substitute them for the reahties and relations of real life ; in which consequently the mind by supposing its fictions to be true , comes into contradiction with the world . The position which the derangement of mind assumes , may be a threefold one : 1 . Melancholy . Here the deranged on the one hand is fully convinced , that his notions and wishes ought to be realized , but on the other he darkly feels the impossibility of effecting their realization . He therefore makes no effort to render possible the impossible ; yet he can not resign the ideal , which he bears in his bosom ; he loves his fictions or the objects of his wishes so much that he can not part with them . Thus he consumes his existence in a monotonous grief ; he can not take interest in any thing , except the object of his sadness . A young girl of cultivated mind was known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head bent down . After long and repeated attempts nothing was drawn from her except a nod or a shake of the head . When she was asked if any person had injured her , she shook her head . When asked if she had injured others , she nodded . But how ? no one could learn from her . One Monday the unfortunate girl at length determined to repeat the Lord 's prayer . When she came to the petition ; " Lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil ; " she raised her voice with the strongest emphasis , and some time afterwards she cried out most piteously : " Alas ! the sin against tke Holy Ghost . " Here the idea , that she had committed the sin against the Holy Ghost , was viewed by the girl as real , while at the same time she desired it to be otherwise , and feeling the impossibility of /z/ undoing what she supposed she had done , it threw her into the state in which we find her . 2 . Insanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world as it is and of its relation to him ; he feels convinced that all his imaginations are real , and exist in full truth . He is therefore satisfied and cheerful , and very ingeniously assimilates the whole world around him to that of his dreams . He is no longer sensible of any contradiction of his phantoms to the world . If he fancies himself a king , he will act as a king with the most logical consequence . So the Jesuit , Father Sgambari imagined that he had been created a Cardinal . To convince him , that his flattering fancy was an error , Father Provinzial , in the hope of curing him , made a friendly representation to him . He answered in this dilemma : " You either consider me insane or not . In the latter case you do me great injustice , in speaking to me in such a manner . In the former I consider you with your permission , a greater lunatic than myself , because you think you can by mere persuasion bring me to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sound , and disposed to scientific investigations . Whenever students addressed him with " Your Eminence , " he was social and communicative . As the body is often partially diseased , but otherwise well , so may the mind be partially deranged . Sometimes persons have become estranged to themselves . A soldier looked on his body as a miserable machine , made to replace his former real body , that had been destroyed by a cannon ball . Or persons , whose judgment is diseased , and whose imagination is active without restraint , produce all kinds of images , when they feel pain , and consider them as the cause of the pain . Animals bite them or sting them . Tissot relates the case , of a man , that became deranged from constant study . He was convinced , that seven horsemen were constantly fighting in his stomach . 3 . Mania . This state of derangement unites in some degree the two former . The melancholy man conscious of the impossibility of realizing his wishes , dwells with his whole mind constantly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reality of the world , and discovering the permanent contradiction , he has an ever- /z/ teeming source of sadness in the results of this comparison . The insane , on the other hand is determined no longer to acknowledge the world around him , as it is , but to re-model it so as to bring it in harmony with that of his imagination . The maniac , like the melancholy man , feels that what he takes to be real , is not so , but that the opposite of it , is ; at the same time he has the tendency of the insane , to realize his fictions , for he considers them to be true and correct . This realization can not be easily effected as with the insane , for the maniac feels the contradiction of his fictions with the world ; he therefore , finding the world in his turns against it with the hope that by its destruction he may realize the purposes of his diseased will . He rages because he can not effect what he designs , nor can he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that kills in his fury whoever opposes him . His whole mind will have fixed itself in one idea , and can not retire from it , because he has given it dominion over himself Hence the imnfienod muscular power in the fits of mania . - ' All the diseases of the mind have their longer or shorter intermissions . This shows , that the reason exists , and is only deranged . Many insane persons are so merely with regard to a single subject , but on every other they are perfectly sane . Others are insane only during a certain period of the year . A celebrated physician of Venice imagined during the dog-days , that he was an earthen jar , and locked himself up for a whole month . After the four weeks were past , he came down again , and went as usual to his employment . Every kind of derangement , according to the statements of many physicians , abates in old age , and the deranged state of mind is therefore one that will pass away sooner or later . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ susceptible of many subdivisions . Insanity , for instance , includes imbecility of mind , weakness of the understanding and will in which man can not take care of himself ; incapacity of connecting ideas , or of seizing a thought and fixing the mind on a single idea ; idiocy , when a person is active without having any particular object in view ; lunacy , when the insane considers himself perfectly rational , melancholy comprises hypochondria , which tortures man by /z/ making him constantly brood over future or present , real or imaginary evils . Mania applies to those that find pleasure in abusing others , in ridiculing them , or who desire to destroy others , and cunningly watch for a proper opportunity . Our division will be found to comprise all the possible relations which the subjective mind may , in its state of derangement , assume to the objective world around . At the same time it agrees with the division founded by others on the principal activities of mind , for melancholy seems to rest on deep feeling and emotions ; insanity on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One question is left which seems to be of great importance . How is it possible that the mind , a purely intellectual activity of divine origin , can become diseased ? It would seem to have the power to keep itself free from every thing that might entangle it . But here we must remark in the first place , that the soul is already diseased in its state of nature ; for turned away from its proper objects , truth , and holiness , and the love of God'it is sinfulness and vice , and instead of deriving its food and nourishment from a study of the good and noble , it seeks for it in the sensual and transitory . But that which nourishes a power communicates also its nature to it , as may be observed in every thing living , in every plant , which , in absorbing the light , becomes colored , and in receiving the air , receives fragrance . As little as the magnet could be said to be in its vigor , if instead of pointing towards the north , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so little is the mind healthy , when it once has lost its only proper direction , but it must be said to be in error and in a dangerous deviation from the right path . To express these remarks more fully , we will consider , for a moment , the nature of will . The ivillf one of the activities of mind , is healthy , when by its own power it freely directs itself in accordance with the divine will , so that it agrees with it both externally , as to the action , and internally as to the disposition . When on the other hand it does not so , but directs itself either by desires or passions , then it is not free , but under the dominion of something different from itself , which is the ground of its determination . The divine law is the divine will . It is the only source of freedom , and /z/ it alone is free * , the human will directing itself by it or by the divine law , returns to the source from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consequently free . To enter on this subject fully here , would lead to discussions that would take up too much room . One idea it may however be useful to mention here , an idea , according to which it is supposed that our will is free , when it can choose between the evil and the good . This idea is wholly erroneous , and instead of calling such a will free , it would be better to call it arbitrary . For if freedom , like every thing else in creation , has its own nature , and if without it nothing can be said to be free , then freedom includes the necessity of acting in accordance with its own nature , or else it destroys itself . This nature is contained and expressed in the divine law , which , like the divine will , can not be influenced by any thing except itself , because whatever is , is created by it and dependent upon it . The human will can be free , therefore , only when it receives the divine will as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil and sin , it would miss what it seeks for , liberty , * and become the slave of sin ; for sin is so wholly opposed to purity of will , that it destroys its freedom . As long , therefore , as a will is capable of choosing between the good and evil , between heaven and hell , between the source of its life and that of its death , so long this will is not free . It would no doubt at once be considered erroneous , if any one should assert that fire , in order to be fire , might choose between burning or not burntng , or that water might be water , whether it would moisten or not ; or that light might be light , though it should be able to choose between itself and darkness . Every one will admit , that in the moment light chose to turn into darkness , it would lose itself and cease to be the free light . So it is with liberty . It must , in order to remain what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * It will be easily seen that it is by no means the author 's desire to discuss the nature of will in this place , that it is rather introduced for the sake of comparison , than for its own ; he hopes therefore that the mere incidental allusion will not be made the basis of either friendly or unfriendly criticism . He here speaks of the contents and not of the /orm of will , and again of pure and genuine and not of common liberty . /z/ is , to determine itself freely by its own activity , and not by any thing different from itself . Liberty is therefore a free activity that is not arbitrary , but includes necessity . But the human will , in its state of nature , is averse to necessity , and instead of perceiving in it the protector of its liberty , it views it as its enemy . It has therefore lost its liberty , and may , in this respect , be compared to a planet that has no light in itself , but must receive it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet remains in its path , and preserves its relation to the sun , it has light , and whatever grows on it is filled with light , and grows and blooms in the most beautiful colors . But if the planet at any time should choose between its regular course and another , and really pursue one leading off from the sun , darkness and death would reign on it and destroy all life . The sun of the will is that of righteousness or the divine will ; it alone can make us free . Rejecting it , we reject the only source of freedom , and become mentally diseased . The eye of man has a latent light in itself , but this light is darkness , and will remain such unless it be excited by the light of the sun . Suppose the sight to be the freedom of the eye , the eye can be said to be free only when turning towards the light , but not when diving into darkness . So the will is free , only when living in its proper elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and divine , and when it does not suffer any attraction or power to separate it from the divine law . From these remarks it will sufficiently appear , that the will in its state of nature is diseased . It is not directed towards its proper object ; nor does it receive its proper nourishment ; nor is it pure , but much more determined by sensual appetite and desires , by inclinations and passions . Every passion is a transient derangement , and the only difference between it and a real derangement is this . The man in passion may be so overpowered , that he , as for instance in anger , can no longer control himself ; yet he enters into this passion arbitrarily , and might if he chose avoid it . The maniac , on the other hand , comes under the influence of his passions , independent of his will . Some maniacs frequently foresee their fits , and beg that they may be chained lest they should hurt some person . With this /z/ view history agrees . For a spirit of revenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the first that have become known historically for their derangement , Hercules and Ajax . Some have therefore thought that a mental derangement was merely psychological , and always caused by sinfulness . This idea , no doubt is correct , if it means to assert , that the body itself became subject to diseases only by the fall of man . Certain it is , however , that by the close connection of the body with the soul , the former has frequently been the cause of the diseases of the latter . Passion , as haughtiness , revenge , wrath ; deep emotions , as terror and fright ; inclinations , as unfortunate love , may become the causes of derangement , and the works of Shakspeare exhibit the most interesting examples of this kind . If the will of man were pure , these powers of sin could not affect it . If man had faith in God , and loved him supremely , if he confided in his providence , then he would not become the prey of every passion , nor would loss and misfortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthly things , he must despair when they are taken from him , or when he can not attain to the objects of his highest wishes . He lives in the sphere of delusion ; how easy then must it be for the demons of pride and wounded ambition , of unsatisfied vanity and sore jealousy to derange a mind that has no hold in any thing which is permanent and soHd . If that on which we stand constantly turns around with us , we must become giddy . Again , the constant use of one and the same mental activity may so awaken all others , that a derangement will be the Consequence . This is the case with such as have become insane from the study of mystical books . Or the whole mind of a person is so constantly devoted to one single object , it becomes absorbed by it and so fixed upon it , that it can not keep oflf its image . So Orestes constantly saw the blood gushing from the wound inflicted on his mother by his own hand . So when Spinello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination was filled with the picture , until at length he saw Satan constantly at his side , reproaching him for having painted him so ugly . And what else than the silent beginning of derangement was it , when /z/ a painter , who had killed a person , afterwards drew a picture that was beautiful in every respect , but over which such a gloom was spread , that no person could look upon it without feeling an awe for which nothing could account , except the diseased imagination of the painter . As derangement is caused by the activity of the mind itself , so again the activity of the body may operate on it and derange it . And here any thing that destroys the health of the body , will more or less affect the mind . Intoxication is in itself a transient derangement , for it causes such an excitement of the . nerves , that they with their whole activity , especially that which principally depends upon them , as the imagination , withdraw themselves more or less , from the dominion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep follows . A drunken person walked at night through a street , beautifully illuminated by the moon ; and thinking it was a river , undressed himself to bathe , and could only be convinced of his mistake by the hardness of the stones . Another in falling down a flight of stairs , rose calmly and asked a friend that happened to be with him with much concern , " whether he had hurt himself in falling down so many steps ? " He could not be persuaded that it was himself that had met with the accident , but insisted on his friend 's having fallen . The delirium tremens , or mania potu are too well known to be mentioned here . In America and Europe more than one third of all the deranged persons become so from the use of hquors ; in China , on the other hand , from that of opium . Poisonous food may likewise cause delirium . Two monks ate water hemlock . Both immediately felt much thirst ; both plunged into water , the one thinking that he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and both declaring that they could live no where else except in the water . Tissot knew a child four years old that raved several times a day . He ascribed it to the food which it had received from its nurse . Want of sleep may derange the activity of the mind as well as too long a deprivation of food . Ugolino ate in his delirium his own child . The idiocy of children is frequently the consequence of the sinful life of parents . It may be easily understood how bodily sickness may /z/ produce mental derangement . Our ideas , our whole thinking depends in some degree on our nervous system . Where nerves are , there is feeling ; and where feeling is , there is either instinct , or in its place consciousness . Man becomes conscious of every feeling produced by impressions on the nerves , and when the nerves are diseased , the feelings must be so ; and if they are unsound , the ideas called forth by them must become unfavorably affected . With every feeling is connected pleasure or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulge the pleasant , or to remove the unpleasant feeling by action and activity . Want is a state of necessity , in which some organ of our body finds itself ; when this state of the organ enters the nervous system attached to it , it is felt ; of this feeling we become conscious , and produce in accordance with it certain notions and ideas . While we therefore must agree with those physicians , that derive many mental diseases from organic derangement , we must at the same time deprecate the idea that the body is the sole source of mental sickness . W " e would rather repeat it as our conviction , that the mind , if it were directed to its proper object , to God and a Savior , could rule over its body as well as over its passions , for it would then possess purity and a power over all things which are merely earthly . If it would keep itself aloof from them , and be ready to lay down the life for Christ 's sake , it could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some may perhaps feel inclined to reply , that mental derangement arises frequently from too deep a religious solicitude . This may be true , and yet it will not affect our theory . Good wine will become spoiled in an impure vessel . When a man will not surrender his life , and yet longs for the privileges of religion , when he will not give up his sin , and yet can not resign the possession of divine favor , and when he then feels the contradiction between his state of sinfulness and that of desired sanctification ,  --  he may easily become deranged , not through religion , but by his relation to it . /z/ We have seen that the mind depends greatly on external influences and on the body of man , and yet it exercises by its energy a control and dominion over the elements around it and also over the body . It affects the form , the health and vigor of the latter , and leaves on it an impression of its strength of character and disposition . To direct the attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the object of the present chapter . 1 . The mind has an influence on the form of the body . This assertion may be easily established , for it is too well known how a fright of the mother during pregnancy , or the sight of any disagreeable or deformed person affects the form of the embryo . The deformity of many children , the deficiency of some members , the weakness even of some senses , as for instance of the eye , in Albinos must be traced to the influence of which we speak . Howshipp , an English physician , relates a remarkable case of this kind . A woman in the state of pregnancy was frightened in crossing a frozen river ; the ice burst and cracked , she was terrified , and when delivered of a child , its skin was rent and gaped considerably in many places , but had begun to heal up . The Lacedemonians were familiar with this powerful influence , for they placed the beautiful statutes of Apollo , Hyacinth , and Narcissus in the rooms of their wives when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease to the embryo . The mind of the mother has its influence not only on the body , but also on the disposition of the child , as we have seen in another place . The Jesuits , well versed in the subject of educa- /z/ tion , showed therefore much sound wisdom in always ascertaining the character of the mother when they received a new pupil . The reason of this influence is obvious . The life of the mother and that of the embryo- child is one . One blood circulates in both , the same nourishment sustains both , and the feelings of the mother are , at least in some degree , also those of the embryo . The body of the child being in a state of developement , is of course more subject to the reception of so powerful impressions , and of the changes produced by them , than that of the mother which is already formed . And yet we may see similar effects of the power of the mind on the body of adult persons . Vice and crimes seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . Testa found the heart of a great criminal , hard , hairy , and skinny ; and Riolan found that of a very vicious man gristly . The same observation has often been repeated . 2 . The mind exercises a power over the health of the body . It would be superfluous , to repeat here , that certain diseases of the body are accompanied by weakening emotions of the mind , as anxiety , despondency , melancholy , fear , a tendency to commit suicide , &c.; Such diseases are those of the liver , obdurations of the intestines . And yet other diseases have a cheering effect upon the mind , as for instance consumption , diseases of the lungs , &c.; So the mind in its turn exercises the most powerful influence upon the health of the body . Fear relaxes the muscles and strips the whole system of energy , and exposes it to the attacks of a fatal miasma ; on the other hand , a strong will and courage keep off the enemy . We will here allude to a few instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy was seized with epilepsy , all those in whose sight this occurred , were so terrified that the disease soon spread through the whole asylum . The celebrated Boerhave knowing the cause of their disease , after having used all other means in vain , had instruments brought , such as pincers , hooks , hammers , &c.,; had them placed in the fire , and then threatened that the first child that became epileptic should be pinched and tortured with these hot instruments . The children fearing this , were all of them delivered from this dreadful evil . This statement agrees /z/ with another recorded in Schubert 's History of the Soul . In the year 1800 the fever raged awfully in the city of Cadiz . Two hundred dead persons were daily carried out of the city , and all the streets were filled with the smell of death . All ties of friendship and sympathy were torn asunder , when all at once the powerful fleet of the English appeared before the city . The citizens forgot the pestilence , and instead of despairing and committing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From that moment the fever disappeared . A student of Boerhave always felt the symptoms of every disease , on which this great physician lectured . Tissot relates two cases , in which one was freed by violent anger from the gout , and another who had been mute for four years received his speech again . So a son of Croesus , who was mute from his youth , when he saw a soldier threatening to kill his father , was enabled by the powerful emotions of anger with a loud voice to speak the words , " Do not kill Croesus ! " The celebrated Stahl became acquainted with a similar fact during his practice . Lameness has frequently been healed by fright , caused by fire or other dangers . Hydrophobia is said to have sometimes originated in groundless fear . The power which the mind frequently exercises during times of revivals , is known from the history of one which took place a few years ago in the west of our country . Persons walking to church were seized on their way by strange feelings and fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church of the Methodists ; the upper members of the body trembled and were convulsed , and the muscles of the face were distorted . See Schubert 's History of the Soul , p. 834  --  852 . These examples will sufficiently show the power of the mind over the body . The question yet left is . How is it possible that the mind can exercise such a power on the body ? To understand this possibility we must consider , that all the emotions of the mind have each its peculiar nerve on which they act . This nerve , becoming thus affected , will in its turn affect all those immediately connected with it . If the emotion is invigorating , as that of courage , hilarity , &c.,; the life of the nervous system will be elevated and strengthened ; if the emotion is of a weakening character , as fear , sad- /z/ ness , &c.,; the nervous system will become depressed . The nerves pass over the whole body , and every organ is surrounded by them ; hence it is , that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the circulation of the blood , breathing , digestion , and even the vDice will be either impeded or promoted by emotions . An example or two will serve to make this more clear . When we are under the influence of the emotion of joy , we feel our pulse beat higher , our cheeks redden , breathing becomes easy , and the muscles elastic . A fresh and vigorous life is spread through all the nerves ; the eye sparkles , and digestion is accelerated . And all these changes in our system proceed from the nerve , upon which joy principally acts . Joy is the pleasant feeling that connects itself with the realization of a hoped-for good or pleasure . This feeling has not therefore a physical origin , but its ground is the idea of good , which we anticipate . When this anticipated good presents itself to us , the feeling of pleasure excites first our cerebral system , and thence it sends its rays of life into all parts of the body . So again anger has the most powerful effect on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rousing violently the slumbering Hfe , or more frequently producing diseases . Anger is an emotion , in which a strong feeling of displeasure arouses the desire and an expectation of destroying the cause of this displeasure , or of causing a similar unpleasant feeling in him who is the offender . This is at once perceptible in the external appearance . For all the muscles , subject to the will , are in motion . The eye rolls about ; the face is distorted ; the teeth are grated ; the voice roars or trembles ; the fist is clenched . Our organism forms a whole , and every local excitement , if strong enough , will communicate itself to all parts of the body . The agitation of the muscles and nerves , immediately subservient to will , will be propagated upon the ganglion nerves , and from them upon those that entwine themselves around the viscera . Hence the secretion of bile will become more copious ; the circulation of the blood will be more rapid , and warmth will be quickly developed . And here we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more copious , but are essentially changed in their quality . The saliva , /z/ for instance , becomes poisonous in a high degree , the milk of nurses causes cramps , convulsions , and colic in children nourished by it . A person , biting in his wrath another , may cause his death by the introduction of the venomous saliva into his blood . This also may be easily explained . For the saliva , according to Oken , has the office to kill the life of all the substances ve eat and assimilate ; strictly speaking , all saliva is poisonous , and even that of birds has been fatal to persons . When novr the hostile nature of anger communicates itself to the whole body , and consequently also to the saliva of the glands of the mouth , it will not only excite to a higher degree its poisonous nature , but positively impregnate it with its own fury . In the same manner the foam of a mad dog becomes poisonous , and also the saliva of many furious animals . It would be easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as for instance , of fright , which sometimes deprives us of our senses , causes us to swoon , makes the voice tremble , and takes away all self-possession . But the above examples will suffice . One remark , however , we will here add lest we should be misunderstood .  --  On the one hand , one and the same organ may be affected by different emotions , as for example , the liver by fear , fright , discontentment ; and on the other , the same emotions do not always produce the same effects , for while the feeling of shame makes some blush , it will cause the faces of others to grow pale ; and while wrath affects the liver of one , it will derange the digestion of another , and promote the appetite of a third . Therefore the idea of Plato , which was before entertained by Homer , that each emotion and passion had a particular organ as its seat , as courage the breast and lungs , ( thus in Homer a strong and loud voice is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted with much caution . This much however may be seen from the above remarks , that a general excit6ment of the blood and nerves may become beneficial to an existing disease , as well as dangerous to an otherwise healthy system . 3 . The power of the mind over the body may be seen from the formation of habits . Habit is the regular return of actions that , by frequent repetition , have lost all feeling of strangeness . Nerves and muscles have their natural po- or Tjiic /z/ sition , and the feeling connected with it is simple . When a new action demands a change of this position , a new feeling will connect itself with it , and this new feeling will interfere with the former simple feeling , until a frequent repetition of the same action makes the blood , nerves , and muscles , run repeatedly through the same position , and thus makes them familiar with it . Then the feeling of strangeness will also disappear , and what before attracted our attention by its novelty , will be no longer noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves , by frequent repetitions , has lost the feeling of strangeness , it is still felt , but we no longer distinguish between the feeling connected with it and that of our existence . Thus we may accustom ourselves to the influence of the weather , to storm and rain , to cold and heat ; and even to the endurance of misery , diseases , and misfortunes . An unfortunate occurrence , when visiting us for the first time , may appear extremely hard , and almost threaten to destroy our life ; if the same occurrence should take place the second time , its novel impression would be weakened , and so on , until its effects on us would be trifling . The fable of the hare , that was much frightened at the first sight of the lion , but gradually grew so familiar with him as to accost him , contains therefore a full and important truth . Habit leads to skill , and skill renders the most difficult labor easy . The arm which constantly hammers on the anvil , will no longer feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strokes . The fingers of a performer on the piano become so familiar with every key , that they miss none , though the performer has his eyes constantly directed to the notes and not to the keys . It is , to speak with Leibnitz , as if the monads of the fingers were set free , and no longer subordinate to the monad of the soul ; they act for themselves . Yet the mind of the performer has , nevertheless , to watch them , for as soon as he thinks of something else , the fingers will miss the keys . Skill renders work easy by reducing the effort at first required to a very small amount . Habits may be formed by design or involuntarily . Examples , education , inclination and passion , lead to involuntary customs , while those willed by us are acquired by our own determination , and because we find them useful and /z/ good . When a habit is once formed , we become attached to it , for it becomes natural to us , and will and nature are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periodical , and when the hour of a certain action arrives , an excitement is felt in the muscles and nerves , which can only be allayed by the performance of the action . The power of habit is therefore great ; it frequently keeps us bound as its slaves , and prevents us from receiving what is better , merely because it is strange and new to us . The question may therefore be asked , whether we ought to submit to this power ? Custom , in general , is beneficial to man , provided it is morally correct and good . For , being itself good , and reigning with regularity over the life of man , it will pervade and ennoble it ; it will rescue it from the sphere of mere arbitrariness , where every new desire invites to a new action ; if habits , which are good in themselves , extend over whole nations , they will unite individuals , break the strength of selfishness , lead them to submit to higher authority , and render them social and communicative . If habits are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to exclude them from us , and if we have formed them , our will ought to remove them again . However great may be the power of habit , that of our will is still greater , and to exercise the latter , it would be well , from time to time , to free ourselves from certain indifferent habits , merely to prove to ourselves that we can do a thing if we are resolute and determined . 4 . The power of mind over the body is perceived in the art of representing the emotions and thoughts of the mind by the motions of the body . This power exhibits itself in the control man has over his voice . He can modulate it according to any feeling or ideas contained in words or works . The character of a piece will determine the key of voice , so that every tone and semi-tone will be guided by it . Every emotion of the heart has a tone to express it ; in fear , the voice is trembling - and low ; in joy , clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each kind of poetry has its tone , the lyric , dramatic , and epic ; each is to be declaimed in a different key of voice . The oratory of the bar or pulpit demands each a different tone . So again the arsis and thesis , or raising and sinking of the voice , and /z/ the accent and emphasis are all wholly under the control of the mind ; and he who thinks well , will generally speak well , as he who understands well , will generally read well , for what is felt and understood will enter into the voice . Gesticulation aids very essentially the understanding of words , and frequently where words would not be sufficient fully to express a feeling , a single glance or a single gesture will be sufficient . So Octavio , at the close of Schiller 's Wallenstein , says more by a glance towards heaven , than a whole speech would have communicated . The expressions of certain feelings by gestures are at first involuntary . The hair rises when we are frightened ; the face grows pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it is produced by our will , and from a consciousness of its appropriateness to convey an idea of our feelings and emotions . To know this appropriateness , we must know the reason why certain motions of the body are expressive of certain emotions of the mind : hence this art has its science , and has been treated by several writers . It subjects the whole body to its designs . The walk , and the motion of the hands , the posture and keeping of the whole frame are all used . But especially the face , the head , and the hands . The face has to serve it by its expression ; by the curling of the lips , by the rolling or fixing of the eye , by the drawing in of the nose , by the wrinkling of the forehead , &:c.; The head affirms by nodding , and denies by shaking ; in the former case it moves towards the object , in the latter , away from it . Bending gently down , it may indicate humility , as in prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up towards heaven , it may acknowledge our dependence on a higher Being , and ask for its blessing or its curse . The hand , when clenched , threatens ; when stretched forth and open , it salutes ; when one of its fingers is directed toward something , it points out or commands ; when folded , it indicates that , as the hands are clasped together , and turned inwardly , and for a time give up their accustomed activity , so the mind is collecting itself to direct its devotion to heaven , abstaining from earthly thoughts . The /z/ hand , moving away from the body , gives a sign not to approach ; moving tovsard the body , it invites to come . The hands clasped in marriage , unites two persons into one ; striking hands confirms a bargain . " With the Hebrews , kissing the hand , the knee , or the foot , indicated submission ; with us , kissing the Hps , friendship . "  --  From De Wettes Commentary on the Psalms , page 88 . Other parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express the feelings or thoughts of the mind , as for instance , shrugging the shoulders , and the like . When one part of the body is not sufficient , several are used at one time . Shaking the head may be united with a repellent motion of the hand . The hand will here principally assist the head , especially when signs for intellectual emotions are to be given . The hand covering the eyes , closes up the fountain of observation , and shows that we either meditate on some subject , or are given to spiritual devotion . Laying a finger on the nose invites attention , for as the nose is thus divided , so the judgment is accurately to divide , but the judgment can not be without attention . Rubbing behind the ear has reference to the understanding , for the ear is the most theoretical sense . Putting the hand upon the heart confirms what we have said . It will easily be seen , that the meaning of these signs or gestures , does not depend merely on the motions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched by them . The nearer they are connected with the intellectual activity of the mind , the more noble will be the signification of the gestures ; the more these parts are connected with the system of re-production , the less noble the meaning of the gestures concerning them . In conclusion the whole body may be used by the mind , as bowing to express its respect , kneeling its entire homage , a straight and unbending posture its haughtiness. 5 . The power of the mind over the body leaves its traces and impressions on the face , on the forms of its single parts , as nose , lips , eye , forehead . A well-formed head indicates strength and fullness of understanding ; a head thick and fleshy , stupidity ; a head small and thin , weakness of mind . If the face is too long or too round , it betrays a low disposition . Thus in Shakspeare 's Cleopatra . AlfTHROPOLOOY. 169 Cleopatra , Bear'st thou her face in mind ? Is it long or round 1 Messenger , Round even to faultiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish that are so . The chin and the lower jaw have reference to the sensual disposition of man . The upper Hps , together with the nose and eyebrows , and including the eye and the ear , refer to feehng and humor , and to theoretical knowledge ; the rest of the face up to the hair , to mind in general . " The forehead is the portal of understanding , the seat of thought ; raised eyebrows indicate wrath , eyebrows hanging down , dark and cheerless emotions . The eye is the mirror of the soul . " To judge of the disposition of a person , the proportions of the three regions into which face is divided , must be carefully examined , while dvery organ , as the nose , the eye , the mouth , forms also a whole by itself . The roughness or smoothness of the hair , its color , and that of the eye and of the skin , declare to the physiognomist the temperament of a person . There is certainly much truth in physiognomy , if confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of a science , or if it assumes a judgment over the moral character of man , it becomes insipid . " When Zopyrus perceived in the face of Socrates that he was naturally inclined to voluptuousness , why did he not read in the same face , that he had a power too , which was strong enough to correct this natural tendency ? If this tendency deserved to appear in the head of a Faun , that power was worthy of being honored with the head of a Jupiter . " When Porta in his attempts at physiognomy went so far as to compare the faces of animals with those of man , he made two mistakes . He supposed that animals had really a physiognomy ; but if we call physiognomy the external expression of the internal and invisible mind or disposition , then animals having no mind , can not be said to have a physiognomy . And if they had , their faces are grown over with hair , and thus their expression is concealed from the observing eye . We can not speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same species have the same expression if they have any , and whoever has seen one lion , has seen all , and in describing the face of one , he describes the faces of all . So it must be admitted too , that /z/ children , when born , have no - expression in their faces , as persons when they die , generally lose those they had in their lifetime . Savages have a physiognomy but little variegated , while physiognomy will vary in proportion as nations become cultivated . This shows that the expression of the face depends on the moral character of man , and not the latter on the former . Who can say by what a wrinkle on the forehead is caused , whether by care or dissipation ? Many a one may have had the nose of Shakspeare , without having had his humor , and no doubt the whole face of Shakspeare has had in some age or other its like , while in no climate and in no age has Shakspeare yet been equalled . The same causes do not produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act as such , but controls them . " Green wood , when placed near the lire gets warped , dry wood only brown . " Two men of equal strength and age , may spend the whole night in dissipation , and after all not have the same appearance in the morning . How much more must this be the case in the sphere of liberty , where we by our mere will may bid defiance to every line in our face . In London , Macklin , the actor , of whose face Quin said : " If this man is not a rascal , God does not write a legible hand , " received in the year 1775 pubHc praise on account of his honesty and nobleness . One and the same organ  --  and this may be said with regard to phrenology no less than with regard to physiognomy  --  may serve two very different purposes . The nose for instance is the organ of smell and for conducting off the mucus ; the tongue of taste and of language . 6 . The power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation of the 5/jwZ/ , which must bear witness of the life of the mind . The observation of this fact has hkewise given rise to the idea of forming a science called Phrenology . The manner of reasoning is this ;  --  Every activity of the mind seems to demand a particular organ . It IS not the eye that sees , nor the ear that hears , but mind sees and hears by the eye and ear . But the mind could not see without the eye , nor hear without the ear . The eye is the organ of sight , as is the ear that of hearing . It is reasonable to expect that this should be so with every /z/ Other activity of the mind . Again , it is not the organ , but the nerves in it , that are active , and to knovsr the amount of activity , of which the organ is susceptible , we must observe the nerves embodied in it . Yet they can not be laid bare during the life of man , and all we can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevations or indentations of the skull , and their proportions to each other . For all the nerves , in whatever direction they may run over the body , will finally concentrate in the brain , and as the skull surrounds it , and conceals it from our sight , the skull only , its formation , its depressions or elevations , are left for our examination . It has been fashionable of late , either to decry phrenology or to raise it above all other sciences . We , on our part , have to acknowledge that talents and capacities will , to a certain degree , be indicated by the formation of the skull . Character , on the other hand , is the effect of will , and not of the nervous muscles . Nor can phrenology much aid our science , for to understand any elevation on the skull , we must know the psychological activity symbolically indicated by it . The want of a good psychology in Gall and Spurzheim misled them , and their errors are exposed in a masterly manner with all due acknowledment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geist des Menschen , from page 255 to 291 . Carus , in the second part of his Psychology , and Hegel in his Phenomenology have likewise spoken against the extravagancies of phrenology . The internal and invisible mind , expressing itself physiognomically and on the skull of man , will be the subject of our investigations hereafter . " We shall view it not as a compound of many mental activities that exist by the side of each other in one common receptacle , and that are externally united , we can not say Jww ? but as a whole of many branches , all of which proceed from one identical life , and are held together by it . /z/ In every science we may discover one point which is the centre of the whole , and which , well understood , will shed light upon every portion of its whole extent . In the system of divinity , it is the idea of revelation ; in moral philosophy , it is that of law in connection with that of conscience ; and in mental philosophy it is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either within ourselves or in nature . It is the light , by which alone we can see in the sphere of knowledge ; before it is fully developed in the child , all his ideas must be confused , and nothing can be known in relation to other things , nothing be classified or arranged , but every object will appear to him without distinction in itself , and without a generic difference from that which is not itself . When , in an adult , self- consciousness disappears for a moment , all consciousness of the things around us and of our personal qualities sinks into transient oblivion , and we no longer notice what is going on around us , though we continue to hear and to feel . Self- consciousness then , is the root of all our knowledge : it must accompany our mental activities , and without it it would be in vain to investigate the nature of the soul . For this reason it ought to be examined , before we approach the activity and nature of the /z/ soul , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention . What then are we to understand by self-consciousness ? It is not a thing that is ready wrought in us , and the qualities of which , like those of minerals , chemical substances , one has only to analyze in order to know ; hut it is an activity that constantly produces itself . The activities of mind , however , are manifold , and it will here be necessary and instructive to distinguish it from them . The first of all the activities of the mind is feeling- It is the most subjective , the most internal and inexpressible in man . Yet difficult as it may be , to convey a clear idea of it , we can not pass it over in silence . " Feelings in general , is passion colled forth hy its own activity . This definition demands some explanation . The passion spoken of here , is one conditioned by its own activity . Hence it follows as a first rule , that that which can not affect itself can not feel . The ball on the billiard table , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is active , but not of its own accord . Touching another ball , it communicates its motion to it , and is put at rest by the resistance it meets with , and consequently is affected ; but this affection or passion is not produced by its activity , but by the resistance of another ball . Every metal expands by heat , and contracts by cold ; but this activity in the metal is elicited by an activity without ; the metal is affected , but not by itself . Hence though warmed by the heat , it neither feels warmth nor
