txt IN a previous number of the New Englander , while considering Gov . Hammond 's defense of southern slavery , we partly promised to discuss , at some future time , the question on which he discoursed , in his letters , with presumptuous and ignorant confidence , viz.-whether the Bible sanctions slavery . This promise we may now fulfill , not so much by any discussion of our own , as by giving some account of the able work of Rev. Albert Barnes , which we have referred to at the head of this article . Mr. Barnes has high qualifications for instituting " an inquiry into the Scriptural views of slavery . " He has , for many years , been employed in Biblical studies , and with distinguished success ; as his numerous and widely circulated commentaries on many portions of the Scriptures abundantly prove . He brings to the elucidation of his subject a great variety and copiousness and richness of illustration . And he has a character for candor and Christian liberality and courtesy , which none can impeach . When , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press an inquiry into the Scriptural views of slavery , we expected a book of the highest merit . Our expectations have not been disappointed . Mr. Barnes 's work is the most minute and thorough examination of the Scriptures respecting this subject , that , so far as we know , has been made . And , while , on the one hand , he does not go to the extreme of denying that some kinds of involuntary servitude did exist in the church , both of the Old Testament and of the New , he on the other hand , brings decisive and overwhelming proof that American slavery can find in the Scriptures no sanction , no warrant , no apology . But we will commend the book more effectually , than we can by any general remarks . We will give a condensed account of its main positions and arguments ; believing that thus we shall render a service which every real opponent of slavery will appreciate . And this we shall do , in Mr. B. 's language or our own , as best suits our purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Scriptural views of Slavery , by Albert Barnes . Philadelphia , Perkins &amp; Purves , 1*46. // dicates the right of every one belonging to the brotherhood of man , and enforces the duty of every one who can have influence , to discuss the subject of slavery as it exists in our land . The main question , he declares , is not about the abuse of slavery . It might be a question , whether there is any abuse of it possible ; that is , any degree of oppression and wrong , which the principles of the system do not sanction . What law of the south can be referred to which can be shown to be an abuse of the system , in the sense that the principles of the system do not lead to it , or that it is not necessary to sustain the system ? But the question is about the thing as it is fairly developed in our countrywhether this is in accordance with the recorded will of God . He , then , in his first chapter , gives reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made to the Bible ; which reasons are these . The Bible is the acknowledged standard of morals and religion . The Bible has legislated respecting slavery , and we should therefore ascertain its decisions . The Bible alone can settle the question whether slavery is right or wrong . Great moral reforms occur only under the influence of religious principle . It is to the Bible , that the advocates of slavery make their appeal , in its defense , as he proves by quotations of the resolutions and arguments of individuals and ecclesiastical bodies . As a right decision respecting the moral character of slavcry depends materially on the proper definition of slavery , our author proceeds , in his second chapter , to inquire what is American Slavery-what distinguishes it from all other relations of life . And here , in view of many definitions of slavery , which are framed to shield the conscience of the practical advocate of slavery , and which make it only an obligation to render service either for life or for a num her of years , he seems to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as what it is ; and accordingly he distinguishes it from many relations with which it is often confounded by men , the result of whose writings is ( we may say it without impeaching their intention , ) to throw dust in the eyes of inquirers . He distinguishes it ( I ) from the condition of an apprentice , ( 2 ) from the condition of a minor , ( 3 ) from the condition of the subject of a despotic government . It is not ( 4 ) a mere relation in which legislative bodies alone are concerned . It is not ( 5 ) a thing which pertains wholly to a legislature to regulate , and with which individuals , or associations expressly organized for that purpose , have no right to interfere , or in reference to which they have no right to express an opinion . Men are made slaves , not by legislative acts , f ) ut by individual rapacity and wrong . The slave is the property of an individual , and his relations are to him . It is not ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia , or " villeins " under the feudal system . Nor ( 7 ) is it the relation of a child to his parent , or of a wife to her husband . It is not " the kind of property which a man has in his wife and child " - in which relations there is no right of property , inconsistent with the human rights of the child or the wife . All these conditions and relations have , perhaps , something incommon with , but yet are widely and clearly distinguished from , slavery , as it exists in the United States . But the essential element of slavery is , a human being held as property - property subject substantially to the self-same laws which regulate property of other kinds-property in the sense in which the holder regards any thing else as his property - property , to be treated indeed in some respects according to its nature , as is a horse or a dog , yet absolutely and completely property . This claim of property in the slave // always involves the following things : ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slave . ( 2 . ) It is property claimed in that which naturally belongs to him , but which he is not at liberty to resume . ( 3 . ) It is prop . erty in all that pertains to the slave , in his time , in his service , in his bodily strength and power of labor , in his talent and skill . ( 4 . ) It is property in his services , without equivalent or compensation . ( 5 . ) It involves the power to sell the slave , as his master pleases . That this is a correct definition of slavery as it exists in this country , our author proves by a reference to the statutes of the slave.holding states . The cardinal principle of these statutes is , that the slave is not to be ranked among moral beings , but among things . Their substance is fully andbriefly expressed in the law of South Carolina , which says , that " slaves shall be claimed , held , taken , reputed , and adjudged , in law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners and possessors , and their executors , administrators and assigns , ro ALL INTENTS , coNSTRUcTIONS AND PURPOSES WHATSOEVER . " Having thus defined slavery , Mr. B. states the true question substantially thus : Whether God designed to command and perpetuate slavery ; whether in his word he has given it his sanction , or made arrangements for its maintenance ; whether it is accordant with the spirit of his religion , and the disposition that religion enjoins and cultivates ; whether the influence of that religion justly taught and truly exemplified , tends to perpetuate it , as it does the relations of husband and wife and of parent and child . Or does God regard slavery as undesirable and evil in its nature and tendencies , and intend to have it removed from the world ; and would the fair application of the principles of his religion remove it as an evil thing . Having thus stated the real ques tion at issue , Mr. B. observes , " If it shallappear , in the course of this discussion , that slavery is an institution which God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islation has tended from the beginning to mitigate its evils ; that he has by his providential dealings frowned upon it ; that he has asserted great principles in his word , which can not be carried out without destroying the system ; that he has enjoined on man , in the various relations of life , certain duties , of which slavery prevents the performance ; that slavery inevitably engenders certain bad passions which are wholly contrary to religion ; and that it is the tendency and design of the Christian religion , when fizirly applied , to abolish the system , it will be apparent , that slavery is a moral wrong . " Mr. Barnes judges that these facts if proved , are decisive of the moral character of slavery , and infallibly evince the truth of the general proposition that slavery is sinful . And so do we judge . As great reliance is placed , by those who deny the sinfulness of slavery , on the example of the patriarchs , " those good old slaveholders , " as the Harmony Presbytery of South Carolina lovingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument . Lie argues very justly , that , even supposing the servitude under the patriarchs was essentially the same as slavery now , the facts that the patriarchs practised it , and that God did not prohibit it , and recorded its existence without express disapprobation , ( for it is not pretended that he commanded or commended it , ) do not prove that it is not sinful . For they practised , and thus God treated , the now acknowledged sins of polygamy and concubinage. - Justly , we say . For , as one of the delegates from Connecticut to one of the late Presbyterian Assemblies in substance remarked , in that body , " Abraham and Jacob , if they were // now living in Connecticut , and should there do as they did in Palestine , would be put into the Penitentiary . How , then , can their example vindicate slavery or slaveholders in this country ? " Mr. B. proves , moreover , that this servitude , such as it was , was not oti ginated by the patriarchs , and way ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and can not be proved to have had the essential characteristics of any real slavery . He enters into a somewhat minute investigation of the meaning of the Hebrew and Greek words , which in the Scriptures express servitude , and comes to the conclusion , that the one Hebrew word which is used for this purpose , and all the Greek words used for this purpose , except one , ( which is used only in one instance , 1 Tim . i , 10 , and there , in composition , to sign ify men-stealers , ) like our English word servant , express obligation to service , or servitude in its most general form , and Ihough they may , do not necessarily or of course , signify slavery ; and , therefore , no argument for the existence of slavery can be founded on the mere use of the words . The meaning of these words is to be ascertained from the facts in the case , as they otherwise appear , and not the nature of the facts from the use of the words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " bought with money , " which , being applied to Abraham 's servants , is used by the advocates of slavery to justify riot only the purchase but the sale of men now , and comes to the conclusion that it proves nothing as to the tenure by which Abraham 's servants were held . The purchase may have amounted to every thing desirable in emancipation , and from any thing implied in the word , their subsequent service in the family of Abraham may have been entirely voluntary . And as to the sale of human beings , he adds , that there is not the slightest evidence that either Abraham , Isaac or Jacob ever sold a servant , or offered one for sale , or regarded them as liable to be sold . As to the facts by which we must decide the meaning of the word , they are such , in Mr. B 's opinion , as evince servitude in Abraham 's time to be a very different thing from slavery in the United States ; so that the former , even if justified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Almost the only transaction which is mentioned in regard to the servants of Abraham , is one which shows the essential difference between their relation to him and the relation of American slaves to their masters , viz , his arming his trained servants born in his own house , three hundred and eighteen men , and pursuing the enemies who had carried away Lot unto Dan , &amp;c . Compare this with the condition of things in the Southern States , where it is considered essential to the security and life of the master , that slaves shall never be entrusted with arms ; where the law appoints severe penalties to any slave who carries or keeps any weapon whatsoever , or goes away " from the tenement of his master or the per . son with whom he lives without a pass , or something to show that he is proceeding by authority from his master. , employer or overseer , - in a word , with the exceedingly jealous and severe precautions against the escape of slaves , their possession of weapons , or their learning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very plain , not only from the fact which Mr. B. mentions , but also from other facts on the face of the Scriptural narrative which evince Abraham 's utter powerlessness to retain or recover his servants contrary to their will , that their servitude was entirely voluntary , and therefore distinct from , and opposite to , slavery . Pursuing the order of time , Mr. // B. next considers slavery in Egypt . The similarity between this and American slavery , which he states in several particulars , the most essential being the tenure by which the Israelites were held and the nature of the claim set up over them , their unrequited and severe labor and the oppressive measures adopted to secure them in bondage and to guard against the dangers resuIting from their bondage-this similarity between the bondage of Egypt and of the United States , he considers sufficient to make it safe and proper to argue from one to the other . Accordingly , he argues that it would have been as just for the Egyptians to retain the Hebrews in bondage , as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declarations in regard to Egyptian bondage , and all his expressions of disapprobation of what occurred in Egypt , are applicable to bondage in this country ; that the calamities brought upon the Egyptians for holding the Israelites in bondage , and for the measures taken by them to perpetuate that bonda* , e , were an expression of the views which God entertained of that system , and now entertains of our similar system ; that the deliverance of the Hebrews from Egyptian bondage , with his other acts and expressions , testifies that it is God 's will that slaves should be allowed to go free ; and if they are not , God will , sooner or later , by dire judgments , compel their oppressors to let them go free ; and moreover , if we may draw an inference from this case in regard to the manner in which God would have them restored to freedom , it would be in favor of immediate emancipation . He did not wait for a gradual deliverance ; nor did he recommend a preparation for freedom ; nor did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difficulties attending emancipation . He demanded of the oppressors that his people should be allowed to go free , at once . This whole chapter is impressive and powerful . We commend it to the attention of all advocates , theoretical or practical , either of slavery or of its continuance . The argument from the Mosaic institutions is especially relied on by the advocates of slavery . Dr. Fuller declares that God thereby sanctions slavery . rPl ) e Princeton Repertory says , that " the Mosaic institutions recognize the lawfulness of slavery , " and that , therefore , " it is in vain to contend that slavery is a sin , and yet profess reverence for the Scriptures . " Mr. Barnes , therefore , bestows special attention on this argument . He thinks it undeniable that Moses did admit a system of servitude into his institutions . Yet he did not originate it . He found it universally existing , and tolerated its continuance , and greatly modified its character . It could commence , under his laws , in the case of a foreigner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebrew , only in these three modes , ( 1 ) a Hebrew might sell himself to serve another on account of poverty ; ( 2 ) a Hebrew might be sold to his brethren , if he had been detected in theft and had no means of making restitution ; and ( 3 ) the child of a wife given to a Hebrew servant by his master , might be retained in servi tude for a time , i. e. to the year of Jubilee . The real question involved in the argument from the Mosaic institutions respecting slavery , is-Was Moses ( or rather God , the real author of the Mosaic institutions ) friendly to slavery , or was he not ? Or , if he was friendly to slavery , as it existed under the Mosaic institutions , is it fair to infer that he is friendly to it , as it exists in the United States ? Mr. B. declares , substantially , that the advocates of slavery , in order to make their argument valid , must prove ( I ) that the Lawgiver was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ( 2 ) that servitude under the Mosaic laws and American slavery are so similar , that the proof of the rightfulness of the former , proves the rightfulness of the latter ; and ( 3 ) that what was tolerated at one period of the world is always to be tolerated ; that what was tolerated under the Hebrew system of legislation is proper under the gospel ; that what is allowed at one period of earth 's history is right at all times , and in all places , and under all degrees of light and knowledge . The last of these three essential constituents of any valid pro-slavery argument from the Mosaic laws , Mr. B. only announces . And that is sufficient . No pro-slavery advocate has ever attempted , so far as we know , to substantiate it . It can not he done . Its bare statement is its refutation . The two first essential constituents of this pro-slavery argument , Mr. B. discusses , by showing the nature of servitude , and of the laws respecting it , under the Mosaic system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more proves that it was sinless , than his toleration and regulation of the practices , now universally acknowledged sinful , of polygamy and concubinage , proves them sinless . If it can be made to appear , ( 1 ) that slavery existed in the nations around in the most harsh and oppressive forms ; ( 2 ) that the condition of a slave was greatly ameliorated if he was purchased hy a Hebrew , so that it was an object for slaves in surrounding countries to place themselves voluntarily under Hebrew masters ; ( 3 ) that by such an arrangement they might become incorporated into the Hebrew commonwealth , and be made partakers of the only true religion ; ( 4 ) that Palestine was an asylum for the oppressed of all lands , defending and protecting from the rigors of heathen slavery , by the whole power of the Hebrew commonwealth , every fugitive slave who crossed its borders , ( a Canada in the midst of slaveholding states ) ; and ( 5 ) that an arrangement was made by which perpetual slavery would be impracticable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made to appear , then it is proved that , though Moses temporarily tolerated the system , he regarded it as evil , and intended its amelioration and removal . The above hypothetical positions are , in Mr. B 's view , and in our own , made positive , and fully sustained by various provisions in the Mosaic laws respecting servitude , which he classifies , substantially , as follows 1 . There stands in the fore front of the whole MQsaic system , among the precepts regarded as elementary , uttered in most impressive circumstances just after the tragedies of Israel 's emancipation from Egyptian bondage , a solemn prohibition , on pain of death , of that which enters into the essential nature of slavery , and on which the whole system is every where based . " lie that stealeth a man , and selleth him , or if he be found in his hand , he shall surely be put to death . " The crime here referred to is stated in a three fold form-stealing , selling and holding a man . All these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the penalty was the same-death . The influence of this law to condemn , weaken and ultimately abolish the whole system , as this influence is set forth by our author , we have not room to express . 2 . Moses secured by law , all slaves from hard and oppressive usage . ( Ex. xxi , 20 , 21 , 26,27 . Lev . xix , 34 . Ex. xxii , 21 ; xxiii , 9 . Deut. x , 17 , 19 ; i , 16 ; xxvii , 19. ) 3 . Moses modified the system of slavery , by securing to the servant , by law , an important portion of time , for religious and moral improvement . ( a ) Every seventh year , Lev . xxv , 4-.6. ( b ) Every // seventh day , Ex. xx , 10. ( c ) The servant had the privilege of attending on the three great national annual festivals , which , including journeys , &amp;c. , would occupy nine weeks annually . ( d ) He was to be a guest at all family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would thus have for himself , can not be ascertained with exactness , but it has been estimated at about twenty three years out of fifty , or nearly one half of his time . To this it may be added , that the Hebrew servant might acquire and possess considerable property ; and there are some intimations that the servant who was bought , was to have some compensation for his labor . And when , at the end of the seventh year , he was set free , his master was bound to give him a liberal provision for his comfort . Deut. xv , 12-15. 4 . Servants were entitled , by law , to important religious privileges . ( a ) They were , as members of a family , admitted into covenant with God , and received the seal of that covenant . ( b ) They were guests at all the national and family festivals , and not dishonorably distinguished there from others by being assigned to a separate religious service , or to separate seats . ( c ) They were to be statedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ xxxi , 10 ; xv , 1 , seq . ( d ) They might become proselytes , and thus be admitted to the full privileges of religion . These religious privileges they received , not from the occasional and voluntary kindness of the masters , but by law . They were entitled to them hy the unchangeable constitution of the land . 5 . A slave could never be sold . A man , in certain circumstances , might be bought by a Hebrew ; but he could never be sold . Nor is there any arrangement in the Mosaic laws , by which servants could be taken in payment of their master 's debts ; by which they were to be given as pledges ; by which they were consigned to the keeping of others ; or by which they were to be given away as presents . In all these respects there was a marked difference , and there was doubtless intended to be , between the estimate affixed to servants and to property . Thus was entirely prevented , in the Hebrew commonwealth , that dreadful iniquity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation of families , and the violent sundering of conjugal and filial ties . 6 . The servant , ifa Hebrew , could be redeemed . The privilege of redemption was not dependent on the will of the master . It was secured to him by law . Lev . xxv , 48 , 49. 7 . The Mosaic law solemnly prohibited the deliverance of a runaway slave to his master . On this point the law was absolute . Deut. xxiii , 15 , 16 . Mr. B. is willing to admit , that this command probably relates only to the slaves which escaped to the country of the Hebrews from the surrounding nations , and that , in form , it did not contemplate the runaway slaves of the Hebrews in their own land . Still its spirit embraces all fugitive slaves , and it contains , as he thinks , important principles which could not but materially modify the system , involving the following results . ( I. ) No law could be enacted in the Hebrew commonwealth , by which a r*unaway slave could be restored to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on any pretence , deliver up a runaway slave . ( 3 . ) Palestine would thus become an asylum of freedom , inviting the escape of slaves from their masters . ( 4 . ) This law would do much to destroy the system altogether , virtually placing it under condemnation . For , if Moses had supposed that the master had a right to the slave , he would never have introduced so extraordinary a provision // into his code . lie would never have publicly invited the slave to escape , and have thrown around the runaway the protecting shield of his laws . He never would have proclaimed , in the face of all nations , that the moment a slave in his flight touched the soil of Palestine , he should be a freeman . Respecting the conflict of the pro . vision in our Constitution and laws , for the delivery of a fugitive slave , with this law of God , Mr. B. speaks very plainly and boldly . Concerning that provision , these are his words : " It is probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and open conflict with any law of the Bible , or where a conscientious man , holding office , would have any doubt about his duty in obeying the Constitution of his country . Here , however , the provision is at direct variance with the law of God . . . . The law of God ordains that every man who can secure his freedom by escape from bondage , has a right to it , and should be protected in that right ; the Constitution and laws of the United States suppose that he has no such right , and that all the authority of the civil arm is to be employed in riveting on him again the fetters of bondage . It would be impossible to conceive of laws more directly repugnant to each other , than in this case , are the law of God and the law of this Christian land . " 8 . Another fundamental principle of the Mosaic code was , that , at certain periods , there was to be a total emancipation of all the slaves in the land . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Hebrew slaves were to be released at the close of the sixth year ; the other , that all the slaves in the land were to be set at liberty in the year of Jubilee , occurring every fifty years . This construction of the positive law in Lev* xxv , 10 : " And ye shall shall hallow the fiftieth year , and proclaim liberty throughout all the land UNTO ALL THE INHABITANTS THEREOF , " being disputed , Mr. B. enters into an extended and able examination of the subject . Through this , we have not space to follow him . We can only say that it appears to us entirely decisive . If any of our readers have doubts about the matter , we refer them to the work itself . The influence of this fundamental law to counteract and ultimately destroy slavery , is considered by Mr. B. ; but it is too obvious to need a word from us . Mr. B. thus proves conclusively , that servitude , under the Mosaic system was , in no case , except by choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time be redeemed , either by himself , or by his friends , and , at any rate , could go out , free , and supplied liberally with gifts , at the end of the sixth year . Andevery fiftyyears , all , including those of foreign descent , were to be liberated . The question whether this servitude was involuntary , Mr. B. does not distinctly discuss , though it is in various ways apparent that he thinks it was involuntary , in some degree . And this , on the whole , is our opinion . Yet , it is plain , that under that system , servitude , though involuntary in form , was virtually and in fact , nearly voluntary . That is , servants were retained , not mainly by virtue of law and by force , but chiefly by their own choice . This is evident to any candid reader of the Mosaic laws and history . For , there is the law , " Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that place which he shall choose , in one of thy gales where it liketh him best ; thou shalt not oppress him . " Deut. xxiii , 15 , 16 . This law is unlimited in language , and is believed , by some able writers , to be unlimited in its meaning , applying to all slaves , and thus of // itself rendering their servitude entirely voluntary . But if it relates , in form , only to the slaves who escaped to Palestine from surrounding countries , as Mr. B. thinks is probable , ( and with this opinion we agree ) yet , virtually , influentially , and powerfully , it relates to all slaves , and frowned upon the delivery of any who should escape . Then there is not a single provision , in the whole system , for the delivery of a fugitive ; nor any record , in the whole history , of a single case of such delivery ; nor any thing in all the laws and history , that looks as though such delivery was intended . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had abundant opportunities for successful escape . Three times every year , all the males over twelve years , were required to attend the national feasts at Jerusalem . This rule would cause their absence from home about three weeks , three times in each year . There was apparently no provision to prevent the men-servants from escaping , during these jou rnies . They could have escaped , if they wished , without any difficulty ; as could , also , the female servants who were left at home with only the Hebrew women and boys under twelve . These facts decisively evince that servitude under the Mosaic laws , though involuntary in form , was voluntary virtually and in fact . Mr. B. then makes an extended comparison between servitude under Moses , as thus exhibited by his laws respecting it , and American slavery , as that is exhibited by the laws which establish and confirm it , which are necessary to the system , and a fair expression of its essential nature . Into this examination we have no room to follow him . Nor is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages , if not more fully from other sources , the na*ture of the Ameri6an system o* slavery , and *tan make the comparison for themselve* . We think they will agree with us , that Mr. B. has fully established these two positions . ( 1 ) That the Mosaic laws represent God as decidedly unfriendly to servitude , even as it existed among the Hebrews , in its nature mild and temporary , and though not in form yet in fact nearly or quite voluntary . And ( 2 ) that even if these laws should be decided to represent God as not unfriendly to that system , that fact would not begin to prove that lie is not unfriendly to the American system , which has hardly a feature in common with it , which is indeed distinguished from it by almost all those elements which constitute the bitterest and most infamous oppression . We think they will agree with Mr. B. in this language , which we most heartily adopt . " Of all the abuses ever applied to the Scriptures , the most intolerable and monstrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery . Sad is it , that the mild and benignant enactments of the Hebrew legislator should ever be appealed to , to sanction the wrongs and outrages of the poor African in this land of freedom ; ' sad that the ministers of religion should ever prostitute their high office to give countenance to such a system , by maintaining , or even conceding for a moment , that the Mosaic laws sanction the oppressions and wrongs existing in the United States . " Mr. B. next raises the important question , what was the working of the Mosaic system concerning savery , and , in discussing this question , considers the period from the death of Moses to the coming of the Messiah . And here he finds that though the peol ) le , in their wickedness , occasionally violated , in this respect as in others , the letter and spirit of the Mosaic laws , and thus retarded and interrupted their benign operation , yet servitude was mild in form , and limited in extent , and at length entirely removed . He shows ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though there were obvious and powerful temptations to such treatment of them in their condition as a race abandoned and doomed by God to destruction . ( That most stolid of all stolid arguments , that , because Noah uttered a malediction on Canaan , which naturally might have led the Israelites , unless prevented by the letter and spirit of the Mosaic system , to enslave his descendants the Canaanites , therefore Ham , the father of Canaan , may be justly accounted accursed , and the Africans , his descendants by a line not through but entirely distinct from Canaan , may be rightly enslaved-Mr . B. appropriately rebukes . ) No permission was given to hold these victims of successful war as slaves ; nor is there any evidence that they were ever held , or sold , or offered for sale , as slaves . ( 2 . ) There was no foreign traffic in slaves . ( 3 . ) The prophets animadverted upon th' injustice of slavery , and denounced it as entirely inconsistent with the Mosaic institutions . ( 4 . ) Servitude altogethcr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence at all in that land , in the time of the later prophets , of the Maccabees , or when the Savior appeared . The last Chapter of his book Mr. B. devotes to the relation of Christianity to slavery  --  to the teachings and influence of the New Testament respecting it . With respect to the teaching of Christ , Mr. B. affirms , that there is no evidence that he ever came in contact with slavery . It had ceased in Judea , as was seen in a previous chapter , before his coming . The only passage that can be supposed to afford any evidence of such a fact , Mat. viii , 5 , scq. - that concerning the Roman centurion and his sick servant - Mr . B. examines , and concludes that there is not the slightestproaf that this servant , was a slave . Of course , nothing can be inferred from the silence of the Savior on this subject ; since it was not his method to go out VOL . IV . of his way , specifically to denounce sins , however great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never uttered a word which can be construed in favor of slavery . And he laid down principles which are entirely inconsistent with slavery , and tend to its rapid abolition ; especially the doctrine concerning the common nature of men , and their common relations to God and each other . That they are all moral and responsible beings , descended from the same parent , on a level before God , redeemed by the same blood , equally heirs of life , and , if Christians , to be recognized as brethren , by all who bear the Christian name ; and also the great principle denominated the golden rule , under the fair operation of which , none could make a man a slave , or exact from him labor without wages , and few or none would continue to hold others in slavery . As to the manner in which the apostles treated the subject of slavery , Mr. B. lays down the following positions : ( 1 . ) They found it existing , and existing in accordance with the severe and oppressive slave laws and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the limits of Judea. ( 2 . ) They did not openly denounce slavery as an evil , or require that those who were held in bondage should be at once emancipated ; and they did admit slaveholders to the Christian church , and did not subject them to immediate discipline for holding ' slaves . From this , however , it does not of course follow , that , in this age of the world , slavery should be treated in the same manner , or that the admission of slavehojders tocommunion should be contemplated as a permanent arrangement , either by churches or missionary Boards . The only fair inference from this conduct of the apostles , is , that slavery , in all conceivable circumstances , is not to be regarded as *i sin . What Mr. B. means by this inference , may * // easily be defined more exactly than he seems to us to define it . He does not mean that , in some circumstances , a people may set up and maintain such a system of servitude as exists in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not mean that , in some circumstances , human beings may be reduced to the condition of mere chattels , and be regarded and treated accordingly , and nobody be to blame for it . As we understand him , he means only that the ownership of slaves , the standing and acting in the relation of a master , may be sometimes not a sin on the part of the owner or master  --  or at the most , not such a sin as is inconsistent with a Christian profession , and * standing in the church . It is to be admitted , moreover , Mr. B. adds , that the apostles gave instructions to those who sustained the relation of master and slave , respecting their duties while in that relation . He denies , however , the position , which the advocates of the lawfulness of slavery affirm , " that the apostles legislated for slavery , as they did for the relations of husband and wife and parents and children . " They did not legislate for slavery , or for its existence , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in any sense , legislate for slavery , as they did for the conjugal and filial relations . For ( a ) they uniformly represent servitude as a hard and undesirable condition . 1 Cor. vii , 21 : 1 Pet . ii , 18-23. ( b ) They enjoin on their slaves submission to their condition , as a hard one in which they are constantly liable to suffer wrong , to " endure grief , " " suffering wrongfully . " 1 Pet . ii , 18 , 19 : 1 Cor. vii , 21. ( c ) The principal virtue which the apostles enjoin on slaves to cultivate , is patience under wrong . ( d ) They represented it as desirable to escape from that relation , if it could be done , 1 Cor. vii , 21 . But where have they given such representations as these , respecting the relations of husband and wife , parent and child ? To the argument of the advocates of slavery , that this conduct of the the apostles respecting slavery is dishonest and jesuitical , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a moral evil , Mr. B. replies , substantially thus-that the condition of things in the time of the apostles  --  the state of the public conscience , and the darkness of the public mind on this subject , the interweaving of slavery with social institutions , aj*d with the institutions of an arbitrary government on which they and their hearers , unlike American ministers and people , had no influence-the condition of things being such as to render it unwise specifically and directly to 4enounce slavery , all that could be required of them as honest enemies of slavery would be ( 1 ) not to pursue such a course as would defeat the very end in view , while it was not yet admitted , by those among whom slavery prevailed , that it was a moral evil ; ( 2 ) never to say or do anything , which , by any fair construction , could express approbation of the system ; ( 3 ) to lay down such fundamental principles of morality , as would , when fairly applied , declare the evil nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then discusses distinctly the question , whether the general conduct of the Apostles , before stated , is consistent with the belief that they approved of slavery . In the examination of this question , he affirms the following positions . 1 . There are no express statements-not one-affirming the justice or propriety of slavery , or giving permission to hold men in bondage ; - no such statements as those men are bound to produce , who claim that an institution apparently so much against human rights and against the principles of the New Testament , is sanctioned by the Apostles . // 2 . No argument for the affirmative , can be derived from the precepts of the Apostles to the masters . Here is the great reliance of pro-slavery advocates . The only precepts of this nature are two , and only two . Eph. vi , 9 , and Col. iv , 1 . But these passages neither express nor imply any sanction of slavery , any right of the master to hold the servant in bondage . In the words of Dr. Wayland , " If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as these , the New Testament would be the greatest curse ever inflicted on man . " Remember ( a ) the undeniable fact , that the right of the master to the slave is never recognized at all in the New Teetament , either expressly or by fair implication . ( b ) The doctrine expressly stated , that all men are by nature , by their common creation , equal in regard to their rights . Acts xviii , 26. ( c ) The doctrine that men are equal in rights , brethren , by a closer tie-that of a common redemption . Look at the two precepts in the light of this fact , and of these doctrines ; and it is at once seen , that they are fitted to lead a Christian man to emancipate his slaves , if it is in his power to emancipatethem . And , finally , these very precepts virtually direct masters to emancipate . For they give directions which can not be obeyed , and state a truth which can not properly be regarded , by masters , without emancipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for there is no respect of persons with God , " ( Eph. vi , 9 , ) would not be long the owner of a slave . More decisive , still , is the direction , ( Col. iv , 1 , ) " Masters , render unto your servants that which is just and equal . " Obedience to this would be ( a ) to give servants a just compensation for labor , which strikes out an elementary principle of slaveryviz , that labor must be unrequitedand would destroy the system at once ; and ( b ) it would be to restore them to freedom , to which they are , by God , entitled . Nothing short of this would be just and equal . The case of Onesimus is then considered , on which many advocates of slavery have placed great reliance ; and Mr. B. here maintains the positions affirmed in his published commentary on the Epistle to Philemon . ( 1 ) There is no evidence that Onesimus was a slave ; ( 2 ) none that Paul used force , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ) none ( even supposing that he was a slave ) that Paul meant that he should return as a slave ; but ( 4 ) there is evidence , on the contrary , that he did not mean that Onesimus should be regarded and treated as a slave , ( ver . 16 ) ; and ( 5 ) the principles laid down in this epistle would lead to the universal abolition of slavery . 3 . No argument for the aflirmative can be derived from the injunctions of the Apostles to the slaves . The passages relied on , are : 1 Cor. vii , 20-24 . Eph. vi , 5-8 . Col - iii , 22-25. 1 Tim . vi , 1-5 . Titus ii , 9 , 10. 1 Pet . ii , 18-20 . In reference to these , our author affirms and maintains the following positions . ( 1 . ) The main duties which they enjoin are meekness , fidelity , kindness , truth and honesty-duties obligatory toward all men , and of course toward masters . ( 2 . ) If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abstract , to which the Apostles had no reference , but slavery as it then existed , the abominable Roman system . ( 3 . ) If they prove that slavery was right , then the similar injunctions to Christians to be submissive to civil rulers , will prove that all the abominations of Nero 's government were right , and that Christians were to submit to them as being right . ( 4 . ) In these precepts the right of the master is never conceded or even referred to . ( 5 . ) The Apostles , as has been before said , rep. resented the condition of slavery as // hard , and directed Christian slaves to obtain release if they could , and if they could not , to console themselves with the reflection , that they were emancipated from the greater evil-sin , and therefore should bear with patience the lesser and temporary evil-servitude. 4 . The principles laid down by the Savior and his apostles , are such as are opposed to slavery ; and , if carried out , would secure its universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic , Mr. B. adds the following remarks , with suitable illustrations . ( 1 . ) The Savior and his apostles inculcated such views of man , and such truths concerning his nature and destiny , his relations and obligations both to man and to his maker-as amount to a prohibition of slavery , and , if acted upon , would abolish it . ( *2 . ) The gospel regards every human being as invested with such rights as are inconsistent with his being held as a slave , rights which always have been violated where slavery exists , and the violation of which can not be effectually guarded against , since the power to violate them enters into every proper conception of slavery ; ( a ) the rights involved in the marriage relation , entirely prostrated , under the power of the master , to prevent or annul that relation at pleasure , and also under the power to buy and sell ; ( b ) the natural right which a father has over his children ; ( c ) the natural right of every human being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ( d ) the right of property  --  the right a man has to the avails of his own labor . James v , 4 . Lev . xix , 13 . Jer. xxii , 13 . " Wo unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness and his chambers by wrong ; that useth his neighbor 's service without wages , and giveth him not for his work . " ( 3 . ) The gospel , and the Bible generally , prohibits , in the most positive manner , many things , which are always found in slavery , and are inseparable from it . ( a ) Stealing a man is frrbidden ; and the precepts on that subject are necessarily violated by slavery . This stealing a man  --  the conversion of a freeman into a slave-somehow occurs essentially , in the case of every one who ever becomes a slave . God made him free , and gave him the right to be free . Legalizing the robbery does not make it cease to be a violation of the law of God . ( b @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppression which always enters into the idea of slavery . ( c ) Depriving one of his wages is forbidden . There is not on earth any other condition of things to which tWe passage in James v , 4 , is so applicable as that of slavery ; and if the rebuke in this one passage of the word of God were regarded , slavery would at once come to an end . ( d ) The withholding of instruction is forbidden . Yet the laws prohibiting instruction to slaves , are abundantly declared by slaveholding legislators , to be essential to the system . ( 4 . ) It is conceded by many of the advocates of the lawfulness of slavery , that the gospel , if fairly applied , would remove slavery from the world . Even the Princeton Repertory , which says , that " It is in vain to profess reverence for the Scriptures , and yet to contend that slavery is a sin , ' * also says , that " the consequence of acting on the principles of the gospel , of following the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gradual elevation of the slaves in intelligence , virtue and wealth ; the peaceable and speedy extinction of slavery . " This concedes the whole matter in debate . For it is a legitimate and inevitable conclusion from this concession , that slavery is sinful . The most rigid application of the principles of the gospel will destroy nothing that is good . It makes war only on evil ; its tendency is to remove only that which is sinful . And with this concession of the Princeton Repertory , // all the arguments found therein , and elsewhere , for the rightfulness of slavery-that the Bible does not condemn it , but has countenanced it in all ages ; that it is not to be regarded as , per Se , an evil ; that it is wrong for ecclesiastical bodies to legislate on it ; that slaves may be held with propriety by Christians and Christian ministers ; that the war which Christianity makes on it is not on the system but the " abuses of the system " - are grossly inconsistent . If Christianity would bring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would ; and the only reason that can be assigned , as drawn from the nature of Christianity , is , that it is contrary to the will of God , and a thing that is morally wrong . Having thus fully examined the tendency of Christianity upon slavery , Mr. B. , as he did in the case of the Mosaic system , inquires what were its actual working and effectand shows that these were such as to confirm this view of its tendency . Slavery was considered by the early Christians , to be adverse to the spirit of the gospel ; they regarded emancipation as a most important and desirable thing ; they made great sacrifices to impart freedom to the enslaved-some even delivering themselves into bonds and slavery , that they might restore others to liberty ; Christianity meliorated the laws pertaining to slavery , and made it quite a different thing ; and , under the influence of Christianity , slavery had almost ceased in the Roman empire , when that empire was overrun by the northern barbarians . Such is this work of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , has cost us far more labor than would a patched account of it , in the ordinary way of quotation . But we think we have thus given more of its life and spirit , as well as its essential meaning . There are faults of style in the work , which we could easily criticise . But we admire it so much as a whole , that we have no heart for such criticism . We pronounce it a thorough , candid , able and triumphant vindication of the Bible against the charge , to which many of its friends with infatuated blindness , have exposed ita charge disastrous to its influence , yea , destructive of its character and authority-that it countenances and sanctions slavery . It was no part of Mr. B. 's design , to discuss the mode by which our country should be freed from this dreadful system . His object was to endeavor to settle one great preliminary matter , viz , to secure the conviction every where , in and out of the church , that slavery is not countenanced but condemned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary to the spirit and influence of Christianity . " There is one method , however , " he says , " which is obvious , and whi*t if every where practiced , would certainly lead to this result . it is , for the Christian church to cease all connection with slavery . " On this point we quote the following , the concluding paragraph of the book . " Now here , I am persuaded , is a wise model for all other denominations ofChristian men , and the true idea of all successful efforts for the removal of this great evil from the land . Let all the evangelical denominations but follow the simple example of the Quakers in this country , and slavery would soon come to an end . There is not vital energy enough ; there is not power of numbers and influence enough out of the church , to sustain it . Let every religious denomination in the land detach itself from all connection with slavery , without saying a word against others ; let the time come when , in all the mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil has ceased with them FOR EvER ; and let the voice from each denomination be lifted up in kind , but firm and solemn testimony against the system-with no mealy ' words ; with no attempt at apology ; with no wish to blink it ; with no effort to throw the sacred shield of religion over so great an evil  --  and the work is done . There is no public sentiment in this land - there could be none created , that would resist the power of such testimony . There is no power out of the church that could sustain slavery an hour , if it were not sus // tamed in it . Not a blow need be struck . Not an unkind word need he uttered . No man 's motive need he impugned ; no man 's proper rights invaded . All that is needful is , for each Christian man , and for every Christian church , to stand up in the sacred majesty of such a solemn testimony ; to free themselves from all connection with the evil , and utter a calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 DONE-pp.383-4 . With this we entirely concur . This ought to be done . The when and the how Mr. B. does not discuss , except that he says , speaking of the Quakers , " They have aimed at two things  --  and two only-both of them legitimate , both of them prudent and wise ; first to remove slavery from their own body ; and then to bear their solemn testimony , in regard to the evil , to the world . The first object was pursued year after year , by patient and manly discussion , and by faithful and affectionate dealing *wth their brethren ;  --  and the period at last arrived , when they could announce to the world , that the evil of slavery was not attached to any portion of their denomination ; when there was not a " Friend " who claimed a right of property in his fellow-man . " We suppose Mr. B. holds-we certainly do-that the when and the how should be such as are entirely consistent with the rule , which we deem cardinal in the church of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the communion and privileges of the Christian church , who gives evidence that he has experienced the renewing grace of God , and is accepted by the Great Head of the church . We have said that we agree with Mr. B. in the general proposition , which it is the whole object of his book to prove from the Bible , viz. , that slavery is sin . We would insist strenuously on this proposition . We care not which form of expression is used , whether " slavery is sin , " or " slavery is sinful , " or " slavery is morally evil , " except that we have a fondness for the good strong Saxon word , sin . These phra ses , in our view , have the same meaning . Lest however we should be misunderstood , by those who are especially given to metaphysics , we would say , that we hold that , in accurate metaphysical language , nothing should be called , as nothing is , sin , but se ! flshness  --  a state of heart in some degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain outward acts so palpably disastrous to human well-being , that the performance of them always implies , in some degree , selfishness , or sin in strict metaphysical language ; and , therefore , the performance of such acts is called , and properly called , in popular language , sinful . While , however , we hold , and would strenuously insist , that slavery is sin ; when we apply this proposition to individual cases of what , in legal and popular language , is called slaveholding or slaveowning , we deem it important , and demanded by justice as well as charity , to make some distinctions . It follows inevitably from the proposition slavery is sin , that wherever there is not merely nominal but real slavery - wherever a man is held as property , contrary to his will , there is sin somewhere . A human heing is held in a relation palpably disastrous to human welfare . That man is a stolen man . He has a right to him*elf-to the reasonable free use of his powers . God gave him this right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . His slavery commenced in theft ; it is continued by theft - by man-stealing . Of course the guilt of the theft , or robbery , is somewhere . Wherever there is real slavery , there is sin , guilt , somewhere ; and that somewhere is where the gripe of the slavery is-where the real holding is  --  the holding which keeps the man in that particular relation , or should that be dissolved , would plunge him into a worse . But there may be , there are , individuals // who are nominal , but not essential slaveholders or slaveowners ; that is , individuals who , in legal and popular language are , with propriety , called slaveholders or owners ; who are not guilty of the essence , the reality of slaveholding or slavery . Minors to whom slaves are willed , and widows who , entitled by will to the income of slave property , may indeed refuse the income , but can not emancipate the slaves , are nominal slaveholders . But the gripe , and therefore the guilt of slavery is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation of owner and master to a slave , and has offered that slave freedom , and facilities and aids to go to a free state , and urges him to accept them ; hut the slave , either from affection to his master , or because he has a wife and children who are slaves on neighboring plantations , and can not in any way obtain freedom , or on account of local attachment or for some other reason , prefers to remain , and urgently requests that , for his own protection and advantage-for protection against laws and customs which either utterly forbid , or cruelly embarass the residence of a freed man-he may remain in that relation ; this man is legally , and therefore in a sense properly , called a slaveholder . But nothing is plainer , than that he is merely a nominal slaveholder , and therefore not guilty of the sin of slavery . That slave is no longer really such , but rather a voluntary servant , if a servant at all . We suppose there are many cases of this kind in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , to make all possible provision against the infinite wrongs to which , without such provision , the slaves are liable , in the event of the insolvency or death of their legal owner and protector . There may be another class of cases of merely nominal slaveholders . A master desires to emanct pate his slaves , or to retain them as voluntary servants upon wages . But the infamous laws forbid , by severe penalties , the emancipation of slaves except by act of the Legislature , ( which would be hopeless ) ; and also the giving them wages or any of the privileges of freedom ; and decree that slaves , who are thus nominally or virtually emancipated , " shall be liable to be arrested and sold by public outcry . " Such substantially are the laws of Georgia , North Carolina and Mississippi . The master , moreover , is not able to take these slaves to a free state . It is not his sin , then , that those men are slaves . He takes no advantage of wicked laws to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty , were it in his power . He might , indeed , manutnit them , but that , instead of giving them liberty , would be to throw them on the cruel mercies of those infamous laws . He can not , in a fair sense of the language , be called a voluntary slaveholder . He can not rid himself with ' out the grossest cruelty , of the relation of a master , and therefore we say he does not come under the force of our general proposition . He is not guilty of the sin of slavery . It is not his hand which gives the gripe of slavery . Yet such cases are rare . There are multitudes of men in the free states , who , if applied to by such masters , would cheerfully aid in removing the slaves to a land of freedom , and in securing for them a comfortable condition. * These distinctions we are bound in charity and justice to make . But our general proposition , that slavery is sin , may be rightly applied to individual slaveholders or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fair meaning of that word , avails himself of the laws of slavery to hold a man in bondage , contrary to his * The contributions to the Colonization Society in the free States , are made for this very purpose , and may he taken as proof of the assertion above. - Editors. // will or without his consent , is guilty of the sin of slavery . Of course , we do not , by this remark , include cases where a man holds others for a temporary period only , in order to their emancipation in the best practicable way . It can not reasonably be supposed , that men at all fit for liberty would object to this . But if they should object , such cases come under the rule " de mmimis lex non curat . " They do not invalidate the justice of the above application of our general proposition . We ought also to make some distinctions respecting degrees of guilt in essential and guilty slaveholding . The amount of guilt , in performing certain wrong acts , varies according to circumstances ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , and always involves real guilt in the intelligent agent , capable , as he is , of knowing , and therefore under obligation to know , their nature and character . Slavery and the slave-trade were just as evil in their knowable nature and tendencies , when Jonathan Edwards defended the one and John Newton practised the other , as they are now ; and therefore involved sin as truly as they do now . But who will say , that those men sinned by those acts as greatly , as the men who are guilty of like acts amid the light of this year of our Lord eighteen hundred and forty six ? Right and wrong , as they exist in outward acts , lie in immutable relations-in the unchangeably evil nature and tendencies of those acts . But right and wrong , as they exist , morally , in the hearts of men who do right and wrong acts , vary with circumstances ; among which may be mentioned , as prominent , knowledge and the means of obtaining knowledge respecting these acts . Accordingly the sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to circumstances ; and , in some cases , may be compara tively small , and quite consistent with reputable piety . We believe there are many instances where a man , educated amid southern prejudices and customs , and embarassed by the difficulties which the barbarous laws of the slave States throw in the way of emancipationa man of full ordinary conscientiousness and wisdom and Christian benevolence-doubts whether he ought , nay , is confident that he ought not , to liberate his slaves . We need not enter on the question respecting the degree of guilt , in the various cases of essential slaveholding . Each case must be decided , not by general rule , but by its own merits . We only need say , that while we fully believe that all essential slaveholders are in some degree sinners , we do not believe that they are , in all instances , at the present time , sinners in such degree as disproves their piety , or disqualifies them for the communion of the saints , or the privileges of the Christian church . There is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to say a word . We introduce it by quoting this language of Mr. Barnes . " if the Bible could be shown to defend and countenance slavery as a good institution , it would make thousands of infidels-for there are multitudes of minds that will see more clearly that slavery is against all the laws which God has written on the human soul , than they would see that a book sanctioning such a system had evidence of divine origin . " This we fully believe , it ought to be uttered with intense emphasis . They who defend slavery from the Bible , are making thousands of infidels . We will not retort the discourtesy and uncharitableness of the Princeton Reviewers , by saying that it is vain for them to plead that the Bible proves the lawfulness of slavery , " and yet profess reverence for the Bible . " We have no doubt that they do reverence the Bible . But // we do say , that the position which they and others like them take on this subject , is most disastrous to the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they argue that the Bible sanctions American slavery-we say American slavery , for that is what we mean and they mean-they would be doing more than is done by perhaps any other agency , to bring the Bible into contempt , and to cause the name of Christ to be blasphemed . They bring the Bible into open conflict , with truths as obvious and as certainly known , as the very premises on which all proof of the divine origin of the Bible must rest . These reviewers , in the article often quoted by Mr. B. , use the following language . " Every one must feel that if perjury , murder , or idolatry had been thus authorized , it would bring the Mosaic institutions into conflict with the eternal principles of morals , and that our faith in the divine origin of the one or the other must be given up . " We turn this language upon them . We try them by their own rule . We say , they bring the Bible " into conflict with the eternal principles of morals . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palpably , contradicting the first principles of right-is sanctioned by the Bible . Nay , they say that it is vain for any one who denies this , " to profess reverence for the Bible . " Thus they bring the Bible " into conflict with the eternal principles of morals ; " and , by their own rule , their " faith in the divine origin of the one or the other must be given up ; " i. e. they must believe that the Bible is not from God , or that God is immoral - unworthy of love or service . On their own principle , they are logically bound to be either infidels or atheists . They are thus giving to the world , and inculcating on the church , premises , which , by a short and logical process , make men , if they will but take the premises , infidels or atheists . The reasoning is just . The logic is infallible . If the Bible sanctions this slavery , then it is not from God , or God is without benevolence , and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , not in intent , but in word and in fact , blasphemy . For how could Ho be more emphatically called the patron of injustice and tyranny , than by saying that he sanctions such a complication of wrongs , such a concentration of oppressions , as American slavery . We implore our brethren , for the sake of God , and for the credit and safety of Christianity , to reconsider and change their position . And we hope that our Princeton brethren , if in all other cases they adhere to their rule to make no progress in ethics or theology , will make an exception here.
