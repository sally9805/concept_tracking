txt WE often hear those who visit Niagara , where every one feels it incumbent on himself to he a geologist for the time , indulging in solemn speculations concerning the probable effect of removing the great barrier which now holds back the waters ; doubting whether it might not let down the great lakes , in sudden and unwelcome inundation , upon the region below . Some of that large class who delight to prophesy evil expound , to the consternation of - their hearers , that the time is not far off when the rocky ridge will give way , the natives of the upper counties share the fate of the antediluvians , and after a drowning overflow , the stream , no longer dashing from its mountain heights , will ever after creep , humbled and slavelike , in a lowly channel far beneath its present bed . After listening to these fearful predictions , one is greatly comforted to remember , that nature fortunately has no delight in these wild exhibitions of power ; she accoim. plishes her purposes by regular and steady action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to her , it may make a serious difference to us , whether these changes are brought about in a thousand years or a single day . Sometimes a part of Table Rock thunders down into the startled abyss , and the ice and frost prepare their wedges to split off a new fragment at a future day ; sometimes the waters dislodge a vast cliff in their channel , and bear it with them in savage triumph to the depths below . But it is not often that any decided change is made in the aspect of the fall ; there is no revolutionary alteration at which " the deep utters his voice and lifts up his hands on high . " Very much the same is true of the great moral and social changes which are continually taking place in the world . FJ7here are powers and influences in constant operation , wearing away the form and fashion of existing things ; their action goes on by night and by day , never suspended for an hour ; and it is by this incessant exertion , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usurpations and abuses // overthrown , and new forms of religion , government , and opinion are established among men . We are very apt , in contemplating one of these changes , to ascribe it all to an individual , or to point out the day and hour when the great work was done ; whereas their true history extends far upward and downward . It is as difficult to trace the beginning as to show the precise point above the cataract where the waters first accelerate their flow ; and as to their dependence on a single life , we often see an enterprise more indebted to the martyr than the champion , and actually gaining more by the loss , than by all the living labors , of those who seemed essential to its successful prosecution . It is difficult to understand that events and persons , which seem to concentrate all attendant circumstances into a point , are themselves parts of a whole ; for example , when the Roman emperor nominates his horse for consul , it seems to us a sudden and startling insult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been free . But as De Retz remarks , " had we lived at the time , we should not have been surprised , " because it was of a piece with other things ; so many far inferior bipeds had been exalted to high stations , that the appointment of a respectable animal took its easy and natural place among the events of the day . So the resistance of Luther to the power of Rome , daring as it was , probably seemed less strange and unexpected than we are in the habit of believing ; for there is no doubt , that , while kings and nations submitted to the pretensions of the church , it was with that sort of resignation which arises from the feeling that they could not help themselves . A deep distrust of its claims must have spread silently from heart to heart , which everywhere made itself felt , though not manifest in living action till the hour was come . Such a change as the Reformation could not be sudden in its origin or its results ; the elements were slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no single year to which it could be assigned , there was no individual on whom it depended . The reforming process , of which Luther 's resistance was one of the stages , began before he existed , it survived when his wars were over , and will keep on long after our generation is in the dust . These great changes in human opinion are of so large extent and so long duration , that no single human shadow , // though great as that of Luther unquestionably was , can throw itself over the whole . There is no short and sharp encounter ; there is no Waterloo battle , which brings sudden death to existing ideas and systems , and sets up others at once in their stead . The Reformation presented its first visible manifestation two centuries before him . Far back in the dim twilight of its history we see the upright and manly form of Wickliffe , speaking with brave determination of the corruptions of the church , and listened to by thousands who believed all he could say of its unsoundness ; thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discovered long before him all that he was able to tell . So , too , when Russ the Bohemian , having caught the spirit of this great master , bore the same strong testimony against the church , the people who had already , they knew not how , arrived at the same conclusions , stood ready to arrange themselves in his party . Savonarola , in Florence , also found himself expressing what the multitudes felt and understood , but wanted words to say . *J7 he reformer in these cases was but a living presentment of the active intellect and conscience of his time ; when he felt as if he had gone on in lonely solitude far before them , he was amazed to find that thousands were pressing on at his side . If things are so , and it is not easy to deny the existence of this kind of prophetic anticipation in the people , though they would be quite unable to explain the manner in which they reach it , the office of the reformer is not so much to make discoveries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds of men in living action , as to unfold their thoughts to themselves , to change their impressions into well defined ideas , and to set the example of following their convictions wherever they urge them to go . The qualifications most essential for the discharge of this duty are a clear head and a strong heart . It is not necessary to have every graceful accomplishment , to possess a philosophical habit of mind , nor to abound in various learning . But it is indispensable that the reformer should have warm and living sympathies , since no one can carry away the hearts of the multitude unless he has one of his own . He must have a firm and steady spirit , that his views may not change with his anxieties and elevations , his hopes and fears ; he must be fearless of what man can do to him , otherwise he will soon be frightened from his station ; // and , what is more than all , an enlightened conscience , not subject to darkening changes , but shining with uniform brightness , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the breast . This we believe to be a true description of the great man whose life is before us ; and we have little sympathy with those who would give prominence to his faults on the one hand , or invest him with airy graces , making him a sort of Chesterfield , on the other . In the present condition of our existence , there are certain virtues which are almost invariably accompanied by certain failings . No one expects to find the elegant scholar , like Erasmus , abounding in active energy ; and when overwhelming energy is the prevailing character of the man , we have no reason to look for those tender and amiable traits which we are most disposed to love . The garden can not have the dreamy boundlessness of the prairie , nor can the bold mountain ridge be smooth and easy to the feet . It is true , there was one character , and only one , in which active and resistless power was blended with the gentlest humanity but it is equally certain that among all who have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembled it ; so that such a union of opposite and apparently inconsistent affections is still the great miracle of Christian history , standing alone in the unapproachable solitude of more than human greatness , filling with admiration and almost with despair those who earnestly attempt to imitate this wonderful association of mighty power with tender lowliness and love . In Luther there certainly was no such perfection ; he might as well be represented with the face and form of the Apollo but he was a man of a warm and generous , as well as brave and determined spirit , always inspiring confidence and securing attachment , which a man of narrow mind and cold affections was never yet able to do . It is in vain to deny that Luther was at times somewhat coarse in his communications with others ; and to ascribe it , after the usual fashion , to the spirit of the age , though it shows that he was not alone in that sort of indulgence , does not make such language refined , nor reconcile it with the purest taste . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetmeats chiefly in his intercourse with Satan , and Henry the Eighth , and other potentates of the same description , where he was wholly exempt from apprehension , as indeed // there was no call for any , lest he should treat such people worse than they deserved . But he is not by any means to be classed with those worthies of whom Erasmus says , that " they break in upon one 's feelings like hogs into a flowergarden , " trampling with grunting satisfaction on treasures which they can not understand . Since we have mentioned this great man , who , by his attacks on the vices of the church , did so much to prepare the way for the Reformation , it is but just to say that the manner in which he is brought into contrast with Luther is not just to either ; each had his separate office to fulfil , and in each case it was successfully done . But they were wholly unlike in temperament ; neither had any thing in himself which enabled him to understand the other . Erasmus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Luther could his classical pen . Though the former saw much to censure and deplore in the church , it is not probable that he wished to overthrow it , and with all his tendencies to rationalism , he would naturally be distrustful of the sort of theology which might be set up in its stead . In all this Luther could see nothing better than timeserving ; accordingly he treated . Erasmus as he treated others , in a way which savored more of strength and plainness than of Christian and courtly grace . But in domestic life Luther appears to have been affectionate and kind ; in his social intercourse with others , open-hearted , generous , and free from all selfishness and suspicion ; while , in his regard for the other creatures of God , he sets an example which others would do well to follow , and which those who think it needless and excessive must allow to have been an indication of manly tenderness of heart . When , by his sedentary life and labor , he had brought upon himself a visitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was advised to take vigorous exercise , and after the usual fashion was encouraged to believe that a sudden transition from a feather-bed to a steeple-chase would be eminently beneficial to him . So far from finding relief in the sport , it continually reminded him of the manner in which souls are hunted by the great enemy of man ; and so little did he enter into the spirit of the chase , that he caught one poor little hare , and hid it in the sleeve of his coat , to save it from the fate which his friends were so greatly enjoying ; which was perhaps as serviceable to his complaint as if // he had killed and eaten it , and which we can not but regard as creditable to his sense and feeling . Some injury has been done to the memory of Luther by those who plead in excuse for violence and denunciation that Luther did the same thing . Though they have no idea of disparaging him by the comparison , but only of exalting themselves , the effect is not so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring the angel down . It is well to remember , that there was something in the great Reformer besides hard thoughts and hard words ; these were his failings , not his virtues , and he would have remained as obscure and inefficient as his ambitious imitators are now , if there had been nothing else to recommend him to the admiration of men . The imitator does not often understand the original which he intends to follow ; he mistakes the points in which his power resides ; he supposes that Samson 's might consists in the length of his hair , when this is but a sign of faithfulness to his Nazarite vow ; and thus , as when some men repeat a jest , all the humor is sure to slip through their fingers , do all who justify their abuse and excess by Luther 's example contrive unconsciously to omit all the particulars of character which made him transcendently great , and , entirely unaware what a length of ear has found its way through their lion vesture , they wonder why they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hoped that such persons will make the discovery , that , however loudly they storm and threaten those who oppose them , men do not mistake them for Luthers , and that the effects which they produce by their vociferation , in comparison with his , will be few and exceedingly small . The chief recommendation of this life of Luther is , that the author allows the great Reformer to tell his own story , taking his own words , particularly his letters , as the best expressions of his character and feeling . In almost all cases , where they are not merely formal , a man puts his heart , or at least a portion of it , into such writings . There are a few examples in which , as in that of Cromwell , the letter is entirely impersonal , and might as well have been written by any body else , for all the light it throws upon his feelings . But this is a remarkable exception . It is as if there should be no more expression in the face than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen , though not often in // men so great . We may not only generally depend on the letters for a clear statement of a nan 's views and opinions , and for the light which colored them in his mind , but we can find the incidents of his life more intimately understood and better described by himself than by others ; and as for the changes of feeling , the stranger can not intermeddle with them to advantage , any more than the wayfarer , who sees the evening light outside the window , can describe the play of the shadows within , as the rising or falling flame may cast them on the parlour-wall . Luther had none of that poor ambition , which is sOmetimes found in those who ought to be above it , to disguise the humility of his birth ; as those who have made themselves rich can afford to dispense with a patrimonial inheritance , he who threw so much glory upon his line might be indifferent to so small a matter . He says that his ancestors , so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his father labored in the mines ; their armorial hearing , for peasants had such playthings as well as lords , was a hammer , an emblem which , if it applied to the employment of the father , was at least equally descriptive of the work in which the son was engaged for a great part of his life , and assuredly that instrument was never swung with a mightier hand . It would not have been easy for one familiar as he was with the letter and spirit of the Scriptures to be blinded by traditional prejudice and outward show . He saw the nothingness of these distinctions , which rise up like walls of separation between human worms of the dust ; he had nothing of that spirit of compromise about him which induces many , who see the truth of human relations , to treat those things which are not as though they actually existed . And well was it for the world that it was so with him and his brethren ; since it made them heralds of liberty as well as of truth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chains ; and though their work was done irregularly and blindly , we feel how much it is owing to their spirit and their labors that the principles of civil liberty are generally extending , and that so much of the civilized world is already comparatively free . Luther himself was so poor in his youth , that , when sent to Eisenach to be educated , he sang in the streets for a living , as was not uncommon with German students of that day . He is said to have done this in 1489 , when he was // Oct . Michelet 's Life of Luther. but six years old , a period of life when the young are accustomed to sing in less musical tones than most persons delight to hear ; besides that it is rather early in his history for the process of education to begin . This date is obviously an error ; it should be 1498 , which would bring him to an age of more discretion both in musical performance and learning . But he was fortunate enough to find a warmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a kind-hearted woman gave him a home for four years , while he was making himself master of what Eisenach could teach . After he ceased to depend on music for a subsistence , he continued to cherish it as a luxury and something higher ; valuing it , in part , because he was persuaded that Satan , by whom he conceived himself beset , had , like some better people , such an extreme distaste for concerts and musical sounds , that he always took himself out of their reach ; and still more , because he found , that , in times of anxious and stormy excitement , music had more power than any thing else to bring peace to his troubled soul . It was not till he reached the age of twenty-two , that any decided bearing was given to his life . The sudden death of a friend who was struck with lightning by his side made him serious at once ; and his earnestness naturally turned in the prescribed channel of the day . He made a vow to become a monk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-denial than a choice of duty ; for he must have felt , as he afterwards found , that such a life was most unsuited to his nature ; his mind , unexcited by outward circumstances , would be the very one to prey upon itself . Accordingly it appeared , as soon as he entered upon a life of inaction , that he fell into deep distress of mind , which was the effect of conscience wrought up into morbid sensibility by a condition so unexciting . For many days , he could not eat , drink , or sleep ; but at length , the Scriptural doctrine of justification by faith dawned like the rising light upon his mind . It gave him relief from his anxieties in a measure ; but it opened slowly on him . He did not understand how widely it would spread itself out . Still less did he perceive that it would reduce the value of those good works on which Catholics so much relied , till it finally undermined the foundations of the church itself in the hearts of men . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insufficiency of external cir // cumstances , and even of religious forms , to satisfy the wants of the soul . It supplied a living principle within him ; it made him independent of human authority , and fearless of all that power could do . As fast as others became conscious of similar wants , and of the inadequacy of the prevailing faith to supply them , their hearts were prepared to move in harmony with his own ; so that , as soon as the standard of resistance was lifted , and the trumpet blown , a great army of martyrs stood ready for the summons of the chief whose commission was an earlier inspiration and a larger measure of the same spirit with theirs . Vhile in this state of mind , he visited Rome , full of enthusiasm for the ancient glories of the church , and longing to see the fountains from which her light and salvation shone . But the time chosen for his journey was unfortunate for that purpose , though it well answered another . He was completely dismayed at the paganism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining military glory ; the higher priesthood taking pride in their knowledge of Cicero , but entirely unacquainted with the Bible ; the mass hurried over by galloping through a part and entirely omitting the rest ; and a clergy ambitiously striving for the good things of this life , without any apparent consciousness that they were ever to go to another . When he once spoke to the Italian monks of their disregard to the church in eating meat on Friday , he came near being put into a condition which would have saved him from all expense for meat again . He knew that such priests could not impart to others that forgiveness of which they were in desperate want themselves ; his reverence for the church fell into consumptive decay ; and though he did not confess it to himself , nor present the subject distinctly to his own mind , he evidently began to think , that , if the church could live without faith , faith could subsist without the church , - better , indeed , than with it ; the light would be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . Having his conscience thus quickened by the study of the Scriptures , and his mind enlarged and enlightened by various learning , he was able to see through the fallacies and contradictions which ordinary minds received without question , and he could not content himself with tame acquiescence in that which he knew to be unholy and untrue . And 38* // nothing could be more startling to a conscientious Catholic than the sale of indulgences , which , as if the thing was not bad enough of itself , was intrusted to one of the most impudent peddlers that ever insulted the common sense of mankind . Luther had no delight in speaking , but he did not dare be silent ; and after trying in vain to call his diocese and the primate to a sense of their duty , he published propositions of his own , with a sermon in the vulgar tongue in defence of them , in which the sale of indulgences was strongly condemned and shown to be entirely unchristian . This bold protest rang through his country like the trumpet which wakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say ; and as soon as his holy4 indignation found a voice , it was answered by echoes from every part of the land . The propositions were everywhere circulated , read , and approved ; those who were most opposed to them in heart could not deny them . In fact , the only reply thought of seemed to be addressed to the fears of the author and his followers ; but it was soon found that to threaten was not the way to induce him to suppress his convictions . He seems to have felt some regret , when he witnessed the agitation which he had made ; he was disposed to obey and submit so far as his conscience would allow ; but it was one of those paths in which , having taken one step , there was no returning , and the only way of escape was not the one which such a man was likely to tread . The only judicious course for the church in such a case would have been to conciliate the bold rebel , appealing to his kindness and reverence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take brands from the burning with tongs made red hot for that benevolent operation . Luther was summoned to Rome , whither he was not disposed to go ; if destined for the flames , he thought it more reasonable that the fire should come to him . For his own safety he gave himself no other concern than not to go into needless danger ; but the Elector of Saxony , who had sympathy with him in his views , and was not prepared to see one of his subjects trampled down , arranged matters in his favor so that he should have his hearing in Augsburg , a free city , where the magistrates could protect his person . Luther 's manly words were , - " Let him shield me , if he can do it without compromising his interests ; if not , I am ready to // face the danger . " He appeared in Augsburg before Cardinal Caietan , who , having been suspected of a tang of heresy himself , was thought to be expert in dealing with persons of that description . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heretical as he pleased , if , as the Presbyterian divine in Edinburgh said to Charles the Second , " he would only shut the windows . " The enormity of the sin consisted in its being publicly known , and thereby misleading others with its example . Moreciver , he could not conceive why Luther should hesitate to make this cheap and easy recantation , which would cleanse him from all guilt , without requiring the least change in his opinions . Finding the Reformer intractable , the legate argued with him ; but as he found his authorities in the records of the church , and Luther took his stand on common sense and the Bible , they were hardly within speaking distance of each other . The hearing did not lead to any satisfactory result ; the Pope had already denounced the insurgent , and it was his misfortune to be infallible , while Luther was sustained by a conscientious intrepidity which not all the world could how . Nothing could be more generous than his bearing ; finding himself thus an object of persecution , he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger to his prince that he was about to quit Germany ; that , wherever he went , he should remember with never-ceasing gratitude the kind protection which had been afforded him , and he respectfully bade him farewell . When we remember how entirely alone he stood , how fearfully he was threatened , and how great were the sacrifices he was making to the truth , this conduct on . his part seems as generous and high as any thing which history records . Every one capable of estimating character must dwell upon it with perfect delight ; and it is a relief to find that the Elector guarded him , not by open resistance to Rome , hut by requiring , with diplomatic adroitness , that he should he tried by disinterested judges ; a sort of bench which he well knew it was impossible to find . Meantime , the emperor of Germany died ; and the Elector of Saxony was so prominent a candidate for that high station , that the Roman court did not think it wise to come in conflict with him till the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power was an effectual shield to all over whom it extended . // It is one of the great points of Luther 's character , that he did not suffer any foresight of consequences to himself to affect his judgment and zeal for inquiry in one way or another . His mind was now dislodged from that traditional veneration on which the influence of the church depended . It was not that he was denounced and threatened , but because a rapid advance of light was taking place within him , that he began to reject the authority of the church , to treat the Pope as an erring and misguided man , and to respect nothing as sacred except so far as it was sanctioned by the word of God . In this spirit he wrote to the Holy Father with a simplicity of kindness which must have been more vexatious to that potentate than the sternest resistance to his will . " Dear Leo , I think of thee as Daniel in the pit . " " 0 hapless Leo , to sit on that accursed throne ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . " This language from a subject , however affectionate , was any thing but courtly and conciliating ; and as soon as the election of emperor had been decided against the Elector and in favor of Charles the Fifth of Spain , the Pope sent forth the bull of excommunication , which , as is not unusual with curses , came back on his own head . But the day for such things was over ; the spell of papal authority was broken . Though Luther 's books were burnt at Rome , the bull and the books of the canon law were burnt at Wittemberg , and no man could see why the demonstration of censure in the one case was stronger than in the other . In a single year , the great head of the church had d*vindled to a temporal prince ; just so far as strength or policy would avail , his power would reach ; beyond that narrow limit , it was no longer able to go . There is no passage in all history which more disposes one to stand still and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear discernment and efficient application of a Christian principle , that of justification by faith ; in the mechanical form of a doctrine , or stated as a Scriptural proposition , changes might have been rung upon it for ages without bringing out its hidden glory and power . But when Luther had once taken the Scriptures to his heart , as he did in the solitude and silence of the cloister , this truth , breaking through the words in which it was folded , seemed to spread and deepen till it covered the whole ground of Christian duty and filled up all his soul . Applied to indulgences , it made manifest that no // 1846 . Michelet 's Life of Luther. 445 human authority could absolve from the consequences of transgression , and it was delusion to believe that any thing but repentance and reform could bring the wanderer home to God . Considered in reference to human obligations , it made clear that the quick and active conscience , divinely enlightened by the Scriptures , must be sacredly followed , let men say what they will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mortal must yield to the immortal , this world in every thing give place to the other . Both with respect to civil and religious obedience , it establishes the maxin* , that " the Lord is our judge , our lawgiver , and our king . " No power can stand between us and Heaven ; and whoever allows himself to be turned from his religious duty by any human pretension is like the seaman who mistakes clouds for headlands , and the fog-bank for a rocky shore . It is wonderful to see how one of those principles of the gospel , when received in the living letter , illuminates every region of the soul , and casts light so broad and far on the way of life , that no one can wander , if the heart is only true . We must confess , that , to our apprehension , the wonderful effects which follow the application of these Christian principles to human affairs afford the strongest evidence of the inspiration of the book in which they are found ; for no suggestions of genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come within measurable distance of the power which resides in these intimations of the word of God . Hardly had Charles become emperor of Germany , before he summoned Luther to appear before the Diet at Worms , giving him a safe-conduct for the way . For himself , he seemed to care little about the reform ; but in his wars with ambitious rivals , he thought it necessary to have Rome on his side . Beyond this mark he does not seem to have cared to go ; though the Spaniards , thinking they understood the wishes of their master , treated Luther with injury and disdain . The Reformer is described by a contemporary who saw him at this time , as a man of middle size , extremely emaciated , with a clear and penetrating voice ; of easy and pleasant manners , entirely without severity or pride ; so far from putting on the air of a martyr , he was cheerful and good-humored in all his intercourse with others . But he was fixed and unflinching in his determinations . Friends and foes both urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trans .. // Oct . Michelet 's Life of Luther. mitted through the emperor 's confessor , that , if he did , he would be burned alive ; hut he made his memorable reply , signifying that nothing should prevent him , and went on in the simplicity of his heart . His appearance before the assembly was collected and commanding ; in his powerful defence , he said , that he could not defer to popes nor councils , for they were but fallible men ; but he was ready to recant , if any one would convince him that he was wrong . Till then , his conscience was a prisoner to God 's word . " Here I stand ; I can not do otherwise , so help me God ! " Leo desired the emperor to violate his pledge of safe-conduct , and the churchmen were earnest to make him an example and a warning . But this would have been too infamous to suit with Charles 's honor ; and accordingly an edict was published , to take effect when his safe-conduct should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen , forbidding any prince to harbour him , and requiring all to seize his person , that he might be dealt with according to the law . Immediately after this appearance at the Diet , he disappeared , in consequence of the Elector 's arrangement , who bad him privately conveyed to the castle of Wartburg , to secure him from the machinations of his enemies . Great was the speculation what could have become of him , and there were many fears for his safety ; but he soon gave the church to understand that he was still alive , by a succession of severe and powerful writings . But this exertion of mind , while the body was at rest , led on to dyspeptic visions and sorrows , which , as usual in that day , were ascribed to Satan ; and surely , if that personage interests himself in such matters , they are precisely the sort of blessing which he would be likely to dispense to men . It was in this retirement , that he is said to have thrown his inkstand at Satan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the appearance been real , the intruder would doubtless have preferred the effusion in that form rather than in the usual manner from the point of a pen as sharp as Luther 's . But the incident only shows how soon , after times of great and active excitement , rest , which is a relief for the moment , leads on to greater internal trouble than weariness and pain can bring . It was not assaults and batteries on his own person , however , but the excesses and dissensions which the enemy was stirring up among his followers , which drove him from his retreat . When he conceived // that , his presence was necessary to prevent confusion , forth he went , fearless as usual , paying no regard to his outlawry , passing through the territory of the Duke of Saxony , his bitter enemy , and at the hazard of displeasing the Elector by departing without his consent . The letter in which he communicated his purpose to that prince is finely illustrative of his character , uniting a grateful sense of kindness with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all personal consequences , which can hardly be matched in all the history of man . " I do not hold the gospel of men , but of Heaven , of our Lord Jesus Christ ; and I might well have called myself his servant , and assumed the name of evangelist , as I intend doing henceforward . If I have sought to be examined , it is not that 1 doubted the goodness of my cause , but through deference and humility alone . Now , seeing that this excess of humility only depreciates the gospel , and that the Devil , if I yield an inch of ground , seeks to take possession of the whole , my conscience compels me to act differently . It is enough , that , to please your Electoral Grace , I have spent a year in retirement . Well does the Devil know that this was through no fears of mine . He saw my heart when I entered Worms . Had that town been filled with devils , I would joyfully have flung myself into it . Now , Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I leave it to your Electoral Grace whether it would not be offensive to the Father of all mercy , who bids us put our trust in Him , to fear the anger of this duke ? Did God summon me to Leipsic , his capital , as He summons me to Wittemberg , I would thither ( forgive the silly expression ) , though it should rain Duke Georges nine days on end , and each nine times more furious than he . . . . He takes Jesus Christ , then , for a man of straw . The Lord may bear with this for a time , but not always . No more will I conceal from your Electoral Grace that I have more than once besought God with tears to be pleased to enlighten the duke ; and I will do so once more with all zeal , but it shall be for the last time . I also beg your Grace 's own prayers , and that you would order prayers to be put up , to the end that we may turn away from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alas ! threatens him each day more nearly . I write this to apprize you that I am on my way to Wittemberg , under a higher protection than that of the Elector ; so that I have no intention of asking your Grace 's support . Nay , I even believe I shall be a better protection to the Elector than the Elector to me ; and did I think that I had to trust to him , I should stay my steps . The sword is powerless here . God must act without man 's interfer // ence . He , in whom faith most abounds , will be the most efficacious protector ; and , as I feel your Grace 's faith to be still weak , I can by no means recognize in you him who is to protect and save me . Your Electoral Grace asks me what you are to do under these circumstances , thinking you have done little hitherto . I answer , with all submission , that your Grace has done only too much , and that you should do nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His cause ; but that we should trust in Him alone . If your Grace entertain this faith , you will reap peace and security ; if not , I at least will rest in faith , and shall be obliged to leave to your Grace the torment with which God punishes unbelievers . Since , then , I decline complying with your Grace 's exhortations , you will be justified before God , if I am taken or am put to death . And , before men , it is my wish your Grace should act as follows - That you be obedient to authority like a good Elector , allow the emperor to rule in his states conformably with the laws of the empire , and forbear from resisting any power which shall attack my liberty or my life ; for no one ought to disarm authority or resist it , save Him who has instituted it ; else t is revolt , and against God . I only hope that they will have sense enough to discern that your Electoral Grace is too high in place to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors open and insist on the recognition of the safe-conduct , should they come to seize me , you will have satisfied the calls of obedience . On the contrary , if they are unreasonable enough to order your Grace yourself to lay hands on me , I will so manage that you shall suffer on my account no prejudice in body , goods , or soul . I will explain myself , if necessary , more at length another time . I forward this , for fear of your Grace 's being distressed at hearing of my arrival ; for , as a Christian , I ought to comfort every one and harm none . If your Grace had faith , you would behold the wondrous things of God ; but if you yet have it not , you have yet seen nothing . Let us love and glorify God for ever . Amen . Written at Borna , with my guide by me , Ash Wednesday ( March 5th ) , 1522 . Your Electoral Grace 's most humble servant , MARrIN LurHEIC ' As soon as Luther had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which grew out of a misapprehension of the truths which he taught , he enjoyed the opportunity of holding a controversy with a crowned head , if so it may be called , when the head was by no means the most efficient part of the system ; we mean with Henry the Eighth , who undertook the cause of Rome , and , to prevent his claiming something more substantial , was called by the // Pope " IDefender of the Faith " ; a title happily ambiguous , since it conveyed nothing concerning the talent and success with which the church had been defended . Luther , in his study of the Scripture , had not only reached the truth that every man might he his own priest , but had made the kindred discovery , that , in civil life , one man is as good as another , and , in a fair political system , a part of sovereignty should be in each one 's hands , so that every one , with no authority except of his own choice above him , should he directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bihle , that the object of religion was to make all men priests and kings ; of course , it was not to be expected , that , after priests ran low in his estimation , he would continue to feel any extraordinary reverence for kings , except they were also respectable men , which did not happen to he the case with Henry . We find that Luther conversed with the Elector on terms of manly equality , showing respect for his character and gratitude for his kindness , but openly professing that he felt no dependence on any earthly power . But as for " that silly-pated Duke George of Saxony , " who , with other princes , had prohibited his new translation of the Scriptures in their dominions , he treated them all with indifference and disdain , not concerned in the least by any thing they could do to him , but only lamenting , that , in consequence of their folly , the next age would see " Germany swimming in blood . " Shocking to royal ears must have been such language as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palatable . " Ye must know , that , from the beginning of the world , a wise prince has been rare ; still more , an upright and honest one . They are generally worthless castaways , or great fools . Already there are very few princes who are not treated as idiots and fools ; for the plain reason , that they show themselves such , and the people begin to have understanding . " " The emperor , " he said , was " a poor and wretched creature " ; quite a new title to add to the announcement of Charles the Fifth . Of Henry he said , - " Here is this king of England , styling himself Defender of the Faith ; the Hungarians , in their litanies , even boast of being the protectors of God . Why are there not princes to protect Jesus Christ , and others to defend the Holy Ghost ? Truly , in this fashion , the Holy Trinity and the faith will be fitly guarded at last . " This sort of compliment , to which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ von . LxIII. - NO. 133. 39 // feet storm , threw Henry into a raging passion ; and truly there was something in Luther 's coolly contemptuous way of abusing , which , however richly deserved , a far more Christian spirit than that of the Defender of the Faith would have been at its wit 's end to bear with any composure . Up to this time , Luther had been triumphant in all his undertakings ; but now the day of his perplexities began , in which he did not always appear to quite the same advantage ; not for the want of clearness in his mind nor of disinterestedness and constancy in his heart ; but simply because , when the old authorities were overthrown , he became the popular oracle . All manner of questions , civil and religious , were submitted to him ; and how to reconcile liberty with order , and to follow the conscience in all things without treason and disloyalty , it was not always easy to tell . He found , as many who have made war on a smaller scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is excellent for pulling down is not the best material for building up ; the same enemy which is resistless in its march against oppressive power does not contain the self-restoring principle within it . Those who keep their ranks during the heat of the battle , as soon as the victory is sure , begin to straggle and wander at large ; after declaiming against authority , it seems ungracious to exert authority ; nor is it of much use , indeed , when there is no longer any consent to obey . He found that his followers began to expatiate , each at his own dear will ; each had his doctrine and his psalm , and fearful was likely to be the discord when each was chanting his own . When each one was referred to his own heart for his authority , he could see no reason why he should harmonize with others ; and in civil matters especially , men could not understand why , after having released themselves from popes and councils , they should bear the tyranny of feudal chiefs and kings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large and liberal in his views and feelings , was driven into something like exclusiveness by the fancied necessity of setting a bound . He feared that the Reformation would be delayed and dishonored by extravagance and excess in his followers ; thus , he differed with Zwingle concerning the Lord 's Supper , when the views of that great Swiss Reformer were more advanced than his own . He apparently wanted sympathy with the peasants in their resistance to oppression , though // their cause was eminently just . In all this , he appears inconsistent with himself ; he evidently felt embarrassment , doubting , as the liberal party when triumphant alw*iys does , whether he had not preached his liberal doctrine with too little qualification and reserve ; and then , in his perplexity , setting up his restraining barriers in the wrong places ; setting them up , not because they were reasonable , or the places were right , but only because it seemed that some sort of restraint was wanting . He is not greatly to be censured for this ; every liberal party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrow , in the same predicament . It seldom shines in the work of conservatism ; its former sayings and doings are thrown into its teeth , occasioning not a little confusion and woe . But with this seeming inconsistency , which in the case of Zwingle certainly was much to be deplored , nothing could he more liberal than Luther 's own personal feelings . To Hausmann , the pastor of Zwickau , who inquired concerning the bounds of evangelical liberty , he said ,  --  " Let each one follow his own lights , and each question his own conscience how to answer to the gospel . " The Moravians asked about the sacrament ; he replied , - " It is madness to be meddling with these matters , to the neglect of the precious concerns of salvation . " As to the worship of images , he says , - " Where faith and charity are , there can be no sin either in adoring or not adoring ; on the contrary , where faith and charity are not , there can not but be one enduring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - " They have been exhibited over and over again to all the world " ; as to purgatory , - " It seems to he a very doubtful matter . " When Spalatin asked for a ceremonial to be observed in mass , he replies , - " I implore you not to trouble yourself about small matters of this kind . " With regard to the elevation of the host , - " Do just as it pleases you . " This is the language of a man who saw that nothing compared in importance with religious character , and whose spirit could not move within the narrow circle of a party . It seemed to him that some church government was necessary to preserve unity and prevent excesses ; his own taste evidently leaned to what we delight to call Congregationalism , not so much , it would appear , from the expressiveness of the term , as from the pleasing melody of the sound . But , harassed // as he was by all manner of cares , and pressed by the force of circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience on the subject , he was obliged to move on in contradiction to his own advice , " not to throw away the old shoes till they had provided themselves with new . " Those which he snatched up hastily were at best but slippers , little suited to the purpose and sadly uneasy to the feet . The effect of being thus pinched was not favorable to his temper , and the chief stains on Luther 's great character grew out of this exclusiveness in systems , to which he resorted because they seemed necessary under the circumstances and at the time , while they were not the desire of his mind , not the true expression of his heart . While it is clear that in all this Luther was disinterested and fearless , there is no denying , that , to use the cant phrase of the day , he was " in a false position " ; for , on the one hand , he was maintaining the rights of liberty and conscience , and on the other , saying to those who took him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther . " But this was not from narrowness of understanding or selfish desire of power , but only because he saw more plainly than others the danger of excess , which might bring discredit on a holy cause , and put the Reformers in the wrong . His old friend Carlstadt , by applying the principles which be had learned of Luther , was plunging on before him . Munzer , too , was stirring up the multitudes to that demand of their rights which ended in the disastrous " Peasants ' war . " Seeing that they were taking the steps most likely to rivet chains and perpetuate oppression , Luther opposed them with severity ; but it should not be forgotten , that , when Carlstadt 's life was in danger , he came forward to shield him with the generous kindness of a friend . We can not like him the less for his moderation , a virtue which it is easier to despise than to understand or maintain ; we honor him for his unwillingness to wage an exterminating war against Rome , and even for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had no patience with those breakers of images , who , in their stupid zeal , were defacing churches , and destroying more than their necks were worth of the remains of ancient art . He resisted the violent suppression of religious houses , by which so many of the poor and helpless were thrown upon the world , xvhile the property became the prey of iron-fisted // robbers . His untenable theory of consubstantiation evidently grew out of a lingering , traditional regard for the Catholic views of the sacrament . But the other Reformers had no sympathy with these feelings ; they looked on him as standing in the way of the Reformation itself ; each one , therefore , poured out a vial of wrath on his head , and Luther , who was never slow in returning such compliments , defended his own position without any parade of respect for theirs . The people , however , who could not understand the necessity of metes and bounds , and thought they could not have too much of a good thing , took sides with his opposers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to fear , or some other unworthy reasons ; and for a time he lost influence , as the Corinthians , not much to their honor , were at one time persuaded by one of their number that St. Paul was not a Christian . There is something very interesting in the description of his retreat into private life . He married a beautiful girl , of noble birth , who had formerly been a nun . There had been some attachment between her and another man . Luther wrote to his rival , that Catherine had not yet overcome her regard for him , and that , if he would come and prevail with her , he could cheerfully see them united . Happily for him , he was not taken at his word , and the monk became a happy husband and father , though his resources for subsistence were at times exceedingly small . He employed himself in gardening and building a fountain ; to a friend he wrote , - " Come and be crowned with lilies and roses . " He interested himself also in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The turning-tools are come to hand ; I have enough for the present , except you meet with some newly invented ones which will turn of themselves , while my servant snores , or stares at the clouds . " It is pleasant to see his powerful spirit submitting to the refining influence of domestic affections ; pleasanter still to see that he practised the generous virtues as faithfully as when they brought him the world 's applause . When the plague entered his house , and all were sick within it , he took in those who were more unfortunate than himself , relieving the sick and adopting their fatherless children , while almost destitute of the means to support his own . Through all changes of joy and sorrow , and under the constant pressure of poverty , he was firm , genial , and unalterably 39* // kind . When he lost his daughter Madeleine , aged fourteen , his wife wept and lamented ; but he said to her , - " My dear Catherine , think where she is gone ; to a certainty she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that is our nature ; but the spirit exults , and finds all as it should be . " As his daughter lay before him , he exclaimed , - " I love her much ; but , 0 my God , if it be thy will to take her , I would give her up to thee without one selfish murmur . " When she was dying , he said , - " My dearest child , my own Madeleine , I know you would gladly stay with your father here , and you will be equally ready to go to your Father in heaven ; will you not ? " She answered , - " 0 , yes , dear father ; as God wills . " " Dear little girl , " he exclaimed , " the spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak . " He then walked up and down in a troubled manner , saying , - " Ah , yes ! I have loved this dear child too much . If the flesh is so strong , what becomes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he threw himself on his knees by her bedside , praying to God that he would spare her , till she expired in his arms . After her death , he said , - " My poor , dear little Madeleine , you are at rest now . " Then , looking long and fixedly at her , he said , - " Yes , dear child , thou shalt rise again ; thou shalt shine like a star , - yes ! like the sun ! I am joyful in spirit , but , 0 , how sad in the flesh ! It is a strange feeling this , to know that she is so certainly at rest , and yet to be so sad ! " We have given this affecting scene to show how the stormy controvertist bore himself in the quiet circle of home . It shows , that , rough and bold as he was , he abounded in manly tenderness , as faithful and contented in the bosom of his family as bold when blazing in the van of reform . Still , the suspension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an extent , that , when sickness had brought him to the edge of the grave , he was happy in believing that his last hour was come . Those men who are great in extended spheres do not always appear to equal advantage in a small one ; but Luther 's bearing in distressed and humble circumstances was to the full as honorable to him as those greater efforts and sacrifices which laid the foundation of his fame . It was found , on experiment , that Luther could do without the public better than the public could dispense with him . The course of reform , however unlike that of true love in // benignity , very much resembled it in the smoothness of it flow . In ordinary times it could spread quietly without any external agency to sustain it ; but when the clouds gathered and thunders began to roll , it needed his heart of flame and nerves of iron to confront the storm . The emperor seemed to be perfectly indifferent on the subject , except so far as his own interest was concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was C*esar 's than to give up what belonged to God . So long as only the Pope 's authority was endangered by the changes in Germany , he looked on with great *composure ; but when the mutual sympathy of the German princes began to threaten his own , his moral sense would not longer suffer him to rest . The only case of conscience which he was interested to determine was , to know which side it was most politic on the whole , to favor ; in other words , which was likely to prove strongest in the long run . Had Germany alone been his field of action , he would have taken side with the Reformers ; but as his politics emhraced all Europe , the friendship of the Roman court was too important to be surrendered . It would have been a great comfort to him , could he have frightened the Reformers into silence ; and on the whole , he thought it better to throw tufts of grass before he tried what virtue there was in stones . But he had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for as soon as a decree had been issued to carry into effect the sentence pronounced on Luther at Worms , and to prohibit future innovations in religion , a league of princes and free cities protested against it ; thus originating that word Protestant , which was then used for the first time , but which the world has since had opportunity to learn by heart . When Charles , in pursuance of his designs , had appointed a diet of the empire at Augsburg , Luther was the soul of the Protestant party . Being under censure , he could not be present , and Melancthon was the representative of the Protestant divines . But Luther was near at hand , and his inflexible firmness held together the elements of their association against all the force and fraud that were employed to dissolve them . Their enemy was desirous to divide and conquer , while many of the more sagacious Protestants were for sinking their differences to secure their common union . But Luther knew full well , that , at such times , the boldest counsels were the wisest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense // of danger was not to be trusted ; and that for each to speak his own opinion was the best way to reconcile them all . As to harmony between Catholics and Protestants , which was a fond vision of Melancthon , Luther told him plainly that it should take place only on condition that the Pope abdicated his throne . So much influence was exerted to entangle the Protestant councils , to make them responsible for the republicanism of Zwingle and the Swiss , and for the Anabaptist fanaticism , and to involve them in inconsistencies and contradictions , that nothing short of Luther 's fixed determination could have maintained that confidence and union which were indispensable to the success , and even the existence , of the party ; so that even his defects of character became serviceable to the great cause which it was the business of his life to maintain . " I care not , " he says , " about being accused of violence ; it shall be my glory henceforth to have it said how I rage and storm . For more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking them fairly . To what end ? Only to exasperate the evil . The clowns are but the haughtier for it . Well ; since there is no longer any hope of shaking their infernal resolutions with kindness , I break with them , and will leave them no rest from my curses till I sink into the grave . " This does not look precisely like the spirit of the gospel , it must be allowed . But he says , - " Yet do I keep towards all the world a kind and loving heart , and my greatest enemies themselves know it well . " In many persons this would have been self-blinded contradiction ; but in him it was really true , that his ungovernable energy , however furiously expressed , never overpowered the feeling of goodwill to men . There were haste and passion , at times , enough and to spare ; but nothing like malice and revenge was ever harboured in his breast . He told Melancthon , that , if he heard of his getting on badly , he should himself be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All danger he treated with contempt , saying , - " If the emperor is disposed to publish an edict , let him . " Accordingly , that potentate , whose patience grew somewhat threadbare at finding how little he was feared , prevailed on the diet to issue a decree which prohibited the future progress of reform . Luther did justice to Melancthon 's admirable character and bearing , saying to him , - " Rejoice and be comforted in your Saviour ! Man of longsuffering , raise up your drooping head , for your salvation draweth nigh . " // This movement on the part of the emperor tended more to provoke than to overawe the Protestants , or to restore the old religion . The chiefs who were thus threatened formed a coalition for their mutual security , not by the advice of Luther , who rigidly regarded the charge , " Put not your trust in princes , " whilst he disliked the resort to force in matters of religion . They were the more busy in this , because it was understood that Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luther termed him in his courtly way , had arranged a secret combination of Catholic princes , to which the emperor himself had acceded . Between this duke and Luther a constant interchange of compliments was passing , in which , it must be confessed , the grace and good manners are chiefly on the layman 's side . He earnestly exhorted Luther to repentance , while Luther replied , with little reverence , - " See our little prince ; and he would be respected , glorified , adored , withal ! Gramercy ! " The duke utterly denied the existence of any such association ; but the Protestant rulers assembled at Smalkalde , formed a league for their common defence , and made application to the kings of France and England for their aid and countenance , which those sovereigns , not from love of the Reformation , but from hatred of Charles , were quite ready to bestow . Luther was accused of having instigated them to this course ; he denied the charge , hut said , that , if they thought it their right or their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Whatever they did was all the same to him . Meantime , nothing was more proper than that the Papists should tremble at shaking leaves , and see phantoms of death and insurrection on every side . He intimated , that , if they should die of their fright , he should not be chief mourner . He made these declarations of his views and feelings in reply to an anonymous work , which he possibly ascribed to his friend Duke George , in which the Protestants were accused of conspiring against the Catholics , who were all for peace . He said , - " No one is to know the author of this work ; well , I will remain in ignorance too . However , I will try my hand and strike upon the sack ; if the blows should fall upon the ass that carries it , it will not be my fault ; they weVe , of course , intended for the sack alone . " As this Protestant coalition was formidable in itself , and secured to itself the aid of foreign sovereigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to have serious doubts of the justice of persecuting heretics and upholding the old religion . With France , and England , and Denmark threatening on one side , and the Turks entering Austria on the other , he saw the duty of toleration more clearly than ever before . He therefore entered into negotiation with the Protestant princes , in which he agreed that all processes against Reformers should be suspended , and that no one should thenceforth be persecuted on account of his religion ; very wise conclusions , whatever may have been the process by which he reached them . This prosperous result was primarily owing to Luther ; for , though he took no part in secular arrangements , and was opposed to the exertion of civil power in matters of religion , it was evidently his determination , and the spirit of firmness which he had breathed into the Reformers , which held them together in the face of danger , and enabled them to present a front so formidable and commanding . The Protestants were brave , through their sympathy with him ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an army , when they feel that they are fighting under their leader 's eye . It was quite obvious that Luther made himself enemies by resisting the popular tendencies , which he was expected to favor , because they grew out of an impulse which he had given to the public mind . But very little cared he for the expectations of other men , and having a clear head to discern the right , and a clear heart to follow it , he went on his way , like a decree of fate , leaving others to wonder , complain , or abuse him , as happened to suit them best . This was the case with the Anabaptists , as they were called , from their opposition to infant baptism ; though the name , as often happens , gives no idea whatever of their character and opinions . Some of them carried the principles of Christian liberty to a base and unprincipled excess , and claimed exemption from all moral restraints under the name of religious privilege , till they were lost in all manner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their proceedings , which was far from complimentary . As soon as their excitement began , he said , - " There was no spark so small , but that a fire might be kindled to consume the world , if the Devil was suffered to blow it . " Foreseeing the enormous crimes to which their tenets would lead them , he was ready to unite with any oth // ers to put them down . When one considers their entire rejection of all civil authority , their open defiance of law , their shameless self-indulgence , and the invitation which they held out to every one to follow his own impulses , however sensual they might be , it is not surprising that he should have disowned them with all earnestness , lest they should be identified with the Reformation , which was new and imperfectly understood . So , indeed , it happened ; it brought great reproach on that cause , where the truth was not known . Luther was held responsible for their fanatical excesses at the same time that they were denouncing him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be resisted and defied by all true-hearted Christians . But he did not fear these popular outbreaks , in which the name of reform was profaned , half so much as the injury which might come from entangling religious with political concerns , in which great zeal for Christianity is professed , while the interest of the parties is sure to carry the day . Whatever offers of patronage and protection were made on the one hand , whatever inflictions were threatened on the other , Luther held fast to his principle , with perfect indifference to their solicitations and warnings . When councils were held to reconcile the Protestants and Catholics , he knew how all such arrangements would end . When Melancthon , Bucer , and Pistorius met in conference with the Catholic divines at Worms , Luther spoke of it as a comedy which was likely to have a tragical close ; and it was found , on experiment , that , while there was a seeming approach to each other in doctrine , the effect of it was to them to cease from action till all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope indignant , as well he might be , at the proposal of a council which would take his business out of his bands . These results approved the wisdom of Luther 's course ; but when religion is once intertwined with worldly policy , it is not easy to separate the two . For the loss of his personal influence he does not appear to have been afflicted ; at all events , he was not the man to whine ; but he did feel strong doubts whether the work of reformation would be carried forward to victory , when " Satan , after being driven out , threatened to return in greater strength than before . " He // said , - " Nobles , citizens , peasants , I might add , almost all men , think they know the gospel better than Dr. Luther , or even St. Paul himself , and they look down on pastors , or rather on the Lord and Master of pastors . " " The nobles seek to govern , but know not how . The Pope knows how to govern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of governing than - I cry them mercy - ten of our court nohles . " It is evident enough that he despaired of seeing the accomplishment of the work which he had so triumphantly begun . " The world , " he said , " is like a drunken peasant ; put him up in his saddle on one side , he tumbles over on the other . The world will be the Devil 's . " Some one said to him , that , if the world were to last fifty years , many things might yet turn up . " God forbid ! " said Luther ; it would be worse than all the past . " These gloomy visions do not appear to have soured him so much as might have been supposed . He said , - " My only thoughts about the emperor and the empire are commending them to God in my prayers . " For himself , he had no desire to linger in life where there was nothing more for him to do . Those who wonder at so brave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppressed him ; the stone and vertigo are no laughing matters , and these , together with the oppression of his laborious warfare , constantly weighed him down . To the despondency originating in these complaints we may trace the impression which possessed him , that the end of the world was at hand . He said , - " I know more than you of the fatalities that await this age . The world is threatened with ruin ,  --  the more the Devil is allowed to go up and down , the more brutish the world becomes . There is but one consolation left us ; it is that the day is nigh . " " I think that our Saviour will soon come to real effects ; the day of judgment will soon put an end to our plans and purposes , and all other things . " " The world is in its old age , and at its last gasp , and is become delirious , as often happens with the dying . " At another time , he says , - " I do believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lord . Therefore , weak and failing as I am , and small as is the sound which I can make this world bear , my voice rings in the ears of the angels in heaven , who will take up the strain after us , and complete the solemn call . " Not only did he foresee this result , but // he seemed to long for it . One day , when conversing on the subject , he happened to have a chaplet of white agates in his hand . He said ,  --  " Good God ! come with the day of judgment ! God grant the day may soon come . I would eat this chaplet to have it come to-morrow . " The sun which rose in cheerful brightness was setting mournfully in tears . There is something extremely sad in the dreariness of his closing life . No man was ever more entitled to universal gratitude , and we feel as if a serene and happy evening should have followed such a hard and stormy day . But we find him saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be life . Had I known at the beginning what enemies men are to God 's word , I should certainly have been silent and held my peace . " " In the whole round of life , there is nothing which gives me pleasure ; I am sick of living . " When he was the last time at the table of the aged Electress , she wished him forty more years of life . He answered ,  --  " I would not have heaven on condition that I must live forty years lon*er . " " I have nothing to do with doctors now . It seems they have settled that I am to live about a year more ; so that I will not make my life a torment , but will eat and drink what I please . " " I wish my adversaries would put an end to me , for now my death would be of more service to the church than my life . " It must not be inferred from these expressions , that he was epicurean in the habits of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-denying . There was , doubtless , in all this something of the impatience of disease ; but making every abatement , it is a closing chapter in his glorious history which must awaken deep sympathy and regret in every reader 's breast . It ought not so to have been . Subjects and princes should have contended with each other for the privilege and honor of smoothing his pathway to the grave . It does not appear that his hopelessness of doing good ever induced him to suspend his labors in preaching or writing , which at every period of his life were very great . At the end of January , 1546 , he attended the conferences at Eisleben , where he preached four times , and revised the ecclesiastical statutes for the earldom of Mansfield . On the 17th of February , he was so ill that his friends begged him not to go out ; but he had strength to walk about the room . In the evening , he was conscious that he was passing away , // but he desired those about him to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he took a few steps about the room , when a cold perspiration came over him , which his friends hoped would relieve him ; but he knew it was a sign that death was nigh . He then prayed , in the words , - " 0 my God ! Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , thou , the God of all consolation , I thank thee for having revealed to me thy well beloved Son , in whom I believe , whom I have preached and honored ; who is persecuted by the Pope and the ungodly . I commend my soul to thee , 0 my Saviour , Jesus Christ ! I shall leave this terrestrial body ; I shall be taken from this life ; but I know that I shall rest eternally with thee . " After this effort , he fainted ; his friends succeeded with difficulty in restoring him . When one of them asked him if he died in firm reliance on the faith which he had taught , he answered clearly and distinctly , " Yes . " A mortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death was in his limbs , and with one deepdrawn breath he expired . The last will of the great Reformer is worth observing . It illustrates his manly and generous character , and casts a censure upon those who are induced , by the poor consideration of property and the spirit of a Tyrian age , to bequeath a dying insult to those whom they have professed to honor and love . He left his property to his " dear and faithful wife , " saying that he would not have her dependent on her children , but , on the contrary , thought it proper that her children should be dependent on her . It was right that they should be under her control , for he had often seen children , even pious children , when left independent of their surviving parent , refuse the respect and kindness which were due to the mother whom God had commanded them to obey . lie said , that , whatever her future destiny in life might be , he had not a shadow of doubt that she would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she might have ; nor had he any apprehension that she would ever injure those whom she had carried upon her breast . As she was the best manager of her children , he committed all with confidence to her hands . And lest the day might come , when , as was possible , she should be accused of withholding money for herself and not sharing it with them , he said , - " I pray all my friends to be witnesses of the truth , and to defend my // dear Catherine , if this should happen . I certify that we have neither ready money nor treasure of any kind . This need surprise no one , when it is considered that we have had no other income than my stipend and a few presents , and that we have gone to the charge of building , and have borne the expenses of a large household . I look on it as a particular mercy from God , which I thank him for without ceasing , that we have had suflicient for our wants , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn up some time before his death ; and whoever sees the inconvenience and suffering which often come from the criminal neglect to make a will , and the manner in which many indulge their caprice and selfishness in what should be the discharge of a solemn duty , will earnestly wish that the rights of the wife should be better secured by law , and that such examples as this should prevent her being treated with that want of confidence which is too often avenged by what Sir Thomas Brown calls " formal mourning , scenical sadness , and no wet eyes at the grave. ** In giving this slight sketch of the history of a man who is more generally known than understood , we can not say that we have been much indehted to the work before us , which is a fragmentary , or rather piecemeal , collection of scraps from Luther 's letters and other writings , connected by a slender thread of narrative , and not arranged in judicious order . But any account , however unedifying , must present the great features of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was great , was exceeded by his strength of heart . No man ever surpassed him in manly determination ; the greatest chiefs of armies never had more collected courage and decision ; when he was once sure of his ground , there was no power on the earth nor beneath it which could force him back a single inch from the place where he stood . His mind was one which took fast hold of the subject before him ; he saw it clearly and with sharp outlines from a single point of view ; and this concentration was more favorable , perhaps , to singleness of effort , than if , with more philosophical and extended comprehension , he had followed it in all its relations and bearings . He did not see t*hose objections which would make others ponder ; he had none of those intellectual doubts and misgivings which prevent many thoughtful minds from advancing . He knew that he meant to be // right , and he had no doubt that he was right ; after that , the suggestions of friends and the defiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elements to detain the steam-ship on her out-bound way . Had he been more enlarged in thought , and less a man of action , he could never have removed the mountains of power and prejudice which rose before him ; the dark mountains on which the feet of earlier Reformers had so often stumbled and been lost . We can not say , that , apart from the single subject to which he devoted his life , his views and opinions seem of the highest value . His conversation , as recorded , does not indicate an unusual grasp or profoundness of thought ; and the truth evidently is , that his mind was so much engaged in active service , that he had neither time nor heart for those more contemplative efforts which enlarge the boundaries of thought , and lead to those intellectual disclosures which illuminate the path of duty . His activity of mind , however , was unceasing ; and as he poured forth his writings in his mother tongue , instead of the classical language which was then generally employed by learned men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all his countrymen ; thus preparing the way for one of the most stupendous movements which this world ever saw , and which , though it had been prayed for , foreseen , and earnestly anticipated hy others , was carried forward to victory hy him alone . Most writers who have occasion to speak of Luther are apparently quite as much struck with his infirmities as with his virtues . But these infirmities did not lie deep in his character ; they affected his manners , perhaps , but were not in his day considered as any subject of reproach . Erasmus , with whom he had so much sharp controversy , said of Luther , that " his morals were unanimously praised ; and it was the highest testimony man could have , that even his enemies could find in them nothing to censure . " And when we find Luther wishing that he was " as eloquent and gifted as Erasmus , " it does not seem as if their severity in disputation came from the fountains of the heart . Melancthon , the highest possible authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiarly must allow that he was a most excellent man , " gentle and agreeable in society , not in the least obstinate nor given to disputation . If he ever showed any great severity in combating the enemies of the true doctrine , // it was from no malignity of nature , but from ardor and enthusiasm for the truth . " In these respects , he seems to have been very much like the English Johnson , who did not convey to those around him the same impression of stern roughness with which biographers have invested him , and who , with all his infirmities of temper and manner , will always , by his melancholy majesty , command the reverence of men . Like him , too , Luther was unbounded in his liberality to the poor , to whom he gave not only his money , but assistance of every description , particularly in maintaining their rights , when they were wantonly invaded . We find him declining favors offered by the Elector and other friends , saying , that , rather than accept so much kindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to apply to them in behalf of others . Under the afflictions of life , of which he suffered many , and , among others , " the serpent 's tooth " of having a thankless child , he maintained a grateful spirit , never insensible to what he enjoyed in his sorrow for that which was wanting . Besides the refining influence of these great and habitual virtues , he was no stranger to the graces of life . For musical taste and science he was eminent ; in reading and writing poetry he greatly delighted ; in all the elegant arts he was deeply interested , though he had not much leisure to give to them . It is clear that such a man courd not be the halfsavage he is sometimes represented . So far from it , he stands among the foremost of the sons of light ; but even the star , if it came down from its throne in heaven , would lose half its glory in the dust and darkness of the world below . The writer of this work acknowledges that his sympathies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reformers if it be so , he has certainly shown most unusual impartiality . But he could not be expected to enter into the spirit of the times , nor , indeed , to comprehend the character of Luther in its relation to the wants of his age . But in the present day , when the great Reformer has so many burlesque imitators , so superfluous and excessive in their ambition to be like him that they are in danger of making the world forswear philanthropy and reform so long as it lives , it may be well to afford mankind a true account of his powers and virtues , which certainly shows , that , with some occasional roughness of speech and manner , he was consistent and , what is more , universal in his kindness of heart . Let those who would be 40* // like him , then , avoid his failings , by recalling which they injure his memory . Let them imitate his manly courage and martyr-like self-devotion , never forgetting , that submission to the authority of conscience was the law of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in conflict with conscience was the great service which gave him glory in the sight of God and man . Surely , if he could maintain his genial kindness in times of violence and danger , it should not he hard to hold fast the crown of humanity in times when the Luther has only to suffer comfortably hy his fireside , when the greatest cross he has to hear is the world 's indifference , and when , though he longs for them as for hidden treasures , he can not find the least prospect of a martyr 's sentence and a bloody grave.
