Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : I. INVOCATION . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Spirit that dwellest in the opening flower , And bathest in the morning 's earliest dew ,  --  Thou that hast wings to hurry on the hour , And makest that lovely which were else but true ; Yielding fresh odor for the hungering sense , Teaching the zephyr mournful eloquence , And , when he brings his worship to the rose , That givest such heavenly sweetness to his tone , That fancy straightway deems it music 's own ! Come to me , spirit , from thy far domain  --  Fain would I , with a tenderness like thine , To her I love , of her I love , complain ; For she hath beckon 'd me to seek her shrine , Beholds me there , yet nothing heeds my pain . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : II . SYMPATHIES . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) I will breathe music in the little bell That cups this flower , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known ; Though hearts their secrets may not often tell , Mine is the charm to win them : I will wake Strains , which though new to men , they shall not fail To tremble as they hear ,  --  as an old tale , Will with new joy the absent wanderer take , Moving his spirit with a strange delight ! Love will I win from friendship  --  the old lure Will I make new , and all the new secure ; And beauty never thence shall fade from sight ! Think not I mock thee  --  spells of higher power Are gathered in the blue depths of this flower . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : III . TO THE SISTER OF MY FRIEND . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Sweet Lady ! in the name of one no more , Both of us loved and neither shall forget , Make me thy brother ,  --  though our hearts before , Perchance , have never in communion met ; Give me thy gentle memories , though there be , Between our forms some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ :  --  let me still , Whate'er the joy that warms me , or the thrill , That tortures , and from which I may not flee , Hold ever a sweet place within thy breast ! In this my spirit shall be more than bless 'd  --  And in my prayers ,  --  if , haply , prayer of mine Be not a wrong unto a soul like thine ,  --  There shall be blessings from the skies for thee . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : IX . SOLACE OF THE WOODS . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Woods , waters , have a charm to soothe thine ear , When common sounds have vex 'd it . When the day Grows sultry , and the crowd is in thy way , And working in thy soul much coil and care ,  --  Betake thee to the forests , in the shade Of pines , and by the side of purling streams That prattle all their secrets in their dreams , Unconscious of a listener ,  --  unafraid ,  --  Thy soul shall feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviving in thy heart , Shall bring thee the best feelings of thy youth , When in all natural joys , thy joy had part , Ere lucre and the narrowing toils of trade Had turn 'd thee to the thing thou wast not made . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : XI . FANCIES . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Here , on this bank of bruisd violets , That the crush 'd odor comes from , lay thee down , And listen to the silence , and leaves blown , Until thy overtask 'd , sad heart forgets The sleepless struggle of yon busy town ! There , every passion sickens ere ' t is spent , Here , others follow ere the first are done , Each , like its fellow , meetly innocent , Soul sweetening , and most easy to be won ! And woman !  --  thou shalt see her as at first , When , on a bank like this , in Eden sleeping , On sight of its lone habitant she burst , Suddenly bright , as heavenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurst . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : XII . THE WINDS . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) These are God 's blessed ministers , methinks , These winds that whisper to the heart subdued , So winningly , that still the sad ear drinks Their messages of mercy , and the mood Grows chaste and unresentful  --  while the blight Passes from off the spirit that , but late , Gloom 'd with the gloomy progress of the night , And spoke defiance to the will of fate .  --  Comforts they bring with the submissive thought That teaches , sorrow still is the best friend , And moves to bless the chastener , that has brought The heart to tremble and the knees to bend ,  --  Counselling that better hope , that born of fears , Is nursed in trembling and baptised in tears . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : XIV . HARBOR BY MOONLIGHT . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) The open sea before me , bathed in light , As if it knew no tempest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all green and bright , As if ' t were safe from carnage ever more ; And woman on the ramparts ; while below Girlhood , and thoughtless children bound and play As if their hearts , in one long holiday , Had sweet assurance ' gainst to-morrow 's wo :  --  Afar , the queenly city , with her spires , Articulate , in the moonlight ,  --  that above , Seems to look downward with intenser fires , As wrapt in fancies near akin to love ; One star attends her which she can not chide , Meek as the virgin by the matron 's side . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : XV . MEMORIES OF FANCY . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) This fairy vision gladdens us no more , As in our days of boyhood ;  --  it is gone , The glory which in fancy 's eye it wore , The crown of spiritual semblance it put on ,  --  The lustre and the holy tenderness ,  --  Appealing , as it were , to glimmering ties , Of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond our memory 's reach it lies . And yet , even now , these mellow smiles of light ,  --  That sad and sinking star  --  these silent woods , Sprinkled with gleams , that , as we gaze , take flight  --  Wake strange , sad thoughts , and still superior moods , And in the eyes that once they filled with joy , Tears gather ,  --  and the man is twice the boy ! Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : XXIII . VITALITY OF STATES . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Sudden , the mighty nation goes not down ;  --  There is no mortal fleetness in its fate :  --  Time ,  --  many omens  --  still anticipate The peril that removes its iron crown , And shakes its homes in ruins . Centuries Fleet by in the long struggle ; and great men Rush , mounted , to the breach where victory lies , And personal virtue brings us life again ! Were it not thus , my Country !  --  were this hope Not ours ,  --  the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cope With thy oppressors ,  --  vanity and crime  --  These ride thee , as upon some noble beast , The scoundrel jackal , hurrying to his feast . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : XXIV . HOME SERVICE . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Would we recal our virtues and our peace ? The ancient teraphim we must restore ; Bring back the household gods we loved of yore , And bid our yearning for strange idols cease . Our worship still is in the public way ,  --  Our altars are the market-place ;  --  our prayer Strives for meet welcome in our neighbor 's ear , And heaven affects us little while we pray . We do not call on God but man to hear ;  --  Nor even on his affections ;  --  we have lost The sweet humility of our home desires And flaunt in foreign fashions at rare cost ; Nor God our souls , nor man our hearts , inspires , Nor aught that should to God or man be dear . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancies ( 1845 ) Another yet , and still another height , And still the last most wearisome ; but hark ! Comes not , like bless 'd starlight through the dark , Smiling with soft but most effectual light , The confident look of hope , that cheers us still  --  Mocks at the toilsome waste of wood and hill , And with most sweet assurance of a joy , That waits and beckons at the cottage door , Takes off the oppressive toil , the day 's annoy , And teaches that the task will soon be o'er ,  --  Forgot in arms we love :  --  then , if we tell Of the day 's journey , wearisome and sad , Twill be , in thanks and blessings , that so well It ended ,  --  in a night so bright and glad . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : XXXII . LIGHT WITHIN . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Not wholly dark the darkness ! The shut eye Is but an intimation to the soul , That thenceforth spreads a wing without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beating its upward wing against the sky , Impatient of the invisible , and still , Catching such golden glimpses of the goal , As make new pulses to emotion thrill , And a new spirit waken ;  --  though denied Fruition of the promise , ' till that life , Which now makes upward flight a thing of strife , Yields to the better virtue in our gift ;  --  And we unclose an eye that makes us lift Vans mighty , that must bear us far and wide . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : XXXIII . SAME SUBJECT . LIGHT WITHIN. from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) And night is full of competence , and brings A presence to the soul that fills the hour , Else dark and vacant , with a native power , Which clothes the common thought with mightiest wings ; And we sail on with fancy , and in pride , To the dominion which is over earth ; And glorious spirits gather at our side , And fill the teeming echoes with rare mirth ,  --  Hopes born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taint ;  --  passions that still delight In excellence , and virtue 's better themes ;  --  That make all life one starlight to the sight  --  A realm of sweet re-union with the blest , Who leave their own to hallow thus our rest . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : XXXV . AMBITION . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Descend , ye dark brow 'd ministers of thought , Ye that are of the mountains ! In your shapes , Gigantic , I discern great shadows , wrought Like those which to my eyes have risen unsought , In midnight visions , and my soul escapes , Joyful , triumphant ,  --  borne aloft , along Your gloomy dwellings of the crag , with song , Whose thunder-tones have riven it , and yet roll , Subsiding , o'er the steeps of each far hill , That feels the ample voice and trembles still ! Descend , ye glorious phantoms , vast and strong ! Proud agents of the swift and sleepless soul , Whose ceaseless longings , not to be control 'd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : XXXV . AMBITION . ITS DANGERS . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Yet , is there danger , if , in that wild flight , That tongue forgets the spell-word ! If the soul Sinks in its terrors , and the aching sight Grows dim and dizzy ,  --  while the thunders roll , And the clouds thicken ! Bitter is the mock Of those dark spirits , bred of elements , That revel in the tempest , love its shock , And glory in the extreme and the intense ! Hurl 'd from their pinions down the eminence , They flout the impotent spirit that would dare Invoke the slaves it could not sway  --  assume The wand of power that , waved aloft , would scare The soul of its usurper ! Dread the doom , If heart , and voice , and eye , fail in that hour of gloom ! Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : XXXVI . SAME SUBJECT . AMBITION . ITS DANGERS. from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) And yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feebly striving . Not to die , Leaves him a puny clamorer for the state , Denied forever ,  --  evermore too high ; The scorn of all who mark the yearning eye Forever straining upward , with no wing The height to overcome , the space o'erleap , And pluck the sullen honors from the steep ! He toils amid the sterile hills of Time That mock him with delusions which still fly , Even as he seeks them , like th ' Arabian spring ;  --  Leaving a desert waste , a gloomy clime , A weary track before him , gloomier yet , Night stooping down in storm , and the bright sun long set . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : XLII . BEAUTY-VISIONS. from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) I saw it in my dream ! O ! could I task My sense again to slumber , nor awake So long as the dear vision were in sight ;  --  I will not do it so much wrong to make My rude words show the picture thou dost ask :  --  Behold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my utterance ! O ! I feel , In the devoted beatings of my heart , That I should look enjoyment , nor appeal To vain resource of language to impart This vision of a most rare happiness  --  That rapture , it would madden to reveal , Which song itself would render spiritless ;  --  It was such sweet , such sad , heart-touching tenderness . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : XLIII . SPIRIT-WANDERINGS. from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Ah , me ! that sleeping like Endymion , Upon a gentle hillslope , flow'r bestrewn , I could be laid to wait the coming moon , And her fresh smile , as some rich garment , don ! Let the winds gather round me , and the dell , That breaks into the valley , catch the sound , And , with its many voices , speed around The airy rapture , till the natural spell Rouse up the wood-nymphs to delight my sleep ; While she , my mistress , from her ocean cell , Ascends to the blue summits , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where blue eyed Nereids sport on ocean 's shell , And to old Triton 's conch , in long procession sweep . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : XLIV . GLIMPSES . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Upon the Poet 's soul they flash forever , In evening shades , these glimpses strange and sweet ; They fill his heart betimes  --  they leave him never , And haunt his steps with sounds of falling feet : He walks beside a mystery night and day ; Still wanders where the sacred spring is hidden ; Yet , would he take the seal from the forbidden , Then must he work and watch as well as pray ! How work ? How watch ? Beside him  --  in his way ,  --  Springs without check the flow'r by whose choice spell ,  --  More potent than " herb moly , "  --  he can tell Where the stream rises , and the waters play !  --  Ah ! spirits call 'd avail not ! On his eyes , Sealed up with stubborn clay , the darkness lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOVE THE PURIFIER. from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Lady , when o'er my heart thy smile was cast , Like moonlight o'er the waters ,  --  thou didst wake That passion of song within me which must last , Less for its own frail worth than thy dear sake . The muse thus hallows fond devotion 's pray'r , Though lowly ;  --  lifts the worshipper on high To mounts of song in the Olympian air , And makes earth pregnant with divinity . Love thus , itself , converts to excellence , Clay that was meanest ;  --  purges it of dross ; Lights the dull eye with raised intelligence , And makes a gain to good of evil 's loss . Thus hath that smile of thine uplifted me ; How can the heart be ill thus full of thee ! Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : L. DAWNINGS OF FANCY . CONTINUED . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Whose denies this wholesome , natural want , Endangers her existence ! She must bask Among the woods she rifles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hard command ,  --  and nap , Where nature yields her groves and matron lap ;  --  Where birds sing slumber , and the hunted doe , Assured of safety , stops awhile to pant ! Thus resting , she arises , prompt and strong , With eye all vigor ,  --  wing prepared to go , Rapt , heavenward , in the upward-gushing song !  --  Poised like the great sea-eagle in his state , Sovereign ' mongst rolling clouds , careering free Or , like the meeker lark , at heaven 's own gate , That , in her love , proclaims her liberty . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : LV . SYMPATHY WITH NATURE . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) We are a part of all we hear and see ,  --  We share in their existence  --  we are taught By what they suffer  --  with their feelings fraught ,  --  Are bound by their captivity , or free , In their fresh impulses ;  --  the earth , the air , Master us through our sympathies  --  we share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , From our own nature to a converse strange With other natures  --  to the rock and tree , The bird , and the sleek animal that glides Still happy in deep thickets . Thus we range , Capricious , still obedient to the tides That chide or soothe our streams , as winds impel the sea . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : LIX . FIRST LOVE . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Oh ! precious is the flow'r that Passion brings To his first shrine of beauty , when the heart Runs over in devotion , and no art Checks the free gush of the wild lay he sings ;  --  But the rapt eye , and the impetuous thought Declare the pure affection ; and a speech , Such as the ever-tuned affections teach , Delivers love 's best confidence unbought ;  --  And all is glory in the o'er-arching sky , And all is beauty in the uplifting earth , And from the wood , and o'er the wave , a mirth , Such as mocks hope with immortality , Declares that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turtle 's voice , the loudest in the land . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : LX . HEEDLESSNESS. from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) We see the flow'r decaying as we pass , Pale with the coming cold , and , on the grass , Write ruin , with our footsteps , every hour , Yet pause not in our progress , though a pow'r , As much superior to ourselves , as we To these dumb suff'rers of the predestined earth , Beholds us rapidly passing from our birth , To a like ruin with the things we see ; And , from our side , as little heeded , goes , Drawn by invisible cords , the treasured thing That has our heart , in keeping ;  --  yet we sing As idly as if life were free from foes , And love were sure ' gainst danger ;  --  there is one , Who , speaking near me now , of death , is heard by none ! Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : XLIII . SONNET AT TONGEVILLE. from Grouped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to thy courts the robin comes Still cheerily chirping ,  --  and the gipsy throng That , in the thorny thicket , hourly hums In noon-day yellow , with a thoughtless song That stirs with spleen the mockbird , ' till he pours , Beneath thy very eaves , such resolute strain , As takes the voice from nature , nor restores , ' Till he has pleased to yield her ears again ;  --  If these surround thy footsteps , nor complain ;  --  If , in thy walks , the timorous dove appears , Timorous no longer , nor inclined to flee ;  --  If these unharmd ones thus speak with me ,  --  Thou hast an evidence that nobly cheers , And with no scruple I award it thee . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : LXIV . DESPONDENCY OF AMBITION . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Thou wilt remark my fate when I am dead , Let not fools scoff above me , and proclaim , That I had vainly struggled after fame , ' Till the good oil of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fell Into the yellow leaf before my time ; A sacrifice , even in my earliest prime , To that which thinn 'd the heavens and peopled hell ! How few will understand us at the best , How few , so yield their sympathies , to know , What cares have robb 'd us of our nightly rest , How stern our trial , how complete our wo ,  --  And how much more our doom it was than pride , To toil in devious ways with none who loved beside . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : LXVII ATTICA. from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Sterile but proud , beneath her own blue sky , Sleeps Attica , there bounded by the sea , There by Euboea ; yet how boundless she , In sole dominion ; with her realms that lie , Wherever winds can wing , or waters bear The proofs of her great magic ;  --  magic wrought , By genius , on the stern and shapeless thought , Which thenceforth took a form that can not fear Whatever Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the God , Still from the eminence sends her breath abroad Spelling the nations with her soul alone ; The soul that makes soil sacred , and from earth , Triumphant plucks the doom of death that came with birth . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : LXIX . TO DEPARTING FRIENDS . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) The friends that still would keep thee from thy home , Yet pray that when thou leav'st them , winds may be Meek and submissive ; and the ocean foam Unroused by tempests ; and the obedient sea , A docile steed that needs no spur to goad , Nor yet the anxious leash which Terror 's hand Grasps , doubting , lest , all reckless of command , The untamed creature flies the appointed road ! Skies favor thee and fortune  --  keep from ills ,  --  Make thee to reach thy haven and embrace The pillars of thy ancient dwelling-place ,  --  Hear all the well-known voices of thy hills , And those that , prattling up from new-found rills , Grow happier , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1806-1870 : LXX . THE BROKEN HEART . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Weave me , sweet minstrel , into gentlest song , The story that I bring thee , of a maid , Who , blessing earth with beauty , did not long Withhold from heaven the treasure that it pray 'd ; She died , ' t is said , for love of one whose heart , Wanton as winning , did from hers withdraw , When that , persuaded of his faith by art , She knew no other life , no other law ; And while all wondering , worship 'd ,  --  he , alone , Mock 'd at the holy truth that never err 'd , Save once , when by his baleful homage won , Him , o'er all others , hapless , she prefer 'd ! She died of heart-break ,  --  though , what earth has riven , If loving truly , is made whole in heaven . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : LXXI . INSENSIBILITY. from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To know not , though the treasure near us lies ; Love 's treasure , first and dearest ,  --  which the skies Vouchsafed , when earth had lost all right to bliss ; The treasure of a true heart ; which , to roof Lowly brings life ;  --  and , when all fortune spent , Cheers with devotion and the sweetest proof , So that the sufferer freshens with content ; And , in the desolation at his door , Sees but the sweet security of all , Which , lost to hapless Adam at the fall , Eden regained , had left possession poor ! Yet daily , in our blindness , we rush on , Though hearts around us cry imploring to be won . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : LXXII . ATTRIBUTES OF LOVE . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) If Love had not an understanding eye , If Love 's eye had not comprehensive speech , If Love were not a thing of memory , Or if to aught but Love , Love aught could teach , How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much fond speech were thrown away on thee ; How much have both remember 'd bootlessly , How much have others seen , who should not see ; How profligate our hearts of moments wasted ; How vain the fond expectancies that led ; How wild the dreams whose raptures sleep untasted ; How sad the sweet delusions which have fed ; The hearts whole being from this danger shrinks ! Yet Love is no such profligate , methinks ! Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : LXXIV . DESIRE AND FRUITION . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Three children play 'd beneath a spreading tree , In an old garden ,  --  a secluded clime , With orange laden , citron and the lime :  --  Two were twin-children , and the first who came Men called Desire ; the second bore Love 's name ; The third , Enjoyment ,  --  sweetest of the three ! How strove the twins then for his young embrace , With panting heart , wild eye and eager face ; But , delicate by nature , in the strife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ! Then fell the two that once had loved , apart , And knew no more each other ;  --  then a gloom , Settled upon the garden , while each heart Grew cold , and Joy 's first birth-place was his tomb . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : LXXV . LIFE IN LOVE . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Oh ! what is there of magic in the name , That thus my heart should tremble ,  --  though long years Have pass 'd , since , following that delusive flame , I learn 'd how little profit came from tears ,  --  How great the shame of weakness , what the scorn Of power , at meek devotion ,  --  and , how vain , When pride finds pleasure in bestowing pain , To hope that nobler feelings may be born In the tyrannic bosom !  --  Shall it be , That , from the passion which has brought me shame , The sacrifice of human hope and fame , The Fates deny my spirit to go free ? Ah ! wherefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  since he lives alone who loves ! Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : LXXVII . THE SAME SUBJECT . THE SPIRIT OF INTELLECTUAL ART. from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Thy thought , but whisper 'd , rises up a spirit , Wing 'd and from thence immortal . The sweet tone , Freed by thy skill from prisoning wood or stone , Doth thence , for thine , a tribute soul inherit ! When from the genius speaking in thy mind , Thou hast evolved the godlike shrine or tower , That moment does thy matchless art unbind A spirit born for earth , and arm 'd with power , The fabric of thy love to watch and keep From utter desecration . It may fall , Thy structure ,  --  and its gray stones topple all ,  --  But he who treads its portals , feels how deep A presence is upon him ,  --  and his word Grows hush 'd , as if a shape , unseen , beside him heard Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : LXXVIII . THE SUBJECT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) At every whisper we endow with life , A being of good or evil ,  --  who must , thence , Allegiance yield to that intelligence , Which , calling into birth , decreed the strife , Which he must seek forever ! The good thought , Is born a blessd angel , that goes forth , In ministry of gladness , through the earth Still teaching what is love , by love still taught ! The evil joins the numerous ranks of ill , And , born of curses , through the endless years , ' Till Time shall be no more , and human tears Dried up in judgment ,  --  must his curse fulfil ! Dream'st thou of what is blessing or unblest , Thou tak'st a God or Demon to thy breast ! Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : LXXIX . THE BEAUTY OF DEPARTING OBJECTS . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) How beautiful , thus fading from the eye , Are the sweet things we scarcely saw before ; Scenes that , ' till now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they , fleeting evermore ; We feel , too late , our blindness and would buy From memory , all that memory can restore ! Thus , the o'erburthen 'd form , as on the bed Of Death , and the last trial , it reposes , New freshness feels in all around it spread , And finds new sweetness in the leaves and roses . ' Till now there had been nothing in the things , Most precious near us , and our eyes unfold , Even as they close forever , to behold How dear the gifts of home our blindness from us flings . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : LXXX . THE PURITANS . ON SEEING WEIR 'S NATIONAL PICTURE from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Men were ye !  --  fearless and strong hearted men , Firm in endurance , resolute for right , Ready to beard the Lion in his den , And , slow to conflict , slower still in flight ! I heed not of your bigotry , that grew From a too-easily persuaded self ;  --  Nor yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slender gains might prompt that too ! But ye were men !  --  brave , earnest , whole-soul 'd men , Forever battling in the good old cause , Of man !  --  his rights , his liberties and laws , And , over all , his progress ! Be it then , Your glory to have struggled through the strife , Renewed , and sure of still-renewing life . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : LXXXI . BUNKER HILL MONUMENT . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) The record should be made of each great deed , That brings unnumbered blessings for its fruits , So , that , while gazing on the vigorous shoots , Our children may possess the generous seed ; Nor , aught forgetting of the glorious past , Lay good foundations in the future 's womb ; So , when the hardy sire descends at last , The emulous son shall still defend his tomb ! Thus chronicled , the mighty deed begets Still mightier ,  --  and the column that mounts high , Where brave souls met to conquer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgets , And joys if he can emulate ! Thus stand , Gray , granite speaker , still , to glad and guide the land . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : LXXXII . THE FALL OF WARSAW . from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Thy sun has set , and yet the sun shines on , Sad City !  --  not a ray obscured , and bright , As on the eve before thy hope went down In blood , and battle , and o'erwhelming night ,  --  And thou wert made a ruin , shrunk in blight ,  --  Not by thy foes alone !  --  but traitors too Were there to thwart , if not to shame , the few , Who , to the last sad hour , maintained the fight ; And clung to the red ashes of their land , As to a mother 's grave ,  --  nerved by a strength Which , though defeated and subdued , at length , Proves nobly what the soul of man may do , Cheer 'd , by a generous hope , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds more true . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : LXXXIII . THE PEACE OF THE WOODS from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Thou hast enamor 'd me of woodland scenes , Good shepherd , for thou show'st them with an air Of truth , to win even wilder hearts to hear , Than his who sits beside thee ,  --  and thus gleans Thy secret from thee of true happiness , Inbred content and quiet humbleness , That can not be o'erthrown by rising high , And vexeth not the glance of envious eye . They blessings are of that serener kind , Which , as they rouse no passions up , must be , Lik 'd to that breeze benign that strokes the sea , ' Till it subsides in murmurs . No rude wind Disturbs thy world 's smooth waters , and defames The glory of its peace , with its unreasoning storms . Simms , William Gilmore , 1806-1870 : LXXXIV . THE ANCIENT RIVULET. from Grouped thoughts and scattered fancies ( 1845 ) Sit thee beside me for awhile , and rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear , As yon sly brooklet sends up to the ear Its chaunt of murmurs , like a strain repress 'd By sobbings of the heart that pours it out !  --  I mind me , friend , that it is now about Some thirteen summers , since I laid me down Beside this little streamlet , as I left , Grieving with boyhood 's heart , my native town ! To this I now return ,  --  of youth bereft , And thorns about my head in place of crown . Then all was , " lo ! the triumph ! " in my breast , My thought , heart , eye , on one achievment set ; Now ! all is changed save this poor rivulet.
