txt OF all the men who have presented themselves to the world , none have exposed themselves so entirely to the public gaze as Horace Walpole . The portrait of an artist by himself is always open to suspicion ; and of all biographies , autobiographies are the least reliable . It is not in Walpole 's Meinoirs that we find his likeness , but in his Letters ; and these give as perfect a reflection of an individual mind as the entire circle of literature can produce . And yet , though Horace Walpole held the torch in his own hand which revealed the most secret windings of his nature , no man has ever had the misfortune to be so often misunderstood and misrepresented by others . We merely see the profile of other men , but we look him full in the face . Paradoxical as it may appear , we think that the main reason of his being so little understood is owing to the undisguised manner in which he presents himselfarousing our suspicions that there must be some trickery about him . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors ; as rogues or saints ; him we see as a veritable man , and we know not what to make of him . He is like the man who stood on London Bridge all day with a golden guinea in his hand , which he offered to sell for a shilling , but could find no purchaser , although he made the most solemn protestations that the guinea was a good one . Nobody would believe him . Neither will anybody believe Horace Walpole . Not because he attempts to conceal anything , but because he reveals everything . His very candor creates a doubt of his sincerity . The Quarterly *Reviexv has contained two long and elaborate articles on his life ; and , in the last , the reviewer winds up by declaring that he can make nothing out of him . Lord Byron , in the preface to one of his poems , says , " it is the fashion to underrate Ilorace Wal pole because he was a nobleman and a gentleman ; but , to say nothing of his incomparable letters and the Castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of the Mysterious Mother , a tragedy of the highest order , and not a puling love-play ; he is the father of the first romance and the last tragedy in our language , and surely worthy of a higher place than any living author , be he who he may . " It is only necessary to remember a portion of the authors living when this extravagant eulogy was penned , to see its absurdity ; but , extravagant as the praise of the poet is , it is not more undeserved than the depreciating notices which are uttered almost every day by critical journals , on both sides of the Atlantic , on the same subject . Walter Scott , in his slight sketch of Walpole in the Lives of the Novelists , has shown a genial appreciation of his genius , and awarded to the Castle of Otranto , of which he must be considered a competent judge , all the merit to which it is entitled . In one word , he allows the author of it to be a man of genius ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only true interpretation of a work of genius is , that it can not be repeated . Any work that can be copied is not the genuine production of a genius . All attempts to reproduce it will bear the same resemblance to it that a Chinese fire does to the sun , or a Bengola light to the evening star . But while Scott makes a just critical estimate of Walpole 's merits as a romancer , he gives a strangely perverted view of his character , looking at the outside of the man% ; like the feminine Miss Hawkins , who described so accurately the bemming* of his ruffles , the colur of his hai*ds , * and other little externals likely to fill the eye of an observing lady . But . when Scott wrote his biographical sketch of Walpole , he did not possess* * The Letters of Horace Walpole , Earl of Orford ; including numerous Letters now first published from the Original Manuscripts . Philadelphia : Lea &amp; Blanchard . 1842. 8vo. , pp. 576 . Essays , Critical and Miscellaneous . By T. Babington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pp. 1640. 353 // half the materials for forming a just estimate of his character that we do at this day , although he had enough to enable him to judge more accurately of the quality of his mind . Like every other writer on this subject , he echoes the cry of Walpole 's aristocracy , as though he had been the incarnation of that principle , and the only one in England . Many men are aristocrats in their personal habits who are thoroughly republican , or even democratic in their principles ; we see many in stances of this , as well as the reverse of it , in our own country . Walpole was thoroughly democratic in his feelings , but he was , perhaps , " aristocratic " in his tastes . All his relations and friends belonged to the highest classes-must he turn his back upon them because they were high-born , if they were deserving of esteem He certainly paid no respect to rank in any instance , and those unlucky wights who received the largest share of merciless ridicule were the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second and his own uncle and cousin ; the last of whom he has immortalized under the name of Pigwiggin . Scott , though a plebeian born , was the rankest aristocrat in the world , but his good nature and generousheartedness made the qualities which in others would be hateful , in him amiable . He wept over parliamentary reform Walpole , with all his aristocracy , would have illuminated Strawberry Hill with wax-candles on such an event . But we have never met with anything so badly eloquent on horace Walpole as Macaulay 's essay in the Edinburgh Review . It is a curiosity . It is an echo of all the vulgarities that have been uttered on his character since he first appeared as an author . He is a literary Cellini , who has picked up all the false brilliants he could find in pawnbrokers ' shops , and , by resetting them , has made them valuable articles . It may be presumption , awful presumption , in us to criticise Mr. Macaulay ; but we are rather inclined to daredevilism of opinion , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assert our independent integrity of thought , by a free declaration of our opinion , even though we should chance to differ from those of the popular Edinburgh Reviewer . " The faults of Horace Walpole 's head and heart are indeed sufficiently glaring , " begins Mr. Macaulay ; and the same may be said of every man that ever lived ; everybody 's faults but our own do , indeed , glare upon us with sufficient strength . " His writings , it is true , rank as high among the delicacies of intellectual epicures as the Strasburg pies among the dishes described in the Almanach des Gourmands . But , as the pdt*-defoie-gras owes its excellence to the diseases of the wretched animal that furnishes it , and would be good for nothing if it were not made of livers preternaturally swollen ; so , none but an unhealthy and disorganized mind could have produced such literary luxuries as the works of Walpole . " We are certainly at a loss to conceive which of Walpole 's works can bear such a comparison as this , unless it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the product of an unhealthy and disorganized mind , then every work of the imagination must bear the same reproach . Indeed , if we are not deceived by our memory , Mr. Macaulay declares , in another place , that all poets are insane , and all imaginative writers must , of course , be like the unhappy bird that produces the Strasbourg pdt*s ; an argument that we do not intend to question ; but we do not see the propriety of marking an individual with the peculiarities which belong to a species . Doubtless every man who lives not in the state most agreeable to the laws of Nature has an unhealthy and disorganized mind ; but Mr. Macaulay tries Walpole not by natural laws , but by the monstrously artificial regulations of the society in which he lived ; and calls him unhealthy because he had a more temperate pulse than his neighbors . Horace Walpole was an abolitionist before Clarkson and Wilberforce were heard of ; he was a teetotaller when it was no disgrace to a bishop to get drunk ; he was a Peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation , and men fought for the mere love of fighting ; he was a republican , a democrat even , before the French revolution was dreamed of ; though the son of a prime minister , he ridiculed royalty and laughed at kings ; though thirty years a member of parliainent , he never deserted his party nor accepted a place or pension from // government ; though a peer of the realm , he neither took his seat in the House of Lords nor made use of his title ; he was opposed to capital punishment , in an age when human life was so lightly thought of that men were hung if they stole enough to pay for a halter . These are strong evidences , it must be allowed , of a diseased mind , since the same things certainly could not he said of any of his contemporaries . " His mind was a bundle of inconsistent whims and affectations , " continues Mr. Macaulay . " His features were covered by mask within mask . When the entire disguise of obvious affectation was rcmoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real man . He played innumerable parts , and overacted them all . When he talked misanthropy he out-Timoned Timon . When lie talked philanthropy he left IJoward at an immeasurable distance . " What Mr. Macaulay means by his playing innumerable parts is not easy to understand , since Walpole was , in his public life , the most constant and consistent man of his time ; and , in his private life , he was simply a gentleman living on his income and devoting his leisure to publishing books and collecting rare works of art . But he wrote letters , and he had among his correspondents people of widely different characters . He also had the happy faculty of adapting his style to the tastes of those to whom he wrote , while he preserved his idiosyncrasy of expression ; and , perhaps , this is what Mr. Macaulay means by his acting many parts . We see no reason why a man should not be a misanthropist and a philanthropist , without being charged with affectation , for the characters of all men do in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of nothing in the character of Walpole which should entitle him to the charge of misanthropy . There is certainly nothing in his works that sounds like an affectation of it , unless we take his ridicule of the vices of men for a hatred of men themselves . But his letters are full of the broadest and kindliest expressions of good-will towards humanity , and he seems never to have neglected an opportunity of doing a kindness without regard to the quality of the person who needed his assistance . In a letter to Sir Horace Mann , while he was comparatively a young man , he says : CC We , the British Senate , that Temple of Liberty , and bulwark of Protestant Christianity , have , this fortnight , been considering methods to make more effectual that horrid traffic of selling negroes . I would not have to say that I voted for it for the continent of America . " Nearly twenty years after this he offered to divide his fortune with his friend General Conway , when that excellent man had been deprived of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did this in a way so generous and affectionate that the manner of doing it seemed of more worth than the gift offered . So too , some time after , when poor , old , blind Madame du iDeffand lost the greater part of her pension by the financial difficulties of the French nation , he offered to make good her loss , or rather begged her to accept the sum from him , not as an evidence of his friendship for her , but as a proof of the sincerity of her esteem for him . In a letter to Bentley , he says : CC f was reading the other day the Life of Col. Coddington , who founded the Iibmary at All Souls : he left a large estate in Barbadoes for the propagation of the Gospel , and ordered that three hundred negroes should be constantly employed upon it . Did one ever hear of a more truly Christian charity , than keeping up the Gospel 's estate ? How could one intend a religious legacy , and miss the disposition of that estate for delivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Must devotion be twisted into the interests of trade ? " Speaking of the taking of Quebec , when the whole nation was mourning the death of Wolfe , and rejoicing in his victory , he says : " It was a very singular affair , the Generals on both sides slain , on both sides the second in command . In short , very nearly what battles should be , where only the principals ou0ht to suffer . " Sterne 's beautiful picture of Uncle Toby and the Fly , which has softened many a hard nature , was a daily fact in the life of Walpole . In one of his letters he says : " I met a single officer at his house t' other day , who said he knew such a person was turning methodist ; for , in the middle of conversa // tion he rose , and opened the window to let out a moth . I told him I did not know the methodists had any principles so good , and that I , who certainly am not on the point of becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kindliness of disposition , his hatred of oppression and bloodshed , and sympathy with suffering , which led him to oppose the persecution of Admiral Byng , and dictated the touching defence of the brave old sailor contained in one of his letters . In another letter lie writes : " In London there is a more cruel campaign than that waged by the Russians . The streets are a very picture of the murder of the innocents-one drives over nothing but poor dead dogs . The dear , good-natured , sensible creatures ! Christ ! How can anybody burt them ? Nobody could but those Cherokees , the English , who desire no better than to be ballooed to blood : one day , Admiral Byng , the next , Lord George Sackyille , and to-day the poor dogs . " On the breaking out of war with France , he indulges in a strain of eloquent and unaffected lamentation on the horrors that must follow , worthy the tender soul of Cowper ; and says that he would not gain another Marlborough for the nation at the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of philanthropy of which Mr. Macaulay speaks . This is what he means when he speaks of his leaving Howard at an immeasurable distance , and if he spoke in earnest , we might , perhaps , be inclined to argue with him . Howard only aimed at making prisoners comfortable , but Walpole would have abolished prisons and set their inmates free . " He scoffed at Courts , and kept a chronicle of their most trifling scandal . The conformation of his mind was such that whatever was little seemed to him great , and whatever was great seemed to him little . Serious business was a trifle to him , and trifles were his serious business , " - continiies Mr. Macaulay . But in what way could a scoffer at courls prove his sincerity more positively than by chronicling their scandal ? Where would Mr. Macaulay look for court scandal at the present day , in the Court Journal or the opposition press It* is true that Walpole , in some of his letters , gives the scandalous occurrences of the Court , but it is always done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not from admiration of them . It would not be strictly proper to accuse the editor of the Newgate Calendar of a reverence for malefactors because he chronicles their doings . He thus excuses himself to one of his correspondents for dealing so often in what Mr. Macaulay calls court scandal : - " I believe I tell you strange rhapsodies ; but you must consider that our follies are not only very extraordinary , but our business and our employment ; they enter into our politics , nay , I think they are our politics , and I do n't know which are the simplest . " It is not an easy matter to distinguish what is great from what is little in a country where the first Lord of the Treasury is formally waited upon by a Cabinet Minister to request the premier to order another minister , a " noble Lord , " not to hiss an opera dancer . When the interests of a nation are en trusted to the keeping of such a gro .. tesque buffoon as the Duke of Newcastle , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is little and what is great ; and if Walpole had sometimes mistaken a trifle for a serious matter , he would have done no more than what the great majority of his countrymen did in his own day , and have been doing ever since . But in troth he made fewer mistakes of this kind tItan any man of his generation . Whatever affected the happiness of a human being was a serious matter to him , but no pomp or pretension could elevate the tom-fooleries of " noble lords , " above the dignity of a trifle in his eyes . He was a genuine Iconoclast . It mattered not how beautiful an idol might be , he hurled his brick .. bats at it , and if it were not smashed , the fault was not his . A man may do small things from great motives ; and a hero may romp with his children or quarrel with his tailor , without a loss of dignity with the world . The common necessities of our nature affect all men alike ; generals , statesmen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " noble lord " will make a wry face at the toothache , and a cabinet minister must fain laugh when he is tickled . These well-understood facts seem to be forgotten by Mr. Macaulay , when he looks at Horace Walpole . He will // not forgive him for being familiar . He has a grudge against him for allowing himself to be seen in his night-cap and slippers . He never considers that these letters of Horace Walpole 's were all private ; that not one of them was ever intended to be read except by the person to whom it was addressed ; that many were written in ill health , that all were written in a hurry ; that they were mostly addressed to intimate friends , who knew what was intended for raillery and what for earnest ; hut he falls afoul of them as though they were philosophical essays , and condemns the writer for uttering a hon mot with the same air that he reproves Bacon for taking a bribe , lIe says " He had , it is plain , an uneasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Walpole does not condemn his pursuits . He seems to have had an uneasy consciousness that some person like his reviewer , would at some time misrepresent his motives , and in several places he has taken the trouble to justify himself from a charge of trifling seriously , by letting it appear that he trifled on purpose and for an object : and that he was not selfdeceived , as all triflers are . The Meinoirs of the courts of George I. and II. , which he wrote in his seventyfirst year , might be considered a piece of trifling if he had offered no apology for it . " Trifling I will not call myself , " he says , to the ladies for whose amusement he wrote , " for while I have such charming disciples as you are to inform , and though acute or plodding politicians , for whom they are not meant , may condemn these pages , which is preferable , the labor of an historian who toils for fame and for applause , he knows not from whom , or my careless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut penned for such a pair of sensible and cultivated minds as I never met at so early an age , and whose fine eyes I do know will read with candor , and allow me that mite of fame to which I aspire 3 " " He scoffed at literary fame , and left fair copies of his private letters to be published after his decease ; at rank , and never for a moment forgot that he was an Honorable , " continues Mr. Macaulay . But he does not scoff at literary fame . His works contain nothing that can be tortured into such a meaning . He very justly ridicules the vanity of authors and learned men , and scoffs at the absurd airs which bookish dunces give themselves ; and in a letter to Hume , thus expresses himself : " In truth , there is nothing I hold so cheap as the generality of learned men ; and I have often thought young people ought to be made scholars lest they should grow to reverence learned blockheads , and think there is any merit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as there are a thousand nonsensical books for one good one , must be the case of any man that has read much more than other people . " As for his letters , he did not keep copies of them , but when those he had written to Sir Horace Mann were returned to him , he caused them to be copied into a book , . and directed in his will that they should be published on a certain contingency happening after his death . But it was not necessary to instance this fact to show that Walpole was not indifferent to literary fame , although it helped the Reviewer to an antithetical sentence ; the fact that he had published books during his life at his own expense was enough . To say that he never forgot for a moment that he was an Honorable , is wicked enough , when he inherited the title of an Earl but never used it , and even objected to what he called the Gothicism of Mister ; desiring to be called plain Horace Walpole . Who ever heard him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambassador in France , the Queen , hearinr that Lady Walpole was a FrenchworA*tn by birth , asked her to what family she belonged 3 Aucune , she replied . Upon which her nephew declares , that though she is the daughter of a stay-maker , she is more truly noble than any member of his family . " To decorate a grotesque house with pie-crust battlements , to procure rare engravings and antique chimney-boards , to match odd gaunilets , to lay out a maze of walks within five acres of ground , these were the grave employments of his long life . From these he turned to poliucs as to an amusement . And having indulged in the recreation of making laws and voting millions , he returned to more important pursuits . " This exquisite bit of raillery is probably founded on a playful passage in a // letter to Bentley , the artist , or upon some other jocose expression- " But to leave politics and change of ministries and come to something of real consequence ; I must apply you to my library ceiling , &amp;c. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really a serious business . Walpole caused a revival of what is called Gothic architecture , by converting the little villa of Mrs. Chenevix , at Strawberry Hill , into a miniature baronial castle . It was a pretty absurdity in him , done half in jest and half in earnest , and though we do not ourselves think that the world has any great cause of gratitude for the example he set it , the world itself thinks differently . Before his piecrust battlements were half completed , his little toy shop had become famous , and persons came all the way from France to look at it . People stared and wondered . Gothic architecture immediately became a passion with builders , and Gothic castles and Gothic churches began to spring up all over England and America like gourds . Our streets and the banks of our rivers are dotted over with tiny Gothicisms and pie-crust battlements , like a chessboard . Every jobber who retires from Pearl Street or Front Street to a high hill in the country , can not content himself with anything less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of Gothic hen-coops and corn-cribs ; and every Unitarian or Baptist meeting must have its Gothic tower and embattIed roof , as though it were built with an expectation of being converted into a fortress . All these follies , including the costly absurdity at the head of NI/all Street , owe their existence to Horace Walpole 's pie-crust battlements . But more than all of these ; more hideously ridiculous , is a proposed Gothic monument to Washington . If this disgrace should ever be inflicted upon us , it will owe its existence to the same cause . In naming Strawberry Hill it is not easy to forget Abbotsford . They are something similar in design , but how different the causes from whence they sprung . Walpole 's villa was built as a recreation , in a kind of mockery of the past ; Scott 's was the most earnest undertaking of his life ,  --  a serious attempt to act over in reality the barbarisms of a half savage period . It is the most melancholy history in the April , world . Strawberry Hill never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least suffei ing in a human being . What heartaches , what distresses , grew out of the stone gimcrack at Abbotsford ! In his efforts to sustain it , the great genius of his age ruined his fortunes , brought premature old age and death to himself , and involved his friends in his own ruin and fall . Talk of trifles ! NI/hat a doleful piece of trifling was Scott 's whole life , if any credit can be allowed to his biographer . " The author of the Lay , " says Mr. Lockhart , " would rather have seen his heir carry the Banner of Bellenden gallantly at a foot-hall match on Carter Haugh , than he would have heard that the boy had gained the highest honors of the first university in Europe . His first and last worldly ambition was to he himself the founder of a distinct branch ; he desired to plant a lasting root , and dreamt not of personal fame , but of long distant generations rejoicing in the name of Scott of Abbotsford . To this ambition we owe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightest meridian of his genius and his fi*me ; this was his beau ideal . " NI/bat a bitter satire upon the great genius whom the world delights to honor ! " It pleased him , " continues Mr. Macaulay , " to affect a foolish aversion to kings , and a foolish admiration of rebels as rebels : and perhaps while kings were not in danger , and while rebels were not in being , he really believed that he held the doctrines which he professed . He liked revolution and regicide only when they were a hundred years old . His republicanism , like the courage of a bully , or the love of a fribble , was strong and ardent when there was no occasion for it , and subsided when he had an opportunity of bringing it to the proof . " His aversion to kings was manifested in every way that he could show it short ofregicide . It may have been foolish , but that is a matter of opinion . He kept the death-warrant of Charles the First hung up by his bedside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the poor wretch Damien , and calls his crime , " the least bad of murders , the murder of a king . " As much as he abhorred bloodshed , we would not have insured the safety of a king 's head if placed at // his mercy . If kings were not proof against ridicule , he would have unthroned more princes than Napoleon did . As to his admiration of " rebels as rebels , " it was expressed at a time when the Tower was full of them , and the heads of the Scotch lords were grinning on the top of Temple Bar . His account of Balmarino and Kilmarnock is more touching than Scott 's ; his description of their conduct on the scaffold is as graphic and sympathetic as anything in the whole Waverley series . What greater proof of his sincerity need be given than his open expression of sympathy for these rebels when they were on trial 1 What can the brilliant reviewer mean by saying that he had a foolish admiration for rebels while rebels were not So in regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , openly espoused their interests , rejoiced in their victories , and voted with their friends , from the time of the first outbreak at Lexington , until their independence was acknowledged . So too did he applaud the first outburst of the French Revolution , which promised to give a constitution to the nation ; it was not in his nature to approve of the horrid butcheries which so soon followed , and because he did not do so , Mr. Macaulay charges him with affectation in having favored the cause at first . He might with as much propriety charge Lafayette , and Bailly , and Roland , with affectation . " His real tastes show themselves through the thin disguise . While professing all the contempt of Bradshaw or Ludlow for crowned heads , he took the trouble to write a book about royal authors . " This , as Mr. Pecksniff would say , is dreadful . It is laughable . He took the trouble , did he , to write a book about royal atthors , and yet had the hypocrisy to pretend to hate kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word  --  to write a book about the devil and yet pretended to be a Christian-though it was all a pretence with the latter , for it has been discovered that he was an Arminian or an Unitarian . It is true that Walpole did take the trouble ( as though taking trouble in the composition of a book were a novel proceeding ) to write a book about royal authors , which he modestly called a catalogue of royal and noble authors . But did he not , most epigrammatic of reviewers , also write books , and take a vast deal of trouble about them too , much more than he did with his royal authors , about engravers , and painters , and architects I And did he not take the trouble to write a book about Richard the Third , too and must he therefore be written down an admirer of all crooked-back tyrants I Never mind , there is worse than that , says Mr. Macaulay . " When he was a child lie was haunted with a longing to see George the First , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of gratifying his curiosity . The same feeling , covered with a thousand disguises , attended him to his grave . ' ' If we mistake not he was about eight years old when he was introduced to George the First ; truly it was a grave offence in the little rascal to want to see the king . But he says himself , that having seen a king when a child he never wanted to see one afterwards . However , Mr. Macaulay knows best . When we remember how all of Mr. Macaulay 's countrymen , with Walter Scott at their head , went out in the raw air with bare breeks to welcome that excellent and exemplary personage , George the Fourth , into Scotland , we can not sufficiently admire his indignation towards the little boy , Walpole , for wanting to see the king a hundred years before . CC One of his innumernble whims was an extreme dislike to be considered a man of letters . " This is said of a man who kept a printing press in his own house ; who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who even condescended to act in the humble capacity of an editor of other men 's labors ; who corresponded with all the eminent literary men of his time on literary subjects . But this grave charge is made on the foundation of a jocose passage in a letter to Sir Horace Mann , who had complimented him on his learning . Mr. Macaulay says it is " curious to see how impatiently Walpole bore the imputation of having attended to anything so unfashionable as the improvemeut of the mind . " It is curious indeed . See how ashamed he is of knowing anything . " I know nothing . How should I I I who have always // lived in the big busy world ; who lie abed all the morning , calling it morning as long as you please ; who sup in company ; who have played at faro half my life , and now at loo until two or three in the morning ; who have always loved pleasure , haunted auctions . - . . how I have laughed when some of the magazines have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the magazines . " This was written to his most intimate friend , who knew it was all a joke , hut Mr. Macaulay takes it for Gospel , and says he ought to have heen ashamed of himself , a man of his years ; forty-three , as the reviewer is so good as to inform the reader . " He wished to be a celebrated author , and yet to be a mere idle gentleman , one of the epicurean gods of the earth , who do nothing at all , and who pass their existence in the contemplation of their own perfections . He did not like to have anything in common with the wretches who lodged in the little courts behind Saint Martin 's Church , and stole out on Sundays to dine with their bookseller . He avoided the society of authors . He spoke with the most lordly contempt of the best among them . " Anything more cruelly unjust than this was never penned , it has hardly a shadow of a resemblance-hardly foundation enough even for one of Mr. Macaulay 's unscrupulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an extreme dislike to be considered a man of letters , hut wished to he a celebrated author . How dreadfully absurd ! It is like the sailor who preferred brandy , but would rather have rum . It is probable that lie did not seek the company of " the wretches " from behind Saint Martin 's Church , and that he preferred the society of such men as Selwyn , and Gray , and George Montagu , and Marshal Conway . Wretches are not exactly the people whose society anybody would court , when they could as easily enjoy that of witty , well-educated , and polite friends . But many of the authors of his day were the personal friends of Walpole , for whom he always expressed the highest admiration . Gray was neither a lordling nor a fashionable gentleman , but lie lived in habits of the greatest familiarity with him , and the first book published at the Strawberry press , was his Odes . April , He corresponded often with Gibbon and Hume , and spoke of them not with lordly contempt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponded extensively with many of the lesser lights of his time , and sought their aid in the composition of some of his books ; he treated Bentley with the kindness of a brother , and published his father 's edition of Lucan , partly out of regard to the son , and partly , as he says , because of all the classics he was thought to breathe too brave and honest a spirit to he put into the hands of the Dauphin and the French . He used to visit I-Iogarth , and took more pleasure in the society of iIrs . Cline , his neighbor , than in that of the duchesses by whom he was surrounded . Instead of doing nothing , he seems never to have been idle . He ransacked all the old castles and abbeys in the kingdom , wrote letters innumerable , published many large volumes under his personal supervision , attended to his parliamentary duties for nearly thirty years , made occasional trips to Paris , and a considerable part of his life was an invalid with the gout . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his personal imperfections were a constant jest with himself . Mr. Macaulay gives Walpole the credit of understanding the French language , but denies that he had any knowledge of its higher uses , and censures him for not discerning what no other man of his time did , the exact result which would follow from the philoso*. phical writings of the time of Louis the Fifteenth , the corruption of the court and the bigotry of the priesthood . He says , " even of Montesquieu , ho speaks with less enthusiasm than of that abject thing , Crebillon Junior . " Of the Es*it des Lois , Walpole speaks in several places in terms of the most extravagant praise , calls it the most delightful book he has ever read , and quarrels with some of his Florentine friends for not liking it as well as he does himself . Of the other author , the only commendation he bestows upon him is in these very grave lines : . " On my sofa A Latin book who ever saw ? What do you think I ever read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calprenedo together , shows in what estimation ho // must have held " that abject thing . " It is hardly possible that Caiprenede could have been one of his reading authors . He names Crebillon Junior hut once again , and then it is to show him up as a dirt.y coxcomb . But he was a popular author in his day , just as Eugene Sue and Paul de Kock are in ours ; and Walpole , in giving an order for the likeness of some of the famous men in France , ordered one of Crehilion Junior , as a notorious personage , among the rest . This is the only proof of his enthusiasm for that author , while he has given many unequivocal ones of his admiration of Montesquien . He was an admirer of Voltaire , and they wrote each other complimentary letters . But he laughed at Jean Jacques with all the rest of the world , and had no sympathy with the French mathematicians , for in common with many other imaginative men , he had no more power thin a tub of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember for ever a hon mot , or the form of a " lean window fat with saints , " but a rule in arithmetic was no sooner learned than forgotten . It was a peculiarity which he confessed without reserve . If he had been ambitious to appear what he was not-in other words , a man of affectations-he would have taken pains to disguise a weakness which the world usually regards with contempt . It is not easy to conceive why Mr. Macaulay should take such pains to misrepresent an author whom he has laid his l*and upon , for the sake of a long article ; we can neither attribute his mistake to ignorance of his subject , nor to malevolence , lie is a reviewer by trade , and has learned that abuse gives a zest to an article , which candor will not impart . He writes to be read himself , and not to induce the world to read others . In most of his reviews he steps between his reader and his author , and instead of opening a communication between them , establishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention which rightfully helongs to the subject of his essay . We doubt whether anybody who should get his first impressions of Walpole from reading Mr. Macaulay 's review , would ever have the courage to look at any of that author 's works . " If we were to form an opinion of his eminent contemporaries from a general survey of what he has written concerning them , we should say that Pitt was a strutting , mouthing , ranting actor , " &amp;c. , &amp;c. , continues the reviewer . But nothing of the kind could be conceived from what Walpole has written ; in fact , the very reverse must be the opinion of any man who gleans his knowledge of Pitt from what Horace Walpole has written concerning him . The truth is , that this is the character which Mr. Macaulay had himself formed of the Earl of Chatham ; and in his review of Thackeray 's History , he thus expresses himself : " Pitt had one fault , which , of all human faults , is most rarely found in company with true greatness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the closet , an actor at council , an actor in Parliament ; and even in private society he could not lay aside his theatrical tones and attitudes . " Walpole , on the contrary , expresses a uniform and enthusiastic admiration of him , not only in letters addressed to him , but in his letters addressed to others who must have known what his real feelings were . In a letter giving an account of a debate in the House of Commons , he speaks thus of Pitt : " My uncle did justice to himself , and was as wretched and 4irty as his whole behavior had been . Pitt spoke at past one for an hour and thirty-five minutes . There was more humor , wit and vehemence ; finer language , more boldness ; in short , more astonishing perfection , than even you , when you are used to him , can conceive . He was not abusive , yet very attacking on all sides . He ridiculed my Lord Hilsboro ' , crushed poor Sir George , terrified the attorney , lashed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even hinted up to the Duke " &amp;e . Again he says of Pitt : " I knew he had a Gorgon 's head , composed of bayonets and pistols , but I little thought he could tickle to death with a feather . " But when Pitt had sold himself for a coronet and a pension , he indulges in some desponding remarks about human integrity , but he makes no depreciating reflection on his talents . Mr. Macaulay , after spelling him backwards , reading him crosswise , judging of his performances by looking on the wrong side of the tapestry , construing as jests his serious declarations , and regarding his jokes as solemn truths ; and , not unfrequently , // making palpable misrepresentations , concludes at last that it is easiest to describe him by negatives ; and having condemned him for everything that he was , proceeds to condemn him for everything that he was not . Such a terrible ordeal as this no man could pass through with a whole skin , and Walpole , of course , comes out of the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a sound spot on his body . But , after all , Walpole is a popular author , more so now than at his death . He has ten readers now , where he had one during his lifetime . This is a fact which Mr. Macaulay *ve1l knows , and he acknowledges that " it is impossible to deny that Walpole 's works have real merit , and merit of a very rare , though not of a very high kind . Sir Joshua Reynolds used to say that , though nobody would for a moment compare Claude to Raphael , there would be another Raphael before there would be another Claude . And we own that we expect to see fresh Humes aud fresh Burkes before we again fall in with that peculiar combination of moral and intellectual qualities to which the writings of Walpole owe their extraordinary popularity . " Sentences like these have a very knowing look , but they are entirely unmeaning . Sir Joshua admits , without intending to do so , that Claude was a greater artist than Raphael , as Mr. Macaulay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a greater man , a more original genius , as he undoubtedly was , than either Hume or Burke , although he tries to make him appear the reverse . It is very true that nobody would ever think of comparing Claude with Raphael , as nobody , unless it were a newspaper critic , to whom anything is allowable , would think of comparing Tom Moore to Lord Bacon , for the reason that there is no point of resemblance between them . If Reynolds 's estimate of Claude and Raphael be just , the one excels the other exactly in the degree in which he is placed at a distance from competition . What other test of greatness can we have in an artist , whether with a pen or a pencil , than the difficulty of approaching him . For our own part , we agree entirely with Mr. Macaulay , in the expectation of seeing a dozen Burkes and Humes before we see another Walpole . Burke April , and Hume were not of the men , any more than Walpole , who leave their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we believe that the latter will leave more fertilizing matter upon the banks of Time , as he glides into succeeding ages , than both of the others . Burke would have smothered the new-born Spirit of Liberty in the ilowers of his eloquence . His poetical rhapsody about Marie Antoinette was once in the mouth of every schoolboy . Of late years it seems to have grown stale . The French revolution is beginning to assume a different aspect to what it wore when Louis the Sixteenth and his ruler , the Queen , were continually exhibited as the chief personages in that unparalleled drama . Walpole 's descriptions of the French court , a few years before the revolution began , make even a mild and merciful man almost impatient to see the guillotine at work , and instead of wondering at the scenes of September , 1792 , in the prisons of Paris , we marvel at their not taking place a long time before . Mr. Macaulay , having admitted in two or three lines that Walpole has real merit , immediately repents of it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his writings are admirable , they ought not to be admired ; allows that he was a good letter-writer , but says he " had evidently studied it as an art . " For what reason * That he might express his thoughts with ease and correctness l No . But because , " there was nothing vulgar in writing a letter . " He willenot allow the poor devil the privilege of doing anything from a decent motive . Even his unstudied friendly epistles , written solely for the eye of his intimate friend , concerning his own private affairs , are , according to the Reviewer , huge affectations , composed with an eye to effect . Nothing can be more evident than that his letters were a unstudied as his breathing . If they contained a particle of affectation* what charm could they have for us If he had studied letter-writing as an art , he must have commenced the study at a very early age , for we find the same peculiarities , the same unequalled force of expression in those written at the age of twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The pretensions of an author should be judged of from his best , and not hi* // worst productions . In common things most men are alike . It would be absurd enough to judge of Lord Bacon 's merits by comparing him with Sir Matthew Hale , or of Burns by measuring him with Cobbet : but it is in a similar manner that Mr. Macaulay justifies his depreciating view of Walpole . Compelled to admit that he is the most readable of authors , that he delights , by his manner of handling , with subjects that other men had in vain endeavored to render attractive , he winds up by observing , in reference to Walpole 's sketches of character , " What a difference between these daubs and the masterly portraits of Clarendon ! " What a difference , indeed ! It would be as just to say , what a difference between Boz 's Quilp and Milton 's Satan . But Walpole 's sketches are the reverse of daubs . His outlines are sharp , clear , and decided , and alive with individuality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the scratches of a sharp-pointed instrument , guided by an unfaltering hand . Of all the names in English literature , Clarendon 's is the last that should have been named in comparison with his . If lie was like anybody , it was Hogarth . He illustrated the same age and the same characters ; and his sketches always give us the same feelings which we experience in looking at Hogarth 's engravings and pictures . Their manner of handling is very much alike . Walpole has sets of paintings that will compare with the Marriage a la Mode , in point of finish , tone , solidity of color , pathos , humor , and individuality of character . His letters are all alive with figures . As we open his volumes , they fly out like bees from a hive . As Goldsmith said of Butler , he has more thoughts than lines . Indeed , every line is a picture , every word a thought . His power of condensation is like Shakspeare 's . Mr. Macaulay says that he has fewer passages of skip than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he difficult to find a word that could be left out in the whole eight volumes of his letters . His expressions are often grotesque , but they are never indistinct . You understand at a glance what he means . Speaking of the Empress Catharine , he says : " I wonder such a principal performer can be spared out of hell . " He says no more about her , and nothing more was necessary . His pet character was the Duke of Newcastle ; and his delineation of that strange animal is as perfect , as unique , as anything in the range of fiction . It is equal to anything in Sterne , or Moli*re , or Fielding ; it is almost as good as Falstaff . After all his absurd tricks , his grotesque sayings , we see him at last a grave old gentleman in retirement . This does not mar the keeping of his picture in the least , it was necessary to its perfectness ; just as Falstaff 's death-bed was necessary to convince us that he was a real man , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has scores of them , are the most absurd , but the most amusing creatures that ever existed in books . Lady Townshend , who fell in love with the square shoulders of Lord Kilmarnock , and would dine nowhere the day after his execution , lest they should serve up a rebel pie ; Miss Chudleigh , with her two noble husbands ; Lady Gordon , who invited the handsome Poniatowski to dinner , and received him , dressed like Venus , with her two sons in the character of Cupids , with pasteboard wings and bows and arrows ; the Lady-Marys , who ran away with their footmen ; are characters that we miss in the pages of the historian , hut they throw more light on the manners of an age than the pompously useless details of battles , or the most exact accounts of the negotiations and intrigues of ambassadors and cabinet ministers . We have not noticed a tithe of Mr. Macaulay 's bitter sayings against Walpole ; he will not allow him even the common feelings of humanity ; denies that he was capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting and as romantic as a woman 's ; his affection for General Conway was as unequivocal as a mother 's ; his letters to Sir Horace Mann are alone a monument of steady and consistent friendship ; as are those to Gray ; to George Montagu ; to Madame du Deffaud ; to the Earl of Hertford , and many others . Itlut what we have already done , prevents our doing what we intended at first to give a slight sketch of Walpole 's life and genius , and just as we are ready to begin our work , we find that our space is filled . But the subject is worth attending to , and we may resume it . Walpole is an // author who is daily quoted hy our press , but there seems to be a kind of free-masonry among the craft , which binds every one to bestow a contemptuous epithet upon him . He is called a petit-maitre , a penny-a-liner , and an aristocrat . No man was ever less of either than he . At the best he is only called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are contained in letters ; but they are not essentially epistles . They might have been published like the Spectator , or like Tristam Shandy , or Swift 's tracts . Everybody writes letters , while but very few write books , and yet there are scores of good books written where there is one letter that will bear reading a second time . But rare as the talent of letter-writing may be , Walpole 's genius is infinitely above that of a mere epistolizer . If Hogarth had made his sketches on a letter sheet , and sent them by mail to a friend , be would have been entitled to the credit of a mere " letter-writer , " with the same propriety that Walpole is . His style is a rapid vehicle of thought . He had much to write , and hut a limited space to put it in . A man who must put a dozen important facts into one sheet of paper , will , of necessity , do it tersely , if not elegantly . Walpole did both . If he had been compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his letters in proportion to their length , although he might have produced twice as many as he did of double their length , we doubt whether one of them would be read now , instead of the eight volumes which are read and re-read like a pleasing story . He says in one of his letters : " You can not imagine how astonished a Mr. Seward , a clergyman , was , who came to Rugby while 1 was there . Strolling about the house he first saw me with Louis , sitting on the pavement of the lumber room , all over cobwebs , and dirt , and mortar ; then found me in his own room , on a ladder , writing on a picture ; and half an hour afterwards , on the grass in the court , with the dogs and the children , in my slippers and without my hat . But you would have died at his surprise , when he saw me walk into dinner dressed , and sit by Lady Hertford . Finding me not quite ignorant added to the parson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and begged to know who and what sort of man I was , for he had never met with anything of the kind . " Many is the Parson Seward whom he has since confounded . Indeed , all his reviewers seem to have been quite as hev*ildered as the astonished clergyman , and after trying in vain to solve him , are obliged to exclaim , that they never before met with anything of the kind.
