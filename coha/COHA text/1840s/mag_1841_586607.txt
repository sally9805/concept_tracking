txt SIR : I believe - at least , I hope - that you are a man of too much good sense to take offence at being addressed by your true and proper title , even by so humble a fellow-citizen as a PennyPostman . That I am prompted by neither a discourteous nor an unfriendly spirit , you will , I trust , be sufficiently satisfied before we part . Others may covertly insult you , by supposing that a title to which you have really no constitutional nor legal right , will gratify a silly vanity which the presumption in truth imputes to you . Others may have been actuated in thrusting upon you the name and the office of " the President , " by obvious motives of interest to which I can scarcely conceive you to be entirely blind . If there were any lack of the former class of obsequious courtiers about your person , despising *vliile they flatter , and flattering because they despise , it would be the first instance in the annals of palaces of such a phenomenon . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivals in your own party , for the succession to the seat you now fill , with all their friends and partisans by whom you are surrounded , were insensible to the importance of insisting on your being a full " President " now , so as to exclude you from any future competition with their own aspirations , by bringing you within the application of the new-fashioned one-term principle ' of which we have lately heard so much , they would sadly belie their wellearned characters for quickness in the perception of the interest of their immediate personal ambition , and for an equal unscrupulousness as to means in its pursuit . I , Sir , am neither false friend nor flatterer ; and will therefore pay you the higher respect , and perhaps the truer service , by addressing you simply by that inferior title which alone you have a proper right to claim . That you should have thus allowed your own better judgment to be misled in adopting the style and title of " the President , " by a deference to the opinions of others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been an object of just suspicionto you , is indeed a matter of some surprise to me . I will not believe that you aided to mislead yourself , under an unconscious influence of a petty pride of official dignity , alike unworthy of yonr position and of your character . If you were induced to believe that highest of all the titles of eminence known to the political institutions of nations , the " PREsInENT OF TEE UNITED STATES , " really and rightfully yours , by the constitution of your // country , and the will of your countrymen , I will not believe that it was because " The will was father , Harry , to the thought ! " I will do you the justice of presuming , that it was more probably from an unwillingness to appear disposed to place yourself so directly in the attitude of a presidential candidate for 1844 , - an attitude which would seem inseparable from the position of a VicePresident called to discharge the presidential duties under such circumstances , while at the same time calculated seriously perhaps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two leading members of your own party already referred to . Such was probably your motive ; or perhaps it was a mixture of all those to which I have alluded . However , as it was your first step in your new position , it was a pity that it was a false one . The argument is exceedingly simple . The clause of the Constitution , in which resides your sole right to the seat you now fill , is in the following terms : " In case of the removal of the President from office , or of hi* death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice-President . " The only question here is , to which of the two antecedents admitted by the structure of the sentence , the relative term " the is applicable - to the words " the said office , ' ' or to the words " the powers and duties . " If to the former , you are now , as Mr. Webster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have yourself assumed to be - and as the political favor of one portion , and the personal courtesy of the other , of both branches of Congress have recognised you - in fact , and in name , by a full and perfect right and title , " TRE PRESIDENT . " If to the latter , you are still that which the will of the people created you , the VicePresident , - although the will of a still higher power has called into existence the contingency provided for in the above clause , in which , by virtue of that capacity , the " powers and duties " of the presidential office devolve upon you . The grammatical construction of the sentence will equally admit either alternative . 1f in the former case , it be argued that the word " office " is the nearest antecedent ; on the other hand , in the latter , the words " powers and duties " constitute the main and primary member of the expressiQn , the words " the said office " being but secondary and dependent upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fact that among the several contingencies covered by the // clause , is one in which the disability of the President may be merely temporary , is surely decisive of the question against the interpretation on which you have been led to act . The " inability " provided against may be caused by mental or physical disease from which the President may recover . You will scarcely contend , that he would cease during that interval to be " the President , " - that he would be bound to withdraw from the occupancy of the presidential palace ( for it is , I regret to say , a palace ) , - or that there would be any intermission of his right to the full fruition of the presidential salary . Still less would you maintain the absurdity that there could be two " Presidents " in existence at one and the same time , each entitled to the honorable designation of the office , and requiring a double appropriation of its salary ; nor if an incumbent had ceased to be " the President , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Vice-President , that he could resume the office thus vacated , that he could recover the virtue thus gone out of him , by any other process than that of popular election . And yet all these consequences are clearly involved in your present assumption of the office and title to which you were not elected by the people . Suppose , Sir , that the good old man whose place you now fill , instead of having been called to receive in heaven the reward of a blameless and virtuous life on earth , were at the present moment simply in a condition of " inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , " which might be but temporary in its duration , - suppose , for example , he were insane , or in a state of trance , or catalepsy , or in such a condition of health as to compel him to withdraw for a time from all public business , or perhaps to seek a remedy only to be obtained by foreign travel - in such case , precisely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are occupying your present position ; yet , surely , you would not pretend that " the said office " had devolved upon you , or that you could advance the slightest claim either to its title , or to its salary , without a special law and appropriation of Congress to that effect . It is true that you succeed to the full possession of all the official " powers and duties " of the Presidency . It is true , too , that no one of any party would probably raise an objection to the passage of the act of Congress legally necessary to entitle you to its salary , and to justify the officers of the Treasury in paying it to you . But that which constitutes in reality the essence of the honor incident to that possession of the highest of dignities that man can aspire to on this earth , the choice of the people , you do not possess , you can not pretend to claim . None of that impalpable but powerful moral // force which is derived from that elective and representative character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office only in the mode in which its administration happens to have fallen on you . Your election by the people , as none understands better than yourself , had not the slightest reference to the contingency which in the course of Providence has occurred . You were nominated , as a very respectable gentleman , for the satisfaction of a portion of your party , to whom the opinions with which your name stood and stands identified , on some of the most prominent questions of the times , were far more acceptable than those which entered into the political character , such as it was , of General Harrison . You were voted for by the main bulk of your supporters , simply as " Tyler too , " much after the same fashion in which any worthy individual of the " Smith " family , provided he had never been an actual inmate of a penitentiary , might have been elected under similar circumstances . Even if you were clearly now , that which you clearly are not , legally and technically the President of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , so far as regards all its true dignity and worth , that you would grasp . All that which constitutes it the glorious prize which in truth it is to the noblest ambition , lies yet beyond , far beyond and above , the position to which an unforeseen accident has advanced you . You have yet , Sir , to earn from your country the honor of the Presidency , - and to earn it in the only mode in which it is to be earned , by the arduous and noble title of deserving it . It is no immaterial point of mere titular and technical distinction , this question as to the true official position which you now hold . It never can be unworthy of our most careful attention to settle , by a first correct precedent , the proper construction of a new point in the application of the great and sacred charter of our liberties and of our hopes , the Constitution . It is easy , too , to imagine cases in which the most serious evils might be the fruit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suppose these two functionaries to be the heads of two hostile and evenly balanced parties , at a period of high excitement and mutual exasperation , and that a temporary disability should , according to your doctrine , divest the President of that office , and cause it to devolve upon the Vice-President , - might not the attempt by the former to resume it , on the recovery of his ability to discharge its powers and duties , be possibly , too probably , attended with difficulties which might be the most disastrous l And on the present occasion eventual consequences of the highest moment may perhaps hinge upon the question . Sir , you are still what the people made you , the Vice-President ; and by that name I beg leave to address // July , you as you ought to be addressed , testifying thus in reality a higher respect and a truer friendship , than if I should flatter your vanity by a title to which you have as yet no claim , but which you may hereafter make most gloriously your own . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the opportunity which it affords you of rendering most inestimable services to your country , and of inscribing your own high among the highest of the names enrolled in the Pantheon of its grateful memory . Are you equal to that opportunity l - are you worthy of that position l I await with a most earnest interest the answer which time must soon develop to the inquiry . You have now to prove yourself either a great man , or a very little one . Prove yourself an honest one - true to the faith of the political school in which you were reared - true to the high principles of the glorious old State to whose favor you owe all that you are - true to the opinions so manfully uttered by you in former years , and with which is identified all of political character that attaches to your name , - prove yourself but thus honest and true , in the present unprecedented crisis of our national affairs , and among those noble sonu to whom Virginia has been so long wont to point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone worthy to grace her queenly brow , there will be none - no , not one - on whom through future years her eye will rest with a proud affection , higher than that which will be equally your desert and your certain reward . I beg your indulgence while I venture to hold up before you , as in a mirror , as faithful an outline of that position as I can trace within my present brief limits . At no former period of our history , together with a similar political excitement , has there existed a similar confusion of parties , to that which now prevails among us . The question is no longer so far as regards the terms in which it is stated - which of the two rival parties shall prevail , the Federal or the Democratic , - which of the two antagonist political theories shall govern the course of the public affairs , that of the State-Rights , or that of the Consolidation school , - which of the two names shall be adopted as the expression of the ideas dominant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Thomas Jefferson . The only question , according at least to the public professions of both parties , is , which of the two is in reality the true Democratic , the true State-Rights , the true Jeffersonian party . Lam far , indeed , Sir , from intending to imply that it is*vith an equal title that the two parties are thus laying claim to a common character . Hypocrisy is said to be the homage which vice pays to virtue . There is doubtless many an honest democrat whom 64* // mistake has cast among the ranks of the Whig party , to whom it would be an injustice I am the last to offer , to impute to him any other spirit , in his political professions or conduct , than the same sincerity I am conscious of in my own . But that this pretension by the party whose votes have elevated you to power , is one of the most flagrant of frauds , and at the me time in its very falsehood the most signal act of homage they could offer to the memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as to the power of the principles he has bequeathed to us , I am entitled to assert . I have here nothing to say of the democratic or anti-democratic , the federal or the anti-federal , the Hamiltonian or the Jeffersonian , character of particular measures , upon which the two parties may have been , or may yet be , at issue . However clearly I may discern in them the evidence of the radically antagonist character of the two parties in their present organiza* tion , - the federalism of the one and the democracy of the other being illustrated in a stronger relief at the present day in some of these measures than they have ever been before , - yet to you I have scarcely the right to address such an argument . You would regard it as a one-sided assumption of the whole subject of the controversy , to which of course I could not claim your assents But Virginian as you were born and bred , and State-Rights-man as you have always professed to be , you can not refuse it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own Secretary of State , that at least the main bulk of the old federal and antidemocratic party are still to be found among those who have been the most zealous in overthrowing the administration on whose fall you have risen . Individuals may indeed be pointed to , on our side , conspicuous from their very rarity , whom the onward movement of the public mind in the democratic direction has converted into friends of the party and the principles they may once have opposed ; but on the other side are to be seen whole masses of population , sections of country , and numerous presses of ancient reputation and unchanged character , which , as they were Federal of old , are Whig now . And while on the one side every such convert to be found among the democratic ranks is frank in acknowledging the radical change of sentiment through which conviction and experience have led him , on the other any such imputation of change is repelled with scorn . Leading Whig presses have freely expressed the contempt all honest men must feel , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have been recently heard so loud on the lips of those whose whole past life and present conduct equally belie them all ; and untold numbers of that party , in the freedom of VOL.IX.No . I.-E // private intercourse , do not hesitate to express all the sentiments familiar to the worst and blackest times of the old Federalism , finding nothing in those sentiments incompatible with their adhesion to the Whig party of the present day . This difference at least , it can not be denied , distinguishes the two paities . Independently of the disputed character of party measures , I leave it to yourself to judge , which of the two is the more likely to be the one , to whose general direction an honest statesman of the school you have always professed ought most naturally to incline . Wo to you , Sir , wo to your future fame and name , if you should succeed , as so many a false friend is urging you , in earning , with the contempt and execration of that party with which Federalism has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able thus to fraternize with that Federalism , in perfect harmony of a congenial character and tendency , but which reposes upon that Federalism as the main body and strength of its support ! Wo , I repeat , and shame , to John Tyler of Virginia , if he can long continue to harmonize , on vital principles of constitutional doctrine , in the same cabiaet counsels with Daniel Webster of Boston ! On the surface , however , of our present political condition there does undeniably exist all that confusion of parties I have above alluded to , - a confusion of which you , in your present position , may be said to be the embodied expression . There probably may be a small number of persons attached to the Democratic party whose real principles are but little in accordance with those of its main body . There certainly is a very large minority of the party whose votes have placed you where you are , between whose principles and those of the majority reigns a discord which no art can ever reconcile . You can not yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a vast variety of elements the most heterogeneous , which have been held together by no other bond than the external and artificial one of a common opposition . All the materials of discontent necessarily generated by a twelve years ' possession of power by one set of men , in a period of high excitement and strong political action , contributed their share to swell the motley mass . Everything that was incongruous , everything that was inconsistent , were there most absurdly mingled together , - like the material of the columns you will see any fine morning that you may walk into the Representative Hall in the Capitol , well described by the expressive name by which it is known to the vulgar as " pudding-stone . " Here you will find a pebble of free-trade snugly fitting in between two larger pieces of high-tariffism-here a fragment of blood-red abolitionism , agreeably s*ontrasting with a black mass of slavery , - here a veiI* // of nullification and the strictest constitutional Construction , interweaving with a broad line , encircling the whole , of the widest federal latitudinarianism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most amicable juxtaposition with all that is antagonist in principle to such an institution , - while you will find crumbled fragments of rotten bankruptcy scattered in abundance over its entire surface , and cemented into a perfect chaos of discord with all the rest of its mingled ingredients . Sir , this is no exaggerated picture of your party . You can not yourself refuse to recognise that it is but too faithful to the truth . Hence arose the necessity , so clearly apparent to the nominating convention , of which you were at once a member , and its choice for the office you now fill , of omitting the usual declaration of principles and intended measures , by which such nominations have heretofore been accompanied . Had such a declaration been made , you well know now , as they well knew then , that you could never have succeeded in the election . This vast chaotic mass , by whose votes the change of administration was effected - ( thorough as was their organization , I can not call them a " party " ) - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single one of opposition to the actual incumbents of the seats of government . The motives to that opposition were as various as the diversified fragments of which that huge but shapeless mass was composed . With some it proceeded from one cause , with others from a dozen different ones . Oae portion of the Whigs hoped to supersede the general policy of the administration by one contemplated set of measures , - than which nothing could be farther from the wishes of another portion ; while on the other hand , the thoughts of no inconsiderable number extended very little farther than a mere change of men , with a view to the reformation of the thousand abuses and corruptions of mere administration , which a thousand-thousand reiterated charges made them believe to exist , on the part of the set of individuals so long undisturbed in the monopoly of public office . How large , too , was the number of those who were actuated by no distinct political ideas at all , to swell this confused clamor for mere " change , " I do not care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of measures as for another , for one set of principles as for their opposite ; and only anxious to take advantage of the brief rally of the " credit system , " which they hoped as the consequence of a political revolution , for their relief from their own immediate embarrassments . Now , Sir , what conceivable administration could be sustained , in any practical line of policy , by such a party ? If General Harrison had lived , he might possibly have held them together , // through the existing machinery of their recent organization , from the personal attachment which seemed to have centred about him , - perhaps for the first year of his term . Certainly even he could not have maintained their cohesion for a longer period . What then have you to expect l Unsustained by any enthusiasm of personal popularity - selected with no actual reference to the contingency which an unforeseen dispensation of Providence has called into existence-an old member of the political school irreconcilably opposed to that of a very large proportion of those whose votes have placed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphatically declared and repeated , and never retracted , the most directly hostile to the views of their majority-is it possible that the idea can for a moment possess your mind , of finding in that party the support necessary to a successful , or even to any practicable administration of the government * If you attempt it by your measures , - and it can only be by the abandonment of all the principles of your school , - I warn you that you will fail , miserably , disgracefully . You have none of that kind of political strength incident to the representative character of a President , fresh from a popular election conducted on the basis of any well-understood great issues at stake . The only basis of moral force you have to rest upon is that of consistency with your old principles , - your hostility to a national bank ; your distrust and dislike of the entire system of paper-money banking as it exists among us ; your opposition to the whole theory of the " American system , " in its double aspect of internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried almost if not quite to the farthest verge of nullification . If you abandon that ground , you sink into nothing . If you stand firmly and faithfully by it , it will prove a rock to your feet which the gates of hell shall not prevail against . In the one case , you drag out your term of accidental office , an object of contempt to all parties ; and after a feeble and imbecile administration , perpetually pressed by unanswerable attack from without , and distracted by harassing dissension within , you will drop out of history , with the reputation of one whom chance had elevated to a position in which he might have been a great man , to no other effect than to enable him to prove the more conspicuously his own miserable littleness . On the other hand , Sir , prove now , when the highest responsibilities of action are imposed upon you , but true in practice to your old principles , and for all the abuse with which you may be assailed by those whom you have never given any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will find an abundant compensation in the general support which you will receive from that great party to // whom those principles are all that they hold most dear . We want nothing better than a President who will conform his actions to your professions of former days ; and in sustaining your administration , if you will but allow us to do so by deserving it , and in electing you by a large and enthusiastic majority to the full possession of the office which is now but imperfectly your own , we should rather rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded us , of proving the sincerity of our devotion to our principles , and our comparative indifference to any inferior objects of common pnrtisan interest . We are far indeed from indifference to not a few of our own distinguished chiefs and champions , who have worthily sustained the cause of those principles , at the head of our party array , in many a hard-fought field of political contest , - those to whom our attachment , our gratitude , and our confidence , would most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate for the Presidency , But our patriotism and our political philosophy rise to a far higher elevation than any considerations of a nature thus purely personal . " .4micus Plato , amicus Socrates , sed magis amica Veri/as ! " We know no such thing as a right on the part of any individual , on his country or on his party , however eminent the services he may have rendered to either . Such services , if in truth performed in such a spirit as to merit any reward , carry their own full reward in their own simple performance . If more is claimed , the very claim is the proof that nothing is deserved . No man can render more than his mere duty to his country and to the cause of his principles . I have always been of the opinion that any application for party reward , on the ground of party services , - be the prize sought high or low in the scale of the political lottery , - ought to constitute alone a sufficient reason for its rejection . In its selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidency or for any inferior post of public trust and honor , the Democracy have no other consideration to look to than the promotion of the great cause of their high and holy principles . No past services of individuals , no personal feeling with which they may be regarded , can have the weight of the dust in the balance in comparison with this one paramount motive of our action . The man whom circumstances may chance to have placed in the position in which he becomes the most prominent representative of our principles , and the most completely identified with the maintenance of their ascendency , he is the man whom , like our barbarian forefathers of old , we raise aloft on our shields , to be our chief and our leader in the struggle through which that ascendency is to be maintained . When our standard-bearer has been stricken down , we care little what new or accidental hand may have succeeded to his post of // honor , - it is upon the sacred orijiamme itself that our eyes are fixed ; and provided it be but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that we rally , with but little heed to the individual over whom its folds may happen to wave . There is nothing , therefore , in the supposed claims ' of any individuals , however high their merits or our grateful sense of them , that would deter us from yielding to your administration and to your re-election a support alike honorable to both , if you will but deserve it . If among those from whom our selection would otherwise probably be made , there should be any who would hesitate to sympathize frankly with that patriotic and disinterested spirit which would under such circumstances stimulate all the better portion of the Democratic party to sustain you and reward you , the feeling would be the witness against himself of his own unworthiness of our regard or confidence . Nor do I believe that there are any such , among the several distinguished individuals to whom this remark could have an application . I care but little , Sir , for the circumstance of your having been , in our party divisions , so long arrayed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glad to support . I need not direct your eye to another very eminent statesman and great man , who may perhaps be rightfully designated as the present head of that political school of which you have always professed yourself a disciple , and whose opposition to General Jackson 's administration had been far more vehement than any ever exhibited by you . He was undoubtedly honest in that as in his subsequent course ; and though in some respects grievously mistaken , and misled by influences of a nature purely personal , yet the ground of opposition occupied by him was one distinct and detached , from the main body of those with whom he was thus thrown into a temporary and accidental alliance . The overaction of the executive spring , in the machinery of our political structure , was the principal point against which his opposition directed itself ; together with that policy of the employment of State banks as the fiscal agents and depositories of the government , which experience so soon after proved to be fraught with evils even exceeding the dangers which he anticipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have forgotten how , so far as regarded the personal antagonism of politics , he was hurried , by the impetuous energy of a generous nature , and by private resentments embittering his feelings and blinding his judgment , to a degree of violence which naturally provoked , on the part of those thus assailed , a corresponding spirit of angry retaliation . And yet you have seen how easily these personal prejudices could // be forgotten , among a party whose devotion is so earnestly fixed on their great principles , on the occurrence of an important crisis when fidelity to those principles was the highest service that could be rendered to them , at the same time that it was a decisive test of deeply-rooted convictions and patriotic purity of purpose . CALHOUN never showed himself a greater man than at the crisis of 1837 ; and the reconciliation of the democracy with him was like that of old friends , still true at heart , though long estranged by mutual angry misunderstandings and resentments ,  - -  a reconciliation , cementing with a closer warmth the attachment whose temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed you , Sir , in a position in which you stand invested with a higher power , for good or for evil , to the cause of the great principles you have always professed , than has ever before , in our political annals , rested in the hands of any single individual . If you are but firm and faithful to them now , they become established , as the only true principles on which the administration of the federal government can ever again be conducted , on a basis placed far beyond the reach of any possible future attack . The present confusion in our party relations will be reduced to order . The Democratic and the State-Rights portions of that heterogeneous medley which calls itself " the Whig party , " will be seen immediately to divide off from its main body of Federal ? sm , to sustain your position , bitterly as it will doubtless be assailed by the latter ; while you will receive from the Democratic party , of every section of the Union , the same enthusiastic support which it has given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mr. Van Buren . We care not for your offices , - we want none of your patronage . Bestow all that you may have to bestow on those who have been languishing for the space of three presidential terms , afar from the smiles of Executive favor , in the chilly regions of Opposition . Let them be but honest and honorable men , and we care not who may be the incumbents of the public appointments in your gift . We would encourage , too , rather than deprecate , the most searching scrutiny which any suspicions may desire , into any of the details of executive administration throughout the whole extent of its widely ramified action . Whatever abuses may have existed , if any , naturally incident to a prolonged possession of executive office , let them be fully explored by the jealous vigilance of new incumbents . Whatever useful reforms may be suggested from any quarter , let them be frankly met and gladly adopted . Every such detection of an abuse , every such suggestion of a reform , is a common public benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity of administration with that of the De // mocracy . Let the new brooms sweep as clean as they can . This has always been one of the chief subjects of clamor by the opposition against the two late administrations ; and in the same spirit in which , when supporting those administrations , we denied the general truth of those violent and random charges , we are perfectly willing now , ourselves in opposition , if it be but fairly and honorably conducted , to court the widest latitude of investigation into them all . Reduce the action of the executive branch as much as you choose , - purify it , if you can . In every step you may take in such a direction , if you can find any to take , I will answer for it that the Democracy of the country will go with you heart and hand . And we shall deem it a happy dispensation of that Providence which presides over our political destinies , that you should have been made the instrument of thus harmonizing many a discord , and reconciling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other source than a mutual misunderstandin g , between the Democratic party and a considerable proportion of those who have been deluded into an opposition little better than fratricidal to the leading principles of our policy in the administration of the federal government . If , on the other hand , you should show yourself unworthy of the glorious opportunity which has fallen to you , - if you should prove false to the principles you have always professed , a renegade to the faith of your political *chool , - if you should consent to the creation of another National Bank , - to a distribution of the national revenue , for the aid of the internal improvement or banking speculations of State politicians , and for the purpose of sparing to them the wholesome necessity of a resort to direct taxation for the payment of the interest on their extravagant debts , - if you should give your approval to the proposed revival of the old Ilamiltonian policy of funding a permanent public debt , - if you should adopt any of these measures whether directly or indirect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ever damn your own good fame , you will have inflicted a stab on " the good old cause " of the principles of Virginia , with the treacherous hand of a false friend , far deeper than could ever have been inflicted by an open foe . Should you thus dare to aim a blow so impious at the heart of your noble mother State , to whose favor alone you owe your present position of power to serve or to injure her , by your fidelity or your treachery to the principles in which she nursed you to manhood and to strength , I may well here repeat the application to her case which has been before made , of those celebrated lines in which she will for ever record the memory of such a parricidal treason : // " &amp; the struck eagle , stretched upon the plain , No more through rolling clouds to soar again , Viewed his own feather on the fatal dart , And winged the shaft that quivered in his heart . Keen were his pangs , hut keener far to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same plumage that had warmed his nest Drank the last life-drop from his bleeding breast . " In either case , Sir , depend upon it that your reward will be as great as it will be justly meted out , - whether of honor or of infamy-of applause or of execration -- of the rejoicings of your true friends or their blushing regrets- of the lasting gratitude of your country or her unforgiving scorn . You stand entirely free to act as your honest judgment may dictate to you , - uncommitted , unpledged , to anything but those very principles to which I now appeal to you to harmonize your conduct . The cry is absurd by which some of the Whig presses have attempted to coerce you into that very line of action the most fatal alike to your true fame and your true interest , namely , that you are bound to carry out any particular set of measures which they see fit now , after the election , to designate as " Whig measures . " Granted that the establishment of a National Bank , for example , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet that is far from being a majority of the People ; - on the contrary , you can not yourself , Sir , deny that the minority of your own party , together with the united mass of the Democratic party , must make a large aggregate popular majority , irreconcilably hostile to such an institution . In like manner , Sir , I may fairly challenge the specification of any single measure that can be termed a " Whig measure , " upon which the issue of the late presidential election can be regarded as an expression of the popular voice , - no , Sir , not even the repeal of the Independent Treasury bill ! On a question of public policy of that nature , every judgment must necessarily be comparative , between the respective merits of proposed alternatives . The number I know to be very large of the Whigs themselves , who , while preferring a National Bank as their first choice , freely avow an equally decided preference of the Independent Treasury over a return to the State Bank deposite system . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number is still greater who would prefer a system far less acceptable to them than that of the Independent Treasury , rather than behold the monster of another National Bank ever again rear its hideous head . It is impossible , too , to form any estimate of those whose opposition to that measure referred less to its own merits E2 // than to the hostility with which they had accustomed themselves to regard those by whom it was to be carried into execution . With such persons , some modification of some of its features , more or less material , may be all that is necessary to render it the most acceptable to them of all conceivable plans for the fiscal administration of the government , - especially when its application is to be made in the hands of those political friends of their own , in whose integrity and intentions they repose a confidence which their most unjust prejudices have taught them to deny to its proper authors . Now , Sir , such is the confidence of the Democratic party in the measure itself , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of those of whose political integrity we are far from entertaining the most exalted opinion . If the law be but fairly carried into effect , the system can not be peryerted ; and to all the charges so clamorously urged against it , that it was designed to increase the patronage and power of the Executive , to obtain a corrupt access to the public treasury , and to perpetuate the ascendency of the party wielding it as a political engine , our relative positions now enable us to make the reply , decisive alike of the purity of the intention of the law in question , and of our confidence in the certain and necessary success of its practical operation , - namely , that we are perfectly content to trust its execution in the very hands of our political antagonists ! Sir , I repeat that not even on the question of the repeal of the Independent Treasury Bill , notwithstanding the convenient plea under which your friends in the Senate so ingloriously shrank from its discussion , when most eagerly challenged to engage in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion ; and I have no doubt that if at this moment the question could be directly submitted to the people , of an option between that and any other specific system that could be proposed as a substitute , the popular majority by which it would be sustained would far exceed that by which you and your friends have been elevated into your present seats of power . There is indeed one line of conduct to which your party have pledged themselves by their united professions before the election , on the strength of which they succeeded in gaining the popular ear and confidence . You are pledged to rectify every abuse and to purify every corruption you may find to have anywhere existed throughout the vast and complex operations of the executive government , - and in this task , if you can find much to do in its performance , I most cheerfully bid you , God speed ! You are pledged to a great retrenchment of the public expenses , - Amen ! is my most cordial exclamation , if it is possible ; and you will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may entitle yourselves to for // the practical redemption of the promise . I can only express a trembling hope that you may perform it in a very different way from that in which you have thus far executed the only other specific pledge that I am able to cite in your favor - namely , that by which you so emphatically bound yourselves to prove your sincere abhorrence of the flngitious doctrine of " the spoils of victory , " to " proscribe proscription , " and to make no removals from office for the mere sake of the honest political opinions of an incumbent , or to create vacancies for the reward of needy and clamorous partisans of your own ! From your Message , I confess , Sir , that I am at a loss to draw any decisive indication of the course you may intend to pursue . I would fain read it in a light the most favorable to you . There is much in it to encourage the best hopes that you may prove not unequal to the present great crisis , not unworthy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , there are more passages than one which in their very vagueness impress the mind with the gloomiest forebodings for the country and for yourself . It is true you throw out a very loose suggestion of some absurd and impossible kind of national bank , to be based upon the proceeds of the public lands , and to distribute its profits among the States ; but at the same time your Message is full of concessions necessarily fatal to any possible one that the friends of such an institution are at all likely to be satisfied with . It is true you refer to the supposed relief of the embarrassments of some of the States , to be derived from a distribution of the proceeds of the public lands ; but it is accompanied with the most emphatic repudiation of any idea of an assumption of these debts , direct or indirect . While your declarations against a permanent public debt ; against a disturbance of the Compromise act ; against any use of the public deposits by banks as a basis of banking operations ; against the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank against the supposition of its utility as a means of aiding a return to specie payments , - with some other passages of a kindred spirit , appear calculated , if not designed , to lay a broad basis of sound general principles , on which you may yet take a position worthy of your name , your State , your political school , and of the great occasion of high responsibility and glorious opportunity which has been laid upon you . Your fame and your fate rest now in your own hands . There I leave them , till time shall reveal the issue of that which is now enveloped in the clouds of doubt and darkness - when you may ngain hear from Your humble friend , THE PENNY*POSTMAN.
