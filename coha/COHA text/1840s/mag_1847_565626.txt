txt sensibly , it comes to be regarded by the people asa professional assumption , and engages their attention less than the naked truth presented only with simplicity . In general , utterance and gesticulation are fitted to impress the minds of hearers only as they are observed to express the mind of the speaker . No such effect can be expected from what may be called his quasi emotion , or the manner that signifies what emotion he ought to feel , or would feel if he cou ! d . Hence , when a young man , possessing the piety and good sense required of an ordinary preacher , does not find in himself-springing up from his own mi**d , in contact with his subject and the occasionthat degree of animation which many of his hearers might relish , or which may seem necessary to the desired effect of his ministrations ; if he asks , What shall I do ? he may be answered , Do without it , rather than speak as if you felt it , or with a determination to excite it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preparation of his heart for the work of the pulpit , by prayer and meditation on his theme : not in any endeavors , while doing that work , to stimulate himself or his hearers by outward appliances of voice and action . We would further remind him , that there is another manner , more attainable by preachers generally-more appropriate to their position-more effective , too , in their stated ministrations , than the animation which is so much coveted , or than even the impassioned delivery of Whitefleld . We mean a manner like that of Edwards and John Wesley , who were both remarkable for moving their hearers rather than for seeming to be moved themselves : the manner of a man who is for the most part calm , at home on his topic , and therefore in his way of treating it , yet soberly intent ; in earnest , yet self-possessed ; rising at times into fervor or pathos , which yet is subdued by the solemnity of his subject and the re* sponsibility of his station . There are living examples in men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but among the most acceptable and successful ministers of our day ; and if it were not invidious , we would name one in particular , who occupies a conspicuous pulpit in one of our large cities , and whose way of preaching is as remarkable for ease and naturalness as for salutary impression . We are not alone in thinking that another and an inferior standard of pulpit eloquence prevails extensively , not only among the people , but among those ministers who , from their position , ought to rectify instead of humoring popular prejudices . And apart from our private judgment , we have heard so many intelligent persons , both ministers and laymen , express their dish satisfaction with what we have call ed false animation in the pulpit , that we believe the evil is more common than our readers might hastily suppose ; and we are sure it is one of the causes that generally impair the impressiveness of preaching . 0 . E. D. THE EVANGELICAL ALLIANCE . THE long expected meeting of the Evangelical Alliance is now a fact of history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian world , to consider its results and form our opinion of the plans ma , tured . Our readers are already familiar with the transactions of the meeting , as detailed in the religious and other journals . Without spending time , therefore , to chronicle its proceedings , we pass // directly to the work of review and discussion . This great convocation of Chris . tians , assembled for fifteen successive days , in Freemason 's Hall , Great Queen Street , London , may be viewed in two distinct lights or aspects ; as a meeting of Christians engaged in acts of prayer and communion , or as a council assembled to deliberate on common interests pertaining to the church of God and establish permanent modes of cooperation for its different branches . In the former aspect , it exhibits a truly sublime and thrilling spectacle . Nothing like it has ever transpired in the history of our world . Viewed as an exhibition of the Christian spirit and its power to assimilate men of different creeds and nations , to melt diversities of form and sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brotherhood and joy which not even the barriers of language can restrain ; no spectator from the other side of the world , can be less than powerfully moved by it . What power , therefore , it must have had over those who were not spectators , but actors in the scene , we may easily imagine . They believed in the unity of the spirit before , but the truth of faith , held in forms of language , was so far transcended by the truth of power and feeling , that it seemed even a discovery . Love itself was a discovery . They poured outafulness from their hearts which they never knew was in their hearts before . Their very disagreements and controversies held in reserve , only made their communion more sublime , as it was closer to peril and poured itself over boundaries and hedges in the understanding , which the heart did not know . Even the actual disagreements , which occurred , as some woujd say to mar the beauty of the scene , only make it more beautiful to us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christian love and brotherhood to transcend even actual and present obstacles . Had twelve hundred Christian disciples from all the four quarters of the globe , men distinguished for character and influence in the church of God , assembled , in this manner , simply to worship and commune together as the servants of Christ their common Lord , it could not be said they had met in vain . Perhaps it might not have been wise to meet simply for this purpose . Had they done so , it might have seemed that so great an effort* to get up a scene was hardly dignified . But having in view ulterior objects of sufficient practical consequence to call them together , it was good , good for them and good for all the Christian brotherhood represented by them , to see how Christ will fuse all hearts that believe in him , in a common love and joy . In this view , and especially when we turn to consider the results of this convocation in other respects , we are glad that so large a portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a devotional character . The prayers that have not come to us were undoubtedly wiser than the speeches and deliberations that have . And the speeches , some of which were very good , had their value rather in the greetings poured out , the responses circulated , the vows pledged , than as efforts of deliberative wisdom and council . The body was , in fact , disqualified for council , by its numbers ; but that which took aivay its capacity for deliberation enhanced its capacity for a good enthusiasm and the gift of tongues , and , as it was a small Christendom within itself , made it a more glowing symbol of that spiritual fire , which Christ has kindled in the hearts of his followers . That good results of a general and permanent character will flow from these meetings of the Alliance , taken as meetings for worship and communion , we have no doubt They have made *n experi* // mental proof of the Christian spirit , such as will hereafter produce a more conscious brotherhood in all the churches of God throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did not know before , but it is something to see the truths we hold become a feeling and a conscious power-much to those who know no truth as real , save when it comes as a feeling . This demonstration too , may have a degree of consequence , when taken as a visible confutation of the outcry of schism , perpetually echoed by the Romish and Anglican priesthood and all the adherents of church authority ; for the interminable strifes and heresies by which they are wont to prove that private judgment is the mother of all evil , are here shown to be fictions mostly of their own creation . We say a visible confutation-a real we have always had ; for every Christian among us of only ordinary intelligence has always been aware of a radical unity among all the evangelical churches ; and nothing has been easier than to show , nothing has been oftener shown , than the fact of a radical unity in their written formularies . The only difficulty has been that the priestly religions , perpetually exercised in what is visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our argument , because it did not address itself to their eyes . Now their eyes are accommodated . In this view , the doctrinal basis assumed by the Alliance , however much we may deplore it as the basis of a permanent organization , has at least some value , as an occasional demonstration . There is also another aspect of this great convocation at London , which is quite unique , and in which we specially rejoice . It was a grand ecumenical assembly of laymenno , not of laymen , for that is a word which implies ecclesiastical subordination-but of Christians , of disciples . There were no priests , no ecclesiastics , no church officers of kind in the body . They met as disciples only . They came together , in their own pure voluntaryism , to speak what they believed , and feel what they would like to feel , trammeled by nothing , save their own human infirmities . It was a new spectacle , having no parallel in the past history of the Christian world . No council ever before assembled has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love and the moral grandeur of holy principle . No bishops in their robes of office , no papal nuncios clad in the symbols of God 's vicegerency , no princes in trappings of royalty , no military at the door , nor prison hard by where the heretics are chained waiting their trial , no scholastic dogmas proposed , no contests of logic , no intrigues on foot to secure some ecclesiastical promotion , or turn the scale of ecclesiastical politics-none of these are here ; but the great assembly meet as Christian disciples ; they confer ; they pour out their hearts , they flow together in the common bonds of love , acrossthe common barrier of nations , names , languages and even mutual controversies ; and , after fifteen days of communion disturbed by no controversy , save about a question of practical humanity , in which they differ only as regards modes and incidents , they return to their homes with hearts enlarged , purposes to serve the common cause of their Redeemer fortified by mutual pledges and the assurance of mutual prayers . This we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christian assembly , and we thank God that such a spectacle has at length appeared in our world . Let the priests and princes of Christendom , let all who are wont to think that dignity consists in a show of dignitaries , look this way and gather hence , if they can , whether Christ 's disciples , uniting as disciples , are able to dignify their assembly , by what of grace heaven will bestow , // without such accidents of ' power and circumstance as they may contribute . Or if they conclude otherwise , let them put their diplomacies at work , let them select their place , adjust their precedences , appoint their officials , and dress out their embassies ; let the heralds sound , on the appointed morning , and the princes and church dignitaries flow to their places , and then let them try , for fifteen successive days , what subject , in what manner they please , and see how much of brotherly consent , of holy truth and sacred magnanimity , their great church council may embody ; how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deadly rancors . At the same time , there are evil consequences connected with this meeting at London , taken in its occasional aspect , which we seriously deplore . It has made a new division among the Christians of England , particularly the dissenting Christians , such as will greatly weaken the power and embarrass the progress of just that interest , in whose success we ought most earnestly to sympathize  --  the interest , we mean , of what , in England , is rather barbarously called " Voluntaryism . " The church of God , in England , can never be settled on any proper basis , whether of truth , or of practical harmony , until the established church , as such , is removed , or separated from the state . We say this , not as denying that there is much to be desired and revered , and abundant examples of earnest Christian piety , in the ministry of the establishment . In our review of Bishop Brownel l 's charge , * we threw off a character of the established clergy of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extravaganza , answering to the charge itself , but was , in fact , taken , we believe , a little more literally than it was meant . If a closer in- 14 spection of the establishni*nt since that time , has in any respect mitigated our judgment of its Christian merits , it has quite as much aggravated our conviction of its noxious power as an establishment , and of the solemn necessity that it should be separated from the civil state ; as being , in that connexion , the greatest hindrance to spiritual religion and the worst inlet of error existing in the Protestant world . As an establishment , it sympathizes with power more than with truth , and lives in the argument of interest more than in purposes of duty and mercy to man . Its aliment is policy more than Christian love . On every form of spiritual religion , whether within or without itself , it casts a baleful shadow of discouragement . It turns the lion frown of the realm , the compacted frown of fashion , station , wealth , law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will en . deavor to assert the simple lifegiving truths of Christ and a spiritual faith . Every good and free thought withers under it . And , what is lot less hurtful , it creates a false antagonism , in which power on one side , is set against truth on the other , throwing every disciple of truth off his balance and occupying his mind with animosities , when it should be occupied with inquiries . Two consequences follow , the develOpment of truth is an irregular , insufficient and distorted process , and truth , when it is found , has none of the rights of truth . Power meets it , not evidence ; policy not argument ; and thus , having in itself neither power nor policy , it fails of its victory . Scarcely does it tend to unity ; for unity can be settled manifestly on no basis but that of truth . In this view , we most deeply regret , as one of the immediate effects of the Alliance , that it has drawn off so large a body of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving a part of their * New Englander , ii , 143 . VOL . V. // number , alienated in feeling , to contend alone and perhaps with a degree of exasperation that will fatally hinder their success . It was on this account that the party now active against the establishment protested so earnestly beforehand against the Alliance , as a romantic and visionary scheme , proposing , for the sake of a sentimental but impracticable unity , to sacrifice an effort , in the final success of which , all practical unity lies . Most earnestly , therefore , do we regret that our American friends in the Alliance have allowed the American churches to be drawn into an apparent sympathy with the romantic party and away from the party with whom all our natural sympathies lie . Quite as much do we regret that this latter party , whose influence properly moderated we wanted with us in our opposition to slavery , have been thrown over , by their repugnance to the Alliance and their determination if possible to crush it , into the hands of Garrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will nullify their influence here , and make them exasperated against their brethren to such a degree as will weaken their assault upon the establishment . Whereas there ought to be a close bond of amity and mutual good understanding between us to assist the success of both . Thus , immediately after the Alliance adjourned , a great meeting was called in ExeterHall , by the leading men of the Anti-church-andState party , to turn a tide of feeling against , and , if possible , overwhelm the Alliance . It was a vast assemblage , filling the hall to overflowing , and was probably the most excited meeting that has been held in England for many years . Lloyd Garrison and George Thompson were the chief speakers ; and they poured out such a deluge of scorn , as they were able , upon the English ministers , for having truckled to the Americans ; and upon the Americans , for their hypocritical and sanetimonious support of slavery ; every word charged with sentiments and opinions concerning slavery and slave-holding Christians , *travagant and fanatical beyond all terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the assembly . The London Patriot , reporting the proceedings , next day , to the extent of fifteen columns , records its opinion that the verdict of death against the Evangelical Alliance is here pronounced by the English people . An immediate result , therefore , of the happy union , within the Alliance , is a great and painful division without , one that can result only in serious practical mischief to a cause , in England , with which we specially sympathize , as involving the dearest interests of religionnot to speak of a second division , by which the supporters of this cause are separated from us and infected with sentiments as repugnant to our better judgment , as their hostility is to our feelings . Doubtless it will be said that the dissenting members of the Alliance are not required , by the terms of their union with it , to withhold their opposition to the establishment . And truly they are not . But their moral position , the ideal that fills their mind , will withhold them as effectively as any express stipulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that remoter and more practical unity , which can spring only out of the ruins of the establishment , who will be so inconsiderate as to hope that the remote will not be lost in the proximate , and every word be deprecated that can disturb the sentimental peace of to-day ? Having sacrificed their judgments to their sentiments , the practical to the romantic , they will nurse the delicate illusion they have embraced , and please themselves in the hope that love will , at length , melt down the establishment without their arguments . how the Alliance will operate , in this point of view , is to be // seen by the course of Sir Culling Eardly Smith , the chairman , immediately after its formation at Liverpool . HPhad been connected with a society designed to act against the establishment . But the first thing done by him , after the incipient organization at Liverpool , of which he ' was appointed chairman , was to remonstrate with Dr. Campbell , one of his old coadjutors , in a printed letter , on account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he deemed an offense against the new sentimental unity just about to be . Whereupon the Doctor replied in a somewhat furious but just castigation of his tameness and inconsistency . Som&amp; have imagined that the union of a respectable body of the established clergy with the Alliance , is a compensation for the loss thus incurred , and is likely even to loosen , at length , the foundations of the establishment . So far from this , it is our opinion that , if they had been hired by the Church to go out thus and connect themselves with the dissenters , thereby dividing their strength , setting them in conflict with each other , and holding a large party tn peace with the establishment , the operation would have been a good one . These good men of the establishment are moved we know by no such sinister design . Yet they cling to the establishment as the ark of God , and are not a whit more loosened from it by their new alliance , than they were before by their character . And as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity it invokes , their ark is safe , even though it be to the end of the world . Truth also obliges us to say , what should not be concealed from the American churches , that the movers of the Alliance in England and Scotland are , to a great extent , persons who , in one way or another , were prepared beforehand to he on good terms with the establishment . Doing full honor to the good Christian feeling which , as an immediate or superficial cause , prompted their desire of a more enlarged Christiaa union , we must yet say that there were deeper causes , partly negative , partly positive , disposing to the effect , with which we have the least possible sympathy . The most real and efficient causes are often those which lie back even of consciousness . Thus a very large portion of the Alliance consists of members of the English and Scotch establishments . These of course are friends and upholders of establishments . Secondly , the Methodists of England compose another and very large fraction of the Alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country , that they have never yet been completely emancipated from the establishment . They take no manly , open part against it-they cower under it and can not , to this day , acknowledge thenselves frankly to be dissenters from it . Indeed they consider themselves to be a kind of abnormal order under the establishment , and some of them read the whole Liturgy even to the prayer for " our bishops , priests and deacons . " Just before this Alliance was proposed , they were beginning to take bolder ground , and it was earnestly hoped that they were about to assume a stand worthy of their principles . That hope is dissipated . They are in the Alliance as fast friends of the establishment , and so they will continue till it is dissolved . Another important portion of the Alliance is drawn from the Free Church of Scotland , and a large body of the members of that church are known still to adhere theoretically to church establishments . It will even be discerned , in conversation with them , that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again by the state and set on the footing of an established order . They are not weaned from this hope by their suecesses. // They understand so little as yet what is due to their age , and the meaning of what God is teach . ing them in their experiment , that if the government would but yield the point in dispute , they would " change their way " and go back to Egypt within the first six months , carrying with them the funds , which our American churches bestowed as a blessing on their voluntaryism . A few noble spirits would resist , but only a few . It will be seen that under the power of such affinities they were ready , of course , apart from all spiritual fervors , to be on good terms with the establishment ; though doubtless it is pleasant to them all to have their ecclesiastical inclinations covered by a motive so pious and worthy as Christian unity . A fourth class remains , which is composed of English Independents , or of Baptists and Congregationalists . Of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly opposed to the connection of church and state stand aloof from the Alliance . Still , many of those who are in it have been known heretofore , as the partizans of voluntaryism . They so regard themselves now . But it requires a little study for American Christians to understand how liable they were to let the Christian fervor , indulged in their new zeal for unity , blend with a less worthy influence . Thus it must not be overlooked as a fact , that a dissenting minister , as such , in England , has no social standing . He is classed with third-rate tradesmen , and can never rise above his class , except as he forces his way upward by some remarkable demonstration of talent . Meantime the lines of society are sharply drawn , and a spirit of homage to rank , little short of worship , pervades the whole community . Therefore a man who feels five or six distinct layers of society resting upon him , to crush him into the earth , must be somewhat more than a man , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those who occupy a higher circle , and be on terms of mutual intercourse and respect with them . If * can escape all personal motives , he is tempted , as a good man , by the hope of enlarging his influence . We are well aware how easy it is to impute to men motives that are latent and do not agree with their professions . But really it is not so much our design to blame as to commiserate . Nothing so much afflicts an American minister , on entering England , as to discover what a weight of social depression rests upon the dissenting ministry . It is a discovery . He pities the fact , and , though he often admires the brave spirit with which they struggle up uijder the load , feeling that he himself might be crushed by it , he is sometimes obliged to recognize , with the great . er sadness , the effects of that terrible oppression under which they are humbled . We have dwelt thus largely upon the relations of the Alliance to the church question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a very important sense , of the Christian world . And it becomes American Christians , before all others , to see that the influence they have is not , by any implication , lent to a movement which discourages an effort wherein the dearest interests of religion , throughout christendom , are so deeply involved . The four great classes comprised in the Alliance , we have seen , are composed of persons who stand in a relation , either of positive affinity with or subserviency to the establishment . And as long as they continue in this effort after unity ,  --  no matter with how much of Christian fervor , it becomes us to understand that they will assuredly make flO advance of opinion themselves , in regard to one of the greatest questions of the age , and will hinder the success of those who are struggling as with death , to achieve one of the greatest vic // tories for spiritual religion ever attempted by man . Jn this view , it is much to be regretted that our Americatt*brethren did not insist upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would give the Alliance a different character . It was an oversight which they will probably regret themselves . Another result of the meeting at London , which we earnestly deprecate , is that , without having attempted any thing in behalf of Protestantism , they have done what they could to tighten the bigotry of Protestantism and modernize its title to odium . It lay with such an assembly , gathered in such an age as this from all parts of the habitable earth , to make some demonstration of enlarged views and catholic feelings . And above all , when they came together professedly to realize the unity of the Spirit and fortify the bonds of love . Still more , when the love was so manifestly kindled to a living glow in their assemblies . And yet , they dared to love only by their creeds and catechisms . F hey could not pray and offer praise to their Redeemer , without propositions on their table to sanctify the exercise . Not having it on hand to establish a new church-not undertaking even to be responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a creed as a test of membership . Undertaking only a spiritual and practical unity , they were yet jealous of the spiritual and practical , lest possibly it might appear that some men are able to love God and his people , whose names and opinions they a little more disliked than they did others held among themselves . What could be more frightfbl than to think of loving God in comtnon with a pious Quaker , Catholic or tJnitarian , who might choose to come into their assembty ! No doubt there may be such ; this they were obliged to confess , but they were afi-aid to embrace , in love , all whom God embraces . So to make the unity of the Spirit more select , they must still go back upon their dogmatistn , making this the test and measure of that spiritual grace , which is the basis of practical unity ; and then , to relieve their predicament , doubling its absurdity by the formal concession that it is no test at all , and that many are included who are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have made up , designedly and with their eyes open , a schismatic unity , subjecting thei*selves to a charge which does not lie against the closest forms of church order  --  a unity composed of one part of God 's elect , to the exclusion of another  --  and this in a grand effort after the very unity of the body of Christ . The narrowness and odiousness of ch an organization was the more felt in England , because a great number of the best and holiest men in England are found among the Quakers . There came over also from Germany , a man who had long been struggling with the bonds of delusion and the arts of priestcraft in the Romish church , and had , at length , burst forth alone , in the might of a soul armed by faith in God , to assert the liberty wherewith Christ had made him free . Baffled by the intrigues of enemies , cursed by all manner of obloquy , turning hither and thither , in vain , to find some righteous sympathy , weary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great convocation to be held at London , where the friends of God were to meet and forget their names , and blend their common sympathies in the common burdens of their warfare . There was the place fur a lone soldier of Ch rist to rest hitriself , to gather fresh courage and he cheered to his duty by the voices of the Christian world . He came to the door of the assemblythe propositions voted were offered him . Poor nan ! he could not sign them all . It was not enough that he came in thc baptism of the Spiritnot enough that he had b6rne more // hardness for the name of God than they all . He was weak , but the propositions had no pity ; he was struggling alone , with his armor on , against the mightiest bulwark of error in Christendom , but the propositions were for them that live at ease and luxuriate in sentimental fervors . Czerski therefore withdraws ; the rejected apostle retraces his steps to Germany , not , we trust , with maledictions in his heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rejected of men can sufficiently compassionate . Never was there shown by Christian men a more sad example of fatuity . We have no words to express the sorrow and shame we felt when the news of this transaction , perpetrated in the name of the Protestant world , came to our ears . Bc it that Czerski had errorsgreat and dangerous errors-bred in such an element , who would not have ? Enough that he wanted to pray and worship  --  and spiritual unity was afraid to pray with him . We only add , in this connection , that if the object of the Alliance had been , not to exhibit a spiritual unity , but to promote a closer doctrinal unity , the dogmatic basis assumed was scarcely less objectionable . The first thing requisite in such an effort , manifestly was to make a formal surrenderof infallibility ; to unite in a modest confession that Protestant divisions indicate Protestant errors , therefore that every man is called upon to yield the possibility of errors in his own church and also in F'rotestantism itself-errors which a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love only can remove : - accordingly that when the grand result is reached , and that final basis of truth is developed , on which the church of the future is to rest in settled unity , it may be something different from any scheme of dogmas now conceived , and may contain elements contributed by all Christian bodies , not excluding the church of Rome itself . To begin therefore with a doctrinal basis was to begin with the end , laying down rough timbers which may require to be torn up and refitted afterward , and thus to obstruct , at the outset , all the results intended . Not to speak of Christian philosophy , a very slight attention to the work in hand , coupled with a little practical insight , should have rectified this inversion , and proved the infelicity of a doctrinal basis of any kind , at the beginning of the movement . Unhappily they could not conceive the possibility that there was any defect or unripeness in any dogmas which they all could draw out of their own confessions . We come now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent organization , proposed for the churches of God , in different parts of the world . And , first of all , it is to be noted that the meeting at London was , in this view , a failure . The members after all were not able to propose any organization which should be general , or universal , but left the Christians ofdifferent nations to form separate organizations of their own . So that if any thing more is to be done we are to have evangelical alliances , not an Evangelical Alliance ; unities , not unity . Then it is to be seen , afterwards , whether the several unities can recognize each other , or will want another formed to 1nite them . And it is already intimated that if the Evangelical Alliance that is to be , of the United States , admits slave-holders , the Evangelical Alliance ofGreat Britain will not touch its hand . Absurd and fanatical as we believe such a conc Insion to be , the anti-slavery sentiment in England will assuredly compel it . 01 ) no other ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And thus it appears , that if our American friends carried their points manfully in the debates on the slavery questi6n , so unhand- // 111 somely forced upon them , they did it , after all , at the expense of defeating both themselves and their antagonists and blowing the whole scheme into the air . We blame them not for this ; we only wish that , forseeing the evil , as they did at the beginning , they had moved a kind of organization that would have excluded the question . The great and staring fault of the whole plan , that which , from the beginning , was so often and earnestly protested against by sagacious men , both here and in England , is that it proposes no object , nothing practical to be done . Before the meeting at London , Dr. Chalmers published a pamphlet , addressed to the chairman of the Alliance , in which he urged the friends of the movement by the most cogent and luminous arguments , such as lay within the compass of his gifted mind , to cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worthy to unite all good men , leaving any to engage in it who can come into the spirit of the object , bear what name they will . He suggests not an Evangelical , but a Protestant Alliance , and that with " no articles of agreement save one , or at most two  --  the first a *villingness to co-operate in all such present measures as themselves may deem advisable , for defending a purely scriptural religion against the inroads of Popery ; and secondly , if it is thought best in prospective measures fur perfecting and making palpable to the world that union which ought to subsist among true Christians . " What these " prospective measures " looking towards a perfecting of union may be , he does not fuliy know , at present , and can only conjecture dimly . Possibly , when the members are sufilciently drawn together by common struggles under the first article , they may raise committees of the most judicious and capable minds , who may try their hand on theological questions and sce whether , step by step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create , as a last fact , a doctrinal basis . But this he leaves to the future . Meantime let the Alliance undertake a practical object under the first article , put on the harness of toil and duty , and try what they can do for the common faith of Protestants . Here he is full and explicit . And the word " Protestant " which he would have them take , as a part of their title , contains all-they are to stand for Protestantism  --  to assert and maintain the " prior " truth , on which all the " ulterior " truths to be established hang , viz. " that Scripture is the repertory of all truth . " - Vindicate " private judgment " and the reading of the Scriptures-combat the " advances of Romish superstition " - ascertain the " statistics of Puseyism and High Churchism , the great feeders of Popery in our island .

Thus engaged , the Alliance will have an object , which is a first reason for the existence of every thing ; and here we can not forbear quoting him more at large " Perhaps we urge them too soon ; but we can not help thinking that in the con. templanon of a vague , and vast , and voluminous undertaking . many of them i.e. of the Alliance are beginning to feet at a loss how , or by what practicat means , they shatt be conducted onward ; or in other words , what they shalt turn in , and how emptoy themselves next . It witt not do for the thing to evaporate , as many other magnificent enterprises have , in the mere phantasmagoria of committeeship and sub-coinmitteeship , wiih an imposing show of officials , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eloquent demonstrations , but are sadly at fault for the materials of business , or how to assign an operative process by which they might advance towards the completion of the object on which they have met . Now it does appear to me , that , whether they shall assurne the title ofProtestant Alliance or not , the best way in which this felt dcsideratum , this want of something to do , could be met , were to engage , arid that immediately , in the proper work of such an association . And it isa work , too , which should come first in order , even fir the attainment of that ultimate object which suggested the Alliance . " In these eloquent words , we have not only the emphatic wisdom of a broad and sagacious mind , but we have also a heavy and just satire upon what is the perpetual infirmity of a large class of English Christians , most forward on aH great occasions . They are good men , but not thinking men . Their piety gurgles in a warm flood through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their head . They luxuriate in their e*notions , but are specially avet-se to the effort requisite to a thorough and sharp examination of a subject , or an undertaking . Their wisdom is to be evangelical , and whatever they may think or attempt un ( lCr that name , is assumed to be wise . Grand assemblages and great speeches , going off with rounds of applause , are ultimate ends in themselves . In the ordinary , i. e. in their preaching and piety , they show a s'yle of goodishness fitly represented by Henry 's commentary ; in the extraordinary , they rise into sublimity by inflation and the swell of the occasion . And having , withal , a certain satisfaction in being Englishmen , they rest on the wisdom of their flatulent emotions , as confidently as if they were solid conclusions . We are truly astonished when we read over the eloquent pages of Chalmers and ponder his massive arguments , that any class of men accounted intelligent could be unaffected by them . It seems impossible that his luminous and cogent expostula tions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of the Alliance to perceive the practical necessity of revising their plan . But they had thought of union , a grand evangelical union ! They had met already at Liverpool , and there they had been lifted into a higher and holier sphere ! The basis was already laid , the name was given , and the summons had already gone forth , calling the churches of the nations to meet in London and feel what they had felt , the grandeur of union ! The chapels here and there were occupied with love appointments , and the day was preparing ! Having their eye thus filled with the prospect of a great and thrilling occasion , how could they listen to the remonstrances of wisdom ? We are able also to add , that the rock on which they split , the slavery question , was explicitly pointed out to not a few of their leaders beforehand , and a modification of their plan was suggested that would perfectly remove and exclude that difficulty , saving all their principles , securinrr all their objects . The suggestion visibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their minds were pre-occupted with the great occasion in prospect ! It can not enough be regretted that this movement , begun as it was by good men , actuated by a right and good feeling , drew so little upon deliberative wisdom and careful forecast . It was blown up by speeches , and in speeches we fear it will end . What Christian undertaking ever lived , that di ( not propose to serve God in some practical object ? If a man can not ? ive on sentiment , how can a body of men ? Having no thing on hand to do and the day of novelty being passed , what is there left to minister emotion or sustain vitality ? Doubtless it is *veil to circulate the kiss of charity ; but we do not live for that object , and if we have not something to do // that shall put us in a glow and warm the kiss , it must soon he as cold to feeling as the lips of death . It was said in the meeting at London , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the meeting , that it is even an excellence of the plan adopted that it undertakes no action ; that having unity and fraternal fellowship for its object , it will dwell in a purer and holier atmosphere , inasmuch as the noise and smoke of labor are far away . But it is not best to go to heaven before our time , or to think that we are of course nearer to heaven , because we are pleased with sentimentalities separated from duties . Besides , if sentiment is our object , by what law shall we feed the life of sentiment , and , above all , fellow sentiment , unless by a fellowship in holy struggles and common perils and sacrifices ? In what other way do men knit themselves together , and go clear of the narrow passions , jealousies and incipient animosities that dwell in their nature , so effectually , as when they become fellow soldiers in the march , the watch , or the siege . Brought together into this Alliance which proposes only to express , feel and cultivate a sentimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road side , wheeling upon one another and standing in all the flimsy attitudes of ease ? The only unity we have is in the harness . But when we are put to the draught , then shall we all wheel into line , and every foot and muscle will be set in tension by the pull we are io make . This is practical unity , an earnest , sound bodied reality . It is nota a rhetorical holiday sentiment , pla*r. ing on the surface of the soul to fly away as gracefully . Born of struggle , of toil and work , it is woven into the soul 's eternity , there to adhere and live . Besides , if we understand what Christian unity is , it Is not a thing to be compassed by any direct ef fort . It is no contract , no treaty of peace , it does not come from far . We can not go beyond the sea and bring it back with us . We can not go up into heaven and bring it down with us . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convocations , who discard that first law of existence which requires every being and thing to exist for an object . Unity is an incident , not a principal , or a good by itself . It has its value in the valuable activities it unites , and the conjoining of beneficent powers . We might as well be disunited as united , if we had no ministry or service to be invigorated and condensed by unity . Unity therefore is the shadow of duty , and we might as well attempt to make shadows without substances as to create unity by itself . The more we seek it , the less we have it . We find it , as we find our life , by losing it . No two men are closer to a quarrel than they who are drawn back into some alley debating terms of agreement and defining rights and injuries , under protestations of desire for peace . Let them drop into the boat from a sinking ship , and share the common for tunes and perils of shipwreck ; and they are soon fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle a unity between Christian teachers and sects , by a process of defining and compounding and sifting out divisions of feeling , answers to this comparison . The church of God can never reach a solid and established unity , until it goes into some grand practical struggle , and girds on its armor for some enterprise large enough and perilous enough to absorb , as trifles and fatuities , the oppositions gendered by idle theory and adverse effort . The " prior , " as Chalmers intimates , must precede , the " ulterior " must follow-first the substance , then the shadow . But if we go after a sentimental unity , if we go Qut coursing over the world and back and // forth between nations to bring back shadows , we shall assuredly find , when we open our boxes , that they are gone . Furthermore , we can not but regard any effort undertaken to pro . duce unity , by direct intent , as dan . gerous in proportion to the power it is able to embody . We distrust great bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no active aim and object to limit their proceedings . No matter what name they assume . Be it an " Evangelical " body in which they unite , still they are men under the name . And they are as likely to meddle in that which does not belong to them , the creeds and constitutions of churches , their religious doctrines and opinions , their relations to each other , and the fidelity of their members , as they are to get power tG do it successfully . We can not detail the crotchety fancies which we have seen creeping through the brains of some of the English members of the Alliance , probably the weaker members-such as that it will byand-bye undertake a new and perfect translation of the Bible , become a tribunal of love for the adjustment of quarrels , and finally of all disagreements . Of this we make little save that straws will sometimes indicate a current , when rocks will not . Enough that the Alliance begins with laying down a doctrinal basis , a platform , which every member has some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing more certain to us , than that such a society , as soon as it may embody a large and preponderant influence , burning in every member after unity and bent on dispelling diversity , will begin to reflect odium on intractable ministers and churches , to suggest formularies , to show what may be held and what given up , and where is a good place for the world to meet . A sense of power yields to no limits prescribed by mere forbearance . When power has a desire , it will also be found that desire has a power . It was precisely this view of the Alliance which made it so obnoxious to Archbishop Whately . He foresaw that it would disturb the internal order and law of the church of God and thus become an instrument of mischief . He was right , also , in the opinion that God wants no tribunal out of the Church to preside over it or reform it . At present , we know that the views of the Alliance are more modest . And if it be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will create the liability we speak of , is ever to be hoped for , it is no satisfactory argument for the plan that it never can be powerful enough to be dangerous . There is likely also to be found , in any direct effort after unity , a false assumption , in regard to the extent and the evils of division , which , if the effort be long continued , will harden itself into a fixed conviction , and will thus create a public dishonor for the body of Christ , without preparing a remedy . The strongest representations will be made continually of the strifes that divide brethren-diverse names and families in the church of God will be set forth as radical divisions , and all the false imputations raised by scoffers and infidels will be set forth as accepted truths . Some of the speeches made on this head , in the meeting at London , were exceedingly shallow and mischievous . The main thing is now and ever has been to unsay exactly what is said in all such representations  --  to maintain that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by saying that we are divided , where before we were not . The tongue is the fire , and if we had no tongues wherewith to talk ourselves into enmity , we should have no enmity to talk of . Not that we should have the complete love of angels . There must be so much of discord as there is of sin . Whoever holds a different // expectation , contradicts Christianity instead of doing it honor . He demands a super-Christian urnty , requiring it of man , as a Christian , that he will act , under grace , as if he wanted neither grace nor forgiveness . Besides , most of what we call division in the church of God is only distribution . The distribution of the church , like that of human society , is one of the great problems of divine wisdom , and the more we study it , observing how the personal tastes , wants and capacities of men , in all ages and climes , are provided for , and how the parts are made to act as mutual stimulants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think that the work of distribution is done badly . Neither is there , after all , any so bitter animosity between Christians of different names , as there often is between those who worship together , and who only feel the more cordial disaffection , all their lives long , because of their proximity . And so little is there of unity often , where there is most of it in name , that within the church of Rome , which taunts us daily with our divisions , there are really more sects and a greater number of deadly feuds , all kept alive by the jealousies and rivalries of the ecclesiastical orders and the ambitious strifes of convents , of bishops , abbots and cardinals , and of those who seek to be either one or the other , than within the whole circle of Protestantism . Therefore any society whose object is unity only , and whose interest therefore it is to exaggerate and misconstrue all the signs of division , is very nearly certain to make more division than unity , and to throw upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not realities ) of its own creation . Bitt we must manifest our unity , it is said by those who can take a deeper and juster view of the subject . We want a society , they say , not to create unity but to exhibit the unity which really exists . What then do we manifest now , but exactly all we have to manifest , neither more nor less ? Doubtless some men , in the exercise of their malignity , or because they are too shallow to judge us rightly , do us injustice . Shall we therefore set up a fiction of love to balance their fiction of malignity ? This setting out to make manifestations of ourselves artificially will be looked upon , by every thciughtful person , as a rather delicate business . The man who has nothing better to do than to manifest what he is , is very sure to manifest just what he is not . It is our affair to have the virtue Christ requires of us ; for the manifestation of it he has provided fixed laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we undertake to shine over and above being luminous , we have much upon our hands , and it is questionable how we may get on . And it is exactly here that we have a heavy charge to bring against the Alliance . Take up for example the ninth article of its doctrinal basis , which asserts " The divine institution of the Christian ministry , and the obligation and perpetuity of baptism and the Lord 's Supper . Having it on hand to manifest a unity not before manifested , it gravely comes before the world with this united declaration , holding it forth as sign of unity . It is accidentally possible that they can agree , in these forms of words , but every one knows that the moment the words are penetrated and the thin covering of a mere logical statement is torn off , they are seen to be in radical and irreconcilable disagreement ! They can not agree whether a Christian minister is a priest or not a priest , or what is the power and duty of a Christian minister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be recognized in the ministerial office ! There are ministers , in the assembly itself , // who will never , by any public act , acknowledge or advise their people to acknowledge any one act performed by others present , as a valid ministration-such too as will earnestly deny the Christian right of any ministry not in three orders and not derived from Episcopal ordination ! So in regard to baptism , they can not agree , either in regard to the significance , or the effiacy ,  - -  the subjects , or the manner of baptism ! One sect represented in the meeting has actually withdrawn from the others represented in it , on this very ground , and will not even go to the table of Christ in their company , or suffer them to come to their own ! If we speak of manifesting unity , we ask whether this kind of manifestation is fair ? We impute no disingenuous design to the meeting ; we have the greatest confidence in the simplicity of their intentions and the purity of their aims ; nevertheless their zeal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of real but of constructive hypocrisy ! And the same may be said , though with less emphasis , of all the nine propositions adopted by the Alliance . The moment we open up the words to ask for the substantial ideas under them , a considerable and often important diversity is discerned . All these general propositions , therefore , when offered as a manifestation of unity , ( which they are not when adopted by churches , ) become unfair , inasmuch as they do not represent the whole case as it is . And , in this light , they are liable to serious objections . The real fact as regards unity , is better manifested , and more truly , without them than with them . We say again that whoever undertakes an artificial mnnifestation of good of any sort , has a delicate business on his hands . Indeed we do not see why a society to manifest humility , or patience , or faith in God , is not as truly within the limits of propriety , as a society to manifest unity , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifest unity is to have it and let it manifest itself . We could have some sympathy with a society to cultivate and exercise unity , but with one to manifest unity . we frankly say we have none . Least of all have we any sympathy with such a kind of unity , as thinks to be manifested in nine propositions . It is not the same thing as Christian unity to be huddled into a small enclosure , or to show the world how small a plat of ground we can all stand upon . Unity is a grace broad as the universe . Like the universe itself , which is its outward type , it embraces , in its ample bosom , all right minds that live , outreaching the narrow content of all words and dogmas and even worlds of being . It is a boundless feeling , which , therefore , is not representable in opinions , or forms of speech , or utterances of any kind . rJ7here is yet another view of this doctrinal basis , which , we suspect , is , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is remarkable how vague , and various , and inconsistent are the conglomerated notions embodied in the Alliance and expressed by its members . It was necessary , it is said , to have some definite terms of membership , otherwise persons would come into the Alliance , with whom it would injure the Christian comfort of the greater part to associate . In this view , the doctrinal basis is laid down not to manifest unity , but to produce separation-it constructs a gulf , not a continent . By what law them are these nine propositions selected ? Is it because they measure and determine Christian character ? rphat is not pretended . Is it because ihey measure and contain the truths essential to the efficacy of the Gospel as an instrument of the world 's regeneration ? What then does the Baptist think of immersion ; the Establishment , of three // orders of clergy ; and a large body of dissenters , of the independence of the church as related to political patronage and power ? Do they thea pick up certain convenient truths , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in arbitrary measure , apart from any principle of classification whatever , save that they will keep out certain persons selected or singled out for this doom beforehand ? Undoubtedly this latter question opens the truth of their proceeding . They have laid down these nine propositions simply because they would , not because they are fit measures , whether of character , or of essential truth . They have used principles as mere conveniencies to their own will , and because the principles would serve as pickets for just the fence they wished to build ! To argue the question , whether this be a fit or even dignified use of principles , would be itself an abuse of principle . Besides , it is proposed , in this Alliance , to unite the great brotherhood of Christ , not to compose a church ; and here the Christian law pertaining is that which determines the recognition of strangers . For strangers are to be tested , not by the creed or catechism they bring with them , but by the living epistle written in their heart ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read of all men . If a stranger remains in England for months or years , what Christian even asks him for his creed to know whether he shall be recognized as a disciple ? Still further what right has any Christian body , striving after the unity of the spirit throughout the world , confessedly to break that unity , by an arbitrary selection , turning God 's principles into fences against those who are inhabited by His spirit ? Is it then obligatory on such a body , it will be asked , to go into a promiscuous herd with all who choose to assume the Christian name ? We admit the inconve nience to feeling and even to order , which would probably ensue . Indeed we could wish to have the body more select than it is now . Nor is there any the least difficulty in making it so . It is only requisite to give up the idea of spiritual unity , as a law of organization , and give the body something to do . For it is even easier to exclude the unworthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they can have no sympathy ; than it is to do it by confessions or terms of belief , which every one knows will admit those who are without a trace of Christian piety , or even a character of common respect among men . By their fruits ye shall know them , not by their dogmas , or opinions . Select doings are a closer test than select propositions , and are withal , in better keeping , as a test , with God 's teachings and commandments . Here again we come back to what is the radical sin of the Alliance , viz , that it began with having nothing to do . Beginning with no practical object , it was obliged to organize itself by tests not found in practical character . Whereas if it had appointed itself to some right undertaking , and to exercises , such as the unbelieving and evil will not relish , it would have had a sufficient test in its works . Nor would it have committed , in that case , any wrong or injury , even if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are believed to be disciples ; inasmuch as it would not have proposed to measure itself by the unity of Christ 's body , but simply by the objects undertaken and the exercises appointed . We shall recur to this point again , in another place , and therefore we add nothing farther here . The practical question now arises , having all the objections in view , what course ought the American churches to adopt in regard to the proposed Alliance ? Shall we en- // 118 Tue Evangelical Alliance . deavor to organize a national branch , as proposed by the meeting at London ? We are very reluctant to answer-no ; because the refusal may seem uncourteous , and because we sincerely regret to have so much of expectation disappointed , so much of preparation fall to naught , and so much of really good feeling excited in Christians of so many different and distant nations thrown back into despair of its object . But we can not , as American Christians , lend ourselves to any movement which , directly or indirectly , fortifies the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are insuperable , except on condition that we renounce our better judgment and what , in fact , we regard as sacred principles- Besides , it is very clear that we can organize no American branch that will be acknowledged by that of England . There is too much good sense among the Christians of this country to think of constituting an Alliance on a basis which denies Christian character to all slaveholders . At a future time , when slavery has been discussed long enough to have laid open its merits , and the principles against it have been fully carried , on the ground of slavery , so that whosoever continues to hold slaves may be fairly presumed to violate , and to violate knowingly , the first principles of humanity , then we shall be ready to deny them the Christian name , and withhold our communion . We can not do it now - least of all can we do it at the dictation of brethren beyond the sea , who do not understand the question , and are themselves governed by the dictation of a blind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they suppose , by Christian humanity ,  --  that which is. willing to judge harshly only when it is sure of judging justly . But if we organize a branch so as not to exclude slaveholders , it is very plain that they will reject all connection with us . They are , in a manner , compelled to it . They can not face the odium of the English nation , so as to hold an organization among themselves , without taking this ground . The sentiments lately declared by Dr. Wardlaw , and what is more , the manners exhibited in his language are , beyond all doubt , a just representation of the attitude that will be assumed by the English branch of the Alliance on this subject . " The American brethren , " he says , " are on trial . If they introduce slaveholders , the repudiation of their deed will then become our duty , and separation from those by whom the pollution has been wilfully contracted . It will be ours to say , with sorrow but with firmness ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerate-we part . " If , then , we wish to throw ridicule upon ourselves , and bring the very name of Alliance into contempt , let us organize an American branch , and then let this grand effort for unity result in the spectacle of two distinct Alliances , one of which refuses to acknowledge the other ! What , then , shall we do ? Our proposition is that we begin at the beginning , and do what ought to have been done at the first , proving the sincerity of our wish to engage with our English brethren , by setting ourselves in such an attitude that , seeing the superiority of our plan , it may be hoped that they will finally modify their scheme to accord with it . We have a society called the Christian Alliance , which has been modestly held back until this time , with a view to give the English brethren that prominence to which their central position might be supposed to entitle them . This Christian Alliance is really the parent of the whole movement , unless some discussions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of Christian union , but which had in fact come to nothing , may be supposed // to have prepared the minds of certain persons there to take a suggestion the more readily . Only it happens that these previous discussions have , in fact , wrought all the mischief we deplore , by turning the minds of certain leaders in a false direction , and away from all that constituted the merit of the American plan . This plan was commended privately to their attention , with a suggestion of modifications , such as we shall now propose . They took enough of the name to spoil it , and rejected every thing else , to go after the bubble of union , with nothing on hand to sustain the life and dignity of the undertaking , but to unite the breath of the Christian world in the inflation of the bubble . Our American plan , with somewhat of American good sense for its characteristic , proposed to rally the united action of the Christian world , in a demand for religious liberty in Italy and other papal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Christians might be drawn more closely towards each other , and united in the bonds of a more conscious fellowship-possibly that all the disagreements which now exist , might be finally removed . In its philosophic reasons , it coincided exactly with the plan suggested by Chalmers , and differed only , by a shade , in its specific object . What we now propose will embody the plan of Chalmers , the American plan , and what can be embodied in coincidence with these , of the plan adopted at London . We propose then to organize not a Protestant Alliance , but a Christian Alliance ; for although our scheme will look towards Rome , in its aim , we prefer to array no conflict between names . Let it be as broad as the world and as open to the Catholic , who can adopt its objects , as it is to the Protestant . Let the constitution begin with a preamble , if it is thought best , which shall set our body in a friendly , but intelligible relation to the English. * Then lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects 1 . To promote by every means consistent with a due respect to the civil order of states and nations , religious liberty ; or the right of every man to have the word of God and to govern his faith and practice by it , clear of all penalties and constraints . 2 . To assert the supreme authority of the Scriptures as the law of all duty and the final arbiter of religious opinions ,  --  doing what may , at any time , seem expedient in the way of argument and moral influence , to resist the encroachments , or convince the adherents and advocates , of any system of religion which acknowledges the coordinate authority of church councils and trilsinals. * Such for example as the following : Convinced that no settled unity is possible , in any part of ' the body of Christ , when taken by itself and separately from the church , nor in the church , save as the members are able to meet in the truth , and that they can meet in the truth only by a common acknowledgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of truth-which also involves as a previous condition the universal freedom of the Christian mind and the discontinuance of all force upon the conscience ; considering also that truth is practical and can not be found as separated from duty  --  and therefore that common struggles arid sacrifices to advance the common cause of our Lord Jesus Christ , having a natural power to assimilate the feelinbgs , are among the preparative causes inherently requisite to assimilate the doctrinal views of believers-which common struggles need also to be maintained by common acts of worship and prayer to God , who is to our fallen nature the source of all right thoughts and dispesitions , as he is of all power and success in righieous endeavors ; considering also that a perfect and settled unity of believers is a last fact and final result of the gospel , and should not therefore be anticipated , by any articles of faith or doctrine assumed as a basis of agreement , but must come in its own order and time , as God shall appoint , requiring possibly important modificai ions in the views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all candor and should not be excluded by formal prejudgments recorded at the be-ginninrWeibe undersigned , &amp;c. // 3 . To accompany our efforts for these objects , by acts of fellowship and prayer , and by whatever exercises may be fitted to promote the unity of the Spirit in our assemblies , or to obtain for ourselves that Divine illumination which is necessary to make us understand our errors , and for all who have corrupted the gospel , that spiritual grace which will incline them toa true reformation ; sothat we and they may , at last , meet in a settled unity , under Jesus Christ our Divine Lord and Redeemer ,  - -  Then will follow the machinery of the organization , including , per . haps , a declaration that we do not propose to be responsible , either for the character , or doctrine of those who engage with us . Aceording to this plan , it will be perceived that we settle no basis of unity whatever , and have in fact nothing to do with unity , save as a result in such shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truths are assumed , as they must be in all action , but only assumed in the active shape . Objects and exercises are , in fact , the tests of membership , no one being excluded by any judgment passed on his character , formally or by implication . Any one may come , under what name he pleases , who can sympathize with our objects . If any one is apprehensive that Quakers , Unitarians , or Roman Catholics , may sometime intrude upon us , their apprehensions are without any Christian reason . lf they come , we should rather rejoice and thank God that they do . As Chalmers truly says , " the atmosphere is ungenial - insomuch that they will either keep away , at the first , or if not assimilated to the general body , will fall away afterwards , - alike repelled by the style of the prayers within and of the performances without . " Still if there be any Quaker who can admit the final authority of Scripture , any Unitarian who can think that this is not a canting assembly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reformation in his church , and can stay with us , and pour out his heart with us in love , we may be sure that there is no so bad an error in his faith , *s to make him dangerous , whatever his words may be . Then as to slavery , that is put in its right place and where it can make us no difficulty ; for the proposed society , though not in form or name an anti-slavery society , must necessarily throw all its influence against slavery as truly as against ecclesiastical oppression . And it has this advantage , that it stands against just those aspects of slavery , which are most plainly hostile to the gospel-its locking up the Bible from the poor , the obstacle it opposes to the free and faithful preaching of Christ , its destructionofsabbaths and of marriage and the rights of chastity , its abolishment , in fact , of all the rights , of God in man as a responsible creature and a redeemed sinner . The whole weight of the society here and throughout the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; inasmuch as they agree , in the destruction of Christian liberty . And it may be well both for the Pope of Rome and the upholders of negro slavery , to find themselves standing out before the world together , as partakers in acommon outrage on the rights of God . This excellence of our plan , as an expedient to relieve the slavery question , was suttgested to many of the movers of the Alliance in England , but they could not hear it . Perhaps they will now see its import and value . Had we been in the Alliance with our American brethren , when the question of slavery was brought into that body , we should have felt as they , did , in regard to the manner in which it appeared and the sentiments advanced . We should most of all have regretted , as we are sure they did , the necessity of maintaining a position , which could not be understood by // the British people , and must leave an impression on their mind , in spite of all disavowals , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meeting the question as they did , we should have moved , first of all , a revision and reconstruction of the whole scheme of the Alliance . Failing in that , we should , at least , have shown the English public what we are willing to do , in reference to slavery ; and then we might take the ground they held , with impunity , though not with more of Christian dignity and manly ability than they displayed in the trying circumstances of the case . We do not propose however , in this movement for religious liberty , to invite the efforts of our English brethren here against slavery . We have too little confidence in their knowledge of our condition and the correctness of their opinions generally on the subject of American slavery . They must consent to let us manage the question , in our own way , and support us from behind with the moral weight of their confidence and sympathy . At the same time , if any of our fellow Christians from the South will join us , ( as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to receive them . We want their counsel , we invite their support and their prayers . Beginning as an American Alliance , we must commence our operations by ourselves , standing ready to communicate with the British Alliance , or with any society that can sympathize with our objects ; hoping that our brethren , in Europe , will first acknowledge us , then sympathize with us , and then , if they see it to be wise , act with us . Meantime we see no reason why they should not , but rather every reason why they should . There is nothing in the condition of the German churches , or in their relations to the state , to prevent . There is every thing in that of the Swiss to make them desire it , though , at this present moment , it might not be safe to engage with us . They will the more desire us to go on , with our utmost energy . Our brethren in France want exactly this to fortify their position and open their way to success . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those opposers of the establishlishment who now deprecate the Alliance , will heartily unite in our plan ; for though it does not propose to touch the establishment , yet neither does it withdraw them from their purpose ; on the contrary it has the free spirit in it , and with that they sympathize . Shall we find any countenance within the establishment ? We ought to find it though we may long fail of it ; for though nothing , in our opinion , can save the establishment , something may be done to save the churchand nothing , with so much of prom . ise , as what we propose . The in. stincts of the Anglican church are conservative . But the true conservatism , the only possible conservatism , as Sir Robert Peel has had the sagacity to discover , is motion . Mo . tion is the conservative principle of all things ; without this , the purest waters stagnate , and we know not but that the stars themselves would rot in the sky . And what is wanted now , above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party of motion should be resisted by motion . When the ever busy agents of Rome are filling England with their schemes of aggression , when all the active power and genius of the church is engaged to Romanize the church , when most of the young men who are going into livings from the universities are going with a passion for candles and strait-breasted coats and the decrees of councils , when the public are looking for the inaugural of a new Roman Catholic establishment , the restoration of monasteries in England , and the renewed processions of the host , it is not bishops ' charges counselling // peace and compromise and offering the wooden head of authority to the dangers rushing in , that can save the church . Action is wanted , bold , decisive , inspiring action . Let the Anglican church , or rather the church of Christ in the Anglican establishment , arise and go forth to lead the age , as it ought , in a grand aggressive movement for the Scriptures and Scripture liberty , in the territory of Romanism itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element felt in the history of the living age , can it hope to continue . Perhaps this truth will sometime be discovered . Looking then for such cooperation as we can obtain , how shall we begin , what shall we do ? Under the first article , call out an expression of all the churches of our land , and solicit the same from churches in other lands , on the subject of religious liberty ; not separating the religious liberty of Italians from that of Irishmen or Polanders , nor the religious liberty of white men from that of negroes . Act in behalf of man as man ; and demand for him every where full religious freedom . if there are millions of human beings in our own country , whom despotism hinders , by atrocious enactinents , or by arbitrary oppression , from reading the Scriptures for themselves ; and who , by reason of the wrongs they suffer , can not receive into their minds the illumination of the word of God , nor render obedience to the will of God as revealed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral sense ; - let the attention of the churches , of the country and of the world , be fixed upon the monstrous outrage on the rights of God and of conscience ,  --  the more monstrous for its being done in the name of freedom . So if in Russia-if in Austria-if in Turkey-if in the States of the Church  --  the rights of conscience and the soul are invaded 1y power-if men are brought un der pains and penalties for reading the Sciptures and attempting to obey the word of God as they find it there ; let the facts be gathered up , and let the universal moral sense of mankind be appealed to that it may pronounce its solemn verdict against the wrong . Let governments and 1 ) otentates , let patriarchs and the pope himself be calmly summoned to acknowledge the rights of God and to coöperate hr their places for the removal of all obstacles , so that the word of God may be given to the world and all men may render it a free and true obedience . Urge it upon France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which her charter proclaims shall be not a promise but an accomplished fact . Urge it upon the Swiss that till in all their cnntons , the worship of God and the preaching of the gospel are free and are protected in that freedom , they can have neither union nor peace . Urge it upon the English people to look to their diplomacy , that the same influence which replaced the Pope , after the fall of Napoleon , may be exerted for Christian liberty in his dominions . Grapple calmly with the great question of religious freedom in all its applications ; and hold it up before mankind as the great question of the age and of the world . Under the second article , we might lay out a work in the United States , resembling that proposed by Chalmers in England and Scotland , only leaving to our domestic missionary societies and kindred institutions the fields they now occupy . The movements and enterprises of that religion , whether Roman or Anglican , which makes the authority of church traditions and church councils coi*.rdinate with the authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to judge for themselves whether the teachings of the priesthood are according to the Scriptures , but to believe implicitly // that the Scriptures mean whatever the priest teaches ,  --  require of us not only constant vigilance , but constant and well concerted counteraction . All these counteracting efforts might not indeed be absorbed and united in our Alliance , but they might be harmonized and invigorated ; and efforts not yet attempted , and as yet perhaps not called for , might in due time be planned and set in motion . And especially might this Alliance be the center of whatever efforts may be required from time to time to cheer and aid those enlightened or half enlightened members of the Roman church who desire to throw off the yoke of that hierarchy , but are not ready to identify themselves with any form or name of Protestantism . Wherever a Roman Catholic or a company of Roman Catholics , would throw off the bondage of Rome , and assert their spiritual liberty , and still retain the name of Catholic , let such souls struggling to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strength . The counteraction of Jesuit designs against our system of popular education , would be a constant effort and a bond of union . What will be required of us , under our third article , need not be distinctly expounded . Indeed we have already gone more into such details , than would have been necessary but for the sake of showing that our plan involves activity and extended operations . What remains of the present article , will be mostly occupied with some considerations tending to show that the effort for religious liberty at Rome , and in papal countries generally , which we propose as that on which the activity of our Alliance must be mostly concentrat ed ,  --  may be undertaken with reasonable hopes of success . And first of all , it is already ascertained that there are many in Italy , who hail our project with joy and will do what they may to assist its success . They want religious liberty , and they want a thorough reformation of their church , though commonly they do not think of becomin* Protestants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestantism is identified with bigotry and malignity , as thoroughly as that of Romanism is to us . But we ask them only to receive their liberty and the truth of God , not Protestantism . And an effort so friendly and reasonable is better fitted to disarm and finally to triumph over their prejudices , than any other that can be invented . In this movement too , we put ourselves on the side of the age , and only seek to hasten the universal tendency of modern society . And thus we enlist the age on the side we occupy , as advocates of liberty and light . And , by a skillful choice of position , we set the truth of God forward as an acknowledged friend of man and the living wants of the age , turning the very laws of human society to our account . And who will dread a failure , when the laws of society are with him ? Thirdly , it is a great excellence of this plan , that it turns a movement upon the Romish Church , in just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead of laboring at the outposts and extremities , we move upon Rome itself , on its own field . And Rome is weaker at Rome , than at Worcester , or at Cincinnati ; just as it is the manner of all corrupt being to be weakest at the heart . For the last twenty years nothing but the military force of Austria has held the Pope on his throne . Phe people of Italy are instructed by their woes . The people of England and of the United States have never seen the woes of the Romish faith . Besides , we do not go into the whole question between us and Romanism ; a question which involves so many points that truth is lost in the profusion of argument ; but we select a single point , where the adversary is weakest , and one itt // which , if we gain it , we gain every thing , and we take the question as narro'ved down to that single point - as indeed we must if we attempt this enterprise , for we can do little or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have carried the question of religious libertyThus it was that Luther , by a blow at the weak point of indulgencies , broke through the impenetrable shell of error and forced a victorious en-trance Many persons do not see by what means we can reach this question of religious liberty at Rome . The field is distant and inaccessible ; we can not march an army into it , can not even establish a press in Italy , in order to hold communication with the mind of Italy . They do not seem to be aware of the wonderful fluency of opinions and the power of ideas in this age ; how they travel through all obstacles , how they seem even to go abroad as powers of the air , whose path we can not trace . No body of men can utter a true idea and persist in it , without giving it authority , and at last victory- It comes to the tyrant or wrong doer at last , and looks him in the face , till it looks him down . It can not be sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or driven into exile . It is an impassible enemy and there is no hopeful war with it . As nations , too , are drawing closer to each other , and open a livelier intercourse , they become more sensitive to the opinions , one of another . So that if we lift our testimony against all church dungeons and tortures , and against all suppression of argument by penalties , as cruel , absurd , anti-christian , and impious , there is no prince , or priesthood , in Italy or any where else , that can long venture to perpetrate such enormities . Cruelty is easy to man , but not infamy . There is no music in the sighs of the dungeon , when the odium of the human race looks on to wither and damn the persecutor . We have already seen the evidence of our power , in the sensation produced at Rome by the announcement there of our Christian Alliance , and in the bull of caution immedi* ately issued to the faithful . The power of new ideas , too , is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine how they come or where their power lies . The Pope has long been feeling their silent approach , and withering under their impalpable frown . Many years ago , he began to testify , in his bulls , against " toleration , " " liberty of conscience , " and the like modern notions , calling them all manner of ugly names , and brushing at them , he knew not how , to fray them away . Not a word had any one spoken to him about liberty of conscience ; but the idea came to him in his sleep , and when he was awake , it breathed hot upon his face . The chambers of the Vatican whispered it in his ear , it wove itself into the tapestries , and the fresco figures held up its torch in their hands . If , then , the silent thought of liberty of conscience thus disturbs him , what will it do when it becomes a sound ? when it is heard , as we hope it may be , pealing on through England , France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Northern Alps ? XVe might also conjecture the possibility that some great change will ere long appear to disturb the present state of things in Europe , and open a way for the establishment of Christian liberty in Italy , and in all Catholic countries-provided a right preparation is made beforehand for such a demand . We might insist on the certainty that a vigorous agitation of this subject , in England , will radically affect the diplomacy of that nation . On the whole , we see little doubt of our success , if such a movement is begun and prosecuted with a spirit worthy of its aim . We can not dismiss our article // without adding a few words concerning the results that will flow to the Church of God from such an undertaking , if successful . To reach a spiritual error effectively , it is a great principle that we must go to its capital-we must begin at Jerusalem-for the metropolis of any great hierarchy or system of spiritual wickedness , is to that system what the brain is to the body . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the whole system . What then , if we are successful , will be the , reach of our success ? We shall have entered Rome and obtained a right to circulate the word of God , and to preach the gospel , as freely as the priests of Rome come to us . Friends will begin to rise up there embracing the truth . Then , to save herself , the Romish Church must purify herself , and , having to sustain her position by argument , she must make her appeal to the Scriptures . Church authority falls not only at Rome , but every where , when once the civil arm is withdrawn , and the dungeons are closed ; for there is nothing even now to give it respect or make it any thing but a broken reed , in the feeling of mankind , save that it is somewkcre fortified and held firm by force . A general reformation must ensue ; and truth , liberated at last , must come forth to reign . Whether she will write over the new Church , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ , we need not trouble ourselves to inquire . Meantime we shall have been drawn more closely to each other , by our common struggles and prayers , shall have enlarged our thoughts and charities , and perhaps discovered some errors to be put away . And now it remains for the truth , having the freedom of the world , to bring us into unity . Hitherto the progress of truth has been irregular and slow , because so many errors have been put in garrison , and held as military posts . This has set the human mind into false and repugnant attitudes every where ; for every disturbance of the kind in one part of the globe , propagates a disturbing influence in every other . The perpetual building of moles and dams in the river of salvation , to regulate the flow of its waters , the perpetual splash and commotion by which , on pretence of guarding their purity , their depths have been agitated , has hitherto been a fatal hindrance to the calm and godly contemplation of truth , throughout the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save in argument , will be able to prove her capacity on the human mind . New results , hitherto unknown , perhaps u nconceived , must shortly appear . Christians are set in a new relation , with new hopes , and we trust , also , with something of a new disposition . There will naturally be a struggle in the church towards unanimity , instigated by a sense of brotherhood in toil , and a common growth of love in the Christian body . Having then hearts to engage in a work so high as this , with a zeal and a breadth of comprehension propor* tionate to its grandeur , it will be strange if we are not hereafter seen to have opened a new Christian era.
