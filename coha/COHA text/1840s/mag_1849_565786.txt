txt THE regents of the Smithsonian Institution have done well in commencing the Contributions to Knowledge , ' published under their direction , with a work relating to the antiquities of the Mississippi valley . Probably , indeed , had they not looked on it with favor , the work itself would have come before the public under some other auspices , and being in a less expensive form would have obtained more general circulation . Thus the diffusion of knowledge among men would have been as well secured by a bookseller calculating the changes of a private undertaking , or even by a historical or ethnological society without funds , as by that institution which foreign liberality has endoxved . But however this may be , since the regents of the Smithsonian had a duty to perform , it speaks well for their future selections of publications offered for their acceptance , that they began , with proper national feeling , at home ; that instead of inaugurating themselves by accounts of dodos on the other side of the globe , or of extinct volcanos in middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they chose for the subject of their first voinme the antiquities of those mysterious races within our own borders , who may be called human fossils , and whose last vestiges are fast disappearing before the labor of civilized men . The remains of ancient nations in the West had been freqnently noticed , and had been explored with some success before our authors began their explorations . It had been a prevailing theory that they were constructed as xvorks of defense ; a very considerable antiquity had been assigned to these works ; and it was the common opinion among persons who had inspected the monuments , or had read the reports of visitors , that the remains belonged to an anterior race , who had reached a higher civilization than those tribes which were co*val with the first settlements in this country ;  --  a race which perhaps came from the south-west , and had some connection with the Aztecs of Mexico . There was , however , after all the explorations , a want of facts , and many of the observations were careless and inaccurate . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Messrs . Squier and Davis have surpassed them much in exactness of observation , and that , by laboriously penetrating to the bottom of the mounds , they have established results which were beyond the scope of their predecessors . // It is our intention , in the few pages devoted to this work , to follow our authors , without theory , by a brief statement of the principal facts which they have brought to light . They have wisely abstained from theorizing themselves , and the good sense with which they have in a simple , natural manner given their statements of facts , is quite praiseworthy . We shall confine ourselves , too , for the most part , to those localities where they have made explorations in person , or to those ( chiefly in their own state of Ohio ) where they have been aided by other competent surveyors . The region of Indian monuments is one of wide extent , yet a large portion of it has never been adequately examined . It xviii be safer , therefore , if we confine ourselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to pass beyond it for the purpose of comparison , and of showing that the builders of the monuments through the whole valley of the west were but one race . The state of Ohio is full of ancient works , which however seem to grow smaller and more insignificant towards Lake Erie , as if the center of activity had been near the southern border of the state . Yet several spots , by the multitude of their remains , are more particularly marked as the seats of a numerous population , or as the capitals of some predominant superstition . r1p he remains are clustered together most thickly in rich valleys capable of supporting a great number of inhabitants , as iii Butler county , and the neighboring parts of the great Miami valley , in the Scioto valley , from Circleville to the mouth of the river at Portsmouth , and along the valley of Paint creek , a branch of the Scioto . Nor ought a remarkable group of works , near Newark , on a tributary of the Muskingum , to pass without notice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Chillicothe is situated , is most populous in these monuments of an extinct race not far from one hundred enclosures occur in this small territory alone . It was in the Scioto valley , and in that of its tributary , that Messrs . Squier and Davis made their principal explorations . For the sake of method , these gentlemen divide the monuments into enclosures and mounds ; and subdivide these two classes according to a view of the purpose which they were intended to serve . The correctness of this subdivision must be justified in the one case by the position and nature of the enclosures ; and in the other by the situation and construction of the mounds , and above all by the results of explorations in them . Whether these divisions can be sustained in every instance , may be a question ; but there is reason to think that in general they will commend themselves to persons of sound judgment . Following the order observed in the work before us , we shall call the attention of our readers in the first place to enclosures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // enclosures were built is betrayed by their position , and by the care taken to guard the points of approach . They are , for the most part , situated on high and nearly inaccessible hills , form*d by the force of water wearing deep channels below the highest level or upper platform of the country . The sides therefore are high walls of rock , through which one or more streams have cut their way : in many cases the spot selected is a peninsula with a narrow entrance around which two brooks run in a circuitous path to a main river . The areas of these enclosures vary in Southern Ohio from twelve to one hundred and forty acres . The artificial defenses consist chiefly of an embankment , on or just below the brow of a hill , composed of earth generally taken out of a ditch or pit , and interrupted by numerous gates which may have been openings for the superfluous waters of the hill . Neither the small height of the earth wall , which is often not morethan four or five feet above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allow the belief that any great reliance was placed upon this wall itself as a means of defense . Yet where the nature of the ground left a point in the circuit more than usually exposed , the mound is found to be considerably higher than the average . The entrance or entrances to these forts are often carefully and even singularly guarded by re*iutering walls of earth , accompanied by outworks , and outlying mounds answering Perhaps for lookouts . The fort in Hamilton , Butler county , Ohio , has four gates : at three of them there are inner defenses calculated to expose the side of an enemy , and at the principal entrance there is quite a series of embankments dividing the passage , and forming a maze , like the labyrinths which children draw on their slates . A very extensive work of this kind near Bourneville , Ross county , Ohio , may serve as a specimen of the whole genus , although differing from nearly all of them in the use of stone instead of earth . It lies on a hill nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paint Creek and two small tributaries . There are two feasible approaches to the plateau of the hill , from two opposite points , but the rest of the circuit of the walls is very difficult of access or else quite inaccessible . The area is yvry large , no less than one hundred and forty acres ; and two large works lie in the neighborhood , at distances of two and five miles . In this case the wall is continuous except at three entrances and at an impregnable point , and consists of stones rudely placed together . Indeed so little does the wall present the appearance of human designs that our authors say " but for the amount of stones it might be taken for a natural feature ,  --  the debris of the out-cropping sand strata . Such certainly is the first impression which it produces upon the visitor ; an impression , which is speedily corrected upon reaching the points where the supposed line of // debris , rising upon the spurs , forms curved gateways and then resumes its course as before . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most easy of access , the wall resembles a loose heap of stones , of fifteen or twenty feet base , and from three to four feet in height . At the southern point of approach , where the xvall is carried across a neck of lower land seven hundred feet in width , the stone work is the heaviest , " and although stones enough have been removed from it at that point to build a stout division wall between the lands of two proprietors , their removal is not discoverable . " There are three gateways in this neck , formed by the curving inwards of the wall for forty or fifty feet , and leaving passages between of not more than eight feet in width . The wall of this fortification measures more than two miles and a quarter in length , and the quantity of stones is calculated by our authors to be great enough to form a wall eight feet broad and eight feet high . The spot is abundantly supplied with water , one depression of two acres containing enough for the wants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fort Ancient , " on the east bank of the little Miami , thirty-five miles above Cincinnati , and which was first described in print forty years ago , is constructed of earth , and has a circuit of between four and five miles . The embankment is in many places twenty feet high , without a ditch ; the materials being obtained from a number of pits , which are still discoverable . Within this work is enclosed a very irregular piece of ground , consisting of two areas united by a natural isthmus of more than a thousand feet in length . The free passage through the isthmus was interrupted by an embankment carried across with the evident design of making two forts out of one . The average height of the embankment round the hill is ten feet , but it rises to twenty where the hill is connected by a narrow neck with the surrounding table-land . A little outside of the wall at this point , occur two mounds , and just beyond them two parallel walls of earth , one thousand three hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small mound . We only add that there are as many as seventy interruptions in the wall of circuit of the fort , from ten to fifteen feet in width , which no one will suppose to be gateways , and which our authors account for on the hypothesis that they were once occupied by blockhouses of timber which have since decayed . A very large work in Ross county , Ohio , situated on the second terrace above the north fork of Paint Creek , is estimated to be surrounded by three miles of embankment , and to occupy an area of one hundred and eleven acres . On one side of this area a small stream , diverted from its original bed , was made to run just outside of the embankment , thus performing the office of the // ditch which can be traced around a considerable portion of the circumference . A part of the enclosing barrier consists of a wall of smooth stones from the creek cemented by tough clay . Within this area are two enclosures , the one a perfect circle three hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two thousand feet in circumference , containing seven closely contiguous mounds which have been explored with interesting results . From the area an opening in the wall leads to a perfect square , which measures eight hundred and fifty feet on each side . These smaller enclosures , we may say here , were constructed for religious purposes ; and from this circumstance , as well as from the not very strong position of the greater area , it may be argued that we have here the site of a little city , whose inhabitants , when exposed to attacks from an enemy , fled to one of the strong holds in the same valley , lying on the third terrace , where the wall of natural rock was far more to be relied upon than any superadded work . And perhaps the great area of some of these strongholds will justify the hypothesis that they were not so much citadels regularly garrisoned , as places of refuge to which a numerous population might retire , and obtain their subsistence from the soil , when the supplies carried with them should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second description of works , to which Messrs . Squier and Davis give the name of sacred enclosures . These likewise are very numerous : plans of nearly forty , principally within the sphere of their own explorations , are given in the volurrie before us . They differ from the works supposed to have a defensive character , in being smaller ; in being often commanded by neighboring heights ; in having the ditch , if it occurs at all , inside rather than outside of the embankment ; in the greater frequency of accompanying mounds , which as will be seen must have been used for sacrificial purposes ; in the regularity of their forms ; and in the complication of works connected with one another . The height of the embankments at present generally falls between four and nine feet . The mounds rise sometimes to the height of thirty . As for the forms of these enclosures , it may be said in general that they are circles connected by a shorter or longer passage with squares , or octag6ns , and surrounded by separate smaller figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as surprisingly regular ; so much so that no means which we possess could make them come much nearer to geometrical accuracy . Several of the circles , in different spots , have a diameter of one thousand and fifty feet , and five or six of the squares have sides of one thousand and eighty feet : probably some venerated primitive model gave law to succeeding enclosures . The parallel embankments affording communication from one such figure to another , or , it may be , // leading to the brow of the hill or to the stream , are often of great length : in one case one thousand one hundred and thirty feet long ; in another two thousand and four hundred ; in another still two passages , each two thousand and one hundred feet in length , run at right angles from a central square without serving any purpose which can be ascertained ; while in the extensive and complicated series of works at Newark , Licking county , Ohio , three sets of parallels , starting from an octagon and running in different directions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a mile , and the third of over two miles and a half . The enclosures which we have just referred to , situated at Newark , on a branch of the Muskingum , and therefore at some distance from the Scioto group , deserve a more particular description : which we will attempt , notwithstanding the difficulty of conveying a distinct conception of them without the aid of figures . Let a person then find himself within the longest parallels mentioned above , forming a pathway two hundred feet broad , and let him take a northerly direction : he will by and by come to a vast octagon , including fifty acres , and having eight gates , within each of which , at the distance of sixty feet , he sees mounds in the shape of truncated pyramids , five feet high , and one hundred by eighty at the base . Passing through this , he enters , by a short passage of three hundred feet by sixty , a circle of more than half a mile in circumference . In this circle there is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passage of entrance . It would seem that here the builders had intended to construct another passage , but chanced their minds after heaping the earth up for a distance of one hundred feet , and " finished the enclosfire by throwing an immense mound across the uncompleted part . " rp his mound is eleven feet high , and has received the name of the Observatory , from its overlooking the entire work . Retracing his steps through the circle and through the octagon , let the traveller proceed for more than a mile through the avenue adjoining to that by which he approached the works ; and he will land at a square enclosure of about twenty acres . Before , however , arriving at the square , he will stop to look at a small circle of two hundred feet in diameter , which abuts upon the bank of the avenue , and consists of an outer wall , a ditch and an interior embankment running ha If way round ; and which may serve as a sample of a great number of others occurring here or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avenue , he will next reach a circle or rather ellipse of about thirty acres in area , which is " one of the best preserved and most imposing in the state . " The walls are of unusual size , being about twelve feet high and fifty wide , to which is to be added the depth , seven feet , and width , thirty-five feet , of an interior ditch . At the entrance // into the circle , both the wall and the ditch far exceed these dimensions of height , and rise to sixteen and thirteen feet respectively . Just at the center of the circle is a figure presenting the appearance of a bird with outstretchect wings , although perhaps not so intended : it is composed of four low mounds running together , and stretching in greatest length two hundred feet Behind this fourfold mound , at the distance of one hundred feet , lies a very low mound of a curved figure , which can now hardly be traced . Besides the parts which we have described , there are pertaining to this group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small circles , as well as of " passages which lead to nothing , " which are severally unimportant , and which even the inspection of a plan fails to free from irregularity and confusion . Another example of the sacrificial or religious enclosure , which we select , is that called Mound City , situated in the Scioto valley , and contiguous to the river , three miles north of Chillicothe . This is an area of thirteen acres , in the form of a square , with rounded corners , nowise remarkable for the size of its embankment , or for any thing else except the peculiarity from which it derives its name . It is crowded with mounds disposed for the most part irregularly ; the largest one of which is seventeen feet high , with a base of nearly a hundred feet in diameter . These mounds have all been opened , and rewarded the iabors of Messrs . Squier and Davis with most valuable results . The Mound City ' does not open , as is usually the case with this kind of enclosures , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large irregular circle , of twenty-eight acres ' area , which , from having a ditch outside of the walls , may be supposed to have been built for purposes of defense , but from having a sacrificial mound nearly at its center , may be classed with the enclosures of a sacred character . We have spoken of avenues , in connection with works supposed to be sacred : there is also a remarkable example of a wide avenue which has more resemblance to the roads of the Romans , or of modern times . It is situated in the valley of the Scioto , below Chillicothe , and affords a passage for the road from that place to Portsmouth . " It consists , " say our authors , " of a graded ascent from the second to the third terrace , the level of which is here seventeen feet above that of the former . The way is ten llundred and eighty feet long by two hundred and fifteen feet wide at one extremity , and two hundred and three feet wide at the other , measured between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out*vard on either hand , forming embankments varying upon the outer sides from five to eleven feet in length ; yet it appears that much more earth has been excavated than enters into these walls . At the lower extremity of the grade , the walls upon the interior sides measure no less than twenty-two feet in perpendicular height . The walls are covered with trees and // bushes , and resemble parallel natural hills ; and probably would be regarded as such by the superficial observer . " From the end of one of the walls a low embankment extends along the third terrace for a distance of more than half a mile , and terminates at a group of mounds . An elliptical enclosure of small dimensions , not far from Chillicothe , and within two miles of the stone fort ' which has been mentioned among the works of defense , is remarkable for being surrounded with a wall of stone instead of earth , and also for five stone walls , starting just outside of the ellipse and running thence , not parallel , but in converging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be idle to form a conjecture as to the purpose for which these masses of stone txventy feet wide at one end , but diminishing to ten feet as they converge , have been heaped together . One of the most remarkable earth-works thus far discovered , and one which remained unknown until the explorations of Messrs . Squier and Davis , is called by them the great serpent , ' and is situated near the north line of Adams county , on a stream called Brush creek . It lies on the top of a hill which rises to the height of one hundred and fifty feet above the stream ; towards the stream the hill presents a perpendicular wall of rock , but descends on the other side by a rapid slope . The serpent consists of an embankment up*vards of five feet high , and thirty feet wide at the base ; and if extended , its entire length would not be less than one thousand feet . Its head rests near the point of the hill ; its body winds like that of a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triple coil . Its jaws are opened , and partially enclose an oval figure , made by an embankment whose transverse and conjugate diameters are one hundred and sixty and eighty feet . Within the oval there was once a small circular elevation of large stones , much burnt , which have been thrown down and scattered . What shall we say of this strange construction ? The antiquary will doubtless find in it a proof that serpent-worship existed among the mound-building aborigines of this country . He will look on it as a representation of " Ophion and Eurynome , the wide Encroaching earth perhaps , " and the sky coiled around the earth like a serpent ; and so will think that he has discovered here a symbol common to the *vorship of nature in many parts of the world . But without yenturing into the regions of speculation , let us pass on to some other monuments in Ohio and Wisconsin , which bear a resemiiblance to the one already described . The first which we name is called the alligator , ' and is situated in Licking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It // is forty feet wide , and two hundred and fifty feet long from the point of the nose to the end of the crooked tail ; and has projecting paws each thirty-six feet in length . The height of the figure on an average is only four feet . Near it , and communicatiug with it by a graded way , is a high circle of burnt stones , which has been called an altar . The hill upon which it occurs , say our authors , is so regular , as almost to induce the belief that it has been artificially rounded . Quite a number of mounds in the shape of animals have been discovered in Dade , Richiand and Grant counties , Wisconsin . Those in Dade county are near the great Indian trail from the Mississippi to Lake Michigan , and are fonnd together in considerable numbers : in this group the figure of a man one hundred and twenty-five feet in length , with outstretched arms , is distinctly visible . The others are rude representations , which might stand for almost any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and twenty feet . The figures which occur in Muscoda or English Prairie , Grant county , are remarkable for their variety . Among them are the human figure , and others which may pass for turtles , bears , otters , and birds . The present race of Indians bury in these animal-shaped structures of Wisconsin , but have no tradition respecting their origin . It has been conjectured that this was the purpose which they anciently served , and that the animal represented by the mound was the totem of a family or clan . The multitude of similar figures in the same vicinity , seems to exclude the idea that they were religious emblems ; arid there is analogy enough between these structures and the serpent and alligator of Ohio to render it quite uncertain whether the latter had any religious import . We proceed now to give a brief abstract of the result of our authors ' investigations upon the subject of the Indian mounds . In the first part of the work they appear as accurate surveyors of what had been incorrectly reported by others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in kind from thQse which were previously known . In the chapters on the mounds , however , and on the works of art found in them , they appear as almost the first careful explorers of what lay hidden beneath the ground , and have thrown new light upon American antiquitfes . Had they confined themselves to the surface of the ground , we should have missed all those conclusions which the structure of the interior of the mounds allows us to draw , not only in relation to the mounds , but also to the enclosures themselves . rJhe mounds in the West may be counted by tens of thousands ; and great numbers occur within the region which is the sphere of the observations of Messrs . Squier and Davis . An important result of their labors is the classification of the mounds into those which contain altars , those which were places of burial , those // which were places of worship , and those which either served more than one of the purposes answered by mounds of the three first classes , or some other purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the altar mounds , which constiti*ite by far the most important class , are that they occur within or near enclosures of a particular description , that they are carefully stratified by human labor , and that they contain near the surface of the soil on which the mounds are erected concave altars of burnt clay , or in some few instances of stone , on which in all probability sacrifices were offered . The connection of mounds of this sort with the enclosures called sacred , while sepulchral mounds have not been observed in such places , is indeed one main reason for ascribing to the enclosures a sacred character . The fact that these can not have been defensive works might justify us in suspecting that they served some religious purpose ; but suspicion arises to high probability , when the mounds are taken into view . At the same tune it ought to be said that a few of the enclosures referred to this species are without accompanying mounds of any sort . The artificial stratification of these mounds is one of the most curious facts hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American nations . It would appear that originally there was placed on the surface of the ground a bowl-like altar of some symmetrical shape , composed of thin clay which was hardened by the fire as it was used for sacrificial purposes : indeed there are traces , in one instance at least , of as many as three layers of clay , baked into hardness at intervals of time , and easily distinguishable . On these altars various remains have been found , which in all cases show marks of fire . The dimensions of the altars vary from two feet across to fifty feet in length by twelve in width . Covering the altars and the remains left upon it , is to be found a layer of earth , to which was given the shape intended for the completed mound , which is usually that of a section of a sphere or ellipsoid somewhat flaring at the base . To this deposit of earth succeeds for the most part a thin stratum of sand reduced to the same form , and this again is succeeded by another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another of sand . There is no uniformity in the number of strata , but the sand layers always form a thin stripe , and the upper covering consists almost uniformly of coarse gravel . The earthy strata are exceedingly compact , so that the process of penetrating the mounds is very slow and difficult . A number of mounds of this description are found to have been disturbed in the symmetry of their strata , to the depth of a few feet , and to contain human skeletons . rphe date of these intrusions is sometimes determined by articles of European manufac // ture which accompany the human remains , as well as by the good state of preservation of the remains themselves . The probability is that the present race of Indians , who kuow nothing of the origin or objects of the mounds , have used them , to save themselves labor , for the burial of their dead . T he inquiry xviii naturally be made , for what object were such altars as have been described , constructed and afterwards covered with a great depth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incremation was in use among the Mexicans , may not these altars have been intended for that purpose . May not the enclosures have been cemeteries of some distinguished family of warriors or priests ; while the common people simply interred their dead with less expense of labor , xvherever convenience might dictate . Our authors meet the conjecture that mounds of this description were burial places , by asserting that the greater number have no traces of human remains upon or around the altars ; and the bones actually found on some of the altars they ascribe to human victims , which the mound builders , like the inhabitants of Mexico and Yucatan , may have sacrificed . But if xve were to oppose conjecture to conjecture , we might suggest that the mounds where there are no human remains , are the cenotaphs of warriors slain among enemies , whose corpses could not be recovered . With regard to the other relics found on the altars , our authors remark that they are usually homogeneous : " that is to say , instead of finding a large variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as go to make up the possessions of a barbarian dignitary , we find upon one altar pipes only , upon another a simple mass of galena , whilst the next one has a quantity of pottery or a collection of spearheads , or else is destitute of remains , except perhaps a thin layer of carbonaceous material . Such could not possibly be the case upon the above hypothesis that is if these altars were places of burning the dead , for the spear , the arrows , the pipe , and the other implements and personal ornaments of the dead would then be found in connection with each other . " this proceeds upon the assumption that the customs of the mound-builders were just the same as those of the extant Indians , which is a point to be ascertained from their monuments . And the strangeness of the fact that an altar used for sacrifice should afterwards be most carefully covered with a depth of earth , is so great , that we confess ourselves to remain in entire doubt as to the object which these particular mounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast numbers at a distance from the sacred enclosures , either in groups or isolated ; and , when opened , reveal their purpose . Out of a hundred mounds explored by our authors , twenty had a sepulchral character . They // rarely contain more than one skeleton . This with personal ornaments , utensils or weapons , is found buried beneath the apex at the original surface of the ground , sometimes in enclosures of timber or of stone , forming a rude coffin . In every instance but one , the skeletons and skulls are so decayed as to render restoration impossible ; in that instance , the skull , preserved by some peculiar quality of the soil , proved to belong to the American type of skulls , but to excel nearly all known specimens , in its dimensions and facial angle . These mounds , as well as the altar mounds , have been disturbed by later burials near the surface . It is worthy of remark that layers of charcoal have been found in these sepulchers , as though a burning piece of wood had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact is interpreted by our authors as indicating that sacrifices for the dead , or funeral rites of some description , were celebrated before the mound was completed . The skeletons themselves , in such cases , have not been subjected to the action of fire . Burial by fire , however , our authors pronounce to have been frequently practised by the mound builders . Burial in urns without burning , or the practice of putting the bones into earthen vessels after the decomposition of the flesh , which has been traced among the Southern Indians , is not known to have existed in Ohio . One of the largest sepulchral mounds is that at Grave Creek near Wheeling , which has often been descrihed and was excavated in 1838 . It is seventy feet high , and measures one thousand feet around the base . It was found to include two sepulchral chambers , one at the base containing two skeletons , and another thirty feet above containing one . Besides a great number of per sonal decorations , this mound is said to have revealed a small flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of characters cut upon it which bear a striking resemblance to the alphabetical signs of several nations . As this is the only trace of an alphabet to be found on this continent before the arrival of Europeans , it of course has furnished copious matter of speculation to the Danish antiquaries and to our own . We agree with our authors in suspecting that these characters have not been sculptured many years . The structures referred in the work before us to the class of temple mounds , are of rare occurrence in the region more particularly explored by our authors . They are distinguished by regular forms , large dimensions and neighborhood to the enclosures heretofore described , and adopt principally the form of a truncated pyramid with a graded path to the top . A mound of this class at Portsmouth near the mouth of the Scioto is circular , surrounded by a terrace , and has a spiral passage leading to its flat summit . Works of this description become larger and of more frequent occurrence in the states south of the Ohio , and by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great size , seem to indicate a relationship between the tribes of the great valley and the builders of the Teocallis of Mexico . A very remarkable one , north of the Ohio , occurring at Cahokia , Illinois , is a parallelogram seven hundred feet long by five hundred feet wide at the base , and ninety feet high . Among the mounds of an anomalous character , enumerated by our authors , may be mentioned several which are chiefly composed of ashes , charcoal and bits of burnt bone and burnt stone . Others are called mounds of observation , from the position which they occupy on the tops of the highest hills , where they may have served as stations for sentinels , or for signal fires ; but as they contain human bones and have not been sufficiently explored , nothing definite can be pronounced concerning them . We pass on to the remains of art in the shape of utensils and implements , personal ornaments and sculptures , the discovery of which in the mounds may be said to have been the principal reward of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have introduced a new era in the knowledge of Indian art , and greatly raised the estimate which must be formed of the imitative skill of the dwellers in the great valley . We refer not so much to the vessels and occasional ornaments of pottery , which are nearly equaled as works of art by others picked up in more southern parts of our Union , or to the implements of metal hammered into shape without the use of fire , or to the rings al ) d other metallic ornaments ; as to the sculptured imitations in stone , occurring in great numbers , of animals still to be met with in the neighborhood of the Indian works . In one of the mounds of Mound City ' our authors found a hundred representations of animals , besides four of the human head ,  --  one of which they pronounce to be unsurpassed by any specimen of ancient American art , which has fallen under their notice . About thirty species of birds , represented with great accuracy and spirit , are among these remains . But the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our authors have obtained from the mounds seven specimens , and which is not known to live to the north of the rivers of Florida . This fact might lead one to conjecture that these works of art were executed further to the south , and passed northward by barter . But the occurrence of representations of birds still inhabiting* the Ohio valley , and executed in the same style , was against such a conjecture . Other circumstances show that a brisk trade in objects valued for their beauty or use , must have been kept up among the tribes of North America . The shells and pearls of the sea-coast , and the teeth of the shark , adorned the persons of the mound-builders . The copper from Lake Superior , remarkable for the accompaniment of silver , formed their metallic implements , while galena in its unreduced state may have come from a nearer locality . Plates of mica are abundant in and about the // mounds , although no original locality is known to exist in Ohio . Weapons and implements of obsidian , found in five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked or in the rude state from Mexico , as no nearer deposit has been discovered . The porphyry out of which pipes and many representations of animals are sculptured , is traced by our authors to a locality on the Missouri . It is a stone of great hardness , but the skill of the workmen has contrived to subdue it into shape by cutting the surface with some sharp instrument . The age of the works which they have examined , forms the subject of our authors ' short concluding chapter . Several circumstances lead us back to quite a remote period , as the lowest date to which they can be assigned . in the first place , while the skeletons which have broken the strata of the mounds called sacred , are accompanied by crosses and other articles of European manufacture , nothing of that kind has been detected , pertaining to the era when the mounds were built . ( In the second place , none of the monuments are erected on the rower terraces next to the present beds of the streams , from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since their erection. ) t*&amp;* Then , again , the rivers in shifting their channels have in some instances encroached upon the superior terraces , so as in part to destroy works situated upon them , and afterwards receded to long distances of a fourth or half a mile or upwards , ' for all which a period of many years seems to be required . Of the decayed condition of the skeletons , in all save a single instance , we have already spoken . Finally the trees growing upon the works , by their annual rings , lay claim to an age of from six to eight hundred years . And this is the lowest limit to which the antiquity of the works can be brought down . We can not close this article , without again expressing our sense of the very business-like way in which our authors have gone to their work , by following up surveys , far surpassing the old ones in accuracy , with laborious excavations in search of what lay hid beneath the ground . The results of their labors ought to rea6h @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quarto before us . We would suggest to them whether a small cheap vol nine comprising the essential parts of the present one , would not be acceptable to many readers , particularly at the west , and might not be the source of profit to themselves . And we could wish also that they might have the means of carrying their explorations on an extensive scale into the states south of the Ohio . A small annual appropriation by Congress , or by the Smithsonian Institution , for the purpose of rescuing from destruction the remains of ancient American art , which have not already passed away-if judiciously used to stimulate the labors of such men as Messrs . Squier and Davis-would in a few years bring together a // comparative museum of antiquities , * from which many valuable conclusions would undoubtedly be drawn . The vast Museo Borbonico at Naples , derives its chief value from the painted vases found in Magna Grrecia , and from the wall-pictures , mosaics and statues of Pompeii and Ilerculaneum . If these remains , obtained within the country , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curiosities which the museum possessed had told the story only of foreign lands-how much would have been said of the listlessness and want of national feeling shown by the Neapolitan government . Even so it will be a shame , if the American monuments instead of being collected into a museum at Washington , go into private collections or are bought up for foreign countries.
