txt Tnx Rev. Thomas Brainerd of Philadelphia , some three years ago , maintained in a sermon before the presbytery of which he is a member , the proposition , that " existing causes furnish no ground to fear , that Romanism will ever become the prevailing religion of this country . " Within a few months past the sermon has been published and we find it so much in accordance with our own way of thinking on that subject , that we are constrained to commend it very earnestly to the attention of our readers . In what we are now intending to say about Romanists in the United States , and the duties of Protestants in regard to the Roman Catholic controversy , we shall make free use of the materials and hints afforded vs by Mr. Brainerd 's judicious and timely pamphlet . The question , flow ought Roman Catholics in this country to be regarded and treated ?  --  and the more general question , What ought we to do in respect to the efforts which are made for the advancement of the Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roman Catholics , particularly in this part of the United States , are generally foreigners-strangers in birth and lineage , strangers to our history and our religion-marked to some extent by a distinctive physiognomy , and to a greater extent by differences of language , or at least of dialect . In every country , the foreigner as such , and especially * Our country safe from Romanism . A sermon delivered at the opening of the Third Presbytery of Philadelphia , at its sessions in the Western Presbyterian Church , Philadelphia , April , 1841 . By the Rev. Thomas Brainerd , Pastor of the Third Presbyterian Church , Philadelphia . Philad. 1843. 8vo. pp. 45. the foreigner of another religion , is liable to become the object of prejudice and of popular hatred . It is in the character of foreigners that the Roman Catholics present themselves to our consideration , when we inquire what kind of treatment is due to them . how ought we to treat strangers , of a religion hostile to our own , who are brought to our country in the providence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions of the old world ? The Hebrew national law , with its ecclesiastical establishment , is the great storehouse of proof-texts for the doctrine and discipline of intolerance . Were we writing for any other than American readers , it would be necessary for us to begin with the refutation of the argument drawn from the supposed pertinency of such proof-texts . But where , as with us , the principle of ecclesiastical establishments , and all distinctions between lawful and unlawful religions , are renounced on all sides , we have no occasion to touch upon a topic so elementary . We will rather begin by citing from those Mosaic Institutes-so little understood , and so greatly abusedone simple precept , the principle of which is universal , and the application of which to our immediate purpose is too obvious to be disputed . " Thou shalt neither vex a stranger , nor oppress him ; for ye were stran*ers in the land of Egypt . " The " stranger , " in the land of the Israelites , was not of course a proselyte or convert to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger ; he became in all respects one of the chosen people . We find then in this command , a precept pertinent to our inquiry . It teaches us how we ought to treat 233 // foreigners of another religion , who come to enjoy here the blessings with which our religion has enriched our country and made it the glory of all lands . how evangelical Christians , of various names and various ecclesiastical connections , ought to treat each other , is coming to he pretty well understood . The Methodist , the Baptist , the Congregationalist or Presbyterian , and the Episcopalian , can treat each other kindly ; and while they differ in various degrees on certain points of doctrine and of ecclesiastical regulation , and are thus separated more or less distinctly in respect to some formalities of church communion , they can feel toward each other as neighbors and friends , and can freely interchange all acts of good neighborhood . Notwithstanding many counteracting influences , they are gradually getting over those sectarian animosities which once interrupted the intercourse of fellow-citizens . Even toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is much of a reasonable tolerance . The opinions and doctrines of such men are denounced as dangerous to the individual and to society ; they themselves , as embracing those doctrines , are naturally looked upon with a somewhat closer scrutiny ; their claims to the Christian name are even rejected ; yet in society , the Socinian , the Universalist , and the Deist , are judged individually by their personal characters , rather than by their religious opinions . No social proscription is exercised against them for their opinions merely . No religious test is made a condition of fair standing in society . This is as it should be . Argument , discussion , instruction , the manifestation of the truth in love-these are the methods by which error is to be suppressed , and truth is to win its way But the Roman Catholics , for va rious reasons , do not seem to enjoy , in some quarters , the full benefit of this tolerant disposition . They are , as a body , foreigners . Their religion is in every relation hostile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in history , to a great extent , with the most arbitrary principles of government , and with sweeping and bloody persecutions . Their ecclesiastical system owns for its head a foreign potentate , who has a temporal as well as a spiritual jurisdiction , and who , in other ages , has given away thrones and realms at his discretion , and has put his feet upon the necks of kings . Their priests , cut off from those sympathies that bind other men to home and country , are invested with indefinite power . Their worship shocks our moral sense with its childish rnummeries and gross idolatries . And withal they entertain , and are not very reserved in exhibiting , the most sanguine expectations of making their religion , at no very distant period , the predominant religion of the whole country . For such reasons as these there is , in some quarters , a feeling towards Roman Catholics altogether unlike the feeling towards the adherents of any other form of religion . In attempting to show how they ought to be regarded and treated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misapprehension of our views , by saying , in the first place , that the nature and bearings of the questions between the church of Rome , and the great catholic communion of evangelical churches , ought never to be overlooked . If all positive religion is not a delusion -- if all systems of religious faith are not equally false and worthless-the difference between that Christianity of tradition which is held by the Roman Catholic church , and that Christianity of the Bible which is held by Protestant Christians , is such as admits no compromise . He who intelligently and // heartily admits the one , can not , without hypocrisy , profess any sympathy with the other . No Roman Catholic asks you to admit-no Roman Catholic who understands his own system , can hut be offended if you pretend-that the differences between his religion and the religion which Protestants profess to deduce from the New Testament , are unessential . What are the questions at issue between the two systems ? They are such as these . Whether the living oracles of God in the Scriptures , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our faith ? Whether we are to address our prayers to God alone , or to saints and angels ? Whether we are to worship God in spirit and in truth alone , or with the aid of images and pictures ? Whether the penitent sinner may safely commit his soul to Christ alone , or must have absolution from the priest , and experience the justifying and sanctifying power of sacraments ? Whether the dying believer , trusting in the Redeemer , goes , like the believing malefactor from the cross , to be with Christ " this day in paradise , " or sinks into a pit of purgatorial fire , there to abide till the priests can be hired to pray him out by saying masses at so much apiece ? Whether true personal religion consists in repentance and faith , a heart cleansed by the word and Spirit of God , and a life devoted to the service and the imitation of Christ  --  or is made up of such matters as making th esiga of the cross , repeating prayers in Latin , confessing to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Friday ? Such questions as these can not be treated by an intelligent and honest man as if they were of little consequence . To him who takes the Bible alone for his authoritative standard , the religion of Rome is polytheism ; for instead of worshiping only the one living and true God , it sets up a thousand infe nor divinities to whom the suppliant looks in prayer  --  the tutelary saints of temples , cities , countries , and of individuals ; and to them it offers more petitions and vows than to the Father of spirits . It is idolatry for it bows down to graven images ; it deals in amulets and incantations ; it worships a piece of bread , not as symbolically representing , hut as actually being , the Supreme Divinity . It is a system at war with the Bible ; for it forbids men to search the Scriptures for themselves ; and it requires them to surrender their judgment and conscience to the church and to the priest , instead of permitting God 's word to come into their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , the believer of the simple Gospel can have no fellowship . It was with reference to such departures from the truth as it is in Jesus , that the Apostle wrote , " If there come any to you and bring not this doctrine**  --  the doctrine of Christ- " receive him not into your house , " as you receive the preachers of the Gospel to help them on their way ; " neither bid him God-speed ; for he that biddeth him God-speed is a partaker of his evil deeds . " We say then , it is plainly wrong for Protestants to unite with Roman Catholics in their worship of images , of saints and angels , or of the consecrated wafer . To go into one of their churches as a mere spectator , gaping and wondering perhaps , but refusing to kneel when they kneel , or to stand when they stand , is to treat them and their worship with an unnecessary incivility , and with an incivility which they feel to be offensive . To give an external conformity to the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We say farther , it is wrong for a Protestant to place his children under the moral and religious training of Roman Catholic schools . He who places his daughter in a nunnery boarding school , or his son in // a Jesuit college , for instruction , knows that he puts that daughter or son to be trained into spiritual and intellectual servitude , and to be converted if possible to that religion which puts a clasp upon the Bible and a veil upon the cross , and which admits a priest to all the secrets of the conscience , armed with power to save and to destroy . Such a parent tells his child in effect , that the Bible is not a light and a treasure ; that Luther and the Reformers were in the wrong ; that the blood of the martyrs was shed in vain ; and that it is well to pray to the Virgin Mary in order to obtain her good offices in procuring blessings from her Son . XVe say still farther , it is wrong for Protestants to aid by their voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extending or supporting the Roman Catholic religion . To afford such aid to that superstitious and despotic hierarchy , is to bid them God-speed . He who gives them such aid , gives them the right hand of fellowship , and becomes a voluntary upholder and promoter oftheir system . When did Roman Catholics in Rome , in Spain , in Austria , in France , in Mexico , or in South America , ever contribute voluntarily to the building of a Protestant temple , or the advancement of Protestant Christianity ? They are consistent with themselves . They refuse to put contempt upon their own faith and worship . Having spoken thus freely of the Roman Catholic system , we may now proceed to the remark that the individual Romanist is not to be treated by us as responsible for all the errors-still less for all the tendencies-of the system in which he has been educated . The errors in which he has been educated , are errors in some sort of combination with truth ; and it may be that the truth taught with the error has had much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of Romanism with all its errors , is not charac terized so much by the direct denial of essential truths , as by overlaying those truths with the corruptions that have been accumulating for seventeen centuries . For minds of an enlightened habit of thinking , and for minds that yearn after the Gospel and can not be satisfied with forms , that system has various ingenious modes of reconciling its superstitions and traditionary doctrines with the essential truths of Christianity . Thus the Roman Catholic church has held within its enclosures such minds as Fenelon , and Pascal , and Sir Thomas More . The grace of God may employ that truth which is buried under Roman errors , as the instrument of spiritual renovation and sanctification to many an individual whose mind is yet , in one degree or another-like that ofApollos before Aquila and Priscilla taught him , or like that of the centurion Cornelius before Peter came to himfettered and darkened . It is possible then , for one who has been trained in the Roman Catholic church , to acquire and to receive into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redeeming work , as shall be made effectual to his salvation . It is very possible that a Romanist , making frequent confession to a priest , much in bondnge to the forms and traditions of his church , much perplexed and weighed down with the burthens grievous to be borne which a usurping authority has laid upon his conscience-may yet be earnest , contrite , conscientious-may walk humbly with Godmay hope in Christ , and be in the way to be saved through Christ ; while after all he can not work himself out of the delusions by which he has been enslaved . A Roman Catholic priest-though it is so natural for Protestants to regard him as a deceiver-may be an honest man ; nay , he may be , before God who knows his infirmities , an Israelite indeed . Luther was such a priest-long after he began to un* // 237 derstand , as well as to feel , the power of the Gospel ; and long before he began to entertain a thought of throwing off the yoke of Roman bondage . So was Zuingle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak . Every individual Roman Catholic , then , ought to be held , by his Protestant neighbors and acquaintance , in just that degree of respect which his individual character may seem to deserve . We are not to confound the individual with the organization in which he is included , for he is an individual still . Romanism may be Antichrist , sitting in the place of God , and inscribed with names of blasphemy ; but he , the individual , though he be a devout Romanist-nay though he be a priest of Rome-is to stand or fall before God , according to his individual character . We are not to look upon him as if he were the inventor of the holy tribunal and its tortures , or as if he had volunteered to bring faggots to the stake of John Rogers . We are not to impute to him , as a part of his character , whatever nameless abominations have been committed within the walls of convents , or by the aid of the confessional . We are not to look on him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the priestly diplomacy of Rome , has at one time and another lent its sanctity . Romanist as he is , he is your neighbor , as much your neighbor as the Samaritan was neighbor to the Jew ; and you are to treat him , not as a representative of a system that has figured so terribly in history , hut as an individual man , according to the manifestations of his individual character . We take another position . The Roman Catholics in this country , are not to be regarded as hostile to oar political institutions . There is a vague impression , if we mistake not , pretty widely diffused , that these Romanists-these naturalized foreigners-are at heart hostile to our laws and liberties . Much has been said about a conspiracy on the part of the Pope and the Popish powers in Europe , to overwhelm us with a flood of Roman Catholic emigration and Roman Catholic missions , and thus to overthrow our republican governments . That there may be such a conspiracy , in manner and form as set forth by those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That the court of Rome is determined to do every thing possible towards making this a Roman Catholic coun* try , is undoubtedly true . That the great body of devout Catholics , throughout Europe , are praying earnestly , in their way , and are contributing largely , for the propagation of their faith in these States , and with extravagant hopes of success , is a well ascertained fact . That the emperor of Austria and some other Roman Catholic potentates , take an interest in the enterprise , appears from authentic documents , and that they and their councillors may hope that America by being Romanized will cease to be republican , is altogether probable . But these hopes , these contributions and prayers and efforts do not prove nay , the alledged conspiracy if admitted as a matter of fact in its whole extent , does not prove-that the myriads of Roman Catholics who come to our country , come with the design of aiding in the overthrow of this great republic . If there is a conspiracy , how can it be proved that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hither ? Who does not know that they come as fugitives from oppression ? Who does not know that they come hither for the very reason that the government of this country , in its form and principles , is utterly unlike the governments under which they and their fathers have been in bondage ? No , whatever dangers are to be apprehended from the influx of these strangers , are altogether of another sort . // There is danger that in their ignorance and in their ill-taught zeal for democracy , they may become the dupes of demagogues . There is danger that , uninstructed as they are in respect to the working of republican institutions , and accustomed as they have been to regard all law as the mere dictate of arbitrary power , and to look on every officer of the law as the natural enemy of the people ,  --  they may be slow to realize that here the law instead of being the antagonist is the only guardian of liberty ; and that the ministry of the law exists only , that the individual may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is danger that accustomed as they have been to see government administered for the benefit of privileged classes , and thus to feel that the wealth of the rich has been , in part at least , unjustly extorted from the poor , they will bring their prejudices with them ; and will be slow to learn that here the poor man , free to labor , and free to spend or to accumulate the earnings of his labor , has the same interests as well as the same rights with the richest . There is danger that coming as the great majority of them do , from a country which has been for ages misgoverned and oppressed by a Protestant government-where a Protestant church , established by law and maintained by the bayonet , has been a standing outrage on a Roman Catholic population-and where , till a recent period , the profession and exercise of their religion has been attended with civil disabilities ,  --  they will bring their old religious animosities along with them ,  - -  and will presume that Protestants here are ready to oppress them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will thus be a more easy prey to such as are disposed to take advantage of their prejudices , for the sake of arraying them in hostility against any portion of the native citizens of their adopted country . Such dangers , it is obvious , will be increased instead of being counteracted , if these multitudes coming to cast in their lot with us and to share in our privileges , find themselves denounced and dreaded , in one quarter and another , as coming to overturn our republican constitutions , and to aid the political designs of European governments . The dangers in the case are to be counteracted by other methods . Our next point is one which we are at a loss how to state , except in the form of a truism . All the rights of Roman Catholics in this country , and especially their rights in respect to religious liberty , should be carefully regarded . The law , of course , makes no difference between them and us . The theory of society as here organized , knows no man as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was founded by a Roman Catholic proprietary ; and the boast of that state is , that it takes precedence of Rhode Island itself as having first attempted the establishment of a perfect religious freedom . The name of a Roman Catholic stands conspicuous among the signatures to the I ) eclaration of Independence , along with the names of Puritans from New England , and Cavaliers from Virginia . Roman Catholics have equal rights in the United States with Presbyterians or Baptists . No man dreams of altering our laws in this respect , or of taking away any of the legal liberties or rights of Roman Catholics . In conformity then with the spirit of these laws , we say that this class of strangers ought not to be subject to any social proscription . For example-it ought not to be made a principle in any quarter , that a Roman Catholic citizen , if in other respects the best qualified candidate for a particular office in the government , is not to receive the votes of his Protestant fellow citizens . For another exam plc -- their ministers ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the ministers and people of other denominations . Not that the right hand of Christian fellowship is to he given to them , as if they were ministers of Christ 's own Gospel , instead of heing priests of a corrupted and perverted Christianity . Not that an ignorant clown , if such an one happens to he invested with the insignia of that priesthood , is to be treated with the courtesy due to learning and civility . Not that a man of justly suspected morals , if such an one happens to steal into the line of that " apostolical succession , " is to he treated as irreproachable . But the Roman Catholic prelate or priest is in this country a having the same rights with a Protestant pastor , or with a prelate or priest of the Anglo-Catholic communion ; and as such he is to be treated just as other clergymen are treated in society , according to his personal character for learning and for morals . And here let us touch upon a question respecting which religious householders are sometimes in doubt , * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , or else all who make the Christian ministry , under any ecclesiastical name or constitution , their professional employment , are clergymen . He to whom preachiiig arid the administration of ret i gious ord iriances is a prof'ession , hat is , the business in which and hy which lie lives , is a clergynian in the only sense in which the word can he properly used under American institutioris . Here the words clergyman ' and minister , ' are used as synonyms . In countries which have a state church , ttie clergy are diose whom the state has made the established and endowed ministers of reliaion . Thus in England , a clergyroan ' is in holy orders in the church of England ; hut a minister ' in common parlance is a dissenter . Sidney Smith is not a minister , hut a clergyman . John Pye Smith is not a clergyman , hut a minister . The late Rohert Hall was a minister . The late C. C. Cotton was a clergyman . Those who read of " the dancing clergy " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember this distinction . and often in difficulty . It is a common thing for Roman Catholics to he hired for domestic service in Protestant families . Every family ought to have , as a family , its daily worship . Here is the questionWhat is my duty as the head of a family in respect to persons thus employed under my roof ? Shall I compel them by the power which my relation to them gives me-shall I compel them against their own convictions and ideas of duty-to conform to the worship of my family ? ' We answer , No . You are not responsible for them in this matter . You are bound to invite them kindly , and to use reasonable persuasion and friendly counsel ; but you are not bound to use any coercive or authoritative influence . In selecting those whom you will admit to this relation in your family , you have a right to prefer such as are willing to join with your family in the worship of God , if you can find such candidates for domestic service . And just so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , has a right to choose a Roman Catholic family , if she can find one , rather than a Protestant family . The relation between you and her is not that of master and servant , in the patriarchal sense of those words , or in the Jewish , or the Roman , or the feudal . It is simply the relation of employer and employed . And we are sure that by using any coercive influence upon her , to induce her to join in a worship which she regards with a religious horror - even if you have the power to do so-you will neither enlighten her ignorance , nor overcome her prejudices . If you must employ these ignorant and priestridden people under your roof-if you have no option but to admit them into your family-your duty does not require you to put any restraint upon their consciences . Let them feel that so far as their liberty is circumscribed , it is by their priest , // and not by you , that they are hindered from doing as they please . Let them see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due time they may begin to feel that the genius of their religion , as they have it under the priest , is slavery . The " school question , " as it is called , which has arisen in New York , must come up sooner or later , wherever there are public schools and Roman Catholic children . As to the particular form in which it has arisen in New York-as to the degree of wisdom with which the controversy there has been managed-as to the arrangements under which the school system of that city has been or is now conducted , we say nothing ; the details not being now before us , we are not qualified to pronounce any judgment on those matters . The question is to us not a New York question , but a general question . How shall the Roman Catholics be treated in respect to common schools ? As foreigners and as Roman Catholics , they are incomparably the most ignorant class of our population . What duty do we owe them-what duty do we owe to ourselves and our posterity-in respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into some sort of competency for citizenship ? The question is too large to be discussed in all its bearings . All that we shall attempt is to suggest two principles , which , though obvious , seem to be in some danger of being overlooked . 1 . It is better that Roman Catholic children should be educated in public schools in which the Bible is not read , than that they should be not educated at all , or educated in schools under the absolute control of their priesthood . If the Roman Catholics in this country learn only to read and write , it will be impossible for their priests always to hinder them from thinking . If in addition to reading and writing , they learn the elementary lessons of arithmetic and geography , they will in time become an intelligent and reading population , surrounded with a thousand sources of instruction and a thousand excitements to inquiry . Intelligent individuals may be devout Romanists ; but that an intelligent , reading , thinking population , can be a priestridden population in a free country-who will believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will constitute an inferior and therefore a dangerous caste . Let them be excluded from the public schools by any regulations which , however reasonable or well intended , have the effect of excluding them ; and then let them he taught in schools of their own under the absolute control of their priests ; and the great object of their training will be , to counteract all tendencies to the right use of knowledge in the way of thinking , and to make them from generation to generation a distinct body , governed in all things by their hierarchy , and cut off as much possible from all sympathy with American society . 2 . Whenever the Roman Catholics are permitted in this country , to look to their bishops and priests as the asserters and guardians of their religious liberty against the Protestant majority , it may be presumed that there is a mistake somewhere . When a Roman Catholic prelate becomes , in the estimation of his people , the champion of religious liberty , things are in a false position . Let the Roman Catholic feel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken away from him or from his children ; and immediately that liberty becomes infinitely valuable in his eyes . He will suffer for it-he will keep his children in the grossest ignorance rather than give it tip-he will die for it , if need be ; and the priest who asserts that liberty for him , will seem to him like a guardian // 241 angel . Such is human nature . But let the question take another shape - let the Roman Catholic who can read , or the Roman Catholic child who is learning to read , understand that his liberty of reading a book which every body else reads , is taken awny from him by the priest ; and his human nature feels itself wronged . The priest instead of seeming , as before , the champion of liberty , becomes , as he is in fact , its enemy . How plain is this . A Roman Catholic child asks , ' Why do I not go to school ? ' The ans*ver is , Because the Protestants will make you read the Bible if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely upon the Protestants . But suppose the question to be , Why do I not read the Bible at school as other children do ? ' To this question the obvious and only possible answer is , Because the priest  --  or the church-forbids you to read that book . ' In this case , the child can not avoid seeing that it is the priest or the church that circumscribes his liberty . He can not avoid seeing , that other children h. ye a privilege which the priest says he shall not have . We are far from supposing that a full solution of all the difficulties in " th2 school question " is contained in these two hints . Yct we are confident that eny determination or discussion of that question , in which these considerations are disregarded , will prove to be unfortu nate . To sum up , as in a word , much that has been already said , and much more that might be said , under the inquiry now before us , we say , Roman Catholics in our country ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited by all proper means to the fountains of knowledge , and to the exercise of free thought . They should be encouraged to forget all their national badges and distinctions , and to become , as completely as possible , and as soon as possible , Americans , in full sympathy with American institutions and American history . They should be made to know and to feel , that the spirit of Christianity -- of Protestant Christianity-is the spirit of liberty , of light , and of universal love . They should be made to see that they are surrounded by friends , and are welcome to a share in the boundless inheritance of privileges for which our fathers bled . In no other way than by the exercise of such kindness , is it possible to avert the dangers which are involved in the presence among us of these great and growing multitudes , aliens by birth and blood , strangers to our history and institutions , and trained in a religion utterly hostile to our own . It is not a merely legal naturalization , and a participation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish peasant into an American . All the kindly influences of society must operate upon him to transform his sentiments , till his national prejudices and his religious bigotry shall give way , and he is brought into sympathy with American habits of thought and feeling . So much for the spirit in which the Roman Catholic should be met by the American Protestant , on Amcrican soil and under American institutions . Let him encounter no bigotry , no religious hatred , no proscription in society , no intolerance or unkindness , nothing inconsistent with the spirit of complete and universal religious liberty . All this implies no indifference to the errors and mischievous tendencies of Romanism as a system of religion . Nor is there any contradiction between this and the most earnest efforts , for the maintenance and extension of true Christianity in opposition to that system . That such efforts are necessary , no intelligent man will be likely to deny . Romanism , under the protection of our // 242 Romanists and the Roman Catholic Controversy . free institutions , is entrenching itself upon our soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranging its forces and extending its agencies and means of influence in every direction . With a keen foresight , it has been for these twenty years laboring to preoccupy the west , and to fasten itself upon the undeveloped vigor of those young states , that it may hold them in its clasp and rise with their mighty growth . Not only does it tax its benighted subjects , to their utmost endurance , in the prosecution of its plans ; but the reviving zeal of Romish devotion in the old world comes to its aid , with the accumulated contributions of imperial princes and of hungry peasantry . Cathedrals , churches , convents and colleges , rise on the banks of the Ohio and the Mississippi , as monuments of the friendly interest which Austria takes in the intellectual and religious welfare of America . Great and continued effort , guided by the soundest wisdom , must be put forth to counteract that gigantic scheme for the extension of the papal dominion , of which these things are the first development . The conflict of the Reformation is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new form , upon the soil of America . We do not complain of this . We will not say that we regret it . Why should we not rejoice in it ? We come then to the inquiry , flow ought this conflict to be conducted ? What must Protestant Americans do to resist and defeat these designs of the Papacy ? In what spirit , with what instrumentalities , in what method , should we contend for the faith against the superstitions and the spiritual despotism of Rome ? First of all let us say , we can allow no place to despondency or discouragement in respect to the result . There is in some quarters , if we mistake not , a disposition to exaggerate the progress which Ro manism is making in these stalesa disposition which would fill the minds of the American people with the most extravagant fears of being brought into bondage by that power which , in other ages , kindled the fires of Smithfield , suppressed inquiry by the tortures of the Inquisition , and exulted in the massacre of St. Bartholomew 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us do what we may , we shall find ourselves too late ; and that the strength and progress of IRomanism among us are such as leave us but little chance of success . In such a state of mind , it is natural to conclude either that it is hardly worth the while to attempt any thing ; or that something must be done by legislation , or by party combinations , to prevent the IRomanists from acquiring a political influence . Thus an exasperated feeling springs up . The poor foreigner who comes hither to cast in his lot with us , and to find freedom and a home under our favoring sky , is regarded as an enemy , and is thus taught to look upon us as enemies to him . In this way , regarding him as an invader , we think little of doing him good ; and he , on the other hand , learning to regard us with responsive hostility , clings to his superstitions with a closer grasp , and yields himself up more entirely to the dominion of his priest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there to justify an antiPopery panic ? Is Popery a new thing upon the soil of America ? More than forty years before the settlement of Jamestown-more than half a century before the Mayflower moored in the bay of Plymouth , a Roman Catholic colony had been commenced within what is now our country ; and at this day houses are standing at St. Augustine which are said to have been erected before the earliest colonization of Virginia . Only four years after the settlement of Boston-two years before a beginning // was made in Connecticut , a Roman Catholic English colony was planted in Maryland . Such was the beginning of the competition between Romanism and Protestantism for the possession of this great domain ,  --  more than two hundred years ago . A hundred years ago , all the region west of the Alleghany Mountains was claimed by a Roman Catholic government , and a chain of French settlements , forts , and trading-houses , strengthened by Jesuit missions , stretched from the mouth of the St. Lawrence to New Orleans . The very names along that ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . St. Clair , St. Joseph , and St. Mary , St. Anthony , St. Charles , and St. Louis  --  the lakes , the streams , the cities , consecrated by the names of tutelary saints , from the Falls of Niagara to the delta of the Mississippiare memorials of that gigantic scheme of French and Popish dominion which , after having been long prosecuted at a vast expense of treasure , toil and blood , passed away at the peace of 1763 . What a defeat was that which the empire of superstition suffered , when it became the manifested decree of Providence that this wide region , from Maine to Florida , and from the Atlantic to the Pacific , should be sacred to religious liberty , and open to Protestant enterprise and the influence of evangelical institutions . And shall we now be discouraged or dismayed because in a population of more than seventeen millions , a million , or a million and a half , are Papists ? The proportion of Roman Catholics to the entire population within the territory now belonging to the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . But some are alarmed at the great increase of the Roman Catholics in this country of late . Within ten years , the numbers of their dioceses and bishops , of their clergy , and ( as it is believed ) of their people , have been more than doubled . At this rate of increase , it is argued , we shall soon become a Roman Catholic people . We would by no means make light of these facts . To us they are full of serious meaning . Still we insist that in these facts there is no reason for discouragement or dismay . The Jews in this country , for a few years past , have been doubling and redoubling their numbers more rapidly than the Romanists . Bavarian Jewish pedlers , with their head quarters at New Haven , are at this moment performing their circuits , with one.horse wagons , through all the highways and byeways of Connecticut itself . Does it therefore follow that the Jews will ere long become the majority ? No ; the increase of the Jews among us is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why that immigration has doubled and redoubled their number , is the well known fact that twenty years ago they were but a handful . This great and sudden increase will be found some years hence to have taken place by an arithmetical and not a geometrical ratio . An immigration of two thousand a year will in ten years double the number of twenty thousand . But if it is to be doubled again in the next ten years - if the forty thousand is to swell to eighty thousand  --  the annual immigration must be doubled ; and Europe , instead of giving us two thousand Jews per annum , must give us four thousand . We need not say that these numbers are taken at random , for the sake of illustration , and are not to be considered as an attempt to tell exactly how many Jews there are in this country , or how great is the yearly increase of their number . Apply this illustration to the increase of the Roman Catholics . They have doubled their number in ten years . How ? Why as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by immigration . The // 244 Romanists and the Roman CathoUc Controversy . reason why they have doubled within ten years , is that ten years ago they were only something more than half a million . They are not increasing in a geometrical ratio . The annual increment does not itself increase in proportion to the increase of the mass to which it is added . The foreigners who come to this country annually are estimated at 70,000 . Of these , some 50,000 probably , are by birth and training , Roman Catholicsi* Should this continue to be the average annual immigration ; should there be no general wars in Europe to employ the superabundant population , as of old , in armies , or to sweep them off in battles ; should there be no great political changes there to inspire the oppressed with new hopes , and to strengthen their attachments to their native soil ; should nothing begin to divert towards some other portions of the world now waiting to be colonized , that stream of emigration which is at present setting so steadily towards our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there will have been added to the Roman Catholic portion of our population , half a million of souls beside the natural increase . Thus ten years hence , the Romanists in the United States , will have multiplied to something like two millions and a quarter . This may seem alarming to those who look no farther . But remember that meanwhile the Protestant population will have increased from sixteen millions to more than twenty millions . The increase of Protestants by birth and immigration , is to the increase of Romanists by birth and immigration as five to one . And then , in the next succeeding period of ten years , the disproportion will be still greater , unless the iramigration of Catholics shall far exceed its present rate of fifty thousand annually . Why should we fear that this country is to be brought into subjection to Rome , and all its institutions subverted , by this Roman Catholic immigration ? In what year of our Lord , are the Roman Catholics likely to be the majority ? Is Popery multiplying its disciples by conversions from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents ? That there are some such conversions is a matter of course . There is no error so absurd , no system so monstrous , that it can not be recommended effectually to some minds in some way predisposed to receive it . Strange would it be if a system so imposing as Romanism , and so adapted to the various propensities of human nature , should make no proselytes in such a country as this . Here and there some ignorant person may be bewildered by a show of argument . Here and there some one whose senses have been half subverted by what are called " church principles , " may be logical enough to carry those principles out to their legitimate conclusions , and to renounce the Protestant name . Here and there one is moved by the " pomp and circumstance " of Romish worship , by the pictures and statues of saints-by the sign of the cross that scares away evil spirits , and the holy water that sprinkles the unclean-by the vestments of the priesthood , and the swinging censer - by the awe with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shape of the con*ec rated wafer-by the associations of romance and poetry , and the picturesque ideas of feudalism and monkish sanctity , connected with the church of the middle ages  --  or peradventure by some of those doctrines which so fascinate the imagination even of enlightened minds of a certain constitution . Here and there a girl , placed by unthinking parents in a convent school , or a boy committed to the tuition of Jesuits in a * We take these estimated numbers as we find them in Mr. Brainerd 's Sermon , p. 15. // Roman Catholic college , has come out after a sufficient course of training , a hearty proselyte . In the Romish church too-as in some other chu rches-matrimony is sometimes effectual as a converting ordinance . But after all , what is the number of these conversions to Romanism ? Does not Mormonism itself make two converts where Rornanism makes one ? Are not some persons proselyted even to Judaism ? Do not Roman priests themselves admit that the conversions from their church in this country are as yet more numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet shown that the American people are at all inclined to abandon the right of private judgment , to forego their hereditary privilege of reading the Bible for themselves , and to give their consciences and souls to the keeping of a priesthood . Why then should we admit one discouraging thought ? The truth is with us , and the God of truth , in this conflict with systematized superstition and spiritual despotism . The argument against the Roman Catholic perversions of Christianity , is as strong now as it was in the days of Luther , and as convincing too , if it can but get a fair hearing . And in managing that argument before the American people , we have every advantage we can ask for . The argument is to be conducted before a people who have the Bible in their hands , and who , if they acknowledge Christianity at all , will refuse to acknowledge any Christianity which can not be proved out of the Bible . The argument is to be conducted in the language of the people ,  --  the En*lish * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Lollards ,  --  the language of the " Book of Martyrs , " - the language in which Latimer and Rid ley greeted and cheered each other at the stake ,  --  the language in which Cranmer breathed out his repentance as he thrust into the lire the hand , " that unworthy hand , " which had signed his cowardly recantation ,  --  the language of Milton and Bunyan ,  --  the language richer than any other in an Evangelical literature , the popular , devotional and religious literature of Protestant Christianity . The people who are to be argued or in some other way persuaded into an acknowledgment of the Pope 's infallibility , and into the belief that a priest-ignorant perhaps , or profligate , or both-has power to forgive sins  --  the people who are expected to renounce the Bible as a book which it is unsafe for them to read , and who are expected to give up the right of electing their own religious teachers and ecclesiastical officers , and to submit meekly and absolutely to a religious despotism ,  --  are none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius of this people , as shown in their history , in their political and social institutions , and in all the indications of their national character , is utterly hostile to the claims of the Romish hierarchy . the history of every religious sect in this country , the Roman Catholic sect not excepted , shows that the irresistible tendency of things upon our soil is to democracy in church as well as in state . Away then with all feelings of discouragement , as if there were , or could be , some doubt whether the despotism of Rome may not yet be established over us , or over our posterity . The Roman Catholic church in this country is not , and never can be , what the Roman Catholic church was , when it domineered in England in the person of the bloody Queen Mary . It is not , and never can be , the Popery which has been for ages the subject of successive panics in England . Here it is not , and never can be , an established church , delivering over those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sword by the secular power . It is nothing but a sect among other sects , all standing on // 246 Romanists and the Roman Catholic Controversy . one level and enjoying the same  |p0-litical  and social privileges . As a deadly heresy , an utter perversion of Christianity , a system fitted to demoralize and degrade the people , it is to he feared , just as we fear any other system of deadly error embodied in the form of a sectarian organization . XVe have Papists among us ; and so we have Jews , rejecting " him of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets did write . " We have Papists and so we have Shakers and Swedenborgians and Mormons . We have Papists , and so we have Universalists and Socialists . These various sects , and others , are to be feared in various degrees , according as their doctrines are more or less destructive to religion and good morals , and their sectarian arrangements more or less imposing and efficient . The Papist here is nothing but a sectariaa among sectarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liberty , and of the universal equality of religious rights and privileges . He can not succeed here by g*rting the private ear , and misguiding the sickly conscience , of the monarch . He can not succeed by perverting a few leading minds among the aristocracy . He can not succeed by intriguing to overthrow the established church and to get his own established in its place . He can succeed only by converting the people one by one . Let him try . The field is open . Let him do all he can . What we have to do is to meet him in the field of open argument before the people . A*vay with every thought of discouragement in such a conflict . We proceed then to another position . It must be borne in mind , that the controversy with the system of the Roman Catholic church - involving the question between ecclesiastical despotism and religious freedom , and the question between formalism and spiritual Christianity-is the great controversy of the age now begun ; and the policy of Protestant Christians must be shaped accordingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many quarters against those views of Christianity , which , though always held in the mongrel communion of the half-reformed church of England , have been lately set forth with a new earnestness and eloquence by the writers of the Oxford school-is not without a true and serious meaning . That in the Roman Catholic system , which is first and chiefly to be contended against-that which constitutes its center and the seat of its life-that corruption from which every other corruption of the great and coinplex system takes its rise-is the identical thing which constitutes the religion of what is now called " Oxford theology . " It is simply church principles . " It is simply the doctrine of salvation by the church and through the priest , instead of salvation by Christ alone through the grace of the Holy Spirit . In this doctrine of salvation by the church and through the priest , lies the germ of all that system of despotism and superstition which we call Romanism . The controversy of the age is not with the Roman Catholic church , but with the Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the full development , whether taught at Rome or at " Riverside , " whether at Oxford or New York . The doctrine , that membership in the visible church makes a man a member of Christ , instead of the doctrine that a man must belong to Christ before he belongs to the churchthe doctrine of a human priesthood with power to open and to shut the gates of heaven  --  the doctrine that baptism with water ministered by priestly hands is regeneration and justification  --  the doctrine that the benefits of Christ 's atoning death , instead of being received directly by the repenting sinner , in the simple act of faith , are conveyed by the // hands of the priest under the form of the sacramental bread , and are received by the bodily action of eating-these doctrines and such as these , whether in Latin or in English , are the foundation doctrines of the Roman Catholic system of religion . These doctrines , and others akin to them , are that formalism which overlays and stifles the spirituality of Christianity . This kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disown the Pope , and be very sorry for the errors and excesses into which the church of Rome has fallen , is the same thing in essence with the formalism commonly known and spoken of as Popery . It is simply Romanism schismatically separated from Rome . It is Popery without its offensive grossness . It is Popery shorn of some extravagancies , but not therefore the less to be contended against . To contend against the Roman Catholic system of religion only in combination with the Roman Catholic church , and to give the right hand of fellowship to the same system when it appears in other connections , is to betray and not to defend the cause of spiritual Christianity . We say then that the true policy is not to assail the Roman Catholic system in its outermost branches , but to strike at its root  --  to argue not chiefly against its particular forms of superstition and of domination over conscience , but against its essential formalism . And this is to be done in no way so effectively as by a clear and continual assertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith alone , and Regeneration by the free and unbought grace of the Holy Spirit . The fundamental question between the Roman Catholic religion and the religion of the New Testament , is not the question of the Pope 's supremacy or infallibility ; it is not the question whether Peter was the first bishop of Rome ; it is not the question of transubstantiation , or of the catholicity of the Council of Trent ; it is not the question whether the honor paid by Romanists to the Virgin Mary and to the other saints of their great pantheon is idolatry ; it is not the question whether the genius of Romanism is essentially bloodthirsty and persecuting , or whether the ignorance and degradation of the masses in Roman Catholic countries is to be ascribed to the priesthood . The grand question between the two religions is simpler and plainer than any of these . It is a question upon which every reader of the Bible is as competent an umpire , as a juror on a question of fact after hearing the evidence . It is , in effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved ? How is it-where is it-that the guilty conscience can find peace ? What answer shall be given to him who cries out , pricked to the heart with the conviction of his alienation from God ? Fix the attention of the Papist on the state of his own heart in the sight of a holy God ; let him ask with an awakened conscience how God can forgive him , and how he can have just evidence that he is reconciled to God ; teach him to rely in simplicity upon the faithful saying that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners ; let him find in the spirit of adoption within him crying Abba Father , and in the fruits of the Spirit in his heart and life , the evidence that God bath first loved him and hath begun a good work within him ; and then the whole controversy between the Romish system and the evangelical , will be seen by him in a new light ; there will fall from his eyes as it were scales ; link after link the chains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will walk ere long in the full liberty of the sons of God . The formalist is to be converted from his errors , not ordinarily by being made a theoretical Protestant first , but by being // made to experience the power of the Gospel . Therefore it is that the thing which Rornanism most hates and fears , and the thing with which the romantic and rubrical sensibilities of Oxford ism are most offended , is evangelical Christian experience , the work of the Spirit of God convincing men of sin , of righteousness , and of judgment , and leading them to Christ , the only priest and the only mediator. * That outpouring of the Spirit which so gloriously accompanies the clear and earnest exhibition of the Gospel in its simple purity-that Divine blessing which attends the humble , praying effort to convert men , one by one , from sin to holiness , must be our great hope in the controversy with the religion of Rome . One blessed effect of the hostile presence of Romanism , and of a * Opposition to that evangelical Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spirit of Godopposition to what Bishop Brownell 's presbyters ' call Revivalism , ' orin other words to that system which is accompanied by the spiritual phenomena cominony known as " experimental religion " - is the ground of an acknowledged sympathy , and will probably he , sooner or later , the ground of a complete union between the Episcopalianism of New York and the Unitarianism of Boston . Thus the Churchman , the " official organ " of the Anglo-Catholic Bi*hop of New York , speaks of " the Christian Register , an organ of the Unitarians in Boston , " in these terms : " A journal to which we are diametrically opposed on the very fundamentals of thith , but to which nevertheless , we are nor ashamed to acknowledge that we are drawn by many cords of sympathy , and among them an hostility to the popular religion of the day . ( variously cvlled Orthodo y ' Calvinism , Revivalism , and the Let/reran heresy of Jast ( fication , ) and an ardent desire that men may practically know , arid realize , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which our blessed Savior has placed within their reach . " - ( New York Churchman , Feb. 17 , 1844 . ) We think any intelligent observer would be interested in watching the moral affinities between the system of which the Churchman is the organ , and that represented by the Christian Register . April , kindred system , in the midst of our people , is that it naturally constrains evangelical churches and pastors of every name to fall back upon those elementary views of the Gospel which they hold in common . Thus they understand themselves better , in their several distinct positions , and at the same time they understand each other better , and are more ready to recognize each other as standing on one basis . And what is still more important , they understand the Bible better ; and are better prepared to exhibit the Gospel in its original simplicity . The true way to understand the Epistle to the Romans , or that to the Ephesians , or the sermon on the mount , is to expound it to a Formalist , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of this conflict , we may hope to see new light breaking forth on all sides from the oracles of God , and a new consciousness of spiritual affinities bringing the vartous branches of Christ 's true Catholic church into a more vigorous cooperation and a more generally acknowledged union . While we thus insist on the importance of regarding and prosecuting this controversy as involved in that more comprehensive and extended controversy between formalism and spiritual Christianity which signalizes the age , we would by no means deny that Romanism in its details should he made the theme of discussion . On the contrary , wa say that the claims , doctrines , and entire system of the Roman Catholic church , should be discussed just like any other subject of equal importance . The whole controversy between Rome and the Reformation should be studied under all the lights of Scripture , philosophy , and history , in theological seminaries . One point after another , as occasions may arise , should be presented to the learned , or to the public at large , through the press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Roman Catholic Controversy . // 249 of this country better prepared for such discussion than at this very time . Those various inquiries and debates respecting the doctrines of grace . which have given a character to American theology ever since the days of ' Edwards , have done much towards training our theologians for such a conflict as that to which they are now called . And within the last thirty years , by the instrumentality of men who are yet living to rejoice in the results of their labors , there has been wakened extensively a taste for thorough biblical studies , which is making our theologians sound and careful scholars as well as acute logicians . Romanism then must be discussed freely , manfully , thoroughly , as every thing else is discussed in this land of a free press , a free church , and a free pulpit . We have no wish that it should be discussed for popular agitation and excitement . The people may need to be instructed , lest they be led astray ; but there is little occasion to introduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much effect on English politics ever since the days of Henry VIII . In this view it may be doubted whether the labors of traveling lecturers against Romanism are expedient . If the lecturer is one of a kind and tolerant spirit , who is particularly acquainted with the subject in all its relations , and who can catch the favorable attention of Romanists themselves , and put them upon inquiry and reflection respecting themselves and the system by which they are held in bondage ; and if at the same time he can wisely and discreetly touch the kinder feelings of his Protestant hearers , moving them to prayer and Christian efforts for the conversion of the ignorant and superstitious , we will not deny that such a lecturer may do great good . But if he is one who goes from place to place stirring up hate and strife-if his appeal is continually directed to the excitement of political or sectarian jealousies and animosities-we can not but think that he might serve God and his country better in some other employment , and that the cause of evangelical truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be taken for granted in the discussion now required , that the question between Romanism and pure Christianity was entirely settled at the Reformation , and that we have nothing to do in these days but to repeat the statements and iterate the arguments which we have received by tradition from our fathers . Admit that Popery has not changed , still the world has changed ; and the Reformation has changed , at least so far as to involve completely and fairly the admission that the Reformers did not fully understand their own cause . In a sad and most important sense , the Reformation of the sixteenth century was a failure . We do not mean that it was not , so far as it went , and so far as it was received and carried into effect , a real and glorious reformation . Nor that those Reformers had not the truth wholly on their side in the controversy . Nor that they were not raised up by God to achieve a work second in importance only to the work performed by the Apostles . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the doctrines of Rome , are not essentially the doctrines of the Gospel . But notwithstanding all that the Reformation was , and all that it accomplished for the church and for the world , every man who reads with philosophic eye the history of those times , and the history of succeeding times even to the present day , ' will be constrained to say that the Reformation was in a painful sense a failure . Look at those countries where the Protestant movement was utterly suppressed ,  --  Italy , Spain , Belgium , and tell us whether the Reformation was not a failure there . // Look at France , where Protestantism , once rallying under its standard half the strength of the kingdom , was compelled after ages of convulsion and slaughter to sink into the condition of a depressed , weak , insignificant minority ; and tell us whether the Reformation was not a failure there . Look at countries where the Reformation prevailed ,  --  Geneva , 1-lolland , Northern Germany ,  --  see the wide decay of evangelical piety and of evangelical doctrine-see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment has recognized as the Reformed religion ; and tell us whether notwithstanding all the moral differences between those countries and the Roman Catholic countries around them , the Reformation was not in some sad sense a failure there . Who will tell us in respect to England that the Reformation there has done what it ought to have done ? Who will look even upon Scotland in all the glory of the new reformation through which she is now passing , and tell us that the old Reformation was not in some sad sense a failure there . The Reformation was to some extent a failure ,  --  not , as the hooded owls hooting from the towers of Oxford would have us believe , because it xveat too far ,  --  but because it was not permitted to go far enough , because it did not consistently and thoroughly carry out its own principles-because while emancipating the state from the power of the church , it did not emancipate the church from the power of the state . rphe Reformation from the very beginning was entangled in political influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reformers did not found their institutions on that " voluntary principle " of which Wycliffe seems to have had some glimpses almost two centuries before them . They admitted the right of civil government to intermeddle with religion , and to use the sword for the suppression of heresy and schism . They recognized and adopted into their system the baleful principle of religious persecution . Thus the Reformation failed of being carried forward to perfection . it became secularized , it decayed , it sunk into a dead formalism , from which it is now at last beginning to revive . Here then is an admission , universal in this country , that the Reformers were in error . On this point , then , if on no other point , we are in advance of the Reformers . From this vantage-ground , Romanism is now to be reexamined . The Reformation of the sixteenth century was in an error , and therefore it could not settle the question between Romanism and the Gospel . The discussion must be taken up anew , and reexamined in the clearer light in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand . But it is not true that Romanism remains unchanged . The church of Rome in the pontificate of Gregory XVI , is not what the church of Rome was in the pontificate of Leo X. Her position in respect to the world is changed , and she must needs adapt her policy , and the instrumentalities by which she works , to her position as it now is . And in fact , notwithstanding Rome 's boasted infallibity , no system is more flexible than hers to accommodate itself to times and places . The superstitions and dognias which are essential to her gains , and to her despotism over the souls of men , she never surrenders . But on points unessential to the end for which her system exists , she can easily suit herself to those with whom she has to do . Romanism , considered as a religion , or as showing the way in which a sinner may obtain salvation , is formalism , superstition , despotism , every where . In this point of view , it is the same in Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islands , in Austria and in America- But its policy changes , its arguments change , its // political doctrines change , according to the climate and the soil where it is planted . Here therefore we are to see-nay , we begin to see already , a new type of Romanisin superstition accommodating itself to the freedom of the press ; ecclesiastical despotism allying itself with political democracy . On this point the testimony of Do Tocquevillehimself a liberal minded Roman Catholic-deserves to he considered . " There are no Romish priests who show less taste for the minute inrihvidual observances , for extraordinary or peculiar means of salvation , or who cling more to the spirit , and less to the letter , of the law , than the iRoman Catholic priests of the United States . No where is that doctrine of the church , which prohibits the worship reserved to God alone from being offered to the saints , more clearly inculcated or more generally followed. *** That is , the Roman Catholic system of religion , in seeking to adapt itself to the genius of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , then , the controversy with Romanism must he a new examination of the whole field of inquiry as it may open before us . And as the controversy here is not to be a controversy on the question which religion shall be established with exclusive or superior privileges , one element of animosity which has characterized the controversy in other countries and in other times , ought to find here no place whatever . The circumstances of the controversy here are so far new , that unless we take up the question anew and throw new light upon its principles and its details , we shall fail of doing justice to the truth . But it is not by discussion alone that the crisis in our country is to be met . We proceed then to another topic , on which it is not necessary for us to insist particularly . * Democracy in America , V01 . II* P. 27 . To the inquiry , what must be done to counteract the efforts which the Roman Catholic church is making in these states , we answer , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the enlightening and saving influence of evangelical institutions . If any part of our country is left to the dominion of ignorance , infidelity and fanaticism , there Romanism may hope to triumph . The Gospel then must be preached in all the extent of our country , not merely as it may be preached by the wandering bookpedler-not nierely as it may be preached by the itinerant missionary or circuit rider-not merely as it may be preached by an illiterate and unprofessional , though pious , ministry  --  but as it can be preached by the intelligent and devoted pastor living among his people , hoping to die among them , and giving himself wholly to the work of making known the Gospel . The great enterprise of Home Missions as it is pursued by our various evangelical bodies , all of which may now be regarded as laboring in the common cause of planting through out the Union , an educated ministry , and in one form and another a pastoral ministry ,  - -  must be pursued with new vigor . Every where the ground must be occupied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry , presiding over evangelical congregations as pastors and teachers . In the presence of such churches , supplied with such a ministry ; Romanism may exhaust her resources in vain . All our evangelical enterprises at home , should he estimated in their relations to the one enterprise of bringing the whole country under the influence of such a moral organization ,  --  . Christian churches with learned , devoted , and studious pastors . Where there is such a ministry , performing its appropriate functions , there will be an educated and reading people , with schools for their children , with the ' // Bible in their dwellings , with the sabbath school and the Bible class , and with a constant demand for standard religious volumes . Where there is no ministry in a pastoral connection with organized congregations , there the success of nfl other forms of Christian effort  --  the success of the itinerant preacher-the success of the Tract Society 's bookvender-the success of the sabbath school  --  the success of the Bible Society 's distribution of the Scriptures - is to be measured by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a studious and teaching ministry . No department of the great work of establishing a truly Christian organization of society throughout our country , is more important than that which seeks to establish colleges and other similar institutions under evangelical influence . The college , including the theological seminary , is essential to such a state of society as is described when we speak of Christian churches with a learned and studious ministry . XVhat would the churches of New England be-what the clergy of these churches-without the colleges of New England ? And New England can never be reproduced upon the mighty rivers of the west , without reproducing there the entire New England system of education , popular and professional . The Roman ist movement at the west , concentrates itself upon a few prominent points . Here and there in some large town the idol cross stands as the symbol , not of the Gospel that makes free , but of the superstition that debases and enslaves . Here and there in some great emporium , arises a magnificent cathedral , with its appendages perhaps of college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such point to another , and taking no notice of what lies between , may be ready to conclude that America has already become one of the most Catholic of countries . But the strength of Pro .. April , testant Christianity , instead of being thus concentrated , is diffused . Protestantism builds no cathedrals , and therefore perhaps it shows less than iRomanism , to the eye of a stranger , at St. Louis or at Cincinnati . The strength of Protestantism in the west , is not at St. Louis , nor at Cincinnati , nor at Chicago , nor at Cleveland or Detroit , but at a thousand localities where the lords of the soil , cultivating their own possessions , dwelling as yet perhaps in no better tenement than a log cabin , come together every sabbath day with their households to worship the God of the Bible . The gathering of five thousand Papists in a cathedral , with all the pomp of Romish worship , is a great affair no doubt . But the gathering of fifty thousand Protestants in five hundred different places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hear the Gospel in their own language , is a greater affair . Were the Romanists , with their present numbers dispersed as widely as the Protestants are , they would be lost . Undoubtedly the policy which they are pursuing is for them the true one . They are strengthening themselves at points which are hereafter to become centers of Roman Catholic influence . Our policy on the other hand , which builds no cathedrals , requires us to cheer and strengthen and bind together by vital sympathies , the multiplied dispersed and feeble congregations whose worship is performed in rude and temporary structures or under the shadow of the ancient trees . Such aid we are giving continually through the channel of home missions . Such aid we are giving also with equal if not greater efficiency by cooperating in the establishment of colleges that shall be centers of sound and thorough evangelical education . What the cathedral is to the Roman Catholic system , that , and much more than that , the college and theological seminary is to the Protestant evangelical system . Romanists and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making to acquire influence over the American people by institutions of education , is the most striking illustration which we have yet seen of the earnestness with which she enters upon her enterprise in the United States . If Protestants would but leave the field of liberal education at the west to be occupied by iRomish colleges and convents , how easy a thing would it be for the Jesuits to go on rejoicingly with their great work of Romanizing our country . If the Protestants will waste their strength upon a host of ill-concerted , ill-managed , starveling institutions under the name of colleges , and will allow the Jesuits to build up a few substantial colleges , with ample apparatus , with great libraries , and with a reputation for sound scholarship , the Jesuits will be almost as well pleased as if they bad the whole field to themselves . But if a reasonable number of well organized colleges and theological seminaries can be planted at the west , and can be sustained and provided with books , and all necessary aids of study and instruction , till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and till the communities around them have been pervaded by their influence ; the Jesuit may pack up his relics and pictures , and go back to Rome . We have one more topic which we must touch upon in answer to the inquiry before us . There should be a more extensive intercourse and correspondence among Protestant Christians throughout the world , and a more combined and vigorous effort to carry the Gospel into Roman Catholic countries , even into those which have been deemed impregnable . All the developments of the controversy with formalism are forcing evangelical Protestants to think less of the points that divide them , and to fix their attention more upon that truly catholic Christianity , which they hold in common . We say then that the signs of the times are imperatively calling them to consult together for their common welfare and edification , and for aggression and defense against a common enemy . We do not say that the Presbyterian and the Methodist , the Baptist and the Congregationalist , must at once abandon their several peculiarities of order and of doctrine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one confession of faith , one form of government , one system of arrangements for the propagation of the Gospel . In this place , we only suggest the question whether there may not be among evangelical Christians of various names and connections , more of correspondence and mutual consultation , a more explicit recognition of the obligation to mutual communion , and a clearer holding forth of their actual unity in faith and hope ; and whether , as the result of this , there may not be more of cooperation in the advancement of the common cause ; and a new impulse given to the reformation and revival of Christianity , throughout Christendom . Why might there not be , on some fit occasion in New York , such a thing as a full conference of evangelical ministers of various denominations , from various parts of the United States , at least for prayer and mutual edification , if not for consultation and inquiry respecting the advancement of religion ? Nay , why might there not he , ere long , some general conference in which the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the continent of Europe , should be in some way represented , and in which the great cause of reformed and spiritual Christianity throughout the world , should be made the subject of detailed and deliberate consideration , with prayer and praise ? That would be an " ecumenical council , " such as never yet assembled since the Apostles parted from each other at // Jerusalem , a council not for legislation and division , but for union and communion , and for the extension of the saving knowledge of Christ . Suppose such a convention , met at London , or Edinburgh , or Genev*i ; suppose that the facts respecting the state of evangelical and experimental piety , are reported from one country and another in succession , and brought under the deliberate consideration of the assembly there , and then after having been digested and discussed are carried back by the various representatives to all the regions and churches from which they came . Suppose the resources of the various evangelical churches throughout Christendom are reported , their institutions of education , their arrangements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-defense and self-extension , their methods of aggression on the world around them , and their plans and enterprises for the propagation of the Gospel among the nations . Suppose all this knowledge sum med up and discussed in connection with the inquiry , what more can we do , and how can we best sustain and help each other ? Suppose that upon that assembly the Spirit of God is poured out , as the spirit of grace and supplication , the spirit of love and faith and zeal . What would be the effect of all this upon the churches and upon the world ? How easily may the reader nominate in his own thoughts a delegation from the Congregationalists , from each of the two great Presbyterian bodies , from the Baptists , and from the Methodists , whose presence in such a convention to report with one accord the facts respecting religion in America , and the progress of living Christianity in connection with the voluntary principle ,  --  would electrify the Protestant world . We make this supposition , not as expecting to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception warms our hearts , and can not but warm the heart of every Christian reader . The time has come when Protestantism must not merely defend itself , and try to maintain its own ground in America and Europe against the industrious machinations of the Jesuits , but must begin to act aggressively upon countries that have heretofore been deemed exclusively , if not hopelessly , Papal . The Reformation is reviving , under better auspices , upon its ancient seats ; and now it must be pushed into regions from which it has been , in other ages , too successfully excluded . Our Foreign Evangelical Society , and some kindred institutions , are operating with encouraging success to aid in restoring and quickening the decayed Protestantism of France and Switzerland . Thus Geneva , with its new theological school , and its enterprising evangelism , has become the center of a spreading religious revival for all that part of Europe . But such efforts as these are not enough . The war with formalism , the inquiry after primitive and spiritual Christianity , must be carried into countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who , of the millions that have read the story of George Borrow 's adventures in Spain , need doubt that the time has come when the question , What is the Christianity of the New Testament ? - What is the way to be saved from sin , and to be at peace with God ? - may be made to awaken thought and discussion in that proud but degraded land of chivalry and superstition ? The mind of Spain is at this moment in at attitude in which it may easily be moved to demand freedom of thought , freedom to read the Bible , and freedom to worship without a priest . It is not Lutheranism or Calvinism , by those names , that can be carried into Spain and propagated there ; it is not as Episcopalianism , or as Presbyterianism , or as Methodism , // 255 from some " heretical " country , that Protestant ideas can be made to reach that people ; but as pure Christianity , fresh from the Biblethe Gospel of freedom , of life , and of the Holy Spirit ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be begun in such a country as Spain . Who can doubt that in these days of universal agitation , when changes are so fast coming over all the earth , Romanism may in this way be effectually assailed in her strongest entrenchments . Italy itself , the very citadel of Antichrist , is not impregnable. * The thousands and tens of thousands of patriotic minds in that country , yearning after political freedom , faint and weary with repeated disappointments , are settling down into the conviction that Italy must be reformed before Italy can be free ; and while they are endeavoring to use all practicable means for the intellectual and moral reformation of their countrymen , they are looking round in all directions for sympathy and aid . Many of the noblest and most gifted minds of Italy are at this moment exiles in Protestant countries-exiles like those of old from England , who saw in their city of refuge , guarded by the Alps and kissed by the blue Wateis , the inspiring sight which never faded from their memory , " a church without a bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italians in New York , in London , in Paris , wherever they come within the reach of evangelical Christians , are a living medium of communication with the mind of Italy . They hold in their hands the links of an unseen chain along which electric light and fire may pass to thousands of Italians in their native country . Through * The Christian Alliance ; its constitution , list of officers , and address . New York , 1843. them we may operate to waken inquiry , and to direct the inquiring in Tuscany , in Lombardy , in Piedmont , and at Rome itself . With their aid , and through such agencies as they may enable us to arrange , we may send the Bible into . Italy with whatever other books are most suited to touch those spiritual sensibilities which superstition stifles ; and the prohibito and prohibitissimo of the custom-house and the police , will only cause such books to be read with the more eagerness . Italy is not impregnable . Let us write upon our banner , Tendintus in Lalium ; and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ohio , the Hudson , and the Connecticut , let him look out for the banks of the Tiber . We are happy to observe some indications of an awakening interest in behalf of that most interesting body of men , the Italian exiles . Every truly American mind , every Protestant mind , ought to syinpathize with them in what they are enduring as the confessors of liberty , and in those hopes for their glorious country which disappointment and banishment are unable to extinguish . We do not desire to see a political crusade against the governments of Italy ; though we know not how those who are now holding public meetings and raising contributions throughout the country to effect a political revolution in Ireland ,  --  in which we wish them much success ,  --  could object to the holding of public meetings and raising contributions to " repeal the union " between Lombardy and Austria . But we do desire to see Protestant Christians everywhere cheering these exiled patriots with the warmest sympathy , and fixing their hearts upon the religious reformation of Italy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
