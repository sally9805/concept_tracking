txt THE nervous system of man , has deservedly attracted the attention of the anatomist and physiologist of every age . The peculiarity of its structure , the singularity and importance of its functions , in that it is the immediate means of communication between mind and matter , body and spirit , the necessity of its integrity to the due performance of every bodily office , and of every mental operation , together with the strange variety of its diseases , have invested it with a degree of interest belonging to no other modification of material elements . During the last fifty years , our knowledge of this system has been greatly enlarged , and rendered more exact by the labors of some of the most acute minds of the age . Those conversant with the subject , will at once call to mind the names of Bell , Magendie , Mayo , Hall , and many others almost their equals ; men of vigorous intellect , learned , industrious Vol . IV . 55 and loving the truth , who have labored strenuously and successfully in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not in hypotheses or fanciful speculations , but in true deductions from established facts . Along with these true philosophers , other laborers have entered into the field , and claim to have gathered an abundt*nt harvest of flowers and fruits , " pleasant to the eyes , good for food and to be desired to make wise . " Phrenology has assumed dominion over the brain , discovered its operations , and laid open its hidden mysteries to its votaries , while Mesmerism , taking cognizance of the whole nervous system , has extended the range of operation of these organs beyond the body to which they belong , to other bodies , or*anic and inorganic , near and remote . Whatever foundation of truth there may be at the bottom of these subjects , notions sufficiently extravagant concerning them , and others // allied to them , have been widely and industriously promulgated in newspapers , pamphlets , and hand books ; and have been spread before the public in popular lectures , and been privately taught by men and women , learned in these branches of science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking the place of the mountebanks of a former age , have dazzled the eyes and bewildered the minds of the multitude with a revelation of hitherto hidden mysteries , at once extracting silver from their pockets and common sense from their brains . The most highly gifted of this class have been called upon to aid , or rather supersede , the physician , in the discovery and the cure of disease , and the magistrate , in the detection of crime and in determining the degree of guilt belonging to the criminal . Claims so strong and so industriously made , of the means of discovering the character and actions of others , have afflicted the timid and credulous in their innermost chambers , through fear of secrets disclosed and hidden things brought to light , with the same sort of apprehension as that which led the good lady to threaten her too curious neighbor with an action of assault and battery for looking at her through a spy glass , because her knowledge of optics had taught her that she would be seen topsy turvy . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctness of the notions alluded to , the inquiry may be allowed , perhaps without offense , whether the great portion of those who have formed definite conclusions concerning these things , are sufficiently prepared , by their habits of investigation and by their previous knowledge , to decide correctly . The object of the present article is to show , by a statement of some of the phenomena which occur in the nervous system , both in health and disease , how careful an examination of facts , how much and varied knowledge , how cool and unimpassioned a judgment are necessary , to form correct conclusions concerning its subtle and wonderful operations . A brief account of the structure of the nervous system , will , with propriety , precede any remarks upon its functions . Nervous matter exists in all animals . In the lowest orders of animals , it is in the form of minute globules , interspersed , without much apparent regularity of arrangement , throughout the substance of their organs . In others , with almost the same simplicity of structure , it is seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most part , around the orifice of their digestive apparatus , which constitutes the most important part , and near ) y the whole of their body . As one organ after another is added , in the ascending scale of animal existence , corresponding additions are made also to the nervou* system , until in the more complex animals and in man , it is made up of many parts , unlike each other in function , and perhaps in structure . These parts are generally described as consisting of the brain , the spinal marrow , and the nerves proceeding from them , together with the ganglionic system , made up of many nervous centres , from which also many nerves proceed . In every part of this substance from which nerves originate , there are found two kinds of nervous matter ; one , the grey matter found abundantly in the brain , less so in the spinal marrow , less still , though perfectly obvious , in the various ganglia , consisting of minute , pulpy particles of various forms , united to each other without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cellular membrane , to which very many minute blood vessels are distributed , giving to it a high degree of vascularity ; the other , the white matter , is found also abundantly in // the brain , makes up a considerable portion of the spinal marrow and the whole of the nerves . This substance is also of a soft consistence , though firmer than the gray matter , obviously fibrous in its texture , the fibres made up of a pulpy matter invested with a covering of cellular membrane . These fibres are done up in bundles , that they may pass safely and be conveniently distributed to the organs which they are to supply . Every nervous fibril has one of its extremities connected with a portion of grey matter , from which it is said to originate , while the other is spread out and applied directly to the tissue of the organ to which it belongs , and there terminates . Thus , the fibres of the optic nerves com*ience principally in the grey matter of the tubercula quadrigemina , near the centre of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to form a pulpy membrane-the retina . The same arrangement substantially is true of all the nerves . This arrangement , together with many supporting facts , suggests the opinion , which is probably correct , that the grey matter originates and controls the nervous influence , while the white fibrous matter is the medium of communication between this controlling power and the organs to be influenced by it . The nervous system thus constituted , instead of being uniform in all its parts , either in its own operations or in the influence which it exerts upon the organs to which it is distributed , is made up of several distinct portions , each of which originates and controls a distinct set of functions . This fact is stated , without any intention of inquiring whether this diversity of function depends upon difference of elementary structure , a different arrangement of its several parts , or is the result of a difference in the tissues to which the nerves are distributed . A simple statement of what these several parts of the nervous system are , without any attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all that will be here attempted . 1st . A portion of the brain , which part and how much will not be inquired about , is the direct agent-the throne as the old writers call it-of the mind ; the seat of the affections and of the intellectual operations . 2d . A portion of the brain , consisting of several parts of it , mostly below and behind its centre , together with the nerves proceeding from it , and distributed to the nose , the eye , the ear , and the tongue , and endowing these organs with their peculiar functions , constitute the system of special sensation . 3d . Passing off from the posterior fibres of the spinal marrow , and from the same fibres continued upward to the brain , there is a series of nerves , which , together with the parts from which they originate , make up the system of common sensation . These fibres constitute a part of all the spinal nerves , and a considerable portion of the fifth pair of cerebral nerves , and their filaments are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another set of nerves are all those which control voluntary motion . These proceed from the anterior column of the spinal marrow , and from the same fibres continued into the brain . They constitute a part of all the spinal nerves , a portion of the fifth pair , and the whole of the third , sixth , and ninth pairs of the cerebral nerves , and are distributed to all the muscles that are under the control of the will . The second , third and fourth system of nerves , seem to be directly connected with that portion of the brain which is the seat of the mind . rj7he impressions which are made upon them , are there received , stored away and preserved for use , while the operations of the mind are transmitted by them to the organs upon which they are distributed . // 5th . There are certain muscles which , in addition to their ordinary voluntary muscular action , act also involuntarily . Such are the diaphragm , the muscles of the thorax , the neck and face ; in short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the function of respiration . To endow these muscles with the power of involuntary or associated action , they receive a distinct set of nerves , to which the name of the respiratory system has been given . These nerves are all given off from the lateral and upper portion of the spinal marrow and the oblong mass connected with it , and have no direct communication with the brain , and are therefore not under its influence . It will be observed , that all the muscles which receive these nerves , are also supplied with nerves of voluntary motion , so that while they are out of the control of the will in all those motions which are connected in any way with respiration , they are voluntary muscles for all other purposes . Thus the muscles of the face are involuntary , in the act of laughing , crying , and yawning , while they are obedient to the will in mastication , deglutition and all similar motions . 6th . Another and the last portion of the nervous system , to which the name of the ganglionic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls the circulation , nutrition , secretion , absorption , and all the vital organic functions , so far as these functions are under nervous influence . It consists of a chain of small masses of grey and white vie rvous matter , the ganglia , situated within the cavities of the body , by the side of the spine , nearly the whole len6th of it , together with the nerves proceeding from them . Th so nerves are ultimately distributed to the circulating system , and especially to the capillary arteries and veins , and probably to the lymphatic vessels , the agents by which the important organic functions above alluded to are performed . This system is so slightly , if at all , connected with the brain , as to be scarcely influenced by it in its ordinary operations . This division of the nervous system into separate parts , each acting independently of the others in the performance of its appropriate functions , yet all so associated as to act harmoniously , should be always regarded in examining the operations of the system , *vhethcr in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibril , consisting of the fibre itself , of its origin in a portion of the grey nervous substance , and of its pulpy termination intimately blended with the tissue of the organ to which it is distributed , constitutes aa independent portion o* the general system , performing a single office , and liable to its own diseases . By what agency the operations of the nervous system are carried on , how impressions are received and conveyed by it , in what manner the various parts communicate with each other , and what is its connection with the feeling , thinking man , though objects of high interest , will form no part of the present inquiry . The object has been , by the briefest possible statement of what the system is , to prepare the way for some remarks upon its diseases . The subject is obviously too extensive to admit of full consideration in all its parts ; the diseases therefore , which primarily and principally affect the nerves of sensation , will be selected for consideration . The diseases of the nerves may properly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of power in the performance of their ordinary functions ; those in which they act regularly but with increased energy ; and those which are characterized by some other irregularity than mere increase or diminution of their force of action . These several states will receive a separate consideration . // The first mentioned of these diseased states , that in which there is simply a diminution or loss of the power of action , paralysis , palsy , is too common and well known to require particular description . Two or three remarks , however , seem necessary to a full understanding of it . In the first place , any one nerve , or any one of the above mentioned systems of nerves , may lose its power of action , while all the others remain entire . Thus , the eye may lose its power of seeing , from palsy of the optic nerve , while its motions , its secretions and all its other functions remain ; or in the hand or foot , the sense of touch and of feeling may be lost , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , palsy of the nerves of motion may destroy all voluntary control over the muscles of the part , while common sensation is entire ; or , perhaps more striking still , the tongue , a complicated organ , which because it receives nerves from several ( listiect l ) ortions of the nervous system , is endowed with various powers , such as common sensation , the sense of tasting , voluntary motion , and involuntary motion in which it is associated with the organs of respiration , may lose any one of these functions by palsy of the nerves on which it depends , while all its other powers are unaffected . Again , the cause of paralysis , or the peculiar diseased state producing it , may be seated in that extremity only of the nerve which is in contact with the organ to which it belongs , or in the trunk of the nerve , or in the portion of grey substance from which it originates . A familiar cxample of each of these states will be given by way of illustration . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the face to a draught of cold air , the extremities of the nerves of the part become paralyzed , and the power of motion or of common sen sation or both are lost , to the great terror of the patient . Here , however , as the trunk of the nerve , and especially its origin are unafThcted , the disease subsides , and in a few days or perhaps weeks , the parts resume their natural condition . Pressure or various other abnormal conditions of the trunk of a nerve will also produce palsy of its extremities , and consequent loss of that function of the part dependent upon the injured nerve .. A familiar instance of this state , which every one has experienced , is that temporary loss of sensation and power of motion of the leg and foot which is produced , when the leg is thrown over the opposite knee , by pressure upon the trunk of the nerves in the ham passing to these parts . Here the loss of power is transient , but if the pressure , as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumor in contact with the part , or the trunk of the nerve disorganized by disease , the palsy would be complete and permanent , without any diseased state of that central portion of the nervous system from which it has its origin . Again , injury or disease of the brain or other central organ from which nerves originate , will paralyze them . Thus a blow upon the head will destroy , temporarily or permanently a&amp;*ording to its severity , the power . of the nerves immediately connected with the brain . There will be the loss of common and special sensation , and of all voluntary motion , while respiration , circulation and the functions immediately conuected with them will go o n , because the nerves controlling them are not dependent on the brain . It will be at once inferred , even by the casual observer , that palsy of a nerve does not necessarily imply any alteration in its structure , but is , in very many cases , a simple loss of its functional energy . It is not from any intrinsic interest or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little of either , that they have been stated . But it is because they illustrate , in an easy and intelligible way , impoi*tant principles which are alike applicable to all the diseases of the nervous system . For it is as true of them all , of every kind , as it is of palsy , that they may affect any one nerve , or system of nerves , every other part retaining its integrity ; thai such diseases , of whatever nature , may commence in and be confined to the remote extremity of the nerve-may extend along its trunk , may involve , either primarily or ultimately , its origin and that central portion connected with it ; that they may be functional and transient , or organic and permanent -- and that many of them , will be , more obviously than this , either under the influence or beyond the control of the passions or the intellect , according to the connection of the affected nerves with that portion of the brain which is the special organ of the mind , and according to the condition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseased condition of the nerves , especially those of sensation , which frequently occurs , is that in which they act with increased energy . That there is an original difference in the acuteness of perception in different individuals , according to what is appropriate* enough called difference of temperament , is undoubtedly true . Impressions , whether pleasant or unpleasant , which are scarcely perceptible by one person , will be distinctly felt by another , and be painful , from their intensity , to a third . In one , the nerves under all common influences , move harmoniously , s the strings of a musical instrument under the skilful fingers of an artist , while in another , like the *olian harp , they are tossed about melodiously it may he , yet with wild and irregular impulses . How much of this difference is original , and how much is the effect of early training and educa tion , can not always be determined . Cultivation of the nerves of sensation renders them acute and exact in their operation , as is seen in persons who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which remain for their knowledge of external objects . It is however in disease , that this exquisite sensitiveness of the nerves of sensation is most fully developed . Every one has experienced this in inflammation ; when of the surface of the body , the slightest touch is painful , or of the eye , the feeblest ray of light occasions agony . This is still more obvious in neuralgia of the skin , in which the touch of a feather , or the slightest motion of the air , is like a red hot iron , or a burning flame to the part . In some cases this exquisite sensitiveness manifests itself without pain , and without obvious disease of the organ affected . Perhaps the eye is more frequently thus affected than any other organ , and when severely , especially if aided by trickery , lends some appearance of truth to the notion , that vision may be enjoyed by other parts of the body than the eye . The most extraordinary and interesting case of this kind on record , is that of Jane C. Rider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her physician , S. W. Belden , M. D. , aided by S. B. Wood ward , M. D. , the distinguished superin*endant of the hospital for the insane at Worcester . It may be found at large in the 11th vol. of the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal . In this case , the character of the patient and of . those who state it , together with all the attending circumstances , utterly forbid the idea of any intentional deception , either wilful on her part , or through ignorance , inattention or credulity of the medical gentlemen . Without adverting to other particulars of this case , which is too long to be inserted here , it may be stated , that unless there is about it some undetected fallacy , it affords full proof , by many trials carefully conducted , // at intervals during several months , and under a great variety of circumstances , that , in a darkened room , or at night , with her eyes closely handaged , she could distinguish by the eye all ordinary objects which were presented to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most striking , hut because it is short and distinct . " Her eyes were covered with a thick cotton handkerchief folded so as to make eight or tea thicknesses , and the spaces below the bandage filled with strips of black velvet . After the bandage was tied over the eyes , a person standing at the other end of the room preparing the velvet , took up a piece colored red . She immedidiately exclaimed , I wo n't have red , ' though her eyes were then secured so that no one else could have seen it at all . The spaces under the bandages having been carefully filled , a small volume , which she had seen only a short time in her previous paroxysm , was put in her hand . Jane began at the paragraph indicated and read distinctly , audibly and correctly , not however without a slight degree of hesitation at the most difficult words , nearly the whole page . No one present doubted that she saw through the bandage . She placed the book at the proper distance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in passing from the book to the eye must have penetrated the bandage . " The nerves of vision were not alone affected , but there was great excitement , and exquisite sensitiveness of all the nerves of sensation , and probably of every part of the brain . This state continued at intervals for several months ; and gradually subsided , upon the removal , by appropriate treatment , of functional disorder of important organs . Since then , more than twelve years have elapsed , with no return of the affection . This extraordinary power of vision , say the narrators with entire correctness , " was the result of the combined effect of two causes : first , increased sensibility of the retina , in consequence of which objects were rendered visible in comparative darkness ; and , second , a high degree of excitement in the brain itself , enabling the mind to perceive even a confused image of the object . " Another and equally interesting state of the nerves of the senses , is that in which sensation is experienced , without the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably , especially when awakened from sleep , or roused from revery , has seen sights and heard sounds , which had no existence . Here the nerve is affected , not at its sentient extremity , but at its origin in the brain ; and the sensation , to which by frequent repetition it has become familiar , is reproduced by an act which may be called involuntary recollection . rrhe most striking examples of this state of the nerves of sensation , are those furnished by the miserable subjects of delirium tremens , a disease of too frequent occurrence to have escaped the notice of any observer . In this state of derangement , the affection exists and is , for the most part , confined to the organs of the senses , and may with propriety be called insanity of the nerves of sensation . Its ravages are sometimes ljmited to one , but more frequently involve all of the nerves of this system . The sensations are for the most part loathsome , painful , and terrific , producing intolerable bodily distresti and mental agony . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests the horrible notion , that his food and drink are drugged with poison ; he feels the creeping of noisome reptiles or venomous serpents over his body ; his ears are assailed with the whispered slander of malicious detraction , or stunned with the clamor of murderous assailants , or with the tumult of battle in which he is a // suffering actor ; while he is aifrighted at the sight of the leveled pistol , or the gleaming dagger , or the blaze of his burning dwelling , or it may be the cord suspended from a gibbet over his head . Under the pressure of these horrible sensations , which are to him realities , the wretched sufferer lies trembling , panting , begging for relief ; or , seeking to escape from them , breaks over opposing obstacles , leaps through windows at whatever height , plunges into rivers or the ocean , fearing no danger but from the phantoms which haunt him . An instance of this disease will best illustrate its nature and effects . The patient was a man whose body had been strengthened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued and abounding iniquity . It was his boast that he had lived be . lieving nothing , hoping nothing , and fearing nothing . And there this strong , fearless man stood cowering , trembling , shrieking in agony ; for to his senses the pit of despair was open before him , and his feet were upon its crumbling brink . His ho . dy was scorched with the flame of the fire that is not quenched ; he was suffocated with sulphurous vapors ; he saw , with starting , bloodshot eyes , the wretched inmates of the eternal prison house , writhing in intolerable anguish ; while his ears were stunned with their groans and horrid blasphemies . Under these sufferings , this strong man 's body was crushed as by a mountain falling upon it , and in a few hours was insensible and ready for the grave . But the man , the thinking , feeling , eternally enduring man-who of his fellow sinners dare inquire what is his state ? A similar state of disordered sensation is often witnessed as a symptom of acute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasurable and soothing kind . " Oh sir , " said a young man to his physician , who had left him the night before restless with fever and delirious , in answer to his inquiry as to the manner in which he had passed the night , " oh sir , most delightfully : soon after you left me , a kind and beautiful lady , ( there was one who , though absent , was dear to him , ) seated herself by my bed side , soothed my aching head with the hand of kindness , looked upon me with her calm blue eyes , sang to me the songs which I love to hear , and so I fell asleep and have been refreshed . " Thus true affection , honorahly indulged , stood him in stead in his hour of trial , and was the prohable cause of his convalescence . Occasionally , this state of the nerves of sensation appears to he a part of the natural temperament of individuals , whose conduct , from this cause , has been the occasion of much wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream dreams ; to whom revelations of hidden and mysterious things are made , and who converse with angels or with the spirits of the dead . Such were Jemima Wilkinson and Edward Irving in his days of darkness , and many others who manifest a strange mixture of delusion and imposture . A different affection of the nerves of sensation , is that which physicians call catalepsy . In the cataleptic state there is an entire suspension of action , a temporary death of the organs of the senses , while all the other bodily functions are performed with their accustomed regularity . The strange phenomena of this affection will be more plainly shown by the statement of a case , than by any description . The subject of it was a young lady of 13 or 14 years of age . Without any considerable previous indisposition , she was found one afternoon by her companions , in a state of entire insensibility . The physician who visited her , found her lying quietly in bed , with a calm natural pulse , easy respiration , and in every respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which she could // not be roused . Intense light admit . ted directly to the eyes ; loud noises , odors and pungents to the nostrils , and strong irritants to the surface , produced no conscious impression . After continuing in this state for four or five hours , she recovered from it , like one awakening from natural sleep . Paroxysms of the same kind attacked her for several successive days , when , upon her removal from the school which she was attending to the residence of her parents , they at once ceased . At the end of several months , she returned again to the school . In less than twenty-four hours she was again attacked in the same way , and had a daily paroxysm , until she returned home . Since then , now several years , she has been free from this , and all other peculiar nervous diseases . No remarks are necessary to call attention to the singular phenomena of this disease , to their apparent causeless origin , and the inexplicable order of their succession . A more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one that of late has excited a large share of attention , is somnambulism . The most common forms of this , simple sleep-walking and sleep-talking , are too well known to need particular description . In the more complicated , and therefore more striking cases , the somnambulist , while apparently unconscious , will walk about , avoiding all obstructions , seek for any desired object , read or write , sing and play upon musical instruments , execute drawings or needle-work , hold conversafinns with absent persons as if they were present , and perform a thousand other common and often unaccustomed acts , often with unusual dexterity and skill , without any subsequent recollection of their performance . In one case , a young lady was employed during the day , in drawing a map , which she saw towards night was erroneously drawn . Her remark to her companions was , that she would throw it aside and make a better one . She retired to her room as usual , and in the morning there was upon her table a correctly drawn map , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any account . For years afterwards she was seen to perform many similar acts , while apparently asleep . The Springfield somnambulist learnt by a few trials and at one sitting , and while her eyes were bandaged , to play the game of backgammon with great accuracy . On recovering from this state the game was proposed to her , when she remarked that she knew nothing about it , and had never seen it played . On trial , it was found that she could not even set the men . An abundance of similar facts , fully authenticated , might , if necessary , be stated . In whatever form it appears , there is not , as has been erroneously said , merely a torpid state of some of the senses , while others retain their activity ; but there seems to be besides , a disseverance for the time of the nerves of sensation from that portion of the brain which takes cognizance of the impressions made upon them ; so that , although some or all of the senses are awake , and often exquisitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obey the sensations , still there is neither consciousness at the time , nor subsequent recollection of the sensation or of the resulting actions . The nerves of the senses seem to be also under the control of the mind , so as to take cognizance of those objects only , which are connected with the present mental operations . Hence the somnambulist , while playing upon a musical instrument with skill and taste , and of course seeing and feeling the instru - ment , and hearing the musical tones , will take no notice of other objects presented to the eye , or of other sounds howevef loud or dissonant . This unimpressibility of the nerves of the senses by common objects , and // their exquisite sensitiveness in regard to all such as are concerned with the present mental operations , have given to this state much of its marvelousness and inexplicability . At the same time , there is present , in many of the cases , an universal excitement of the nervous system , producing quickness and accuracy of apprehension , a ready memory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great acuteness and vigor of every mental operation . It is stated of Jane Rider , that her perceptions were so acute and accurate , that a glance at an object was sufficient to give her all that knowledge of it which others acquire only by long observation . The sight of the back of a visiting card which she had before seen , recalled to her mind the name upon the reverse , giving some plausibility to the notion , that she saw through the card . This illusion was dispelled by the fact , that if a card which she had not seen before was employed , she knew nothing of the name . The gambler and the blackleg acquire much of the same discriminating perception , in the practice of their swindling business . So also events and facts , matters of science and literature , information and knowledge of every kind which had made no impression upon the mind or had been long forgotten , are recollected by the somnambulist , and are often stated with such distinctness and accuracy as to appear like inspiration . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A stupid and ignorant servant girl , had been accustomed to hear a variety of tunes skilfully played upon the violin and piano , without apparently at the time regarding or acquiring any knowledge of them . Afterwards , when in a state of somnambulism , she would repeat them with great accuracy , imitating not only the tunes , but the particular tones of the instrument which she had heard , and at times the voices of several ladies of the family with whom she lived . " She had been known to conjugate correctly Latin words , which she had probably heard in the schoolroom of the family ; and she was once heard to speak several sentences very correctly in French , at the same time stating that she had heard them from a foreign gentleman , whom she had accidentally met in a shop . Being questioned on this subject when awake , she remembered having see the gentleman , but could not repeat a word of what he said . " She often descanted with the utmost fluency and correctness on a variety of topics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , the historical parts of Scripture , public characters , and particularly the characters of members of the family and their visitors . In these discussions , she showed the most wonderful discrimination , often combined with sarcasm , and astonishing powers of mimicry . " Of all these matters , as is usual with somnambulists , she was entirely ignorant when in her natural state . The same reminiscence of things unheeded or long forgotten , is not unfrequently witnessed in other states than somnambulism , as in ordinary dreaming , in the delirium of fevers , and after mechanical injuries of the brain . An instance of this kind of dreaming is stated by Sir W. Scott . A gentleman was threatened with the loss of his estate , through the want of a written document , which was believed to be in existence , but could not be found . Shortly before the trial which was todecidethe case , he dreamed that one of his ancestors appeared to him , and described the place of deposit of the missing paper . On searching there it was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life he knew the place of concealment , but had forgotten it , until , in the rapid and undisturbed action of the brain // during sleep , it was recalled to his mind . Sir A. Cooper relates , that in consequence of an injury of the head , a man in St. Thomas ' hospital , who ordinarily conversed in English , was found talking in a language that was not understood , until a Welsh woman heard this man talking Welsh . Another patient , with disease of the brain , a German sugar baker , spoke at first in English ; but as the disease advanced lost his English , and could answer only in his native tongue . In these cases , the injury to the brain had thrown it back in its operations to the period of childhood . The instances which have been stated are sufficient to show , that disordered conditions of the nervous system are produced by very different causes ; at one time operating upon it through the mind ; at another , by bodily disease , and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that many of these diseases , after having frequently recurred , may be reproduced by the will of the patient , or by the indulgence in any strong mental emotion . The strange phenomena which attend many of these diseases , are still farther complicated , and rendered more astonishing , by an element belonging to them , which is always overlooked by the wonder-loving multitude , and often by those who should be able to form a proper estimate of its influence . It is well known to medical men , that those who are affected with the more singular forms of nervous disease , take a strange delight in their manifestations . Their love of notoriety is gratified , by the attention which they receive ; and , strange as it may seem , by the emotions , whether of pity , surprise or terror , which they excite . This passion of itself , will increase the symptoms of the disease , and often leads to their exaggeration by direct deception-  --  a species of decep tion of which the patients themselves are scarcely conscious . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at times devised and employed with a wonderful degree of cunning intelligence ; and after frequent use , become so much a part of the disease , that the patients are unconscious of the deception , or are so far self-deluded as to believe in the existence of the supernatural powers which are attributed to them . It is not incredible , that some of the cunning men and women , who " palter in a double sense " with those who credulously consult them , have some faith in their vaticinations ; and it is by no means improbable , that a portion of those , who a century and a half ago suffered the penalty of the laws against witchcraft , believed , not without a degree of exultation in their supernatural powers , that they were guilty of the acts which were charged upon them , and that they were martyrs in the cause of demoniacal possession . If the facts and principles concerning the state , functions and diseases of the nervous system have been so stated as to be intelligible , their bearing upon what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood . It is useless , at the present day , to meet , with a mere denial of their truth , all the phenomena which it is alledged are produced by mesmeric influence , or to attribute them all to intentional deception . Some of these phenomena have been too often witnessed , under too great a variety of circumstances , and by too many persons , of whom there can be no suspicion of collusion or blind credulity , and they are at the same time too consonant with well known laws which regulate the nervous system , to leave any reasonable doubt of their reality . Along with the truth there has been mingled so much of extravagant pretense , of obvious impossibility , unless all the recognized laws of living bodies are a fallacy , // and so much of downright imposture , that many have turned away from the subject in disgust and without investigation . It should be remembered however , that there can hardly be a subject , however fanciful or absurd it may be , which takes hold largely of the public mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that other truths will probably be elicited during its investigation . In such a harvest field there may be a large proportion of tares , yet the few grains of wheat be well worth the gathering . No attempt will be made to discuss , much less to *disprove , the foundation doctrine of mesmerism ; that its phenomena are produced by an impalpable fluid or aura , whether electrical , galvanic , or nervous , transmitted by the strong will of the operator to the person operated upon , thus controlling the workings of his nervous system . All that is deemed necessary is to express a strong and unqualified disbelief in any such agent . The same strong dissent is extended also to the notion , much insisted on by the believers in mesmerism , that the feelings , sensations , and opinions can be conveyed from one person to another by mere volition , without any outward expres*ion of them . Such influence may doubtless be exerted , without the use of language . In whatever way passion is expressed , whether by anguage , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be felt . This influence is of the same kind as that by which the tiger in his fury , or the raving maniac is quelled , under the steady gaze of a resolute man . It is to be rernembered also , that those persons by whom this influence is especially felt , are of a susceptible nervous temperament , and are predisposed to some of the strange nervous affections heretofore enumerated . For the strongest supporters of mesmerism claim no more , than that here and there an individual can be brought under its influence . It is also to be borne in mind , that in all diseases of the nervous system , the severity of the disease is usually altogether out of proportion to the exciting cause ; those of the gravest character being often produced by causes so slight , as to be scarcely appreciated . In the epileptic or hysterical female , a paroxysm will be produced by indigestible food in the stomach , by the slightest mechanical injury , by any disturbing mental emotion , and not unfrequently by the mere will of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a disease of the nerves of voluntary motion , have been caused by injuries so slight as to have excited no notice , until attention was called to them by the invasion of disease . This statement seems necessary to account for the fact , that the phenomena which are attributed to mesmerism , are often , indeed usually , brought on by slight manipulations , by fixing the attention of the senses upon some one definite object , and especially by directing the mind of the person operated on to the effects which are expected . Those who believe strongly in their own susceptibility to such influences , are the most prone to experience them . The facts and principles which have been stated , although the statements have been brief , and accompanied with very few of the illustrations which might be brought to bear upon them , are perhaps sufficient to lead to a correct estimate of the truth of many of the alledged phenomena of mesmerism . Some of these phenomena are so entirely in accordance with the known laws of the nervous system , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the rarity of their occurrence , and on account of their wide departure from the ordinary operations of the nerves , are received with much hesitation ; while others still , standing out as they do // in direct opposition to every known law , and to all the modes of action , both in health and disease , of the organs concerned , are entirely beyond the reach of ordinary credulity . In the last class , are comprehended clairvoyance , the vision of objects inclosed in substances absolutely opaque , or however distant ; the looking into the human body and discovering the condition of its internal organs , whether sound or diseased ; community of thought and feeling , so that sensation , feelings and information of all kinds experienced by one person , will be equally apprehended by another who is in communication with him ; intuition , or the knowledge of the properties , situation and relations of bodies , of which the senses can have had no cognizance ; and the complete subjection of all the faculties of the body and mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the phenomena which have been adduced to prove the existence of these states , by those who believe in their existence , though it is believed that a satisfactory explanation of them all can be given in accordance with well known physiological laws , so far as they are not the result of wilful deception and collusion between interested parties , would extend this article beyond its intended limits . A few remarks will be made upon several states of the nervous system , whose existence is proved and which are claimed to be produced by mesmeric influence , with the intention of showing that although some of them are of an unusual character , yet they are a part of some one of the pathological conditions heretofore described , and that no new or mysterious agency need be invoked to account for their appearance . The first , most simple and most frequent of the alledged results of mesmeric influence , is quietude , somnolescency , or actual sleep , more or less profound . Now if this state , produced by the means which are commonly employed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no reflecting mind would have considered it as any thing more than one of those common occurrences which need no explanation . Every one knows , that quietude of the nerves , when irritated or in pain , and that sleep will be commonly produced , by any means , however slight , by which the mind is withdrawn from external influences , or by the steady , continued and gentle occupation of either of the senses . The judicious physician is in the habit of employing means , the same in kind as those of the mesmerizer , though with less of parade and pretense , to relieve pain , allay nervous irritability , arid to induce sleep , without any suspicion that he is employing an unknown agent . Some of those who are thus put to sleep , exhibit also the common phenomena of sleep walking and sleep talking ; and of those who talk in their sleep , a few receive impressions from without through their senses : hence they will answer questions , hold conversations with those about them , and , while apparently unconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent torpor had not fallen upon them . All these circumstances , it will be remembered , are a part of a well known pathological condition of the nerves of sensation formerly alluded to ; and it is 1 ) 0 cause of surprise , either that such a condition should exist , or that its ordinary phenomena should be developed by the means which are employed . For in those who are the subjects of this condition , all the attending phenomena appear at times without any obvious exciting cause , or are produced by any impressions either bodily or mental , which interfere with the common course of nervous actions . In all these symptoms of irregular nervous action , there is nothing out of the ordinary course of things , as // they appear in those who are the subjects of this pathological predisposition . Another state , the alledged result of mesmeric influence , which has excited more surprise , and has been met with more incredulity , is that in which there is a degree of unconscious insensibility that resists all impressions whether pleasurable or painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extracted , tuinors excised , and have undergone other serious surgical operations , without any manifestations , and probably without any consciousness , of pain . The proof that instances of this kind have actually occurred in France , in England , and in this country , is of such a nature , as to demand belief , unless all faith in human testimony is abandoned . The state in which these things will be tolerated , is the cataleptic , formerly described ; and is one of those pathological conditions of the nerves of sensation , to which a few persons are constitutionally predisposed . No one who has examined a cataleptic patient during a paroxysm , will doubt that any bodily infliction will be borne without apparent consciousness , and of course without the expression of pain . The proportion of those in whom this state can be induced , is confessedly small , and consists , for the most part , and perhaps entirely , of females at an early age-of those who are the common subjects of strange and irregular nervous diseases . That a paroxysm should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are constitutionally predisposed to catalepsy , is in entire accordance with the general law formerly stated , viz , that all the forms of irregular nervous action are usually excited by causes so slight as to be scarcely noticed . It is certainly no more strange that a paroxysm of catalepsy should be excited by mesmeric passes , as they are called , or by slight long continued irritation of the nerves of common sensation upon the surface of the body , or by fixing the attention of the eye or the ear upon some one object until the fatigue which demands repose is produced , than that hysterical convulsions should follow a fit of passion , or that a fatal tetanus , or locked-jaw , as it is often called , should be occasioned by the prick of a pin or the scratch of a nail . The same train of remark might be followed out , concerning that still more striking and half-way mysterious state , in which all the phenomena of somnambulism , in its most acute and exquisite form , are manifested . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spontaneously , or is produced by the manipulations of the mesmerizer , or by any other exciting cause , the manifestations are the same ; varying in degree in different persons , but of the same kind in all ' . In all there is apparent unconsciousness , with exquisite sensitiveness of all the organs of sensation ; in all , there is the immediate connexion between the organs of sensation and those of motion , so that appropriate actions follow sensation without fhe intervention of conscious volition ; in all , there is acute mental apprehension , with unusual readiness and accuracy of all the intellectual operations : in short , there is an unnatural excitement of the whole sensitive and active nervous system , while that part of it whose business it is to take cognizance of , and to regulate their operations , is asleep . When to this strange state is added that strong tendency to exaggerate all its manifestations , which is so common in those who are its subjects as to appear like a part of the ' disease , together with the intentional deception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these matters , and the abounding credulity which is always ready to believe and to magnify whatever appears to // be incredible , an easy explanation is at hand of every thing connected with it that has been regarded as marvelous . After all it must be acknowledged , and those who are most familiar with the subject will most readily make the confession , that nervous diseases , and especially those of an unusual character , are still involved in much obscurity . Enough however , it is believed , is known , to convmce the intelligent and not too credulous inquirer , that the investigations which have been recently made , whether by those who honestly seek the truth , or by the charlatan for the purposes of gain or notoriety , have all utterly failed to bring forward any " evidence in support of the existence of any new agency , whether designated mesmeric , magnetic , occult , or by any other name .
