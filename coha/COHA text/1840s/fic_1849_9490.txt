End note : 1Kb Thanks ! There is no illusion here : Wit , Wisdom , Beauty , all appear , And grace our house to-night ;  --  Still striving , as we do , to please , A rich requital , smiles like these  --  This fair inspiring sight ! Ah ! as in boxes and in pit , A goodly company , ye sit , Are there no conjured shapes that flit Your fancy 's gaze before ? Shapes which this storied dome recalls , Which start from these half-conscious walls , Past pleasures to restore ? In worthiest state , I see them rise  --  The brave , the beautiful , the wise , The guilty , and the good  --  The Drama 's race ! They come , they pass , In crowds , o'er Memory 's magic glass ,  --  A mingled multitude ! " Angels and ministers of grace Defend us ! " Is it Hamlet 's face , Hamlet the Dane , I see ? He bends his melancholy eyes On vacancy , and , hark ! he sighs , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotspur rushes by , And " Mortimer ! " is still his cry  --  Nought can his rage restrain . Shylock gasps forth , " Is that the law ? " Old Lear puts on his crown of straw ; " Richard 's himself again ! " Ah , Romeo ! Romeo ! is it thou ? Fair Juliet hears thy honeyed vow Beneath the moon 's pale beam ; And lo ! Macbeth , with blood-stained hands ! And see where black Othello stands , " Perplexed in the extreme ! " " Run , run , Orlando ! " Rosalind Thy tributary verse shall find  --  " The inexpressive she ! " Fear not to tell her of thy flame ; And do not fail to carve her name Upon the nearest tree . " Farewell ! farewell ! " ' T is Jaffier speaks ; And wretched Belvidera shrieks As only wretches can . Ha , Benedick ! thou'rt caught at last ! Fair Beatrice the net hath cast  --  Thou'lt be " the married man . " Lo , Brutus , with a fierce appeal , O'er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No more be slaves ! " And stern Virginius , pale and wild , Folds to his breast his darling child ;  --  Then , thus !  --  her honor saves ! " Ho , Ion ! ' T is thy father 's life ! " He grasps the sacrificial knife , And seems transfixed with wonder ; And , as the fates of Argos roll Their lurid terrors o'er his soul , Exclaims , " Was not that thunder ? " What an astounded group is seen , Where falls my Lady Teazle 's screen  --  To none but Charles a joke ! There Julia mourns her fatal choice ; And , list ! " That voice ! ' T is Clifford 's voice , If ever Clifford spoke ! " Hoping he do n't " intrude , " Paul Pry , With his umbrella , comes to spy What mischief may be done . Ha , Ollapod ! for human ills , Your jokes are better than your pills  --  " Good sir , I owe you one ! " Pizarro , Douglas , William Tell , Pauline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene ye flock ; And Bardolph , with a cup of sack ; And there  --  " Well , go thy ways , old Jack , " And fight " by Shrewsbury clock . " But , hark ! the impatient prompter stamps ;  --  A hint I 've been before the lamps A reasonable space ; And , at that sound , the airy throng , Like guilty creatures , crowd along , And , fading , leave no trace . The spell is broken :  --  but , before I heed the summons , one word more , If patience yet endures : Till all its stars have disappeared , May still the Drama 's cause be cheered By hands and lips like yours !
