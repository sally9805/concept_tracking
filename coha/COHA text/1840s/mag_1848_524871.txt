txt IF it were necessary to choose between a party well led but without principles , and a party well principled but without leaders , we should not be slow in the decision ; for it is not the men , however admirable , but the principles they represent , that give dignity and interest to a war of opinion . A party without principles is no party , but a combination of interested office-seekers , enticing the weak and ignorant to vote for them . It is a body without a soul , an organization without laws , and must always vacillate in a contemptible medium . It can not change its policy with a just regard to circumstances , without suffering by the charge of inconsistency ; all its measures are selfish , and all its admissions are compromises ; it is disreputable and without force . It becomes then a part of self-respect as well as of prudence in the Whig party , to let it always be distinctly known , why , and on what suggestion , they advocate particular men , and particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax , suited to the year or to the age ; but if , with the change of circumstance , they think it best to dispense with these , they have not therefore ceased to be Whigs . The difference between the parties lies VOL . I. No. iv . NIW SERIES . 22 deeper than the reasons of a temporary policy . At different times parties will change their ground , and even alternate opinion* , because the necessity of the times demands it . It would not be any subject of wonder , if , at some future day , hypothetical pedants should be heard crying up free trade principles , on the side of the present opposition , and the good sense ad prudence of the party permit thei to do so . A regular army may allow ancient Pistol and the blackguards to follow the camp . Ancient Pistol , that battered hypothesis of valor , may help to terrify the weak among the enemy . But , as we now stand , and for this century at least , free trade is not a Whig measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shop , the mine , or the field , con-. tinues to require protection . We repeat it , the differences of party are not merc temporary differences of policy ; they arise rather from general views of human nature ; and its necessities . The better to explain our meaning , let us endeavor to characterize the opposite parties , as they are actuated by adverse motives , and mark the contrast . This contrast is in nothing more marked than in the doctrine concerning liberty VOL . I. NO . IV . // For , your Whig refers all rights and liberties back to their original source in the individual , and holds that society is established for the protection of those rights and liberties . Whereas , your ultra Democrat believes , or affects to believe , that each person gives up or resigns his free mind , on entering into the social compact , to the decision of caucusses and majorities . The one side holds , that this very decision by majorities is not established by any merely natural law , but by a constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority , assembling when and where they please , can assume power over individuals  --  to govern the few by the many  --  to keep each one in fear of a multitude , and to make right and wrong by acclamation . That way tends ultra Democracy . Hence , too , arises the extreme doctrine of instructions : for , while your Whig distinguishes in his national legislator a twofold relation , one to the people he represents , and one to the nation as a whole ; holding also , that he is a lawful legislator , not only for those who voted for him , but for those , also , who voted against him , and in brief , for every man , woman , and child in his district ; and that , notwithstanding this , he is also a law-maker for the nation at large , and bound to protect and foster it ; - your ultra Demociat , deriving all the power of the legislator from the voices that chose him , and not from the Constitution , requires that he shall not dare expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation , but shape every opinion by the narrow interest of his Constituents . They make no distinction between the honor of the man who has tacitly pledged himself , by his election , to certain principles , and the duty of the national legislator who is bound by the superior law of conscience and the Constitution , to promote the honor and prosperity of his nation . From the beginning , the one party has been characterized by a constant , endeavor to identify the interests of the people with those of the government ; while the other has as clearly opposed every national measure , which should call the creative and protective functions of the government into action . More remarkable still does this difference between the two parties appear , in popular judgments on the conduct of the Executive ; for , while your ultra Democrat approves of every step of his Executive , no matter how unconstitutional , while he is supported and encouraged by the opinion of his party , your Whig looks to the Constitution , and expects the Executive to keep within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference , it is evident , proceeds directly from the different ideas of liberty entertained by the two parties ; one regarding the government as unchangeable except by a solemn decision of the nation in convention , the other treating it as inferior in authority to the public opinion of a day . From these last , therefore , it meets with little favor and less respect ; and they are rather gratified than otherwise , by the encroachments of a popular President . They do not make that distinction between the private honor of the President , which binds him , by the pledge of election , to the opinions and measures of his party , and that superior relation which he holds to the nation , without distinction of party , as its executive head , under the laws . The doctrine of the one party , that the whole people , as sole and sovereign source of power , established the Constitution for a guarantee of individual freedom , and a source of all authority , is the doctrine of liberty it places each citizen in a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opinion to judge by , in weighing men and measures . Ultra Democratic doctrine , on the contrary , indulges men in a perpetual revolution , cutting off the past from the present , and the present from the future ; making its own decrees utterly forceless and contemptible , by deriving their authority from acclamation , instead of placing it where it belongs , under the Constitution of the whole people . It is the desire of the Whig party to establish an accurate though not an illiberal Construction of the laws ; and that every public act shall be done under the spirit of the Constitution . Their maxim is , that the laws can not be too much improved , and can not be too well observed : they would have no man or body of men , majorities or minorities , exert a shadow of real power over their neighbors ; and they refer all power and authority 330 April , // whatsoever back to its original source , the will of the nation as a whole , expressed in the Cnstitution .

It seems unnecessary to urge , that such opinions and policy would flow from noiie but the most elevated views of humanity , such as reject all sectional and private arb uments . Are there any weak enough to think , that a party to which the Union owes its existence and safety , and from which have constantly flowed all measures for the benefit of the whole , can cease , or lose its unity for an instant ? No ! a consciousness of a common purpose , and a steady adherence to the form and spirit of a government which took its birth from the bosom of the nation , renders their dissolution impossible . They began with the Union ; they go along with it , and gather strength with it , contending successfully , though not without reverses , against the most formidable enemy that can threaten a State , namely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true sources and purposes of government , and confounding the sovereign will of a great nation , expressed in its laws and forms of power , with a sudden decision of a jealous crowd , whose ears tingle with the lies and flatteries of wily politicians . Since the adoption of the Constitution , no crisis has occurred so important , or which has developed so clearly the real principles of the opposition , as the war with Mexico . Begun with deliberation and carried on with ardor by the leaders of the party in power , it was checked and denounced by their opposers , because it seemed to be a departure from that just and equitable line in which we had been moving . The collected arguments against the war establish the surprising fact , that we enjoy a form of government whose fundamental maxims differ in no particular from those of the law of nations , or , as it has been styled , the law of conscienceand that to sin against our law is to sin against humanity ; that it is impossible to step beyond its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men or hations ; and that we shall seek in vain for better principles than those imbodied in our fundamental laws . It is not now to be settled by a controversy between Pacificus and Helvedius , . whether " the powers of declaring war and making treaties are , in their nature , executive powers . " Those powers are well understood and established in their proper place : had the deliberative reason of the nation been in a badly ascertained opinion of a majority , or in an Executive able to construct at pleasure the opinion of such a false majority , this government could not boast itself a popular government , nor claim to be settled upon any undisputable maxims . The Executive stands , in a true theory of the Republic , as the agent of the naked will , and Congress as the instigating heart and guiding reason , of the nation ; a division invented to escape from despotism , and of a nature so profound and real , the disposition to neglect , or disregard it , betrays at once an ignorance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government . A tainted school of Federalism formerly wished to confound these powers : time and circumstance have established the absolute necessity of making the separation as distinct and clear in practice as in theory . If the naked will of 1848. 331 / // the Executive moves one step of itself , in national enterprises , either with or without the aid of public opinion , it violates the right of Congress , to whom the people have committed the consulting and predetermining power . Should the Executive employ the army in making harbors or canals , without consent of Congress , the cry of usurpation would have come from those very men , who now contend that the President did right when he sent an army into Mexico , in time of peace : had he sent the same troops to Lake Ontario , to build a harbor there for the aid of commerce , would any have been found so bold as to excuse him ? And is the will of the Executive freer 4n the perilous enterprises of war , than in the harmless works of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to commit such questions to a few learned lawyers , to try if they can find a precedent for this or that usurpation in the books : Whig principles , party principles , familiar to the people , . must determine them ; we must resolve that our State shall not split upon that rock ; we will have no usurpers , at least ; we will have a President who knows how to keep within bounds . To decide and to act , are things different in nature ; and usurpation is merely assuming to decide and act together , where it is only given to us to act . Our Executive must not plan enterprises for the nation ; the people have conferred that power upon Qongress -- -upon their deliberative assemblies ; the Executive can not , without usurpation , do more than execute , or refuse to execute , what is proposed by the council of the whole . Are we wrong , therefore , in saying of the FUTURE POLICY OF THE Winos , that this point , of Executive usurpation , is one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equal importance , have they to keep in view ? Next to suppression of present evils , is the adoption of plans for future good . The party in opposition have raised up every obstacle before the mad ambition of the war party , to compel them , if possible , to bring hostilities to a close . So far , only , they were successful , as to rouse the better spirit of the nation against the spirit of aggression and conquest . The mere drain and exhaustion of life and treasure , have done as much to end the war as all other causes . The evil of a public debt , was one which might be cast upon posterity , or which , at worst , was not difficult to bear ; the loss of valuable lives in battle , was not an argument of much weight with apeoplc notoriously careless of their lives ; the supply of the treasury by foreign funds , prevents any serious drain upon the moveable capital of the cities ; the gains of . the great harvest and the famine are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the people that disasters lie in wait for them ; their ears are occupied with philanthropical discourses and all the pathos of successful war ; they dare not believe that their rulers are doing wrong : it is a thought too painful and troublesome to be entertained by a prosperous people . We must be made miserable before we can begin to be wise . The policy of the party in power appears first in the getting up and management of the war ; second , but not less marked , in the management and collection of the revenue . To defend the first , they advance certain doctrines of " right of conquest , " " progress of the species , " " Anglo-Saxon destinies , " and the like , veiling their designs with these philanthropical pretences . A philanthropical hypothesis seems to be the ace card in the modern game of politics , and the player* has one ready in his sleeve , to whip out upon occasion . If you argue with a becoming spirit against killing and robbing , your ears are deafened with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any comfort to be derived from that . Destiny ! my friend-do you say it is my destiny to be a thief ? Perhaps it may be with you to lead ; but the path is one in which it fits not my disp*-sition to follow you . If you contend , with a becoming directness and warmth , for the protection of free labor , and of the interests of the country , you are interrupted , and talked down , by a genius with long hair , who politely assures you that you mean well , but err through simplicity : the philanthropists to whom all human affairs have been intrusted by a special dec#ee of Providence , have resolved that all nations ought to be treated as one nation , and no regard be had to petty differences of race , climate , manners , morals , industry , or liberty . The occupations of life are to be divided up amongst them ; England is to make all the wearing apparel , machinery , and movea 332 April , // ble conveniences , while America attends oniy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , italy our religion and our summer hats , Germany supply our thoughts , and Africa furnish out our sympathies . Thus will this jolly round ball of earth be no longer several ant-hills , but rather one vast formicary . This is all the purpose we have been able to discover in a free trade argument , that occupations should be restricted to particular nations . What benefit is to come from the arrangement it requires the mind of a mystic to perceive . But if the fancied advantages of free trade are hypothetical and hard to be appreciated , the arguments against its contrary are no less so : While England is raising a hundred , and this nation twentyfive millions of dollars through tariffs laid on by free trade theorists , we are entertained by our long-haired philosopher with the following thesis : " That a tariff is unjust , because it taxes one class to enrich another . " These two hypotheses , first , that each nation should produce some one commodity , or set of commodities , proper to itself ; and the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one man to enrich another , " include the whole free trade argument ; - they are at once , theory , arguments and premises . If it were true , that a tariff affording protection , enriches one man to the loss of another , then would those free trade legislators who proceed to raise half the revenue of England , and the whole of that of America by tariffs , be proved guilty of inflicting a great wrong upon their respective countries ; but as mattera now stand with them , they are charged , not with the error of imposing tariffs , hut with having imposed them in such a manner and in such a form as to do with them the greatest possible amount of injury . Thus , while they cry **30;1321;TOOLONG , and argue for the ad valorem , they discriminate in favor of particular articles , such as *tea and coffee , and bread stuffs , in the very teeth of that favorite maxim of free trade , that " if a tariff is laid it must he for revenue . " In times of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yields a better revenue , the duty rising with the price , but no sooner was there a scarcity of food in England , the duty was lowered to a rate merely nominal . The policy was advocated as a just and necessary policy , and the ministry were praised for it , but it threw down and forever annihilated the doctrine , that " revenue alone is to be regarded , in the adjustment of duties ; " it proved that if tariffs are used at all , it is necessary to discriminate , lest in raising revenue , we depress and injure the people . The English ministry were bound by a maxim of free trade , as their economists teach it to our democracy , to have kept on the duties , and to have realized all the revenue possible from the rise of the prices of bread stuffs , and the consequent increase of ad valorem duties . Though this single instance is an effectual demolition of the maxim of which our free trade speculators make such an efficient use , it may not be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinching the nail . Revenue , then , is the sole thing to he thought of when we are laying duties : admit it , and your ad valorem-your duty measured by the price-becomes absurd . Suppose a certain class of imported articles  - -  coarse woollen cloths , for example-are in common use by all the people , and are counted among the necessaries of life , as they would be were there no manufactures of them in the country . Through excessive importation the price has fallen and the duty with it ; the market is supplied and all the people are using the goods . The state wants revenue : by doubling , or trebling , or quadrupling the duty on these cloths , it will raise additional revenue ; the people must have the cloths , and will pay double for them ; the additional duty musi , therefore , be laid , for " revenue alone is the thing to be considered in laying duties . Thus it appears from both instances , not only that your ad valorem principle is an absurdity , for to raise a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " largest revenue principle " is inhumane , and takes . advantage of the hunger and nakedness of the poor . So it appears that these two maxims stand in a ridiculous opposition to each other , and are eqi*nlly contemptible , the " ad valorem " for its having no meaning at all , and the " largest revenue " principle , for its being both weak and wicked . Once more , let us admit the maxim , that revenue alone is to be regarded in laying duties , why then are they not laid upon exports as well as upon imports ? Free 333 // trade economists tell us that the consumers of imported articles pay the duties , and not the producers , or the wholesale purchasers . If this be true , what more necessary or proper than duties upon exports also , and so double your revenue 9 If you laid export duties upon Ohio corn , not the farmer , nor the corn dealer , would pay them-say you  --  but the consumers in other parts of the world . Is it then your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that keeps you so silent on the policy of export duties ? " 0 no ! we know very well that it is not possible for us to regulate the price of corn in the European markets , and if the price were raised artificially by imposts here , the producers would suffer . " What of that ? what of that , my sage economist ? your duty is to raise the revenue by the most efficient and convenient means , and you are not to go about protecting-odious word ! - these Ohio farmers , by laying all your duties on imports , and allowing them to go scot free , paying not a dollar of revenue ! It is an outrage on humanity , when you know that Ohio farmers wear homespun and pay no revenue , to discriminate for them , and lay your duties upon other men . This is taking money out of his pocket who wears English broadcloth , to put it into the Ohio farmer 's , who is content with homespun  --  a discrimination quite intolerable and oppressive : the Democracy should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the picture in all lights yet , for now it grins a fool , and now stares a knave ; in a third view it will perhaps show a mixture of both . In laying duties , " say our economists , " we are to discriminate , not for protection , but for revenue . " Instance that an ad valorem duty is laid upon foreign manufactured cloths , and all articles of wear , be they light summer fabrics or heavy and costly broadeloths ; nothing of the kind shall escape , for now we are broaching a new war and must raise a great revenue . Discriminate , however , we must , for our object is revenue and nothing else . here , on our list , is the article of foreign silk fabrics : a vast quantity is yearly imported ; they are evidently a necessary of life , and will bear an enormous duty ; for the people are attached to their use , and will pay double rather than give them up ; and if we find them dis posed to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty is high , then up with duties on linen and cotton , and so force the people to buy . All goes on well for a year or so , and we are raising a large revenue , with duties carried to the top of endurance , when suddenly , to our amazement and sorrow , the goods cease to be bought , and the revenue falls off . Certain traitorous capitalists , conspiring against the revenue , and thus rendering aid and comfort to the enemy ; have erected mills , and manufactured articles of silk , cotton and linen to undersell the imported . The country is all at once supplied with silk manufactures of admirable quality-but the revenue ! the revenue ! what are we to do ? The process is easy : lower your duties suddenly , ruin all the manufactures , and when they are well out of the way , nd their mills converted to other uses , raise the duties again as soon as you please , and I will insure you as large a revenue as ever . You may repeat this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of revenue by it . The whole art is to find out the commodities which are most necessary to the people , and lay on heavy duties ; your principle is to discriminate for revenue , and not for protection . When you saw that high duties on certain articles , which your discrimination marked for revenue , operated to protect them , you were astonished to find that there was no discrimination for revenue which was not also one for protection . If you taxed one import heavily , you were obliged to tax all others which could be substituted for it , else it was of no avail . Your ad valorem principle made high prices advantageous , and , as the goods rose , your profits rose in proportion , notwithstanding the falling off of buyers ; till , on a sudden , the whole vanishes , and while you were thinking to discriminate for revenue only , you protected manufactures , and so far , were guilty of the sin of protecting the industry of your countrymen . You knew of no better way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had enriched , and then starting anew with your ad valorem and discriminating duties . Unfortunate economists ! compelled , as it were , by the very laws of nature , to violate your own maxims ! - for , if you taxed the farmer 's grain , then that wrathful and intelligent person would eject you // from office ; and , if you use high tariffs , so graduated as to raise a great and constant revenue , then you protect not only the pernicious manufacturer , but the farmer too , allowing his produce to go free ; when you were striving , with a laudable zeal , to avoid protection of all kinds , as a policy hateful to you , you are compelled to create a host of enemies by breaking down all the manufactories , and are thus again in danger of ejectment ! But the economist is not so easily balked . His forgetive brain teems with expedients . He invents a new phrase-Incidental Protection . The economist , laying down his maxim , that the revenue should be so raised that no one class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rest , advanced , in the same breath , this other , that duties should be collected with a view to revenue only , and not to protection . The first required him to regard , and the second not to regard , the effects of different modes of taxation . The first was universally a protective , the second a universally indifferent and selfish maxim . To reconcile these two incompatibles , he forges a new phrase , " incidental protection . " He told the people that he was for incidental protection . He was for protection , but it must be incidental . He would raise the revenue as he best could , and if any protection followed he had no objection-this was incidental protection . Some persons , not of the wisest , mistook this for a patriotical testimony ; others said , that there could be no such thingthat a tariff for revenue was directly opposite to a tariff for protection ; for , after the first treasury harvest from a high tariff on imports , manufactures would spring up , and the duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be necessary to lower the duties so as to break down the home manufactures again , and reap another harvest on imports . That a protective was therefore the opposite of a revenue policy ; that the protection which was incidental to high and profitable duties was the plague of the treasury , and continually lessened its receipts. ; and that , if revenue was the sole purpose of a tariff , and of its discriminations , it was the mortal enemy of protection . These arguments , however , had but little weight , so euphonious and pleasing were the words " incidental protection. ** When this became stale , our economist took a new start . It had not yet occurred to him , that every profitable duty on imports , however small , is protective to an extent proportioned to its weight ; because it causes in some degree the substitution of home-made articles if low , and of home manufactured , or of other articles , if high . The economist conceived in his imagination a certain happy medium of duties which should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet yield a good revenue ; which should not be so heavy as to stop importation , nor so light as to yield less than might be got from them . Now , having attained this point , ( for the experiment was tried , ) he observed that it coincided most unluckily with the point at which manufactures began to spring up . If the duties were raised to this point of greatest yield , then manufactures began ; for this point was found to be itself determined by the beginning og manufactures ; and it would soon become necessary to lower the duty . In short , the point itself was one at which in the nature of things you could not remain . It was found that it would be necessary to keep the duties just below the point where protection would begin , and so the tariff , with its ad valorem affix , could never be made to yield as much as it was desired and ought , without giving a protection which undermined it . A word now upon ad valorem , an ad. justment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is an application of a very necessary rule of taxation to the collection of tariffs : lands , houses , valuable furniture , slaves , cattle , in brief , all kinds of real estate and chattels , must in general be taxed according to their appraisement , or their market value at the time ; it would be gross injustice to tax a house just so much , because it was a house , or a clock because it was a clock . But in the case of duties this ad valorem principle ( admired by the ignorant for its Latin name ) often works great injustice . In times of scarcity , when there are large importations of food into a country , it is an inhumanity to suffer duties to rise with prices ; this is to aggravate the public distress , and voluntarily to assume the office 1848. 335 // of an avenging angel . In all such instances it should be a rule of political economy to keep the duties at a moderate rate , and lay them by the quantity , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when prices fall , as in the case of railroad iron at this moment : as the English economists were obliged to lower the duty on bread stuffs , to save the operatives from ruin , it is equally the duty of Congress to raise the duty on railroad iron to save the industrious Germans in the iron factories of Pennsylvania from ruin . By the operation of the ad valorem duty , the price of iron has been unnaturally lowered of late , * and our valuable factories of iron are failing under the influx of English iron , thrown into this market at unnaturally low prices , through the distresses of the railroad companies in England . . To be sure , we mean not to compare the distresses of our own operatives thrown out of employment , with those of the English , at the point of *tarvation ; but if an action of government was right to prevent a great injustice in the one case , it was equally so to prevent a less one in the other : right and wrong are not measured by less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does a little wrong , as he who does a great one ; as our ancestors well knew when they refused to concede Great Britain the right to tax us even in the value of a sixpence . The justice lies in doing all for the good of the nation , with an eye to it present necessities ; and he is but a pedant who mistakes adherence to a maxim through thick and thin for a mark of virtue . The ad valorem applied to tariffs , works injustice in every way ; not only when prices fall , but when they are excessive ; in the one case diminishing the duty absurdly , and in the other increasing it absurdly . But it not only does evil to producers , but also impairs the revenue . For when there is a great importation and prices fall , , the treasury , by keeping its duties at a medium , would reap a good harvest and the people be never the worse for it . And when the prices of imports rise , the duties rise with them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one case the revenue is impaired , in the other there is an unnatural stimulus upon production , which the fall of prices will soon abate and bring ruin upon the new manufactories . In fine the ad valorem applied to imports , is in theory an ab surdity , and in its effects a gross oppression . There was a time when legislators regarded the wealth and happiness of the people , but now their whole attention is directed upon increasing the revenue : to get money is all their thought ; their understandings are corrupted , and emit only contradictions and absurdities . To be good economists for a nation it is necessary for legislators to be just men ; without a good conscience and a good heart , the greatest ingenuity produces nothing of permanent value to mankind . In this cultivated and reasoning age the great qualities of the soul are skillfully imitated by the moral theorist ; instead of patriotism we have a grand philanthropy embracing the whole human race ; - persons infected with this bloating of the heart , lose all the pith and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or country is too small for them ; the*y must be citizens of the universe , and fraternize with the Calmucks , the Lunary people , and the devil himself . All things must be free-not only trade but the nether limbs of women ; and in qne breath they propose one universal pence* and a masculine costume for ladies . Observe the dullness of these metaphysical sots , who propose a policy for all the world in regard of the condition of men in general , and apply the same to their own nation without regard to its condition in particular . The greatest mark of folly in a man , is to engage in any business on an hypothesis without an eye to conditions . None but madmen will try experiments in business affairs . He who wishes to benefit himself inquires first into all matters concerning himself , and then proceeds by his knowledge of them , and not by any theory of free trade between John and Thomas . On the contrary , John will take good care to give Thomas no advantages ; he will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , lest Thomas judge him to be a cheat . Nothing could better exemplify the necessity of a strict regard i*o circumstances in a business transaction , or a policy , than the policy of the present Administration in adopting the free trade maxims put forth by British economists . Without entering now upon the question whether the piivate motives of those English statesmen who have carried the late policy of the English gov 336 April , // 337f eminent into effect-for , if it were possible to discover those motives , the knowledge of them would not help us in deciding whether the measures which they advocate will or will not benefit the nationwe may at least inquire into the preseut condition of England and of the interests which predominate there , in order to find some practical reasons , such as men of business will appreciate , for the adoption of the so-called free trade policy in that country . England has usually taken care that every great interest shall be protected and flourish in her dominions ; her commerce by navigation laws -- her agriculture by corn laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , have grown up to their present perfection and importance , under the care of government . She is the great example of the fruits of protection ; the strongest , richest , wisest , and just at this time , the most powerful monarchy on the globe . Whatever be her errors , her defects or her miseries , there she stands , a witness to the world and to all time , of the fruits of foresight and wisdom . More than that ,  --  England by her example , and by cheris*hing the seeds of liberty , protecting and ' encouraging all rightful industry , whether of the hand or of the head , has made herself the patroness and protector of human liberty ; and sending colonies into remote regions , carrying with ' them her laws and principles , has made herself the mother of future empires . And what is this policy that has made England so great ? what has it always been and what will it constantly he ? To feed her children from their own soil  --  to clothe them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own commerce-to educate them in their own language , literature and religion-protect them with their own proper laws and customs , and govern them by their own free opinions . Such has been the policy of England , always protective , always patriotical . We are not writing a history of her errors , to enter here upon those exceptions to her general policy , which have impeded , though they could not hinder , her greatness : it is enough for present purposes that we know the course which she has commonly pursued . Coming now to the example so much quoted by our new philanthropists , as an instance of departure from her general system , namely , the so-called Peel policy , alluded to at first ; it is well understood that the manufacturing interest in England , through causes which need not now be dwelt upon ; has come to predominate over the commercial and agricultural in a very great degree . Of the great interests of a nation , namely , the manufactures , the commerce , the agriculture , and the mines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is always important to manufacturers , that the products of mines and farms should be rendered to them as cheaply as possible , not only that they may be able to procure the raw products of mines , forests and farms at the least price , to be worked up into articles of trade and of use , but that the workmen , procuring bread , clothing and lodging at an easy rate , may find their wages more than sufficient for maintenance . And let theories of political economy be invented never so refined and unanswerable , it is as certain as the sunrise , that manufacturers will aim at producing such a condition of things as will bring down the price of bread stuffs and raw materials of manufacture to the lowest rates . They will not only buy in the cheapest , and sell in the dearest market , but they will , if possible , use such an influence with government as to cheapen the commodities which they wish to buy . They , therefore , desire a free navigation ; for by the competition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rates of transportation are brought down to the lowest possible . Should it happen at any time , that the manufacturing interests of a nation which depends in great part upon a foreign market for its products , should predominate in the national councils , either through want of talent and foresight , or want of capital and energy in the other reat interests , doctrines of free trade will naturally spring up and be cherished , just so far as they favor the manufacturing interest , and no farther . The duty on bread stuffs will be lowered to content the operatives with less wages ; the duty on raw materials for manufacture , to content the owners of the mills , and foreign shipping be admitted to competition with one 's own , to lower the rates of I transportation . Hence the present Peel // and Cobden policy , so philanthropical to appearance , and so politic and partial in the fact . The total value of articles manufactured in the United Kingdom in 1838 , is estimated byMcCulloch at about ? 117,000,000 sterling , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 per cent . profit , an income of five millions sterling to the capitalists , which gives an average of ? 1000 each , to five thousand families among the educated classes . Here we have an immense body of influential persons enjoying an income by the export of manufactured goods , many of them too , like Peel and Cobden , possessed of vast wealth , accumulated , principally , by the employment of capital in manufactures . It is surely unnecessary to attribute the motives of a mere agitator , or of a closet theorist , to the leaders of the English free trade party , compelled as they are by the rivalry of our own manufactures in the foreign markets , to furnish everything at the lowest possible rate . It is unnecessary , at least , to attribute any theoretical motives to them , and when the common causes of political movements are considered , it is absurd . There are reasons endugh to be found , why they should lighten the duties on imported bread stuffs and on certain raw materials of manufacture , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle declamations of a few enthusiasts , as ineffectual to change the course of English legislators as would be a mesmeric spell to draw the gold out of their purses . They are not of that persuadable stuff to be led away from their interests by a free trade hypothesis . The policy of the Peel party has been to lighten the duties on imported articles and supply the consequent deficiency of revenue by taxes on incomes . A tax upon the incomes of the rich is democratic , and popular , beyond a doubt ; and it has the advantage of drawing back into the treasury a part of the interest of the national debt ; it is a quiet way of equalizing the burthen of the debt : the nation at large is taxed twenty-seven millions for that debt , which is paid by the Treasury to the stockholders . Now if a good part of this tax is levied upon the rich , by a graduated income tax , it is but making a number of rich men pay the interest of the debt  --  a very popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground in England , we may live to see the whole interest of the debt paid in this way by the rich , instead of being paid as now by rich and poor alike . The income tax yields , at present , about five and a half millions ; that it might easily be increased to twenty-seven , may be guessed from the fact , that the total income of capital in railways , funds , banks , matiufactures and commerce in the United Kingdom , is reckoned ( at 3 per cent. ) at about forty-five millions . Now as far as funded property is concerned , a well distributed income tax is but a cancelling of so much of the national debt ; and this policy seems likely to gain ground . To pursue the illustration : in the days when the landed proprietors , the merchants , and the manufacturers , bore an equal sway in the councils of the nation , before the rise and predominance of the manufacturing interest , none of the great businesses of the nation failed of their due protection . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , and the vast body of rich manufacturers who command the markets of the world , are in danger of losing those markets , by competition with ourselves-could we by a protective policy , so far encourage our miners and manufacturers as to undersell them at home and abroad . They command and can use the great body of the movable capital of the IJnited Kingdom ; they employ millions of pauper operatives , in constant danger of starvation ; they are in a situation which compels them to strain every nerve , and exert every infl*-ence to save themselves from ruin ; they will stick at nothing to accomplish their purposes . They can not go to war , for that would spoil all ; they can not beat down the wages of their workmen , for these are already at the lowest ; they have but two means left , and these are to buy in the cheapest and sell in the dearest market ; to feed their operatives , and supply their mills duty free ; and to sell their products in America and elsewhere duty free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and having the instinct , they pass , by a natural effect , to the theory . In a word , the great object of English manufacturers , just at this crisis , is to persuade the world that free trade is a capital thing . 338 April , // The loss to the revenue , through the diminution of duties on imports , amounting , it is said , to some eleven millions sterling , had to be made up by the imposition of additional taxes . Thus , the manufacturers were relieved to the amount of eleven millions , all clear gain to them , and loss to those who bore the compensatory burthen . To say , then , that England has made the experiment of free trade , is merely false ; for the *principle of the free trade economists is , that the nation shall not be taxed to sustain a particular interest . England has taxed her incomes and other sources eleven millions , to support the manufacturers . Not questioning the wisdom of this policy , or denying that it is a vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them chiefly she has become the richest nation in. the world ; admitting , too , that this policy will accomplish its end , and save the British manufacturers from ruin ; let us now inquire what policy these free trade leaders would pursue , acl3ing on their present principles , and instigated by the same motives , were they Americans , with a large capital , invested in manufactures in New England . First , then , at all risks they would sustain the country , labo.r to preseiwe its acquisitions , and open for it new sources of wealth . Observing that the States of New England are composed chiefly of a rocky and unfruitful soil , they would not entertaia the hope of sustaining a dense population there by agriculture . Seeing , too , the rapid impoverishment of the towns and villages , by the removal of ablebodied men , and of capital , to the new lands of the West , and the ruin of the small farmers , by the influx of cbeap provision from the western lands , they would cast about for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of providing new means of subsistence for those who were thrown out of employment by the stagnatioa of agriculture . Every part of this new continent , they would say , ought to support an active and wealthy population ; but how shall we make New England , or the barren regions of the Southern and Middle States , do this ? At present , all these regions lie waste , or are thinly and poorly inhabited ; the people have neither means nor leisure , and must soon become miserable and unimportant . The great West grows rich , and fattens by its corn fields ; why should we , then , live poor and wretched ? is there no way in which we too may prosper ? Our commerce is great , but it is a commerce carried on between foreign countries and the great West ; we benefit but little by it ; it rather impoverishes than helps our country people , for they buy foreign goods with money , and not with produce , making nothing by the exchange ; the West is always too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by commerce , but the country people grow poorer every day . It is , therefore , necessary for us to sustain our manufactures , to erect new mills , and make goods to exchange with these southern planters and western farmers , and so reap the grain ourselves that goes else to enrich foreigners . To bring these French and English goods across the ocean costs much , and involves many risks and losses ; we will save the country this loss , and by competition we will break down the foreigner in his prices , and make him give more of his own in exchange for western products ; by and by we will supply our countrymen of the South and West with all that they now get from foreigners , and that at a less price , exchanging with them for their corn and raw products ; our wealth will then begin to overflow , and we will send our products to foreign nations , and bring home riches , and every luxury for ourselves and our countrymen ; and thus our nation will be made complete and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruits of the earth , a barren region near the sea devoted to manufactures , and a coast adorned with commercial cities . Are not these reasonings identical in principle with those which actuate the free-traders of England ? Their position compels them to sustain their manufactures , for by these they draw to themselves a great part of the wealth which makes them powerful , and defends them against the encroachments and the bad influences of neighboring nations . Human liberty has been upheld and defended by the industry , as much as by the courage of England ; but that industry is drawn out by capital , and capital is created by manufactures . It would be impossible for England or for any nation to acquire great power and wealth by agriculture alone ; for of all industrial pursuits agriculture is that which 1848. 339 // yields the least surplus of profit to the producer . Commerce and exchange may be reckoned the most profitable of all ; but manufactures , much more than agriculture , furnish the material and the occasion for commercial enterprise . They create merchandise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Countries , therefore , like England , and the barren regions of our Eastern and Middle States , if they mean to prosper and sustain a thriving population , must engage in manufactures . Mentally revolving the course that events have taken in the political world , we seem to discover , indeed , no issue towards which they tend more remarkable or more alarming than the establishment of new and unconstitutional powers in the Executive  --  the powers of creating war , of withholding information , of taxing , and despotically governing , conquered territory ; add to these the creation of armies for the sake , if not of patronage , then of new wars and of new unlooke d - for uses of power ; the formation of a false public opinion , the turning of the powers of the general government upon enterprises confessedly calculated for the aid of an exorbitant ambition . These things , indeed , excite an alarm most reasonable , and that should lead to the most decisive action among conscientious men . It is discovered that the limitation of the Presidential term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to liberty ; erroneous precedents , party precedents , grow gradually into law , and the accumulated mass of them are handed from one term to another , like the traditional usurpations of a hierarchy , until in a course of ages , every feature of the original Constitution is buried and forgotten . Though these just fears may , indeed , image forth the head of our FUTURE POLICY , we are not , therefore , to forget other things ,  --  to be so occupied with the head and front of the offence as to forget the vile and corrupting body . It is a matter of some importance to the nation that its sources of wealth and power should be kept open , and that the chinks and scuttles , through which its riches are flowing away like water , should be stopped ; in a word , that it should not be left a prey to foreign enterprise , and have one great third of its productive power sacrificed to the united selfishness of the remaining two-thirds . This word " selfishness , " so easily and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assist the argument ; but it may serve here to suggest a reflection not inapt for the conclusion of this article . The wealth of a nation , meaning by its wealth , that moderate surplus of means which is necessary to its freedom and power , is created by at least three distinct and contrasted kinds of industry : indeed , so very distinct and contrasted , they breed opposite habits and permanent differences of character , in those who use them . , These are , the production from mines , or from the soil , of the raw material of industry ; the manufacture of these materials into com ( modities ; and the transportation and exchange of commodities in trade and commerce . The hamlets , villages and open spaces of the country are occupied by those who produce the crude material ; the towns near rivers , canals , and at the meeting of great roads , are chiefly occupied by manufacturers ; while cities by the sea , and on great streams , bays and lakes , are the head-quarters of trade , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that a nation v* ithout commerce can never rise to the first importance , and in all ages statesmen and rulers have become celebrated and respected more by their encouragement of roads , canals , shipping , and all the enterprise of commerce , from the protection of caravans to the founding of commercial cities , than for their successful wars . Nor is a nation capable of sustaining itself long without a constant attention to agriculture . Egypt , Grece , Rome , China , India , interior Germany , and above all , England , have made agriculture the right arm of the public industry . But what great nation , that has a sufficient respect for itself , does not desire to complete the circle of its industry , and add manufactures to agriculture and commerce ? Why should we stupidly insist upon producing and transporting our raw material to other more cunning and ingenious nations ? Why must a bale of flax grown in Ohio , be lugged across the scornful billows of the Atlantic , to be worked up in England ? Why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home ? Patience is exhausted in such an argument ; the good sense of the nation is insulted by it.
