STEREOTYPERS ........ T. K. &; P. G. COLLINS , PRINTERS . INTRODUCTION . The great degree of favour with which a series of Sketches , similar to those embraced in the present volume , was received by the public and the press last year , has induced the publishers to add another volume of the same character and style to their " Library of American Humorous Writers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other Tales , " which were more especially intended to illustrate character and incident in the south and south-west , appear to have been unusually popular , the Editor trusts that the present volume , which includes a wider range of the peculiarities and characteristics of " the Universal Yankee Nation , " will not be deemed less entertaining by the public generally . The different Sketches in this volume have nearly all appeared in the columns of the New York " Spirit of the Times , " where most of them were published originally . If they afford as much satisfaction in their present shape as when first given to the world , the Editor will enjoy the consciousness of having been the means of alleviating the dulness and ennui of many a weary hour , and of having added his mite in contributing to the amusement and gratification of " the million .

B. THORPE , ESQ. , OF NEW ORLEANS . As the author of " The Mysteries of the Backwoods , " and a series of sporting sketches in the " Spirit of the Times , " of which " The Big Bear of Arkansas , " and " Tom Owen , the Bee Hunter , " are perhaps best known , Mr. Thorpe has acquired the most enviable reputation on both sides of the Atlantic . It is not so generally known that he is , by profession , a painter ; and his abilities as an artist are cheerfully acknowledged by his contemporaries . Since the breaking out of the war with Mexico , Thorpe has visited its theatre , and the result has been a very interesting volume , containing many illustrations from drawings by himself , made on the spot . It is called " Our Army of Occupation ; " the publishers were Carey &; Hart , of Philadelphia ; and the work may be obtained at any book-store for half-a-dollar , though worth five times that amount . It is not expected that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkansas , will turn the current of fashion of two worlds , from Brighton and Bath , or from Ballston or Saratoga , although the residents in the neighbourhood of that delightful place profess to have ocular demonstration , as well as popular opinion , that his Satanic Majesty , in warm weather , regularly retires to the " retreat , " and " there reclines in the cool . " The solemn grandeur that surrounds this distinguished resort is worthy of the hero , as represented by Milton ; its characteristics are darkness , gloom , and mystery ; it is composed of the unrivalled vegetation and forest of the Mississippi Valley . View it when you will , whether decked out in all the luxuriance of a southern summer , or stripped of its foliage by the winter 's blasts ; it matters not , its grandeur is always sombre . The huge trees seem immortal , their roots look as if they struck to the centre of the earth , while the gnarled limbs reached out to the clouds . Here and there may be seen one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its top to the base you can trace the subtle fluid in its descent , and see where it shattered off the limb , larger than your body , or turned aside from some slight inequality in the bark . These stricken trees , no longer able to repel the numerous parasites that surround them , soon become festooned with wreaths and flowers , while the damp airs engender on living tree and dead , like funeral drapery , the pendant moss , that waves in every breeze , and seems to cover the whole scene with the gloom of the grave . Rising out of this forest for ten square miles , is the dense cane-brake that bears the name of the " Devil 's Summer Retreat ; " it is formed by a space of ground , on which , seemingly from its superiority of soil , more delicate vegetation than surrounds it has usurped its empire . Here the reed , that the disciple of Izaak Walton plays over the northern streams like a wand , grows into a delicate mast , springing from the rich alluvium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tapering from its roots to the height of twenty or thirty feet , there mingling , in compact and luxuriant confusion , its long leaves . A portion of this brake is interwoven with vines of all descriptions , which makes it so thick that it seems to be impenetrable as a mountain . Here , in this solitude , where the noon-day sun never penetrates , ten thousand birds , with the instinct of safety , roost at night , and at the dawn of day , for a while , darken the air as they seek their haunts , their manure deadening , for acres round , the vegetation , like a fire , so long have they possessed the solitude . Around this mass of cane and vine , the black bears retire for winter quarters , where they pass the season , if not disturbed , in the insensibility of sleep , and yet come out in the spring as fat as when they commenced their long nap . The forest , the waste , and the dangers of the cane brake , add to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and makes them subservient to his pursuits . Associated with these scenes , they to him possess no sentiment ; he builds his log cabin in a clearing made by his own hands , amid the surrounding grandeur , and it looks like a gipsy hut among the ruins of a Gothic cathedral . The noblest trees are only valuable for fence-rails , and the cane-brake is " an infernal dark hole , " where you can " see sights , " " catch bears , " and " get a fish-pole , ranging in size from a penny whistle to that of a young stove-pipe . " The undoubted hero of the Devil 's Summer Retreat , is old Bob Herring ; he has a character that would puzzle three hundred metaphysicians consecutively . He is as bold as a lion , and as superstitious as an Indian . The exact place of his birth he can not tell , as he says his parents " travelled " as long as he can remember them . He " squatted " on the Mississippi , at its nearest point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting for a living , having no prospect ahead but selling out his " pre-emption right " and improvements , and again squatting somewhere else . Unfortunately the extent of Arkansas , and the swamp that surrounded Bob 's location , kept it out of market , until , to use his own language , he " became the ancientest inhabitant in the hull of Arkansaw . " And having , in spite of himself , gradually formed acquaintances with the few residents in this vicinity , and grown into importance from his knowledge of the country and his hunting exploits , he has established himself for life , at what he calls the " Wasp 's diggins , " made a potato patch , which he has never had time to fence in , talked largely of a corn-field , and hung his cabin round with rifle pouches , gourds , red-peppers , and flaming advertisements with rampant horses and pedigrees ; these latter ornaments he looks upon as rather sentimental , but he excuses himself on the ground that they look " hoss , " and he considers such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bob 's mind would puzzle three hundred metaphysicians consecutively , and we as boldly assert that an equal number of physiologists would be brought to a stand by his personal appearance . The left side of his face is good looking , but the right side seems to be under the influence of an invisible air-pump ; it looks sucked out of shape ; his perpendicular height is six feet one inch , but that gives the same idea of his length , that the diameter gives of the circumference ; how long Bob Herring would be if he was drawn out , is impossible to tell . Bob himself says , that he was made on too tall a scale for this world , and that he was shoved in , like the joints of a telescope . Poor in flesh , his enormous bones and joints rattle when he moves , and they would no doubt have long since fallen apart , but for the enormous tendons that bind them together as visibly as a good-sized hawser would . Such is Bob Herring , who on a bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and be more active than any man living , sustaining the whole with unflinching good humour , never getting angry except when he breaks his whisky bottle , or has a favourite dog open on the wrong trail . My first visit to the Devil 's Summer Retreat was propitious , my companions were all choice spirits , the weather was fine , and Bob Herring inimitable . The bustling scene that prefaced the " striking the camp " for night lodgings , was picturesque and animated ; a long ride brought us to our halting place , and there was great relief in again stepping on the ground . Having hobbled our horses , we next proceeded to build a fire , which was facilitated by taking advantage of a dead tree for a back-log ; our saddles , guns , and other necessaries were brought within the circle of its light , and lolling upon the ground we partook of a frugal supper , the better to be prepared for our morrow 's exertions , and our anticipated breakfast . Beds were next made up , and few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , covered with a blanket , with a saddle for a pillow ; upon such a rude couch , the hunter sleeps more soundly than the effeminate citizen on his down . The crescent moon , with her attendant stars , studded the canopy under which we slept , and the blazing fire completely destroyed the chilliness of a southern December night . The old adage of " early to bed and early to rise , " was intended to be acted upon , that we might salute the tardy sun with the heat of our sport , and probably we would have carried out our intentions had not Bob Herring very coolly asked if any of us snored " unkimmonly loud , " for he said his old shooting iron would go off at a good imitation of a bear 's breathing ! This sally from Bob brought us all upright , and then there commenced a series of jibes , jokes , and stories , that no one can hear , or witness , except on an Arkansas hunt with " old coons . " Bob , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wit in others , but he sustained himself against all competition , and gave in his notions and experience with an unrivalled humour and simplicity . He found in me an attentive listener , and went into details , until he talked every one but myself asleep . From general remarks , he changed to addressing me personally , and as I had every thing to learn , he went from the elementary to the most complex experience . " You are green in bar hunting , " said he to me , in a commiserating tone , and with a toss of the head that would have done honour to Mr. Brummel in his glory ; " green as a jinson weed  --  but do n't get short-winded ' bout it , case it 's a thing like readin ' , to be larnt ;  --  a man do n't come it parfectly at once , like a dog does ; and as for that , they larn a heap in time ;  --  thar is a greater difference ' tween a pup and an old dog on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a riglar . I remember when I could n't bar hunt , though the thing seems onpossible now ; it only requires time , a true eye , and steady hand , though I did know a fellow that called himself a doctor , that said that could n't do it if you was narvious . I asked him if he meant by that agee and fever ? He said it was the agee without the fever . Thar may be such a thing as narvious , stranger , but nothin ' but a yarthquake , or the agee , can shake me ; and still bar hunting ai n't as easy as scearing a wild turkey , by a long shot . The varmint ai nt a hog , to run with a w  --  h  --  e  --  w ; just corner one  --  cotch its cub , or cripple it , and if you do n't have to fight , or get out of the way , then thar ai n't no cat-fish in the Mississip . I larnt that , nigh twenty year ago , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Signifying my assent , Bob Herring got up in his bed , for as it was the bare ground he could not well get off of it , and approaching the fire , he threw about a cord of wood on it , in the form of a few huge logs ; as they struck the blazing heap the sparks flew upwards in the clear cold air , like a jet of stars ; then fixing himself comfortably , he detailed what follows :  --  " I had a knowing old sow at that time that would have made a better hunter than any dog ever heerd on ; she had such a nose ,  --  talk ' bout a dog following a cold trail , she 'd track a bar through running water . Well , you see , afor ' I know 'd her vartu ' , she came rushing into my cabin , bristles up , and fell on the floor , from what I now believe to have been regular sceare . I thought she 'd seen a bar , for nothing else could make her run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort a carelessly , with only two dogs at my heels . Had n't gone far afore I saw a bar , sure enough , very quietly standing beside a small branch  --  it was an old he , and no mistake . I crawled up to him on my hands and knees , and raised my rifle , but if I had fired I must have hit him so far in front , that the ball would have ranged back , and not cut his mortals . I waited , and he turned tail towards me , and started across the branch ; afeerd I 'd lose him , I blazed away , and sort a cut him slantindicularly through his hams , and brought him down ; thar he sat , looking like a sick nigger with the dropsy , or a black bale of cotton turned up on eend . ' T was not a judgmatical shot , and Smith thar " ( pointing at one of the sleeping hunters ) " would say so . " Hereupon Bob Herring , without ceremony , seized a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , thus suddenly awakened from a sound sleep , seized his knife , and looking about him , asked , rather confusedly , what was the matter ? " Would you , " inquired Bob , very leisurely , " would you , under any circumstances , shoot an old he in the hams ? " Smith very peremptorily told his questioner to go where the occupier of the Retreat in Summer is supposed to reside through the winter months , and went instantly to sleep again . Bob continued ,  --  " Stranger , the bar , as I have said , was on his hams , and thar he sot , waiting to whip somebody and not knowing whar to begin , when the two dogs that followed me came up , and pitched into him like a caving bank . I knowed the result afor the fight began ; Brusher had his whole scalp , ears and all , hanging over his nose in a minute , and Tig was laying some distance from the bar , on his back , breathing like a horse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke of his left paw , and thar he sot , knowing as well as I did , that he was not obliged to the dogs for the hole in his carcass , and thar I stood , like a fool , rifle in hand , watching him , instead of giving him another ball . All of a sudden he caught a glimpse of my hunting shirt , and the way he walked at me with his two fore legs was a caution to slow dogs . I instantly fired , and stepped round behind the trunk of a large tree ; my second shot confused the bar , and he was hunting about for me , when , just as I was patching my ball , he again saw me , and , with his ears nailed back to his head , he gave the d  --  t w  --  h  --  e  --  w I ever heerd , and made straight at me ; I leaped up a bank near by , and as I gained the top my foot touched the eend of his nose . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the skin on my face seemed an inch thick , and my eyes had more rings in them than a mad wild-cat 's . At this moment several of my dogs , that war out on an expedition of their own , came up , and immediately made battle with the bar , who shook off the dogs in a flash , and made at me agin ; the thing was done so quick , that , as I raised my rifle , I stepped back and fell over , and thinking my time was come , wished I had been born to be hung , and not chaw 'd up ; but the bar did n't cotch me : his hind quarters , as he came at me , fell into a hole about a root , and caught . I was on my feet , and out of his reach in a wink , but as quick as I did this he had cut through a green root the size of my leg : he did it in about two snaps , but weakened by the exertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on while I blowed his heart out . Ever since that time I have been wide awake with a wounded bar  --  sartinly , or stand off , being my motto . I shall dream of that bar to-night , " concluded Bob , fixing his blanket over him ; and a few moments only elapsed before he was in danger of his life , if his rifle would go off at a good imitation of a bear 's breathing . Fortunately for me , the sun on the following morn was fairly above the horizon before our little party was ready for the start . While breakfast was being prepared , the rifles were minutely examined ; some were taken apart , and every precaution used to ensure a quick and certain fire . A rude breakfast having been despatched , lots were drawn , who should go into the drive with the dogs , as this task in the Devil 's Summer Retreat is any thing but a pleasant one , being obliged at one time to walk on the bending cane  --  it is so thick for hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground  --  then crawling on your hands and knees , between its roots , sometimes brought to a complete halt , and obliged to cut your way through with your knife . While this is going on , the hunters are at the stands , places their judgments dictate as most likely to be passed by the bear , when roused by the dogs . Two miles might on this occasion have been passed over by those in the drive , in the course of three hours , and yet , although " signs were plenty as leaves , " not a bear was started . Hard swearing was heard , and as the vines encircled the feet , or caught one under the nose , it was increased . In the midst of this ill humour , a solitary bark was heard ; some one exclaimed , that was Bose ! another shrill yelp that sounded like Music 's ; breathing was almost suspended in the excitement of the moment ; presently another , and another bark , was heard in quick succession ; in a minute more , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from silence to so much noise made it almost deafening . No idea but personal demonstration can be had of the effect upon the mind , of such a pack baying a bear in a cane-break . Before me were old hunters ; they had been moving along , as if destitute of energy or feeling , but now their eyes flashed , their lips were compressed , and their cheeks flushed ; they seemed incapable of fatigue . As for myself , my feelings almost overcame me , I felt a cold sweat stealing down my back , my breath was thick and hot , and as I suspended it , to hear more distinctly the fight , for by this time the dogs had evidently come up with the bear , I could hear the pulsation of my heart . One minute more to listen , to learn which direction the war was raging , and then our party unanimously sent forth a yell that would have frightened a nation of Indians . The bear was in his bed when the dogs first came up with him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then finding things rather too warm , he broke off with a " whew " that was awful to hear . His course was towards us on the left , and as he went by , the cane cracked and smashed as if rode over by an insane locomotive . Bob Herring gave the dogs a salute as they passed , close at the bear 's heels , and the noise increased , until he said " it sounded as if all h  --  l was pounding bark . " The bear was commented on as he rushed by ; one said he was " a buster . " " A regular built eight years old , " said another . " Fat as a candle , " shouted a third . " He 's the beauty of the Devil 's Summer Retreat , with a band of angels after him , " sang out Bob Herring . On the bear plunged , so swiftly that our greatest exertions scarcely enabled us to keep within hearing distance ; his course carried him towards those at the stands , but getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , but not with the same speed ; want of breath had already brought him several times to a stand , and a fight with the dogs . He passed us the second time within two hundred yards , and coming against a fallen tree , backed up against it , and showed a determination , if necessary , there to die . We made our way towards the spot , as fast as the obstacles in our way would let us , the hunters anxious to despatch him , that as few dogs as possible might be sacrificed . The few minutes to accomplish this seemed months , the fight all the time sounding terrible , for every now and then the bear evidently made a rush at the dogs , as they narrowed their circle , or came individually too near his person . Crawling through and over the cane-brake was a new thing to me , and in the prevailing excitement , my feet seemed tied together , and there was always a vine directly under my chin , to cripple my exertions . While thus struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking round , I saw Bob Herring , a foot taller than common , stalking over the cane , like a colossus ; he very much facilitated my progress , by a shove in the rear . " Come along , stranger , " he shouted , his voice as clear as a bell , " Come along , the bar and the dogs are going it , like a high pressure nigger camp-meeting , and I must be thar to put a word in sartin . " Fortunately for my wind , I was nearer the contest than I imagined , for Bob Herring stopped just ahead of me , examined his rifle with two or three other hunters , just arrived from the stands , and by peeping through the under-growth , we discovered , within thirty yards of us , the fierce raging fight . Nothing distinctly , however , was seen ; a confused mass of legs , heads , and backs of dogs , flying about as if attached to a ball , was all we could make out . A still nearer approach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the head of the bear could be seen , with his tongue covered with dust , and hanging a foot from his mouth ; his jaws were covered with foam and blood , his eyes almost protruding from their sockets , while his ears were so closely pressed to the back of his head , that he seemed destitute of those appendages ; the whole indicative of unbounded rage and terror . These glimpses of the bear were only momentary ; his persecutors rested but for a breath , and then closed in , regardless of their own lives , for you could discover , mingled with the sharp bark of defiance , the yell that told of death . It was only while the bear was crushing some luckless dog , that they could cover his back , and lacerate it with their teeth . One of the hunters , in spite of the danger , headed by Bob Herring , crept upon his knees , so near that it seemed as if another foot advanced would bring them within the circle of the fight . Bob Herring was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waving his hand to those behind him , he raised his rifle and sighted , but his favourite dog , impatient for the report , anticipated it by jumping on the bear , who throwing up his head at the same instant , the bear received the ball in his nose . At the crack of the rifle , the well-trained dogs , thinking less caution than otherwise necessary , jumped pell-mell on the bear 's back , and the hardest fight ever witnessed in the Devil 's Summer Retreat ensued ; the hunter , with Bob , placed his gun almost against the bear 's side , and the cap snapped ; no one else was near enough to fire without hitting the dogs .  --  " Give him the knife ! " cried those at a distance . Bob Herring 's long blade was already flashing in his hand , but sticking a living bear is not child 's play ; he was standing undecided , when he saw the hind legs of Bose upwards ; thrusting aside one or two of the dogs with his hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the animal was so quick , that he struck the knife with his fore paw , and sent it whirling into the distant cane ; another was instantly handed him , which he thrust at the bear , but the point was so blunt that it would not penetrate the skin . Foiled a third time , with a tremendous oath on himself and the owner of the knife " that would n't stick a cabbage , " he threw it indignantly from him , and seizing , unceremoniously , a rifle , just then brought up by one of the party , heretofore in the rear , he , regardless of his own legs , thrust it against the side of the bear with considerable force , and blowed him through ; the bear struggled but for a moment , and fell dead , " I saw snakes last night in my dreams , " said Bob , handing back the rifle to its owner , " and I never had any good luck the next day , after sich a sarcumstance ; I call this hull hunt about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thar , " pointing to the carcass , " that thar , ought to have been killed , afor he maimed a dog . " Then , speaking energetically , he said , " Boys , never shoot at a bar 's head , even if your iron is in his ear , it 's unsartin ; look how I missed the brain , and only tore the smellers ; with fewer dogs , and sich a shot , a fellow would be ripped open in a powder flash ; and I say , cuss caps , and head shooting ; they would have cost two lives to-day , but for them ar dogs , God bless ' em . " With such remarks , Bob Herring beguiled away the time , while he , with others , skinned the bear . His huge carcass , when dressed , though not over fat , looking like a young steer 's . The dogs , as they recovered breath , partook of the refuse with relish ; the nearest possible rout out of the Devil 's Retreat was selected , and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it was divided out in such a manner that it could be taken home . Bob Herring , while the dressing of the bear was going on , took the skin , and on its inside surface , which glistened like satin , he carefully deposited the caul fat , that looked like drifted snow , and beside it the liver ; the choice parts of the bear , according to the gourmand notions of the frontier , were in Bob 's possession ; and many years ' experience had made him so expert in cooking it , that he was locally famed for this matter above all competitors . It would be as impossible to give the recipe for this dish , so that it might be followed by the gastronomes of cities , as it would to have the articles composing it exposed for sale in the markets . Bob Herring managed as follows : he took a long wooden skewer , and having thrust its point through a small piece of bear fat , he then followed it by a small piece of the liver , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until his most important material was consumed ; when this was done , he opened the " bear 's handkerchief , " or caul , and wrapped it round the whole , and thus roasted it before the fire . Like all the secrets in cookery , this dish depends for its flavour and richness upon exactly giving the proper quantities , as a superabundance of one or the other would completely spoil the dish . " I was always unlucky , boys , " said Bob , throwing the bear skin and its contents over his shoulder , " but I 've had my fill often of caul fat and liver ; many a man , who thinks he 's lucky , lives and dies ignorant of its virtue , as a ' possum is of corn cake . If I ever look dead do n't bury me until you see I do n't open my eyes when its ready for eating ; if I do n't move when you show me it , then I am a done goner , sure . " Night closed in before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon our spirits and energy , but the evening 's meal of caul fat and liver , and other similar " fixins , " or Bob Herring 's philosophical remarks , restored me to perfect health , and I shall recollect that supper , and its master of ceremonies , as harmonious with , and as extraordinary as is , the Devil 's Summer Retreat .
