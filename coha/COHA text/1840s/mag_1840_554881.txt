txt ON Tuesday , the 6th of March , 1894 , Robert Ross , a representative American citizen , a man young , full of high hopes , and of irreproachable character , was shot at the polls in the city of Troy , by Bat Shea , a partisan of Murphy , the so-called City Boss . Ross had already suffered for liberty 's sake , and had , like Marcus Brutus , given his life for his country before he started on his country 's errand , resolved to do his duty as a citizen by protesting against Murphy 's repeaters . He knew that he was a marked man , and when a friend expressed fear for his life replied , " Let fifty Rosses die , if only we can have a pure ballot . " As he lay on the ground dying in the midst of his enemies , his figure fitly marked the epoch in which we live , for he symbolizes that great struggle for survival which is now going on between the lingering type of Americanism and the alien element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unintelligent sense of the situation that has given rise to the A. P. A. movement . In view of the facts , it becomes us not hastily to rebuke that which has its origin in a genuine national necessity , but to find , if we can , a wiser solution . To one not familiar with our circumstances , the first feeling on becoming acquainted with them must be that of astonishment . A great people cross the seas , subdue a wilderness , found an empire , develop a new form of government , defend it with masterly courage , exhibit* above all peoples the genius and force of statesmanship , and at the end of a century are found deliberately to have abandoned the sceptre to an alien race , and to be actually fighting the battle of liberty over again . It may indeed be objected that this was true only in our great cities of the North ; but it is these same great cities which , by their vote for the American Constitution , saved the country from anarchy . They have always been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its moral backbone . They have now become its deadliest menace . Their political corruption is fast stamping its imprint upon the whole country . Nor is the situation mitigated by the fact that the foreigner is not a bad fellow , who has often proved himself capable of becoming the best of citizens , and that it is only in the mass , and under the management of that American traitor // called the " boss , " that he has become an instrument for subverting our liberties . The fact remains that by the foreign majority , and its susceptibility to the management of traitors , the American people have been put outside of their own institutions , while those institutions themselves have been turned into an instrument of degrading tyranny . The intelligent are in the power of the unintelligent , and the situation is duplicated at the South , where the possession of the suffrage by the negro has compelled the American population to choose between misrule and practical rebellion against the Constitution of the United States . Now , when a people are actually put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ignorant domination is either by a rebellion of some kind against their own institutions , or by some process as yet undiscovered , they may fairly be said to have entered upon a struggle for survival , and to be not unjustly counted in with other examples of the same sort , such as the American Indian and the bison . Happily , we are in the first stages of this epoch , but much depends on our distinctly recognizing where we are . However much it may cost us , we had better get rid of our pet illusions . Curiously enough , it has been urged against the restriction of emigration that foreigners alone do not make dangerous citizens ; that Americans themselves often turn into propagandists of anarchy ; and that many commuuities , as for example the State of Kansas , which are most pure blooded in their Americanism , are most alien to our national principles . But this only serves to bring out a fact which should make us more prudent in regard to both emigration and suffrage . If our organism for imprinting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it fails to Americanize even considerable portions of our native-born population , then all the more must it fail to take hold of foreigners . It is madness to trust to luck . The first thing to do is to inquire how the organism came to be so defective , and what is possible to it under the circumstances . Unless we restrict both emigration and the suffrage within the re sonable range of our assimilating organism , we must certainly come to grief . In fact , this defection of a large portion of our Anglo - Saxon population shows us both our greatest peril and the point at which the remedy must be applied . Doubtless one of our worst mistakes has been that we have trusted too much to heredity . Heredity will certainly do much . It can make a clan , but not a nation . A great free nation must cohere through the force of its national character , and the propagation of national character can not be trusted to sex alone . That which is born of the flesh is flesh , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it may be asked , Do you think it essential that there should be a distinct organism for the reproduction of the American type ? I answer , It ought not to be necessary . The public schools , the Protestant churches ( nay , the Catholicchurches , when their priests , like Archbishop Spalding , plainly teach the separation of politics from religion ) , the national Constitution , the laws , the legislatures , the elections , even the trades unions themselves , when leaders like Powderly and Wilkinson stand up in an hour of trial for the American idea , all these are organs for reproducing the spirit of Americanism . Indeed , under a recent test , the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers has shown itself alive with true Americanism . But the trouble is that our organs are for the most part not performing their function . This is due to the fact that they are pervaded by an anti-American spirit ; and here , beyond all question , lies our greatest peril . No American Protective Association can reach that . The foreign majority can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should it come to such a sharp necessity , but an anti-American spirit among ourselves // is a thing that can be put down only by conquering ourselves with the power of the truth : and this is an exceedingly difficult task , for the quality that gives force to our anti-American spirit is a specious humanity which claims the allegiance of our better nature . Its power lies in the element of good there is in it , and it can be eradicated only by an analysis sharp enough to separate the good , and distinctly brand the evil with which it is now identified . As to humanity itself , let us thank God that , however mistakenly , we have followed it , for by following it we have been baptized with it . It has become the great creative force of our national life . Having gained the force , we are now to learn its use and limitations ; but first we must rescue it by a struggle grander even than that by which it was obtained . One thing is becoming clear : humanity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of the French , lead to terrible mistakes where it is exalted above that truly supreme force , religion . Quite possibly that is one feature of our present peril . An insubordinate humanity , bent only on grasping material good , and trampling beneath its feet that unifying love of God which binds men into a spiritual brotherhood , may not unnaturally issue , as did the French Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , in a reign of hatred , for such a humanity is on the straight road to animalism . But whether this be so or not , there is food for solemn reflection in the fact that we have followed humanity now these ninety years , its inspired prophets marching before us , uttering their visions , holding up their undeniable verities , always demanding our absolute fealty , sometimes wildly attacking the Federal Constitution , often declaring the church a failure , and religion itself a monstrosity , because it could not follow fast enough , - nay , even avowinghumanity itself the only religion . We have followed these prophets , I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their visions contained a reality , though we often suspected it of being confused . We have tried to share our freedom with foreigners , only to djscover that freedom is not transferable . We have given the ballot to the negro , only to find out that an elector can not be manufactured . The negro ballot meant a negro majority , and this in turn meant that the institutions of the country were to be under negro domination . This turns out to be impossible . Society will not cohere under such conditions . Intelligence can not be ruled by ignorance . The higher force can not be dominated by the lower . Nature will not tolerate it ; she prefers disintegration and reorganization . Indeed , it is now generally agreed that the reorganization of a state must be left to those who have the natural leadership , and that it is better to suffer and be patient than to attempt to force nature in the interest of humanity . In short , we have discovered beyond question the fact which we all along more or less feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been humanitarianism rather than humanity ; for it is the characteristic of an " ism that it does not stop to inquire carefully , or to work humbly and patiently . Reckoning up profit and loss , our humanitarians have two items to their credit : the humanity itself , such as it is , and a tremendous lesson in respect to liberty , - namely , that liberty is not a thing that stands by itself , but is what the scientific people call an organic product , and that , as in the case of a strawberry , the only way to net it is to cultivate the stem , root , soil , leaves , and blossoms with which it belongs . this is important , because these same prophets of humanity who led us to give the ballot to foreigners and to the negro are still wildly urging us on . They are the real moral leaders of the present socialistic movement . They are still , in their old impetuous fashion , upbraiding the church , the state , the capitalists . Once it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich . Once it was the slave States ; now it is the general structure of society . " Every poor man is a slave . The rich man has forged his chains . " Now , is it not about time that these prophets of humanity should stop and reflect ? May it not be that the welfare of the poor man , like that of the negro , may be actually imperiled by forcing nature in the interest of humanity ? May it not be that wealth and happiness as well as liberty stand together with some kind of organism , and that instead of madly trying to manufacture them , or to extract them out of capitalists , it would be better patiently to cultivate the stem on which they grow ? Is it not possible that humanity turned maniac from want of quiet reflection may , after having scuttled the ship , succeed in sinking her , and so wind up the business of humanity so far as this nation is concerned ? This stands out more plainly if , instead of taking humanity by dribblets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant we face humanity squarely , we find that the Chinaman and the Zulu are just as much on our hands as Mr. Debs is . Humanity knows no local bounds , no conventional relations or obligations . It binds us to do whatever we can for every man , wherever he is . Nor does it know any limitation of rich or poor . It binds us to help the wretchedest victim of the African slave trade toward happiness , but not one whit less does it bind us to help the Prince of Wales in the same direction , if so be it in us lie . Furthermore , it bids us seek the real condition of human happiness , not what we imagine it to be , and then to attempt to secure it for every man . If , as has been lately assumed , wealth is the condition , and all that is required is a fair sharing of that wealth , then we are bound at once to divide with everybody . Not only are the capitalists bound to divide , but the labor unions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who earn only three or four cents a day : we ought to divide with them , - they will soon call upon us to divide with them ; and they are well off , relatively , to multitudes in other parts of Asia and in Africa , with whom also we shall soon be called to divide . The fact is , this is a poor world , and if wealth be the condition of happiness , and the equal distribution of it the means of promoting happiness , then we , not only our millionaires , but our working people , are terribly wicked . For most of our American workingmen are millionaires compared with the masses of humanity . Indeed , so great is the world 's poverty that a fair distribution would leave us each only enough to starve on , while industry , civilization , and education would all stand still together ; and as the little that each man had would soon be spent , and there would be no capital to furnish employment , the distress would be greater than it is now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most thoughtful and dutiful minds , and has shrunk back aghast . Then she has asked herself the question , What does nature mean ? We talk about the gifts of God , but in themselves considered these are a poor pittance . It is true that they may be made to yield untold wealth , but they must first be set free . One gift alone there is that can unlock the others : it is brains ; and this gift nature has most unequally distributed , nor can it be developed into any kind of efficiency save by work . Men must work together , cultivating the earth for centuries before there is developed a brain like that of Fulton or Edison , and then we see what nature has been driving at . She has been developing a human stem of industry on which wealth may grow . Doubtless she still holds for us inconceivable treasures , but they are all securely hidden ; before they can be ours there must be developed a new brain which shall unlock the secret door that conceals them . Nature never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // she will give bread , but it must be grown on a wheat stem , through the labor of hands , but above all of brains . Furthermore , she keeps crowding us sharply on by our necessities . We must have more bread , and , in order to it , quicker hands and keener brains . For she is bent not so much on giving us external conditions of happiness as on making organs which shall be themselves sources of power and happiness . Neither is it her plan to make life easy . Indeed , it is by the direst pressure of necessity that she forces that sluggish animal , man , to wrestle with her for her gifts , and creates his manhood by a hard struggle for survival . Often she appears to fail to come to the rescue of her offspring in his utmost need . Sooner than withdraw the coercing force that develops manhood by a struggle for stirvival , she leaves the individual man to perish in his misery , like Lazarus at the gate of Dives ; so unrelenting is she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so careful of the type she seems , so careless of the single life , so bent is she on fashioning manhood into a corporate whole , on developing it into a society by her organic method , for thus she stamps the type upon the individual . Every attempt to resist her has been in vain . Every endeavor to distribute wealth other than by her organic method has come to grief . She will not tolerate sameness . Distribute wealth equally , and society becomes but the poorer for it . She herself is really at the bottom of the inequality between men , for she gives to men unequal brain capacity , and bands are insignificant without brains . When she is left to herself , her irregularities are vast as those between oceans and ponds , between oaks and grass blades . But when we have looked on both sides , the advantage is often fearfully against Dives . The plutocrat has the most outward conditions of happiness , but Lazarus towers far above him as regards the inward sources of it . To sum it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . We often hear it said of a measure that it is generous , but it is not business . In other words , it is sacrificing the stem to the fruit , the plant to the produce . We also sometimes say that a man must be just before he is generous ; that means , strictly speaking , that we must first pay our dues to the plant before we can give away the produce . And this is precisely the limitation of humanity . Christianity , altruism , whichever you name it , puts us under obligations to do for all mankind what we can do . We are to be generous even to the point of suffering for others , but we must first pay our dues to the organism on which everything depends . When those dues are paid , justice ends and generosity begins . Give your vine its due in fertilizers ; take what is needed to support yourself , the cultivator ; pay your hired laborer his wages ; take care of your plant , and you may give away the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define the limitations of your humanity . Now , nothing is more fundamental in the exercise of humanity than to keep clear this boundary line between justice and generosity . It is the lack of this plain distinction that lies at the bottom of our national peril ; for there is a notion in the minds of our sentimental humanitarians that there is no such boundary line between rights and right , between our debt to the organism and our debt to humanity . To the minds of such people right is a line that shifts from age to age . Human progress is a battle between the " Haves " and " Have Nots , " in which the " Haves are wrong , and everything wrung from them a clear gain . It is the wicked rulers and capitalists who make the world 's poverty . But the real quarrel of these agitators is with nature , or with its Author . Their position has been somewhat naively expressed by Mrs. Gougar , who wishes she could be in the Almighty 's place for a few hours . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to do with a structure of things that does not lend itself immediately and absolutely to the human will . Nature has a method of her own ; she develops first a central trunk or stem , and then the dependent branches . Through slow processes she evolves a great organic type , a creative solar man , a Charlemagne , William of Orange , Washington , or Lincoln . He is the statesman , the stem . By him unities are felt , grasped , and formulated ; around him society coheres ; his thought constitutes an atmosphere , a national spirit , that pervades men . He is nature 's king , ruler , or head . Around him lesser statesmen cohere , as the branches cohere about the trunk ; and so society is formed down to its last organ , the individual citizen , whose fruition in the direction of life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness is the object of the whole structure . Thus throughout the organic world nature specializes and differentiates her organs , and by this method builds her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race through her stem Abraham , a language through her stem Dante . She creates the great republic through her stem Washington , restores it through her stem Lincoln ; yes , and even far down into the lower unities does she work still upon this plan , creating commerce through merchant princes , business through great men of business , industry through inventive and commanding men of industry . In all departments she carries forward her developments of mankind , upon that plan of which the solar system itself is the type , by a central organ and dependent organs . Equality of interests is her idea . Her plan is as much concerned for the benefit of the feeblest organ as that of the greatest . In fact , it is for the last and feeblest organ , the tender blossom of the spring , that she creates the whole , and to that purpose she severely subordinates the whole , consuming by her fires the trunk that will not minister its ener gies to the leaf and fruit . But equality of function , organic structure , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her trees all trunks , or her solar system all suns , or a body all head . Her irregularities are vast , but wondrously balanced ; the organ that rules in one capacity serves in another . But against sameness she absolutely revolts . Now from this standpoint it is possible to see that social development is not a mere struggle between the " Haves and " Have Nots , " with no forces to settle the question but the desire of liberty in one class , and the sympathy for that desire in another . As a matter of fact , social development consists in a progressive adjustment of interaction between the stem and the branches , between nature 's ruler and his subjects , in which process we are continually learning , under the pressure of necessity , the great laws that govern it . Take , for example , the political world . First of all came the necessity for a stem about which society might cohere ; nay , a stem with force enough to compel cohesion , - when , as Carlyle says , wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Be thou our acknowledged strongest , our king ; " king , or K*Iniq , meaning simply the man who is able , the man with energy strong enough and bold enough and rough enough to hold society together . That is the first grim primal necessity , a stem . Then came - for no stem can penetrate alone the varying needs of society - the branches , or ruling class , of the same material as the king . In the interaction that follows , this crude type of sovereignty , having vast physical force but small moral , sacrifices the interests of the dependent class , forgets nature 's eternal equality , and tramples on her inalienable rights . The subject rebels against this , but not alone , for nature stands by his side with poverty and famine and disease , solemnly averring that faithfulness to the interests of the feeblest subject is a thing that she will re // quire at the hands of every one of her rulers . Then , as the process of interaction has gone on under the pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruler , because these were in clear excess of his organic function and trespassed upon the interests that he was ordained to serve . The limitation of kingly power thus secured has been vested in the form of a charter or constitution . Then , to support the rights of the constitution , there has been developed the parliament , an assembly of the governing classes , to represent the interests of the realm . Parliament itself has then grown into a constitutional organ of government , holding in its hands the money power of the nation , so checking still more the tendency to insubordination on the part of the ruler . Following this has come the lower house . The intelligent and powerful middle class , the kings of industry and commerce , finding themselves not fully represented by hereditary legislation , assumed the function already inherent in them , and declared that those who created the wealth should be represented in the disposal of it . In this way there came to be a house of commons , or representatives , and a body of electors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems evident that there must be a wider representation of interest . At first this new organ of the electorate is confined to the business of selecting members of the lower house , the organs of government being determined by heredity . Finally , however , under the pressure of environment , the defects of heredity appear , and the question arises , Why should not this new organ , the electoral body , take the place of heredity ? So the popular electorate becomes at last the final source of government . Thus the whole process , which at a hasty glance seems to be a mere struggle for liberty , is , from the true point of view , a series of actions and reactions by which nature has been developing an organic political structure . Society has really been following the same process of growth as a tree . At first there was only the stem , with one or two subsidiary branches ; all else was inorganic . But as the nation has developed , a vital reciprocity has opened up throughout its structure . Each atom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political vitality have been widely distributed , until every genuine interest of manhood is represented by an organ that can in some way control the centre of vitality . Clearly , the progress has been from inorganic unity to organic unity , liberty being a condition of the latter . Parallel with this process and equally essential to liberty has been the differentiation of the political stein organ from those of religion , education , and industry . The fact has been revealed that in each of these great social formations nature operates precisely as she does in the political realm . The religious side of this truth was first brought out by Jesus in his claim to spiritual headship , while at the same time he distinctly disavowed all interference with temporal authorities . Since his day experience has shown that the religious and the political spheres both have their respective sovereignty , and that while they are interdependent , they are best developed without interference . The same is true of the industrial and the educational . Political government can at best only help these great social forces by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the law of their development is not intermeddled with . The essential tiling in every department of the nation 's life is that the creative stem , man , should have free chance for development . The freer nature is , the larger and grander the personalities she will develop , and these personalities are the stems of all social growth . The result has not , of course , been reached without much experiment , much governmental persecution of preachers , teachers , and newspapers , and much arbitrary crushing of institutions generally ; as the // outcome of it all , a sufficient experience of the unprofitableness of such attempts , and a verdict that the above-mentioned social forces may , with small protection , be trusted to take care of themselves . This at least is Anglo-Saxon experience , and is our reason for holding that government should be reduced to the minimum practicable point . Apropos of this point , as we look at history we see that it is only in connection with the AngloSaxon race that this evolution of government has steadily progressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been more susceptible to the organic method . He has absorbed its features ; they have become a national characteristic , with salient traits , such as the love of justice , or , in other words , of what is due to the different organisms of the nation , and law-abidiugness , or an inherent clinging to our national institutions . Probably one great secret of the Anglo-Saxon 's susceptibility to nature 's method has been the fact that in England and Scotland the spiritual stems have been strong . Religious leaders are often far more f ormal than spiritual , but from Wycliffe to Cromwell , and from Cromwell to Wesley , there have always been great spiritual types in England , - formative men who have stamped their impress upon the national character , who have generated an atmosphere of spirituality and created spiritual ideals . As a result , the masses of English and American people have been more penetrated than others with the sense of spiritual values and laws . The subjective has been with them a mighty force . The Puritan held the external conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcus Aurelius was more philosophic concerning outward f ortune . But with the Puritan it was more than a philosophy ; it was a passion , and it extended to the humblest classes . Indeed , he was above all things law-abiding towa*rd the spiritual realm ; the great thing with him was , not the land tenure , hut the man tenure . He held himself a steward and servant of God : he could therefore tolerate no paternalism in government ; no power but God could be allowed to dictate to his conscience . Before such a stern and lofty idealism pope and prelate must needs give way ; even industrialism must be left free to God 's steward . Thus tbe Anglo-Saxon has been the pith of the tree of liberty . His character has been the life of the organism . He has been inseparable from it , and it from him . This is the structure on which liberty has grown . The founda-* tion of our freedom lies in the willingness of an Anglo-Saxon minority to submit to the majority ; this is the cohesive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yawn before us . The AngloSaxon does not fear the triumph of the opposite party , because he knows it to have the same law-abiding characteristics as himself , and likewise because he knows that it will not attempt to rule except through the well-defined organism of government , which insures the protection of rights . The moment a party majority gives evidence of lacking in Anglo-Saxon characteristics , he begins to be anxious . He no longer thinks the government organism a sufficient protection . He trembles lest the official patronage should , in the hands of an unAmerican majority , pervert the goverm*-ment into a mechanism of tyranny . His fears have been justified ; it is precisely what has happened . Free institutions , deprived of that type of life which is their sap and strength , have shown themselves capable of becoming a harborage of the worst political vermin . To sum up matters , the question of humanity is the question of an organism . Nature is sternly coercive ; if we give away her organisms , she will make us cultivate them again in tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through type , and it is the type , the ever evolving type , on which she is bent ; for that everything else must 1895.1 23 // wait . To it she sacrifices not only the single life , but , if nece*sary , multitudes of lives , not because she is unmerciful , but because her mercy is in the type . Therefore she is patient . She counts not the age of slavery too long if through it she may evolve an Epictetus , and crucifixion not too dark a tragedy if through it she may bring forth her Christ ; for by her Epictetus , and yet more by her Christ , does she give character to her lives , and on the stem of character she builds the organic nation , with its wealth , liberty , and happiness . Now it is this sacrifice of the life to the type against which the animal in us rebels . Nature exalts the type above the life ; she exalts the subjective condition of happiness above the objective . Animalism has exactly the opposite creed : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards ; it values the objective condition above the subjective . In its impatience it can not wait for the type ; it insists on having the outward circumstances first . This is the rot of nations ; it destroys the ethical manhood , which is the backbone of every free nationality . This creed appears in the business man , whose ideals are sensuous , who cares more for wealth than for citizenship , who refuses to see that his money makes him the organ of the state and the steward of humanity . He is the original generator of the anti-national spirit ; he first spreads the sentiment that the life is worth more than the type . It is not the colossal fortunes that hurt us , but the brutalizing creed which they too often illustrate , that the external is worth more than the inward . It is the impious prostitution of wealth from nature 's purpose ; it is the lie that a rich man utters when he parades as though money actually exalted him above his fellows . For outward circumstances can not of themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that make the real inequality ; it is character that builds the awful heights . The gulf between Dives and Lazarus is fixed at last , not by fortune , but by Dives himself , who says by his ostentation , " See how far above that poor wretch I am ; we do not belong to the same class . " But nature is pitiful , and when the great gulf becomes at last fixed it turns out to be Dives who is at the bottom of it . The spectacle of to - day is the creative facility of wealth ; and when rich people choose to create such a society for the world 's edification as is depicted in Mr. Warner 's Golden House , it is not wonderful that hasty human nature revolts with a spark of divine indignation , and hankers to pitch the whole edifice into Tartarus ; nor can it be wondered at if even Christian philanthropists , when they contrast such a spectacle with the awful poverty at its gates , should avow that wealth is the devil , and that our only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when we see , as we often do , a vast fortune in the hands of a noble creative man like Plutarch , or William of Orange , or Howard the philanthropist , we then understand that wealth is not only a bond of brotherhood , but the condition for the development of a great type of humanity . Such types are the progenitors of a noble national life . Deny to the grand personality its office , and you destroy the type . Contract the womb , and you spoil the child . Nor would it do any good to abolish the forms of wealth ; the lie would remain . It is animalism that creates the illusiou ; it is this that is undoing us ; it is anti-national because it is anti-ethical ; unable to see the value of the type , it mistakes the organism for a machine , and gives birth to machine politics . Occupying a false view point , it is always onesided . In its eagerness for liberty , it insists that every person shall have the ballot : it is blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possession of the ballot as on its being in libertyloving and intelligent hands ; that the electorate is in reality an organ of the government ; and that the essential characteristic // of an organ is that it should be filled by the true type of vitality . Thousands of men have risen to power , enjoyed all the liberty they wanted , and changed the course of the world , without having the right of suffrage . Its possession by every man is not essential to the pursuit of life , liberty , and happiness on his part , but its being held by trustworthy men , who are themselves true types of the nationality , is absolutely essential to everybody 's welfare . Again , in its eagerness after popular sovereignty , this one-sided humanity has attempted to exalt one organ of the state at the expense of another ; it has made the elector everything , the legislator nothing ; it has stripped from the statesman all statesmanship , making him a public servant in the lowest sense of the word , and developing in him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed servants of the people . They have ceased to be stems . In an hour of deadly peril like the Chicago strike , they wait to see which way the popular tide will turn . They degrade the national organ to which they belong . Destitute of the type of sovereignty , it ceases to be sovereign . Apropos of this is the notion that one man is as good as another , and that every man should have his turn at governing . Such an idea is not business ; it would be death to a bank or a mercantile house to conduct it on such principles , and it is death to the nation ; it is casting contempt on the type ; it is emptying the organ of its life blood , and fearfully has it told upon us . Already are we a spectacle to foreigners ; they say well that we have no respect for our own institutions , no faith in the people . Nor is it strange , since we have reversed nature 's methods , so careless of the type we seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly an anti-American spirit , the opposite of that breathed forth by Washington and Lincoln ; but it is the humanitarian aspect of this animalism that is most to be dreaded , for here the illusion is worst . Folly is transformed into an angel of light , yet , fool-like , it can see but a single interest . Formerly its eye was on the negro , its single aim to secure his liberty against his oppressor ; now it is fixed on the workingman , but it is on one kind of workingman , and on one stage of his development . In the first stage , he must be so protected that he can let the labor of his hands for the largest price ; he must be free to exercise generosity as he sees fit ; nor must he be compelled to help his fellow-laborer , but as soon as he has a room in his tenement to let he becomes a landlord , and now this sentimental humanitarianism would dictate to him how he shall let , and when he must be generous . Still further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes a capitalist , there must be a law to dictate to him the terms on which he shall let his capital , and to arbitrate between him and his employee . This one - sidedness is illustrated by the savage attacks upon Mr. Pullman . From the stage of labor he had risen to the stage of capital ; he had become a stem of industry ; into his hands hundreds of men put their savings , many of these stockholders being people of small means . Mr. Pullman was their trustee ; the surplus of his company was their guarantee , it stood instead of a mortgage bond ; nothing could be more desirable for the country than his reciprocity between the small savings and the industrial stem . Now the singular thjng is that no one thought of attacking Mr. Pullman for want of generosity in the use of his private fortune , but there has been a universal howl against him for not being generous with other people 's money ; he should have reduced his rents though it cut into his surplus , invalidated the security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dollars to his stockholders . Not only should he have been generous at other people 's expense , but he should have called it justice . Not // only ought he to have done it , but he should have been compelled by government to do it , and for want of governmental interference he should be compelled by anarchy to do it . Actually , the popular attitude towards these small investors has been simply this : Go to Canada with your small savings ; you have no rights in the case which we are bound to respect . This is a duel between riches and poverty . The intermediate stages are " beyond the pale . " Such an attitude is not only antiAmerican , and opposed to the old Anglo-Saxon bill of rights , but it is essentially anarchical . Beside , the question how much is due to the workingman is not one of abstract justice , - no man gets his moral deserts in the industrial world ; the question what a man 's work is worth depends on how essential it is to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial justice ; and taking it as the criterion , it is by no means certain that the workingman is not receiving more than his share . In that case , the question of help for him becomes one of generosity , not of justice , precisely as it would in the case of a poor author or physician . On the other hand , if we throw away the organism , in behalf of the American workingman , and attempt to give him his moral valuation or his worth as a brother man , we are equally bound by the principles of humanity to do it for the Chinese or " the poor authors . " Doubtless the industrial organism is a slow instrument for distributing wealth , but it has the merit of being nature 's institution ; it develops the type , the man of business genius , who is nature 's stem and wealth creator ; furthermore , it coerces all men in the direction of industry , economy , and skill . True , it is hard on the shiftless and the incapable , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the organism which develops type and stem . Certainly there is great suffering , but the sooner we realize it is to be relieved by existing forces , and throw the responsibility upon them , the better . Organized benevolence will then become what it has never been before ; and that brings us to the question which anti-Americanism has forced upon us . Shall we develop the present forces , or shall we throw away nature 's plan and give up the Anglo-Saxon organic nation in which law is reduced to a minimum ? Shall we abandon free benevolence , and go back to paternalism and militarism ? It takes genius to create a first-class illusion , and socialism has of late had genius on its side . We read Mr. Bellamy 's Looking Backward , and feel the same drawing to his Utopia that we felt towards the patriarchal institution when we read the first volume of Uncle Tom 's Cabin . The devil really is not in it ; no bill of rights seems necessary ; the institution produces nothing but Uncle Toms , little Evas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we realize how entirely this benign aspect was due to the concentration of light on a certain negative type of character . It must be the type , after all , even in socialism , that decides our happiness . Some one ought to write a second volume of Looking Backward , in which Mr. Bellaniy 's colorless officials should take the background , and thepolitiealorgans of the industrial army should appear , with Mr. Debs as commander in chief . The opening chapter should deal with the last Anglo-Saxon struggle for liberty against the resistless patronage of the socialistic party which held in its hands all the railroads , telegraph lines , and mines in the country . It should describe the immensely preponderating foreign element in this new party ; the loss of confidence on the part of the Anglo-Saxon minority ; the resulting anarchy and bloodshed ; the final seizure of the government by trades unions , under the leadership of some crafty " boss . " It should go on to describe the political structure of the new nation : how , in the new paternalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place of the papacy , dictating to men 's consciences when they should be generous ; how it soon became necessary that religion and education should come under the paternal system , since the power which controls altruism must likewise control the social forces that lead to it ; how one step toward tyranny led to another ; how tyranny inevitably tended toward autocracy ; and how at last that same single , forcible , shrewd head of the CLesar once more appeared on the throne of the temporal and spiritual world , and so the " look backward " was complete . There should be a chapter , too , on the personal aspects of the inorganic Altruria : how men sank into mere automata ; how personal interest in work died out because everything fell into a dead sameness ; how individuality ceased because no man had any breadth of field in which to exercise it ; how creative power failed for want of property ; how men shirked because they were doing government work ; how manliness perished because every man was taken care of by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types failed ; how character became inert because nature ceased to be coercive ; how altruism itself at last collapsed because it was enforced , and generosity died out because the secret of generosity is liberty . I do not say that Altruria is impossible ; on the contrary , I believe it is coming ; what I do say is that the type must come first , and we are very far yet from the type . We have not yet an electorate pure enough or intelligent enough to be trusted with the first step towards socialism , the control of the railroads ; our political stems , our Murphys and our Debses , have still too much murderous ambition . Nor do I believe that Altruria , when it comes , will be a reversal of the order of evolution , and a return to the inorganic nationality . I believe it will come , not through paternalism and militarism , but through larger liberty , through wider spheres of personal development , through greater individual wealth and nobler creative types . But the immediate peril of socialism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It creates a fiery illusion by putting things in a false light . This is dangerous because we are confronted with an enormous mass of men who do not think things out for themselves . They are organized into trades unions . These socialistic theories are to them what the loose ideas of the aristocratic and literary reformers were to the Jacobin clubs of France before the Revolution . But there is this vast difference in the times : liberty with us has already gone further than the structure of the organism can safely permit ; to stretch it yet more means the loss of it . Yet these trades unions are wild for advance ; they are a vast disciplined army , ready at a moment 's notice to precipitate a war . They are inflamed by their false creed ; they fancy themselves grievously wronged . Even if a wrong exists but in fancy , no one will sit quietly under it , nor will they . They are determined to right themselves , peaceably if possible , but should it require force they do not mean to fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chicago strike revealed , they prefer it to failure , and their madness at the President 's interference reveals the direction in which they mean to move . They propose to have presidents and governors who agree with them . As John Adams said when he beard the guns at Lexington , " It is a glorious morning . " Nature has brought us into a place where we must lose our liberty or develop a new citizenship . That new citizenship has already appeared , thank God . It has had its proto-martyr . It now has , in New York city at least , its determined leader . Men are rallying around it ; they are being recruited from all nationalities ; it is a unifying hour ; the great battle of liberty has at last come . There is genuine goodness in the country , but it has been nebulous and inert ; it has been fiddling while Rome burnt ; it // is now awaking to facts . The call is for a party of the republic which , like Robert Ross , shall hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like his , Perish all lesser interests , if we can have a purified nation . Good will it be for us if we know in this our day the things that pertain to our peace , for nature will not step aside out of her course from deference even to the greatest of her republics ; she has one law for them all , the law of the organism ; nor does she ever suffer the national pyramid to stand upon its apex . The unintelligent do not rule the intelligent for long . Of two evils , men always choose the less . They fly from anarchy . Society must cohere , and it always coheres about a man who is able . Personality must come to the front . If there is enough of the national stock with which to furnish her organs , nature will have a republic as she did in Rome . If the stock runs short , she contracts her organs , and men pass under the tutelage of an empire . It is the organic that is possible . Whatever we have developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There sat in the imperial seat of Rome , long after the republic had passed away , a type of the old stock , whom nature had preserved for her beneficent work . For him the republic had existed and passed . Of him Frederick Maurice says : " Marcus Aurelius wrote in Greek , he dwelt in all the effeminacy of a court , but he desired above all things else , he says , to be a male and a Roman . " " What he meant by that we can understand by his acts , and also from his thoughts ; for he is one of those who lets us into the secrets of his life ; who has told us what he was striving to be , and what helps and hindrances he met with in his strivings . He had evidently taken account of the causes which had made the Roman the ruler of the world ; he had seen that self-restraint had been one main secret of his power ; that reverence for the relations in which he found himself had been another ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only security for the fidelity of the citizen . His meditations exhibit a man who is striving by all means that he knows of to recover something which he feels has departed or is departing from his country , from those who are governing in it , from those who are serving in it . " Wonderful is this care of nature for the type ; its own prolonged struggle , too , for survival , though reduced to a single man , a solitary headland against the tide of anarchy , the sole governmental organ of that state which could no longer be a republic , not even a limited monarchy , because there was not enough of the governing type left out of which to make constitutional organs . Years before , the transcendent intellect of Julius Cmesar had grasped the situation and foreseen the only possible form of government left for Rome . Two organs alone were possible , an imperator and an army . This was the fact that the eloquent Cicero and the noble Brutus were not clear-headed enough to see . They thought they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the battle of Pharsalia showed the irreversibility of organic law . The Roman stock was gone , the live tissue dead , and the Roman constitution which had conquered the world fell like a rotten trunk in a storm.
