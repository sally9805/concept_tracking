txt THE attentive readers of missionary intelligence , especially of that conveyed through the Missionary Herald , will recollect that some fifteen years ago , a mission was commenced by the American Board among the Armenians residing in Constantinople and other cities of the Levant . Rev. H. G. 0 . Dwight , who in connection with IRev . Eli Smith , of the Syrian Mission , had visited Armenia proper , and the Armenian churches and communities scattered over the east , was appointed to labor among that interesting people in the metropolis of the Turkish empire . " Armenia is an inland country at the eastern extremity of Asia Minor , lying at short distances from the Mediterranean on the southwest , the Black sea on the northwest , the Caspian on the northeast , and at a much greater distance from the Persian gulf on the southeast . Its western boundary is not far from six hundred miles east of Constantinople. *** It * Researches of Smith and Dwight in Armenia .

Ararat , from which this country has been appropriately called " the second cradle of the human race , whence were scattered over the face of the earth , the first progenitors of every nation " The Armenians , after various political changes , have at length ceased to exist as a distinct nation . Their country has been divided among their more powerful neighbors . They are scattered in almost every part of Turkey and Persia , and are found also in India , and in Russia . Their number is estimated at about 3,000 ,  - -  000 in the Turkish empire . At least 150,000 are to be found in Constantinople and its suburbs . There are several thousands also at debted for many of the facts stated in the following pages . See also Southgate 's narrative , the Missionary Herald , and the occasional publications of Mr. Dwight and other missionaries in the Levant . // Broosa , Smyrna , Trebizond , and Erzeroom in ancient Armenia , At each of these points , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important is that at Constantinople . The Armenians have been familiarly styled the Yankees of the east . Mr. Southgate says of them , * " this singularly industrious and frugal people are to be found in all parts of the empire ; from the Caucassus to the Nile , and from the Danube to the Persian gulf ; and every where they are the same , with those variations only which differences of occul ) ation , of climate , and of local government tend to produce . Simple and industrious ; quietly hearing the yoke which the Greeks are so restive under ; given to the honest and useful arts of life seekin0 gain wherever they are , and , for the most part carefully preserving it ; docile and sober-minded ; they are much more akin to the Turks , both in character and manners , than any other of the Christian races . Driven out from their patrimony , or enticed from their ancient lands by the desire of gain , they are to be seen in almost every district and every city ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syria , in Egypt , in rfurkey , in Europe , in the provinces north of the Danube , and beyond the boundaries of the empire , in Austria , Russia , Persia and Hindostan . Every where in Turkey they are the great producers , whether they till the soil or engage in traffick . They are the bone and sinew of the land-at once its most useful and most peaceful citizens . Were they removed from Turkey , the wealth and productive power of the country would be incalculably diminished . " In Constantinople the Armenians are engaged in the most lucrative trades . Many of them are men of wealth , the bankers and brokers not * Visit to the Syrian church , Pp. 44,45. only for the community at large , but also for the government . They are a trafficking people ; and are often intelligent and influential . According to tradition , the Gospel was first preached in Armenia by Thaddeus , one of the seventy , soon after the death of Christ ; and towards the close of the third century , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country having been overrun by Persia , Christianity was well nigh exterminated by the bloody persecutions instigated by the Magi . At the same time the Armenians , by rejecting , through their synod , the decisions of the council of Chalcedon , were separted from the communion of the Greek church . They are still regarded as heretics and schismatics by the Greek and Romish churches , though they would not suffer probably from a comparison with either . They have , however , the form of godliness without its power . The Bible is to them a dead letter . It is not indeed a prohibited book ; it is read in the churches ; but in , what is now an almost unknown tongue , and with little exposition of its meaning . The people know nothing of it experimentally . Christianity , in its doctrines , spirit and ordinances , is completely perverted and degraded . The ceremony of the mass is celebrated in the churches , with much the same pomp and idolatry as in the Roman Catholic churches of Europe . Confession of sins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice is less odious in some respects than in the church of Rome. * Prayers are of- * There is no confessional in the Armenian churches ; the priest sits cross-legged upon the floor , and the penitent lays his or her head upon his bosom or in his lap ! Absolution is granted professedly without remuneration . The prescribed forms of confession , infamous as they are , are pure in comparison with those to be found in Roman Catholic manuals . Rome will never lose her preCminence among apostate churches , as the mother of harlots. // fered through the medium of ' the Virgin Mary and other saints , images and pictures of whom are corninonly , though not uniformly , found in the churches . Baptism is regarded as cleansing the soul from original sin , while spiritual regeneration is an unknown and unintelligible thing . Prayers are offered for the dead , though the Romish doctrine of purgatory is denied . The seven sacraments of the Romish church , with some modifications , are observed by the Armenians , as also fasts and feasts innumerable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relates to the nature of Christ . The Armenian church , like all the churches of the east , is hierarchical in its constitution . Its spiritual head , who resides at Echmiadzin , is called Catholicos ( a bishop whose see is unlimited ; ) he ordains bishops and consecrates the sacred oil . The patriarchs , of whom there are two , one at Constantinople and the other at Jerusalem , are not strictly ecclesiastical dignitaries . Th*ir rank in the church is merely that of bishops . Their office was created by Mohammedan authority , for civil purposes . There are nine grades in the Armenian hierarchy , viz , the Catholicos , bishops , priests , deacons , sub-deacons , porters , readers , exorcists and candle-lighters ! - at once a proof and a cause of the degeneracy of the church . It must be said , however , in favor of the Armenian clergy , that they are far superior to the Romish clergy in morals . This is mainly owing to the fact , that every officiating priest not only may be , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordination . The vartal3eds are unmarried , but they are , strictly speaking , not priests , hut monastic preachers . The bishops are taken from their ranks , and not from the priests , so that a candidate for orders must make his choice for life between matrimony and a bishopric . Paul was more liberal in his allowance to Timothy , ( 1 Epis. iii , 2 . ) Such in native character , and in social , political and ecclesiastical relations , are the people among whom the Missionaries of the American Board have been laboring for several years , with various success . Notwithstanding the prevailing ignorance and corruption of the Armenian church , there have been and still are men of vital piety in its bosom ; some of whom are even worthy of the name of Reformers . Before they were made the subjects of missionary labor , a spirit of inquiry after truth was awakened amonb them , the minds of several we e enlightened by the Spirit , and the work of evangelical reformation was actually begun . The Missionaries of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and institutions of the people . They aimed simply and solely , at the conversion of individuals to a pure evangelical faith . Fl*ey contemplated no secession , no distinct organization on the part of those who might be renewed . Though they foresaw that evangelical religion could not thrive under such a mass of superstition , they resolved to labor for the personal instruction and salvation of the Armenians , and to leave their ecclesiastical relations to be determined by themselves , under the direction of Providence . In so doing they followed closely the example of the Apostles , who did not aim primarily to reform or to demolish systems , hut to save men ,  --  whether Jews or Gentiles . Even when in 1839 , an intelligent and evangelical priest declared it to be his conviction , that all true converts should withdraw from the communion of the Armenian church , the missionaries did not advise to such a step . " We came here , " said they , " not to form a sect , but to preach the Gospel , and leave that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is // to endeavor to direct the attention of the people to the vast concerns of the soul , and to leave the Gospel unmixed with human ingredients , to make its own way and accomplish its own work . A separation ought not to be forced , although it will , without doubt , ultimately take place , for light and darkness can not always exist together . And least of all are we , who are foreigners , the men to clear away the difficulties by which this subject is encompassed , and impose ecclesiastical forms and rules upon the people . " So far then from manifesting a disposition to disturb the ecclesiastical relations of the Armenians , our missionaries have studiously refrained from exerting the least positive influence for such a purpose . Their course has been approved of God . By personal conversation , hy the distribution of tracts and books , by instruction through the medium of schools , and of little circles for reading and expounding the Scriptures , individuals have , from time to time , been made acquainted with evangelical views of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these have been men of wealth and influence , some from the different orders of ecelesiastics . As their number has increased , suspicion and jealousy have been awakened against them ; they have fallen under the ban of the patriarch , and occasionally have been imprisoned or sent into exile under false pretences . This was the case with Liohannes , whose name is so familiar to our ears . In 1839 , the labors of the American missionaries at Broosa and Constantinople , were seriously interrupted by the opposition of the patriarch and those in his interest . Still the work of regeneration has gone steadily forward . For two or three years past , its progress has been wonderful ; it has spread from the cities far into the interior , and hundreds of Armenians , of every grade and from every quarter , have been reckoned as faithful converts or devout inquirers . The reports of our missionaries have been one continuous narrative of the revival of evangelical religion among the people . The converts , or " Gospelmen , " as they are called , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missionaries , for prayer and instruction . As yet , however , they have not formally withdrawn from the Armenian church , but have simply refused , like the Puritans of England , to conform to its corrupt and idolatrous usages . Of course , upon the principles already stated , such a state of things could not long exist without opposition . It was a bona Jide reformation , and the patriarch , like the Pope in Luther 's time , employed every artifice to put it down . Individuals here and there were arrested upon some frivolous pretext , and fined or imprisoned ; one was decoyed and confined in a mad-house ; domestic persecutions were instigated ; burial was refused to the bodies of deceased friends of the reform  --  a matter of special odium in the east . These measures not sufficing , the patriarch ventured into the field of argument , and employed a skillful casuist , a sort of Dr. Eck , to defend the tenets of the church against these gospel-men , ' ' in a series of public disputations . But here again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of truth , he had recourse to the more natural weapons of intimidation , proscription and force . He publicly anathematized all who were of this new way of thinking . His second and general anathema , was in the following words " Be it known to the pious flock of our church in the metropolis : That on the last Sabbath the decree of anathema was read for the information of the pious ; but some of the people understood it as referring only to the cursed nonentity Vertannes , falsely called priest , and not also to the others . Wherefore we have considered it necessary to-day to repeat it , and // to inform you that not only that cursed one ( Vertannes ) , but also all that are of his sentiments , deceived and blasphemers against the church , and followers of the corrupt new sect , are accursed and excommunicated and anathematized by God and by all his saints and by us . " Wherefore , whoever has a son that is such a one , or a brother ora partner ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in making money , or has intercourse with him as a friend , or does business with him , let such persons know that they are nourishing a venomous serpent in their houses , which will one day injure them with its deadly poison , and they will lose their souls . Such persons give bread to Judas . Such persons are enemies of the holy faith of Christianity , and destroyers of the holy orthodox church of the Armenians , and a disgrace to the whole nation . Wherefore , their houses and shops also are accursed ; and whoever goes to visit them , we shall learn and make them public in the holy church by terrible anathema . For in these days there are some of the poisoned individuals who have become acquainted with their awful error , and having undertaken the necessary penance , and with repentance they confess their sin ; whotn God forgives through the intercession of the holy church and our holy church also receives . On which account we now wait that we may receive all who will return ; and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , receiving bodily support or monthly wages , deny their church , and , like Judas , betray Christ through love of money ; these also by their names and places , we shall publish to all our church , far and near , with terrible anathema . " Wherefore , by this my letter of notification , I again command and warn the piens to keep aloof from these wicked deceivers ; for the love of the holy faith of Jesus Christ , the glory of the holy church ; and the interest and advantage of your own souls . " Farewell . And the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen . remains unbroken- An illustration of this has just been furnished at the Antrim assizes , in Ireland . Suit was brought against a IRoman Catholic priest , by a parishioner , for damages done to his business by a public excommunication . The plaintiff was a poor man , a miller by trade , who became enlightened by the Scriptures , and began to distribute them among his neighbors . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to " put man , woman and child from speaking to him , " so that " they would not walk on the same side of the road with him " ; that " he would not get a single hand 's turn to do , " hut would find his mill " as dry as the road . " At length the curse was uttered ; a bell was rung , candles were extinguished , a book was shut ; the congregation was in a great state of agitation , and several females fainted during the awful ceremony . The predicted consequences of the malediction were fully realized . The plaintiff was completely ruined . rrhe jury gave him ? 70 damages . What must have been his fate , if the civil and ecclesiastical authorities had been united Similar effects have followed the denunciations of the Armenian patriarch . The particulars of this l ) ersecution may be ascertained from the appeal of the American mis sionaries , which has been extensive ly published in this country , and from the Missionary Herald for June . The anathematized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // extract from one of Mr. Dwight 's letters , will show to what various annoyances the converts are subjected . " There must have been from twentyfive to thirty of our evangelical brethren and sisters among the Armenians , anathematized by name up to the present date . The influence of the foreign ambassadors seems , at present , to he barely sufficient to prevent the exile of these brethren . Every species of oppression is resorted to by the patriarch and his party , without the least scruple or pity ; and it is evidently the want of power only that prevents them from cutting off heads . Our brethren have never been so sorely tried before . They can not pass through the streets without being abused by all kinds of filthy language , spit upon , and stoned . Three of them are now in prison , and unless the Lord checks the rage of the enemies in some way , others will shortly he confined . Whatever trade a man has , if he is found to be evangelical , he is at once ordered either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . " It so happens that almost every trade in the city is so in the hands of Armenians , that it is exceedingly easy for the patriarch to carry his oppressive and unrighteous schemes into execution . The three brethren in prison are an example of what he can do . They are all of the watchmaker 's trade . The heads of this trade ( as of almost every other ) being Armenians and the patriarch 's men , refuse to stand as surety for anathematized Armenians before the Turkish government . But the law requires that every person shall have a surety from among his fellow tradesi ien . Our evangelical Armenians might , according to law , be surety for each other ; but the patriarch has got the Turkish head of the department so into his hands , that he will not accept one evangelical man as surety for another . The consequence is that three of our brethren , as I have said , have been thrown into prison for want of sureties . If it can be made out that this is according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these persecuted men from this injustice , 1 see not why we are not to expect that , within a few days or weeks at most , all who remain firm to their evangelical principles , will be thrown into prison for a similar reason ; and , in fact , for a similar reason they may be sent into ban ishnuent . ' In order to understand the precise position of affltirs , it will be necessary to look for a moment at the political constitution of Turkey . For full information on this impor tant point , we refer our readers to the able and lucid article upon " Toleration in Turkey , " from the pen of Rev. Eli Smith , in the Bibliotheca Sacra for May . The state of society in Turkey is essentially feudal . The Turks have not attempted to merge the nations they have conquered , into one ; but have governed each mainly , through its own internal organization , provided it was already existing in unity under an acknowledged head . Thus the Greek community is represented in the person of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers . The Spanish Jews are governed through their chief Rabbi . The seat of the Armenian Catholicos being remote from the capital , a bishop was constituted the civil head of the community at Constantinople , with the title of palriarch . The circumstance that these are ecclesiastical officers , is wholly accidental ; in the view of the government they are municipal officers merely , the heads of civil communities , not of religious sects . The laws of Turkey recognize any community of citizens , which can present itself in a compact organization under its proper civil head , irrespective of its religious tenets . Toleration is not limited to the existing sects . A new sect of papal Armenians has been recently acknowledged as a disti*ict community , and is governed through a patriarch appointed by the sultan , though he is not their ecclesiastical head . All foreign religions are regarded by Mohammedans , only as so many fbrms of infidelity , and are placed upon the same footing . " A Christian transgresses no law of Mohammedanism , therefore , by going from one acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shall pay his taxes and perform his duties as a citizen , in order to he tolerated in his faith . For convenience he must be classed somewhere , for the government deals // with its non-Mohammedan subjects , as communities , tribes , or nations , and not as individuals . Protestants do not need therefore an ecclesiastical head , in order to exist as a distinct body in Turkey . The virtual establishment of any one sect , could not fail to be detrimental to spiritual religion , and even to religious freedom . It is for the sultan to recognize them , through whatever civil magistrate he may see fit to designate . There is more toleration in Turkey than in many countries of Europe , though it is not exercised upon the most enlightened and liberal grounds . The present persecution of the Armenians , therefore , does not emanate from the Turkish authorities . It is not a civil , but an ecclesiastical persecution . The bigotry of the patriarch leads him to abuse his authority , as a magistrate over the Armenian community ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecclesiastical purposes . He has , indeed , the power to scourge and imprison members of his own com* rnunioh , just as the Jewish Sanhedrim had under the Romans . Formerly , he could easily procure their banishment ; but he has no power over their lives . Like the Sanhedrim , he can persecute for opinion 's sake , simply because the higher authorities will not intermeddle in such matters . They , like Gallio , will not trouble themselves about religious differences , but leave each sect to settle its own disputes , so long as they do not threaten the government , nor disturb the public peace . Hence the patriarch , by the use of a little art , can act the part of an ecclesiastical despot , without interference from his superiors in office . He seems resolved to suppress the wide-spreading reformation among his people , by any means which his ingenuity can devise , or his power can execute . The intervention of the foreign ambassadors , and the respectful but firm remonstrance of the " Armenian readers of the Holy Gospel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foreign affairs , have checked the violence of his proceedings . The imprisoned brethren have been released ; but are not yet permitted to return to their shops and houses . More than thirty shops remain closed , because their owners will not subscribe the patriarch 's creed . It is to be feared , that the fiery trial of these Armenian converts is not yet over . A man of the disposition of the present patriarch , with his power and influence , can do much to oppress such an infant band , though they have done nothing contrary to the law . But deplorable as are the immediate effects of this persecution upon the sufferers , in some respects it will prove an invaluable blessing to them , and to the whole Christian world . It gives the world a fresh illustration of the power and vitality of the Christian religion . After long ages of darkness and corruption , the days of primitive Christianity are reviving in the East . That faith which has of late been tested only by works of love , is called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same faith as of old ; the same faith which baffled the persecutions of three centuries ; the same faith whose white-robed martyrs cry from beneath the altar , till their sacred number shall be filled ; a faith which the wheel has not broken , the dungeon has not buried , nor the fire consumed ; a faith which can suffer as well as triumph , and triumph most in suffering . The patience and firmness of these persecuted Armenians , and the readiness with which they sacrifice their all for Christ , bring out the vital power of the Gospel in strong contrast with the dead formalism around them . Mohammedans , Jews , Greeks , Papists , all see what the Gospel is , and what the Gospel can accomplish . Shall not they too who profess that // Gospel , be animated in their faith , and zeal , and devotion to Christ , by the example of these recent converts from superstition ? This persecution testifies moreover , to the importance and the success of our mission to the Armenians . It shows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the minds of the people , so that violence can not root it out . It brings to light a work of grace more genuine and more extensive than we had before supposed to exist . The drawing of the sword is but the signal that Christ is there doing his work . And when we consider the extensive commercial relations of the Armenians , and their natural adaptation for missionary labors , we can see one design of God in permitting this storm to arise ,  --  that like those " who were scattered abroad by the persecutions which arose about Stephen , " they may go " everywhere , preaching the word . " The *visdom of the general policy of our missionaries in the Levant , receives additional confirmation from this event . We see more strikingly than ever the need of a spiritual reformation among the Armenians . The Romish church has always made her need of reformation more apparent by her attempts to crush reformers ; for a church that can not bear light and discussion must need reform . The fires kindled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Inquisition , rendered the darkness and corruption of Rome more palpable and appalling . There are two widely different methods of acting upon the churches of the East , adopted by different Boards of Missions . One is that of courting an alliance with those churches ; receiving them under certain modifications , into fellowship as true churches of Christ ; receiving them by wholesale , through their ecclesiastical authorities , just as a politician buys up the votes of a club'or party through their lead ers ; and then aiming at a gradual , perhaps a mutual reformation , by the interchange of ecclesiastical favors . Mr. Southgate was sent upon a mission to " the bishops and other ecclesiastical authorities " of the Eastern churches . Said Bishop Griswold , in his instructions , " our great desire is to commence and to promote a friendly intercourse between the two branches ( Eastern and Western ) of the one Catholic and Apostolic church ; to impart to our brethren in that country any knowledge of the Scriptures and of the doctrines of Christ , which , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gladly to receive any such light from them. *** Our readers have not forgotten the gravely ludicrous proposal of another bishop , that a clerical deputatidn should be sent to the Eastern churches , to receive baptism and ordination ; and so to import a purer article of Apostolical succession , than can be obtained through the excommunicated church of England , or the non-juring bishops of Scotland . The whole plan of Mr. Southgate 's mission , is totally different from that of the missionaries of the American Board . He looks for a church by external marks , and aims to establish friendly relations between his own church and the churches of the East , on the basis of external conformity . For this purpose he persuaded a remnant of the last triennial convention towards the close of its session , that it was indispensable that he should be made a bishop . He says of the Syrian churches , that " they receive , without any exception , the first three general Councils of Nice , Constantinople , and Ephesus , and the several minor councils approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and use daily , the Nicene // creed , and acknowledge the Apostolic Constitutions and Canons . What more can we ask ? *** Just so he would endorse in the main , the Armenian church , and seek to hring it into fellowship with his own . He believes that to churchmen only the " work of restoring and strengthening those ( Eastern ) churches is committed , and they only are able to perform it . " Lie adds also , what is highly probable , that " they alone will fully appreciate the considerations which he has to present . " Now the fact is , that so far as Churchanity is concerned , those churches have a decided advantage over any fraternizing churchmen in this country . The Armenian church , so near the fountain head of " Apostolic constitutions , " has not only the " three orders " of the ministry , hut three times three , all duly constituted from the Catholicos to the candle-lighter ! As to the " doctrines of baptism and laying on of hands , " they hold these according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fasts they far exceed Mr. Southgate 's power of abstinence. * How much are such a people to he henefited hy those who put themselves into the same category , and acknowledge them to be a church by outward signs , though they have none of the Spirit of Christ ? How much will they be benefited by adopting any suggestions that are likely to he made from such a quarter ? Suppose that Mr. Southgate convinces them of the great impropriety of admitting any part of the congregation within the chancel , t how much wiser or better will they be ? What they need is , not reformation in externals as a church , hut reformation in heart as individuals ; regeneration by the truth and the Spirit of God . This is the theory of our missionaries . The reformation which they * Preface to Visit , &amp;c. , p. 9. t Visit , p. 205. 4 du . P. 49. contemplate is a work in the souls of individuals ; and as it progresses we see , as in Luther 's time , its natural result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forms . This persecution brings distinctly into view the fundamental obstruction to the propagation of the Gospel , viz. , the denial by civil or ecclesiastical authority of the right of private judgment in matters of religion . The very essence of persecution lies in the use of coercive measures against the rights of conscience . It does not consist in the severity of these measures , for there may be persec*ution by intimidation or other methods , without physical force . It is not the circumstance that such measures are directed against what is right in itself , for men may be persecuted who are in the wrong . It is not the mere imposition of restraint in matters of religion ; for a parent may often with propriety so restrain a child . It is not merely an exclusive spirit . A Protestant might refuse to take a Roman Catholic into his service without being illiberal ; but if he should do this in order to compel him to renounce his faith , to starve him out of it , he would be a persecutor . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in violation of the rights of concience , is persecution . This is the weapon of despotic governments , and of established systems of religion ; it is man's nature to wield it , and we must expect to encounter it in our attempts to spread the Gospel . A preliminary question in respect to the evangelization of the world is yet to be decided ; i. e. , whether men shall be controlled in matters of faith by reason or by force . The great battle for religious liberity is yet to be fought ; the moral strength of Christendom must he arrayed against every invasion of the rights of conscience . The idea of religious liberty , so fundamental in the missionary ent*irprise , // and which is yet to be the great idea of our age , has been but slowly developed . The reformers did not possess it . Even the Puritans did not fully grasp it , if we except him who does not need a statue , as he would not wear a crown ; whose truest , noblest title is the MANOliver Cromwell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea in its purity . God makes men strong by pressure ; he makes them great by heaping great trials and great responsibilities upon them . Persecution engenders freedom ; it evolves from the crucible of human thoughts and feelings and sufferings , the great principles of human rights . Men persecuted for opinion 's sake , have demanded liberty of conscience for themselves , till they were bound in turn to grant it to others . Roman Catholic journals in France , are crying out for religious freedom , since the expulsion of the Jesuits . The true doctrine of religious liberty has been developed in this country . Here we have , and we desire , no such thing as toleration ; for toleration implies despotismthe power to suppress . Protection , as the term is applied not to the guarding of personal rights , but to the supervision of the State over religious affairs , concedes the right of control . There is toleration in Great Britain , where Uissenters are all allowed to live by the side of an established church . There is freedom here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State . True liberty protects itself by the force of principle , by moral law . Now God has given us this boon , that we may give it to the world by example and by argument . This is our mission . The Christian Al . liance has undertaken to propagate this idea through the world ; to form a public sentiment against persecution , akin to that now every where existing against the slave trade . Public sentiment is beginning to control the world . It has made war despicable ; it is fast making slavery too odious to live . Victoria feels it ; Nicholas feels it ; Metternich feels it ; the Pope feels it. - There is not a sovereign of Europe who does not desire the good opinion of mankind ; who is not keenly sensitive to the voice of the press and of the people . Let , then , the people of Great Britain and of these United States rally around the standard of religious freedom for the world ; let them lift up the cry of indignation at every infringement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavens , and make every oppressor tremble as at the voice of God . The persecution among the Armenians , furnishes a fit occasion for such an expression of public sentiment . These Armenians are veritable Protestants , though they do not assume a name which is in special odium among their nation . They are Protestants in spirit , and are contending for the great principles of Protestantism . They are struggling for more than what the Greeks and Poles contended for , when their trials awakened a sympathy in American hearts , which the laws of nations could not restrain . They are struggling for man 's first and dearest right ; for that , without which he cau not be a man . Phey are not a political faction ; they are obedient subjects , demanding only the peaceful exercise of their own rights . This is apparent from their own published appealsto the patriarch , and to th' Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs . They are oppressed for conscience sake . An expression of sympathy from this country in their behalf , would riot be unavailing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this persecution ; he denies that it is a persecution ; he resorts to artifice and evades responsibility . The Turkish government , now pledged to the // policy of toleration , may be prevailed upon , by public sentiment from abroad , to arrest these irregular and violent proceedings of the patriarch . Public sentiment has an overwhelming power when it is on the side of conscience , of humanity , of freedom and of God . Some expression of opinion from this country is demanded by the false attitude in which many American Protestants are placed by Bishop Southgate , their nominal representative . This Mr. Southgate sanctions fully the proceedings of the patriarch . We know that he has been misrepresented heretofore and the missionaries of the American Board were the first to vindicate him . They do not accuse him now ; he speaks for himself , in the Christian Witness . Speaking of the anathema , he says : " That the sentence was just , I think there can be no question . " He states that the patriarch referred those whom he was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying : " He is my friend , by his decision I will abide . I will grant whatever he thinks just . ' *-So , then , it seems that Bishop Southgate was in the confidence of the patriarch , and had this whole matter virtually in his hands ; and he approved of these , arbitrary proceedings against men who refuse to worship images , to confess to priests , and who choose to follow the Scriptures in all things ; and he claims to represent the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States ! But , says Mr. Southgate , there is no persecution-nothing but a simple excommunication . Of this let the reader judge from the petition of the sufferers to the Turkish Minister . After declaring that they are " true and faithful subjects of the Sublime Porte , " they say : " Not being able to disobey the cornmiindments of the hoiy Gospel , while , however , in every other respect , we render to our patriarch perfect honor and obedience , your servant , the patriarch , not satisfied with simply excommunicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any ground , accusing them with the names of Protestants , atheists and infidels , still further ordered all his flock , and the chiefs of the trades and the quarters of the city , and also the priests , under penalty of excommunication and anathema , to oppress and injure these your servants in various ways ; such as by taking away from them their permission to trade , and expelling them from the trading corporations ; turning them out of their shops , and causing them to quit rooms which are their own property ; preventing those who are their debtors from paying them , and forcing , at the same time , those to whom they owe money , to demand it before the expiration of the term of payment ; driving them by force away from their homes , and separating them from their wives and children . " The above mentioned persons have executed all these measures upon your petitioners , and your servants , with their families , are now in an utterly destitute and oppressed condition , and they are in need of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your Excellency , we beseech that your Excellency would order the patriarch to withdraw his oppressive hand from your servants , and thus secure for us deliverance . " We presume that Mr. Southgate is a sincere , well-meaning man ; ( so was Saul of Tarsus , ) but he is infected with a pious horror of schism . This to him is a mortal sin . Almost every chapter in his work shows his dread of it . No matter what the church is ,  --  Greek , Armenian , Syrian , Nestorian ; no matter how corrupt it may be by his own showing ; if it is any thing which has a bishop to it , then beware of schism ! Here we think is the solution of his present course . these Armenians , by forsaking foolish traditions and ceremonies , were committing schism . But , Mr. Southgate , do they not believe in Christ , the Trinity , the Scriptures , the Nicene creed ? " Ah ! the sin of schism ! " Do they not merely renounce image worship , tran-substantiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! but they are guilty of schism . * But did not the English church of // which you call yourself a bishop , secede from Rome upon these very points ? " Ah ! may the eastern churches never share in the schisms , the sects and divisions of the west . " But , Mr. Southgate , did not you yourself dissent and secede from the ancient and primitive ecclesiastical order of New England , in which you were educated ? " We must save the Armenian church from schism ; and here are some of these men who have no respect for a bishop , but say they are as much bishops as any body . Yes , Mr. Patriarch , it is my decision that these men shall be excommunicated to save the church from schism . " Do Protestant Episcopalians in the United States know , that they are contributing to the support of such a miserable , paltry , weak-minded bigot , as their representative ? If not , we share with them , as Armericans and Christians , the grief and shame which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the sympathies of a missionary of the American Board were known to be upon the side of ecclesiastical tyranny in such a case , he would be instantly recalled from his station , or the Board itself would find itself ruined by the righteous indignation of those whom it undertakes to represent . Let us see what will be the effect of bishop Southgate 's avowal of his criminality , in this high-handed trespass against man and God . We find our own views on this point admirably expressed in the following extract from an*article in the Journal of Commerce , for June 6 . " Bishop Southgate has no doubt that the sentence of the Patriarch was just , and that lie granted them all that the most scrul ) ulous conscience could rightly demand . Yet we presume there is not an American citizen in the whole United states who could conscientiously subscribe to the Patriarch 's confession , unless indeed there may be some one Armenian in the land . Neither the Roman Catholic - nor the Episcopal church could subscribe to it , and certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southgate once himself rejected all such things , and believed just as " the persecuted Christians " believe . His relations and the whole New England community believe so still ; and of course are " not heirs of salvation . " " Neither the Patriarch nor bishop Southgate would think of persecuting men for conscience sake , though nothing but thinking and speaking are alleged in the anathemas . Men never confess to themselves that they are persecutors . The thing is too monstrous to acknowledre in one 's own heart . When bishop a Southgate left the Congregational church and repudiated its bishops and its ordinances , what if he had been treated as these Armenian Bible readers are treated ! But the Puritans established different opinions about the right of every man to believe for himself , and so the bishop suffered nothing by the change of his opinion . It is the right of every man to change his opinions , and his duty too when he finds he has been in the wrong . It is the old and fallacious way of getting along with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the evils they suffer are consequences-not inflictions . A hierarchy surrounds itself with all the horrors that can be invented , and holds them over the heads of its members who dare to think . If they rebel , it does nothing to hurt them . It only knocks away the props , and then of necessity the curses come tumbling down . As well might the French revolutionists say that they hurt no one ; all they did was to take away the support from under the axe . Whatever may be the merits of the case , it is clear that American citizens are responsible on both sides . The missionaries of the Board avow it that they have been spreading Bibles and teaching the people ; and bishop Southgate , as we understand him , quite as frankly avows that all that the PatTiarch has done , has been rightly done , and with his sanction , both before and after . Itis a matterfor grave consideration by the whole American people ; for it is not a question of religious dogmas , b erty . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , however , that the Missionary Committee of the Protestant Episcopal church , will give this whole matter a candid and thorough investigation , and will condemn the course of bishop Southgate . Even if they were disposed to shield him from public censure , they could not bi-ook that show of indignation which is already rising among the laity of their own com // munion , at this outrage upon human liberty . The bishop will find himself at the head of a mere fragment of his own church , and may even be subjected to the fearful alternative of schism or excision . We trust that the Episcopal church will seize upon this occasion to vindicate her Protestant character . We hope , however , that the bishop , if condemned , will not be persecuted . In conclusion , let the reader re member , that these persecuted brethren are in urgent need . Their present wants must be relieved by contributions from abroad . This is a grand occasion for the exhibition of Christian unity to the world . Christ moreover , is testing the love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will remind them of the response they make to it , at his appearing . ( Mat. xxv , 34 , seq. )
