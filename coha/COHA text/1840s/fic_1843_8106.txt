Schoolcraft , Henry Rowe , 1793-1864 : ALHALLA , OR THE LORD OF TALLADEGA . A TALE OF THE CREEK WAR . from Alhalla , or the Lord of Talladega ( 1843 ) INTRODUCTORY STANZAS . Stretched on his couch , the Indian warrior lay , His bow and quiver prostrate at his side , Revolving all his fate in still dismay , Dominion lost , skill baffled , power defied . " Shades of my fathers ! " thus his reverie ran , " And shall the Red Man thus , in clouds decline , " With no memorial of his name or clan , " Or only left to point the poet 's line , " And tell to other years , the tale of his decline ? " Oh , is it thus , the noble woodswise race , " Shall steal away to an unhonored tomb , " Who once were lords of the ascendant chase , " And swept the forests in their pristine bloom ? " Brave were their hearts , and strong in sinewy strength " They drew the shaft that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craven foeman at his length , " And triumphed in the battle 's wild career , " A wanderer of the woods  --  lord of the bow and spear . " Ah tell me , Spirit of the Golden West ! " Say , is it want of knowledge dooms my race ? " Or the wild passions of an untamed breast , " That leaves nor peace nor virtue there a place ? " Can raging tumults of the mortal soul " Prejudge its fate , and lead the wayward mind " Through seas of want and poverty to roll , " Till in a gloom of fixed despair it find " Life 's path without a friend , and even death unkind ? " Doth human rectitude , in mind and heart , " The inward purposes of right and wrong " In human acts  --  so great a boon impart , " Or lead , by their neglect , to thraldom strong ? " And can it be , ye messengers of air ! " Who know the great high Spirit 's sov'reign will , " So vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature 's dictates still , " And worship Manitoes on every breezy hill ? " ' T is wondrous all , and yet there are , I ween , " Some inward inklings of the Indian soul " That whisper to his mind of things unclean , " That taint his rites , and all his life control , " Leading the mind  --  whenever he would do " An evil act , or e'en the purpose form , " To that High Excellence beyond the view , " Who guides the sun and regulates the storm , " Dispensing winter winds , or summer breezes warm . " And is this conscience ? So the white man tells , " Pointing to letters as the star-light kind , " That man 's own heart to man himself reveals , " And warms and renovates the wandering mind , " Impels the hand to drop the bloody blade , " And seek support from art 's more kindly cares , " Where genial fields invite the plough and spade , " And industry her golden wreath prepares , " And peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But why  --  and here my doubts and fears arise  --  " Why are kind precepts of such angel forms " All bleared by acts that sunder friendship 's ties , " And overcast our atmosphere with storms ; " Our lands despoiled by arts , we know not how , " Erst in the solemn council we convene , " But ere we note the hour , the white man 's plough , " Driven reckless through each quiet hamlet scene , " While steel-armed horsemen , stand as guards between ? " And whence  --  if we must acts by precepts try  --  " Whence all the new-found ills that mar our life , " The liquid fire of distillation high , " That whelms our bands in most unseemly strife , " And oft our maddening blood , unruled before , " Stains with its purple tide our utmost lands ? " Is this benignly meant ? say , ye who teach  --  " Or be there few that aim to overreach ? " Ah , do not outward acts most eloquently preach ? " Such is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The muse essays in numbers to review , In that dark hour of opening peril rise , When late to arms the Southern war chiefs flew , Albeit , misguided in their warlike ires , By foreign counsels cast with cruel ken , And war , through all their borders , lit his fires , Transferring ruin to the peaceful glen , And woe to many a band of noble hunter men .

See  --  along the purple sky , See the billows looming high ; Not in rage as ( if aright Men report the wild affright , ) Oft with fear too sorely true , Thy advent'rous kinsmen view , But with long and lab'ring swells , That of lulling tempest tells ; Seest thou ? near the horizon dim , Shadowy form upon its brim , Dun and small  --  that closer scann 'd , Main and margin , should be land . Tell !  --  for by thy lifted eye , Well I ken thou read'st the sky  --  Tell me !  --  in its shadowy forms Is there sunshine  --  is there storms ? Seest thou there , a spirit mild , Or the fiend of waters wild , Who shall make to-morrow 's wave , Many a hapless hunter 's grave , And along the yellow strand , Raise their mounds amid the sand ?

Footnote : 1Kb Listen , white man ! go not there ; Unseen spirits stalk the air ! Though the sky be clear and calm , And the south-west winnow balm  --  Though each wave be smooth and fair , Be thou cautioned  --  go not there ! Misty forms , that walk the wind , Guard the treasures there enshrined ; Hungry birds their influence lend , Snakes defy , and kites defend : There , the star-eyed panther prowls , And the wolf in hunger howls ; There , the speckled adder breeds , And the mighty canieu feeds : Spirits prompt them  --  fiends incite  --  They are eager for the fight , And are thirsting , night and day , On the human heart to prey : Be they gods , or be they not , Touch not thou the sacred spot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoar , Dweller on Igomee 's Footnote : 1Kb shore ! Wherefore bound by spell or wile , Spirit guarded , is yon isle ? Is there not embowelled there Many a gem of lustre rare  --  Glow there not , in hidden mine , Jewel stones of ray divine  --  Ore resplendent  --  crystal bright , That illume the cavern-night ? Or , along the mystic strand , Massy piles of golden sand ? Tell me , hunter ! wilt thou not Guide me to the treasur 'd spot ? Arms , with Europe 's skill prepared , Shall the daring deed reward ; Bands shall deck thee , feathers bless , And the pride of Albion dress , With Columbia 's banner wide , And a chieftain 's plate beside . MONGAZID . Listen , white man ! Moons have past Since this earth was all a waste : Rains had drenched it  --  thunders rent  --  Winds demolished  --  waters spent  --  And the ocean , black and still , Slumbered deep o'er every hill , And not one ling'ring beam of light Illum 'd the vast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky , In mercy hung yon lamps on high  --  Sun , moon and stars  --  and by their light Expelled the dread chaotic night : Then clothed he hills and vales with trees , And stated bounds to lakes and seas ; Then sent he bird and beast in woods , And fish in all our limpid floods , And creatures small , of foot and wing , And every living , breathing thing :  --  Last sent he man  --  ( a barb'rous race , From whom my long descent I trace , ) As lord o'er all  --  and thus benign , Addressed the parent of our line . To thee I give these smiling woods , These lofty hills , and peopled floods , Filled with all needful game , and blest For thy maintainance , peace and rest . I give thee bow , I give thee spear , To dart the fish , and fell the deer ; I give thee bark full light to sweep O'er the broad stream and billowy deep ; I give thee skins for thy attire ; To shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More need'st thou not , nor covet more , And peace her joys shall round thee pour . But touch not gold ; the tempter fly , Or all thy kin shall droop and die ; For in that potent evil pent , Lurk envy , pain , and discontent ; And luxury  --  of life the bane  --  And woe , with all her haggard train . Listen , white man ! Dreamest thou My soul could e'er descend so low , To sell my country , life , and line , For any frail reward of thine ? Or break the Sire-of-life 's command , By treading yonder sacred strand ? My fare is scant ; my roof is low ; My country cold , and deep my woe , And every moon that gilds yon hill , Sees growing want and growing ill ! But scantier still must be my meal , And keener woes my bosom feel , A sharper winter chill our sky , And louder tempests rage on high , Gaunt famine howl along the plain , And every limb be rack 'd with pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , or guiding thee . ETHWALD . Man of the woods ! thy fancies seem Like some distemper 'd midnight dream ; Wild and devoid of reason . Vain Are all thy fears of gold or gain ! Not more vain the infant 's call To the starry skies to fall ; Or the fear this ocean-lake O'er yon cliffs its way shall take , If a single pebble-trace Circles in its glassy face . MONGAZID . Wealth is a curse , our old men said , Their wisdom speaks , though they be dead , Wealth is a curse , and all its trust A breath of wind  --  a heap of dust : ' T is here  --  ' t is gone ! told or untold  --  And Mystery is my name for gold . We have been pining , since we knew The wonders ye could make it do  --  But find with cavil , years , and time , It is the white man 's curse and crime . Of old , our fathers held it good To deal in shells , and rove the wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With food , and skins to keep them warm . But ye , with your unhallowed gain , Have burned our forests from the plain , Causing our hope  --  our game  --  to fly , And making life itself a lie . ETHWALD . Know ! thou man of suff'ring proud , Ills that press , and woes that cloud ! Know , that gold doth hold a charm Want to banish , care disarm  --  To dispel the father 's fears , And suppress kind woman 's tears . Gold ensures the ready meal , And the joys the lib'ral feel , In the palace , or the cot , Fam 'd , applauded , or forgot . Oft its peace-inspiring power Gilds fair virtue 's evening hour  --  Oft , at stern-eyed power 's command , Renovates a drooping land  --  Opening , by a blest employ , Founts of noble , lasting joy : From its toil-impelling springs , Commerce spreads her daring wings ; Art uprears the public dome , Agriculture treads her loom , And a thousand pleasures stand To obey its potent wand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write  --  but its abuse . MONGAZID . Yet , is the sweet with bitter blent , And all without that boon  --  content ! Else hadst thou not quit friend and home , In these unmeasured wilds to roam ; Or boldly dared this forest-sea For gains , that still thy grasp shall flee  --  Or proffered me thy valued pelf To sell my gods  --  my peace  --  myself ! ETHWALD . Thou wouldst shun the white man 's joy , Lest there should be slight alloy : Know , to mortal is not given Joy unmixed , by righteous heaven : Death and sorrow , toil and woe , All must dread , and all must know . But methinks thy purpose stern , That would neither teach nor learn , Give nor guide , remit or feel , Doth some secret power reveal  --  Power that doth thy being sway , And thou must , perforce , obey ! Is it pride of hunter fame , Azid 's art , or Azid 's name ? Is it dread of fate severe , Is it hope , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ill , Foeman 's ire or foeman 's skill  --  Dread of pain or dread of woe , Azid 's heart can never know ! It hath breasted famine drear , And the jagged flinty spear , Warrior 's wrath , or wizard 's sign , Nor doth dread the force of thine ! ETHWALD . Wizard am I not , nor part , Read or know of such foul art , False and visionary . There , Wrapt in his robes of holy care , Behold you pilgrim , early gray , Companion of my toilsome way , As now along the desert strand , With sober tread , he marks the sand  --  E'en now his lips the skies implore , Thy long-lost people to restore ; To lead their steps where joys invite , And love , and truth , and life , and light ! Disciple he , severe and high , Of the great ruler of the sky , To thee but known by thunders loud , The rushing wind , the fire-lit cloud ; But to our fathers , sage and eld , By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or spirit 's wile Thou fearest on the desert isle , His simple , solemn , sacred pray'r Shall guard and guide and bless thee there . OSCAR . The fear from which you fly , is this  --  You would not make but find your bliss . But so God ruleth not his people . He Hath so hewn out our destiny , And linked it with our own free will , That means with ends must tally still . The bliss for which you chase and roam , You might more truly find at home , If but one tittle of the time You give to hunting , war , and crime , Were turned , with simple , peaceful hand , To stocks or grain upon the land . Besides , in every good man 's view , You worship now  --  ye know not who ; The very Power , which , dark of eye , If seen , ye would most swiftly fly . MONGAZID . ' T is well ! Thy god will list to thee , And think'st thou mine shall turn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew Fair skies o'ershadow  --  friend , adieu ! DE LA JOIE . Hunter , stay ; I have a gift , Of such potence it shall lift From thy brain , and from thy mind , Every care of grosser kind , Every latent , earthly woe , Such as weary mortals know , And induce the lifted soul In one round of joy to roll . It shall banish selfish care , Change the fouler fate to fair , And inspire , with visions high , Thy sedate , prophetic eye , Take this little vase ; the draught May be oft and freely quaffed , By those only who have felt Oft its sovereign power to melt , Raise and gladden ; but with care Let thy lips the liquid share ! When the sun , with splendor bright , Wakes the drowsy world with light , Come thou hither , straight , and tell If my gift be ill or well : If my words thou findest true  --  If such raptures may ensue  --  And , with new-found courage brave , Thou wilt tempt with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe of peace . Accept my pledge of purpose high , That calls me to your northern sky . Much have I heard , and longed to view These spreading coasts , and waters blue , These rosy skies , and beaming shores , Replete with all their sylvan stores . Nor less my interest in that race Who poise the dart , and lead the chase ; And , with a pride of kin and sire , Still light up here their council fire . Tradition hath informed me well Of deeds in which ye yet excel : Your skill by water , rift and rock , The war-path and the battle 's shock ; And all those arts , through which ye sing , " I am the wild-wood 's subtle king . " Take of my proffered pledge : we stand Thus heart in heart , as hand in hand . MONGAZID . So be it , sire : the heavens turn black On all who from this pledge draw back . CANTO II . THE SACRED ISLAND . A DISCOVERY . Scene . The broad expanse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . One , in advance , bearing the national flag of the United States . Time  --  morning . The golden sun with early ray , Saw Ethwald on his ocean way , With silent Azid for his guide , And mission-father by his side : His birchen vessel light and gay Speeds swan-like o'er the liquid way  --  The sky is calm  --  the morning air Scarce stirs that mass , so vast , so fair  --  That , like a sheet of waving gold , The eye may not undimm 'd behold ; Yet is there motion  --  bark and crew Dance lightly on that ocean blue , And ever , as up and down they ride Upon that broad , eternal tide , The strained sight descries the while , Short glimpses of that holy isle , Like dreams of bliss , that , fair and sheen , Flit in the moment they are seen . Nearer and nearer as they ply , A gathering mist swells up the sky , And every object , dun or fair , Spreads wild distorted through the air  --  The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunted land  --  The pointed cliffs spread broad and square , Like castles with their banners fair , And motley shapes of monstrous size Start up , and glare before the eyes . To all but Azid 's fearful view The scene is glorious , grand , and new , But wondrous not  --  they know and prize The gay refractions of these skies ; But Azid  --  ghastly forms pursue , All that he fears he sees in view ! At first he mutters  --  then he speaks , Cold drops bedew his aged cheeks ; But ere he lifts th ' imploring eye , T ' appease the spirit of the sky , An offering meet of sacred things Upon the misty wave he flings , But chief that herb whose sacred fame And power , the tribes Ussma name . Then with brief word and solemn air Recites the simple hunter 's prayer . " ' T is now with Thee  --  Great Spirit free , My rite is done  --  it is with Thee ! " Now western breezes briskly play , And sweep those fleecy forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And show that treasur 'd island nigh , In all its loveliest verdure drest , Like sanctuary of the blest , Where peace hath rear 'd her forest throne , To man and all his works unknown . With joy they reach the silver strand , With joy they gaze  --  they leap to land , Like beings from a higher sphere , Dropt down to dwell and worship here . On all its cliffs and arching bays , They pour intent their ardent gaze  --  Each airy , wild , fantastic sight , They scan with ever new delight , As if the very earth-clod there Had something more than earthly fair , And every rock that wall 'd the shore Were jewel set , or bright with ore ; Each pebble on the saffron sands , They search with prying , chemic hands , By glass or magnet , lest perchance Aught should escape a grosser glance : The fragile little helix shell Along the shore their steps impel , Intent each speck 'd and striped whorl To find a mass of orient pearl : The fallen trunk they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Or scan the antler bleach 'd and dry With curious , searching , eager eye . Hours thus elapse : and every hour Is fraught with some expressive power ; But now a task must be essayed , They seek the island 's central shade ; And first they pass a thicket green , Where birch and aspen intervene , And next a grove of sombre hue , Where spruce and fir arrest the view ; A hill succeeds , and then a wold , With pines encumber 'd , sere and old , That stretch their branches dead and bare , High forked amid the upper air  --  Beyond , a beetling rock is seen , Of massy granite  --  crown 'd with green , And from its clefts a limpid stream Pours on the sight its silver gleam , And murm'ring on its downward way Speeds idly to a neighb'ring bay . Here pause the travellers , joy 'd to meet Such lonely , wild , and still retreat ; And oft the streamlet 's mossy side They press , to taste the crystal tide , Or lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . But hark ! a sound or voice is heard , A human voice  --  perchance a bird ? Or , in some spiral cliff around , Can rushing winds produce the sound ? Or is the gaunt hyena here ? To Azid  --  ' t is a voice of fear ! But hark again  --  the softening sound Reverb'rates as if cavern-bound . They pause , they list  --  a strain is sung , ' T is in the well-known Indian tongue . They list  --  a female voice essays This fond lament of other days . EDNEE 'S SONG . 1 . To sunny vales  --  to balmy skies , My thought  --  a flowery arrow flies . I see the wood  --  the bank  --  the glade , Where first a wild-wood girl I played : I think on scenes and faces dear ; They are not here  --  they are not here . 2 . In this cold sky  --  in this lone isle I meet no friend 's  --  no mother 's smile : I list the wind  --  I list the wave , They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart 's young joys are gone ; It is alone  --  it is alone . 3 . Ah ! can I ever cease recall My father 's cot , though it were small ; The stream where oft , in sun and shade , I roved , a happy Indian maid , Pleased with the wild flowers , pink and red , A brave youth bound around my head . 4 . I love the land that gave me birth , Its woods and streams , its air and earth ; I love the very sounds I knew  --  Sweet woodland sounds  --  when life was new ; I love the garb my fathers had , And my own bright Muscogee lad . That voice is mute : with care they seek , By winding rock and fallen peak , For rift or path that foot may tread , To gain the crag 's o'erhanging head . At length a rugged path they spy , That seems nor light , nor safe to try ; But still with patience , skill and might Suffices to attain that height . A faintly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Then by a rock , when turning short , A cave displays its ample port ;  --  An Indian maid of stature fair , And forehead high and flowing hair , Sits pensively , secure and lone , Beside that rustic hall of stone ; A string of shining shells she prest Upon her slender chisell 'd breast ; Unmoved her air ,  --  and now again She raised the half unfinished strain , When that priz 'd guardian of the night , The hunter 's dog , and fond delight , Darts forth instinctive , and defies Their near approach with doubling cries . Instant she starts , as with a shock , And flies within the cavern 'd rock . Soon from within a man of years , The warrior father , slow appears ; Tall , rigid  --  firm of step and eye , That speaks of sage , or prophecy ; A head , by nature bald , or shorn , A look of care , but not forlorn  --  A simple spear is in his hand ; With brow upraised , and gesture bland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that seems to say , Come friend  --  come foe  --  ye still shall find A proud , resolved , unbroken mind , That oft hath tried the battle blade , Or set the deadly ambuscade ; That neither shuns , nor seeks to die , That will not stoop , and will not fly . OSCAR . Holy hermit  --  not in ire Press we on thy cavern fire ; Travellers we , from distant shores , Where the loud Atlantic roars , And the sun its earliest light Pours on valley , plain and height . By the Erie 's fretted shore , Plied we fast the cedar oar , And the Huron 's placid sea Swept with spirits light and free : Northward still we held our way , Glancing on by isle and bay , Bank and river , rift and wall , To St. Mary 's sounding fall  --  Foamy pass of waters wild ! Islet green and rock up-piled , Where the torrent silver-crown 'd , Dances on with murm'ring sound , Deep and mellow  --  while the eye Glows with thrilling ecstasy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature 's potent power to melt ; But with ever brief delay Urged again our watery way , Till we felt the dizzy swell , As it rose , and as it fell , Of this vasty sheet and breeze , Sire of continental seas ! And with joy unfelt before , Gazed upon its ocean shore . Nor upon that border hoarse , Bent we many days our course , When a hunter , old and hoar , Spied we joyous on the shore . Him we urged , and by his skill Reached this storm-indented isle : Yet in all our lengthened way , Nought of wondrous , grave or gay , Have we met in joy or fear , Strange as thy existence here , Deemed by men a sacred shore , Mortal never trod before . ALHALLA .

I resolved apace to flee To some valley lone and free , Friendly wood or sheltering cave , Or some wild and distant wave , All too frigid , poor and dread , E'er to tempt the white-man 's tread ; There unknown to pass my life , Free from rapine  --  free from strife  --  Happy in th ' unpeopled wild , With my loved , my only child ! And full happy , freed from cares , Envy breeds , or hate prepares !

But e'en this may not be so , Fresh the springs of sorrow flow ! And the fiat black and drear Still pursues its victim here ; As if ' t were a boon too high Thus to live and thus to die ! To declare thy presence here Doth inspire a joy sincere , Or with gladness fills my eye , Were most base , unseemly lie ! Yet , to wayward mortal feet , Is my roof a safe retreat ; Be ye foes , or be ye friends , If impelled by noble ends , Chance , or circumstance severe , Chilly blast , or famine drear , Welcome is my stony cot , Welcome is my forest lot ; Freely enter  --  freely share Cottage fire and cottage fare .

Nor wanting she  --  whose age and art Supplied the maid  --  a mother 's part .

I would scorn the labor base Of thy wonder-working race ; As my fathers lived , would I Wish to live and wish to die , Hold the precepts they have given , Seek with them my final heaven ; Proper are thy gifts to thee , Proper are my gifts to me ; Go thy way  --  my fervent cry Is here undisturbed to die .

Hear my words :  --  Thrice twenty snows Have bleach 'd and chill 'd these frontless brows , And sun and frost , and wind and rain , Prevail 'd alternate o'er the plain , As moons revolved  --  since erst with joy I roved a careless hunter boy , Full free from sorrow , care , and pain , On Talladega 's sunny plain , And every year with fresh delight , Gleamed on my fond enraptured sight , And youth fled fast , and manhood came , But manhood found me still the same .

But years , that turn the young man gray , Brought silent on another day . War came :  --  not such as mem'ry tells Once rung through Tuscaloosa 's dells , When simple wood-craft plied her art , Club against club , and dart to dart , But grim , exterminating wrath , That heaped with dead his giant path , Embracing in one gen'ral sweep Both those who strike and those who weep , The young and old , the weak and brave , Driv'n onward to one gen'ral grave .

Sayest thou there was no mercy shown , No prisoner saved in battle  --  none ? ALHALLA . Little there was  --  I must be brief , Yet would not play the knave or thief , By robbing foeman , chief or youth , Of one small tittle of the truth , To save this wither 'd trunk the ire And rack of slow-consuming fire . When erst this cloud obdurate rose , Red with the wrath of many foes , And men and steeds promiscuous slain , Strewed Tallasatche 's fatal plain , The struggle o'er , compassion fair , Perched on the standards floating there ! I , on that sanguinary day , Mixed freely in the dubious fray , And with my war-axe , lance and brand , Fought with the foremost of my band . These scars upon my arm and breast , My valor on that day attest . But vain was every warrior art , By charge or war-whoop , club or dart ; The foeman pressing on our ground , With horse and bayonet wall 'd us round , And with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host and town , And nine score warriors , whom I led , Upon that day lay cold and dead . Few suns set on that dismal scene , My wounds were still unsear 'd and green , When thundering on with trump and drum , I heard again the war-horse come , Like gathering tempest , big and black , That through the forest wings its track , Sweeping and tearing all that stand , And desolating wood and land . But I had oft seen danger near , And knew not that base feeling  --  fear ! I roused my warriors from the rest That with short , fitful dreams they prest , And armed for fight , and strife and pain , Stood firm on Talladega 's plain . Oh Talladega ! thou art still My native wood ! my native hill !

And still I hoped , when nature threw Around my brows the silver hue , And fainting limbs proclaimed the close Of earthly cares and earthly woes , To lay me down with sober care , And slumber with my fathers there . Ah ! land of all my heart holds dear , Thy groves are desolate and sear  --  The echoes of thy winding shore Shall charm my listening ear no more  --  The winds that whistle o'er thy plain Repeat a sad and hollow strain , And all thy haunts are fill 'd with moans , And whitened by my nation 's bones . But let me drop this strain of woe : I told thee of the coming foe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well foretold a stubborn day . Few words I spoke to those who stood , With ready arms , within that wood ; But , when I ceas 'd , the battle cry Rung long and loudly  --  strike or die ! Erst trampling horse , in armor bright , Pricked to the front and wooed the fight , With volley quick and furious tread Essayed th ' assault , and , wheeling , fled . I forward sprang , and at one yell A thousand warriors served me well , And urging ball and feather 'd dart , Play 'd hot and strong the warrior 's part ; And once I drove the reeling ranks Back on their chief  --  the chief outflanks , Pours from behind his galling horse , And opes the war with all his force . Thick round my sides my bowmen lie  --  They faint , they waver , and they fly ; Then streams afresh the battle gore Wider and wider along the shore , And those who fly but fly to feel Th ' avenging horsemen 's angry steel . And when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the slain , Few , out of all my gallant band , Had ' scaped the mark of ball or brand ; And death , of brave Muscogee men , Had numbered fourteen score and ten .

The sun went down that fatal night , Not as it wont , in glory bright , But veil 'd in clouds of sombre trace , Prophetic of my falling race . I stood upon a rising ground , As darkness flung her mantle round , And heard the last , departing din , Of horse and footmen , gathering in , With clank of steel , and sharp hallo , As from the onset they withdrew , Far winding down the distant hill , Faint , and more faint  --  then all was still , Save crackling tread , or groan severe Of hapless comrade , weltering near : For all that wide , extended wood , Was strewed with carnage , death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On all one fleeting day had wrought  --  Of friend and foe  --  the brave and dead  --  And those who fought , and those who fled ; And bitter were the pangs that came That hour within my inmost frame : For I had seen a father slain , A father old in years and pain ; Two brothers stricken at my side , And a fond parent 's dearest pride , The child hope shone most brightly on , My loved , my first-born , only son ! In grief absorbed and musing high , And yet no tear escaped my eye  --  No sigh my bosom heaved  --  no moan Bespoke my heart 's forsaken tone ; But sealed in woe , within that wood , Unmoved as storm-beat rock I stood . The moon , in pity veiled that night , Shed out a transitory light , As dusky clouds , in rapid chase , Now hid , and now revealed her face ; And by her feeble , trembling ray , I took my solitary way  --  The narrow , winding , leaf-clad road , Conducting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , low and poor , So oft hath made me feel secure , howsoe'er he roam , Still forms the Indian warrior 's home  --  And which he would not change , or give , Like Briton , Scot , or Gaul to live , For all the wealth that kings command , Or temples made with mortal hand . Brief space I walked , when , turning round A beetling rock that walled the ground , And just o'erhung my lodge , there fell Sounds on my ear I knew not well ; A murmur indistinct  --  and then The harsh , brief words of stranger men . A pause ensued  --  a shriek ! I sped To guard my lowly , leaf-crowned shed , And saw , with deeply rous 'd alarms , My Ednee in a soldier 's arms Borne shieking off , in accents wild , ' Oh , father ! save thy injured child !

" Vain cry ! outnumbered , hand to hand I felt the foeman 's heavy brand , And reeled to earth  --  and bleeding there , I felt unutt'rable despair , For still I heard that plaint so wild , " Oh , father ! save thy injured child ! " As hungry panther from his tree Darts on his victim , bold and free , Or black crotalis , ere he spring , Gives warning of the deadly sting , Thus swift and sure in strength and mood Ten warriors leapt from out the wood , Upon the instant when , with pain , I sank upon the dewy plain ; Each armed with arms of steel and dread , With brave Clewalla at their head , And at one shout , and at one bound , They shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! words are vain , They bring me safe my child again . What boots it , that I here should tell , Or those who ' scap 'd , or those who fell ? Th ' assailants , merged in margin damp And tangled brushwood , sought their camp . Of those who fell , a liquid grave We gave in Coosa 's yellow wave ; Which , soft and slow , and winding , bore Its charge to ocean 's sand-bound shore . Now sober silence once again Began to hold her wonted reign ; My wounds , with simple skill , were bound , My warriors lay reclining round , And ere the hour of midnight chill , All seemed as dreary , hush 'd , and still , As if the shout , or battle 's roar , Had ne'er been heard upon that shore . I sat within my tent , and mused , ( As oft in peaceful days I used , ) Upon the Spirit , great and high , That rules the earth , the sea , the sky , And that mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sends powers and nations to and fro , And fills the earth with strife and woe . I thought upon my own wild kin , And all their wand'rings , want , and sin , And that untoward fate that gave , Profuse , their bodies to the grave , And seemed to set them in array , For Saxon arms to drive and slay . I cast my eye in thought profound , On that dear circle slumb'ring round , And mark 'd th ' unoccupied recess A son , a father , once could press ; And last bethought me of the fate And juncture of my own estate : Weak , wounded , foiled , and sore distrest  --  Of friends bereav 'd  --  by foemen prest  --  Sad , bitter thoughts my heart control , A dreamy madness steeps my soul , Or wake or sleeping wist I not , By whom environ 'd , whom forgot ; Unreal scenes before me rise , And visions pass before my eyes . Methought I looked upon the sea , And low , dark waves , not large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With scarce a pebble dash , or roar , Then larger grew , and louder sound , Till one wide tumult rings around . I looked again  --  a monster bear , With claws of steel , and fiery hair , Emerged from out the deep  --  his head , Two polished horns of brass o'erspread , And at his side a leader stood , Of visage pale ,  --  a full-plum 'd hood Danced o'er his brows , and in his hand He held a sharp and shining brand . I looked again , and from a tree , A beauteous bird sang joyfully ; A ray of light from either eye Shot forth in bright tranquillity , Illuminating all the wood , Within whose ample disk I stood . Yet once again my view I cast ; Another changing vision past : A fleecy cloud came from its height , And stood before my wond'ring sight , And parting , like two banners drawn , A figure stept upon the lawn , In size , and color , dress and air Like my own kindred  --  but more fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put question meet  --  he answer 'd  --  " God , Whom once thy sires , on burning sands , In other years and other lands Most truly served , hath doomed thy race To melt before the white-man 's face , To fail in battle , and in store , A scorn  --  a by-word on the shore ; For ye from his commands have turn 'd , And ye unholy fires have burn 'd , And with new altars and abodes Set up and worship 'd other gods , And through unholy rites and sin , In word and deed become unclean ; And for a season he hath given Your nations to the wrath of heaven , By divers men from foreign climes , Who loathe your waywardness and crimes , And congregate from far and near To worship God in spirit here .

Let it , once for all , suffice , That my path was hemmed by vice , Power , misfortune , cross and ill , Such as stoutest bosoms kill ; But I had a warrior 's heart , That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with club and knife , Strewing death 's dark path with life , But not often felt the blight Fate prepared that fearful night , When by river , rock , and dell , There Alhalla 's household fell : As I lifted high my brand , O'er the wide retreating strand , Hot the fight and loud the yell , This I only know , I fell : Consciousness , as with a thought , Left me , as the fight I fought , Sudden , as , if in a dream , What we do may only seem . When , from this unguarded stroke , First to life and sense I woke , Darkness spread around the plain , Shielding dying , dead , and slain ; Slowly rising from my gore , Faint , I sought the river 's shore ; Fatal act ! to drink or die , Purchased by captivity . Yet my fate was not to fall By the broadsword or the ball ; Taught by kindly hands to know War doth mingle balms with woe , And ' t is only on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my prison bed , Kindly nurtured , kindly fed , Till my wounds and fevered brain Health and soundness felt again . Seasons now had passed their round When I sought my native ground ; But I found no kindred tone , Fire had swept it , friends were gone ; Men were ploughing , where , in cheer , Once I chased the noble deer ; Piles of brick , and wood , and stone , Rose to heaven  --  the engine 's groan , The big wheel 's dash , the rattling train , Announced the white man 's iron reign . I sought thy cot  --  it was a plain Where reapers reapt the yellow grain ; I sought the grove , whose solemn shade Our council fire so oft displayed : It was with angled piles beset , Dome , dwelling , garnished minaret , Or steeple called ;  --  with pensive tread I wound me , where repose the dead , And long affection 's pious hand With evening fires illumed the land ; It was a shorn and mangled glade , Where not a staddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide west round , But need I say , I never found , Or where thou hadst in solace flown , To what strange people , not thine own . At length I came where I could hear That thou wert living , but not near ; But still so balked by wayward fate , My footsteps they were e'er too late ; Last , chanced I , with a random aim , For still I heard thy father 's fame , Ethwald 's rapid bark to spy Bound to this magnific sky ; Him I followed  --  but no wail , Word or gesture , told my tale , Trusting some kind chance would ope Fortune , which I scarce could hope ; And so led , by heaven 's decree , Ventured in this sylvan sea . Ask me not of other woes , Why I chose not  --  why I chose ? Why I did not  --  why I did ? Time will tell what now is hid ; For my joy that thus we meet , Changing bitter scenes to sweet , Is as flowing , fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . ALHALLA . Warrior , rest thee . Take the seat Due thy rank and presence meet , By ancient custom , right and power , Deemed sacred in the forest bower . It is our wont , that groom and bride , As heart in heart , so side by side Be-seat them : act and sight Thus simple , seals our forest rite . To-morrow , ere the dawning east The sun illumes , prepare the feast , Where joy and plenty shall preside , To crown the warrior and his bride .
