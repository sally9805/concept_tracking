txt To the oft repeated accusation that is brought by foreigners , especially by Englishmen , against the character of our countrymen , that we are a dollar-hunting people , eager and successful in nothing but the pursuit of wealth , we wish for no better answer than is afforded by the history and present condition of Harvard College . Six years after the settlement of Boston , while the surrounding country was still a wilderness , and doomed apparently to remain so for a long time on account of the sterility of the soil and the incursions of savage tribes , the " General Court " passed an order for the establishment of a college at Newtown . They appropriated for this purpose a sum " equal to a year 's rate of the whole Colony , " or as much , in proportion to the means of the government , as if Massachusetts should now give half a million of dollars for a similar purpose . The object of this noble foundation was not to enlarge the income of the Colony , to prepare for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to increase its attractiveness for emigrants ; but simply to provide for the truthful preaching of God 's word among the people by competent , discreet , and well-educated ministers ,  --  to the end that the torch of sacred learning , which had been lighted for that generation in the English universities , should not be suffered to waste away and expire in their new home on the rock-bound shores and amidst the unbroken forests of New England . How long will it be before the English settlers of New Holland or New Zealand will make bountiful provision for such an object exclusively from their own resources ? The end in view was not the diffusion of the mere elements of an English education throughout the Colony . So // much as this would be accomplished , it was well known , by the zeal and liberality of individuals , without the aid of legal enactments . The Puritan of that day thought his child 's soul would be in danger , if he were not enabled , at least , to read the Bible for himself . Accordingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the schools which sprang up everywhere as soon as the primitive forests were felled , the children of that period were universally instructed in the rudiments of learning . But the wisdom and foresight of the stern and parsimonious fathers of New England went much farther . They were a saving set ; frugality ranked next to piety in their list of household virtues . They would deprive the lawyer of his fee , if they could , and would even stint the clergyman in his salary . But they took good care that there should always be clergymen enough for the wants of every town , - men whom they could trust , from their general reputation for learning , to interpret God 's word for them and to teach them the way of salvation . The clergy of that time , both of the first and second generation , the former coming from Oxford and Cambridge , the latter from Harvard , were all good scholars ; their classical attainments were probably superior to those of their successors in our own century . They could quote Greek and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with but a moderate share of false quantities . Our less instructed ancestors looked up to them with reverence , and blessed in them the first fruits of that " school of the prophets " which they had established at Cambridge . This inordinate estimate of clerical learning and dignity passed away , as was natural , with the lapse of time and the progress of general intelligence . But the benefits resulting to the whole community from the liberal studies of a few were still felt and appreciated ; and the institution where these studies were pursued was still fostered with an eager and thoughtful care . Our ancestors felt a generous pride in promoting the cause of sound learning and a liberal education for its own sake ; they did not stop to inquire whether the balance of the immediate results was on the side of profit or loss . They acknowledged that comprehensive and accurate scholarship was a good thing in itself , and in the long run was sure to redound to the advantage of the people . The men to be educated at Harvard would teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy almost exclusively the bar and the pulpit , and minister to the health , not only of the physical man , but of the body politic . They would fill the highest public offices in the Colony ; they would form the tone of public opinion ; they would take the lead in every generous enterprise and every political emergency . How these expectations were realized is matter of history . Read the annals of Massachusetts , and the greater part of the distinguished names that you find there will also be found enrolled in the Triennial Catalogue of the college . Most of those who guided the Colony through the dark period of the Indian and French wars , and who took the lead in the Revolutionary struggle , were graduates of Harvard . So it must always be ; the writers , the teachers , the thinkers , the men of great local influence and inspiriting example , who , if they do not always appear on the quarter-deck , invariably do most to determine the course of the ship , are mostly those whose youth was devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why these exceptions are conspicuous is that they are few . That ours is now , and virtually always has been , a democratic community is a fact which only lends additional force to the preceding considerations . Wealth has here comparatively little influence , birth has none at all . Strictly personal qualities alone form a universally recognized title to public esteem and confidence . The elements of character , when in their most ductile state , receive shape and impress from the predominant influences that govern a life at college . Broad and vast as the consequences of a common school education are , when so universally diffused as it now is in this State , we doubt whether its general effect upon public sentiment and the general welfare is superior , or even equal , to that of the higher seminaries of learning . The reason is obvious ; the pupils in the former case are younger , and are not exposed so exclusively to the influences of their place of training . Men do not often form their characters or imbibe many of their opinions while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , which either forms their introduction to active life , or is spent within the walls of a university . From fifteen to twenty years of age is really the critical , the governing , period in the life of most persons , - not that the decisive step which will mould their future fortunes is usually 9* // taken as soon as this , but because the powers are then at work which determine how that step shall be taken , and in what direction . Besides , school is hardly ever more than a concurrent power with home ; what is learned by rote in the one is never half so important as what is silently imbibed at the fireside of the other . College life in most cases is a suspension of home influences . While at school , we collect the materials and gather the strength for raising the whole fabric of our future character and destiny . At college , we do much more ; the structure is actually begun , is often carried far forward , and the whole architectural plan of the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social position have any weight in a community like ours , they go to increase the legitimate influence of those who have been liberally educated . Our fathers acted wisely , then , in cherishing with extreme care and liberality the interests of sound learning and liberal studies as represented in their land almost solely by Harvard College . It is a pleasant task to review their example in this respect , and to hold it up for the admiration and imitation of their posterity . We are grateful to Mr. Eliot , the energetic Treasurer of the college , for giving us a renewed opportunity of doing this , by bringing together in this little work , with admirable taste , method , and succinctness , all the requisite materials for judging of the past , and for estimating the present condition and prospects of the institution . It is not a mere abridgment of President Quincy 's elaborate work , though the writer at first proposed this as the limit of his endeavour . But going over the subject again with a full mind and a deep interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labors of his predecessor , as well as to present an abstract of them , and to hold , up some points of research and discussion in a new light . Though writing with a strong bias of affection towards his old . alrna Mater , and with the chief purpose of advancing her interests , he has not unduly colored the facts he had to narrate , nor anywhere betrayed the spirit of an advocate bound to support only one side . There was enough to relate in which the historian could take an honest pride without lapsing into a strain of exaggerated eulogy ; the real claims of the institution are strong enough not to need rhetorical or professional artifice in the attempt to set them forth . If personal feeling appears anywhere in the volume , it is in the warm-hearted sketch of President Kirkland and his // administration of the affairs of the co1leg* yet even here ,  --  the expression is so temperate and judicious , and the avowal of blemishes and faults so frank , that the critical spirit is at once disarmed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a full and hearty approval . We have here the means of estimating with great precision the relative obligations of the college to the Colony and the State on the one hand , and to individuals on the other . We have said , that the legislature and other public authorities nursed the infancy of the seminary with extreme care , and fostered its growth by a liberal application of the public means . The original grant , equal to a year 's income of the Colony , was followed by a string of public donations , many of them small in amount , if judged by the standard of the present day , but large in the aggregate , and showing the affectionate and continued interest that the body politic took in the welfare of the institution , and how the college was considered , like the Church , to be virtually identified with the state . A salary was voted year by year to the President and the Professor of Divinity almost as regularly as to the Governor and the Council , - even more regularly when political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get any pay whatever . By the end of 1786 , these public grants amounted in all to more than $115,000 . At this period , the stream of public bounty suddenly stopped flowing , the disastrous state of public affairs forming probably the obstacle to its continuance . Not till 1814 was it opened again , when a grant was obtained of $ 10,000 a year for ten years , thus making the aggregate of aid from the legislature to exceed $ 215,000 . At three different periods , also , the college was permitted to raise sums for a particular purpose by lottery ; and the whole amount obtained in this way , if it should be considered as a legislative donation , which is doubtful , for it did not come from the public treasury , would raise the aggregate nearly to $ 300,000 . Let us now see what individuals have done . Reckoning only the gifts of money or of articles afterwards converted into money , and thus putting aside many valuable presents of books , philosophical instruments , and land , their donations before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we add what has been given or bequeathed by private persons during the last forty-eight years , we have // the noble aggregate of $ 857,000 ; to which should be added $ 370,000 for legacies already made , though they are payable at a future day . The exact state of the account is , then , that the college is indebted to the legislature for about $ 300,000 , and to individuals for $ 1,227,000 ; or the State has given not quite one fifth of all that the institution has received . Of course , we are not to consider that the productive property of the college now amounts to a million and a half of dollars . Nearly half of this sum has been expended in the purchase of lands , books , and instruments , and the erection of buildings , - all useful for the several objects which the institution has in view , but not yielding any pecuniary income , and having no valuation attached to them in the Treasurer 's books . On a former occasion , * we- ventured to doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expended in building than either the absolute wants of the seminary , or a due regard to taste and convenience , would justify ; and certainly nothing has occurred since to alter our opinion . Within the last thirty years , $200,000 have been expended on four buildings alone , namely , University Hall , Gore Hall , the Observatory , and the Laboratory ; and more than three fourths of this immense sum was taken from what is called the " Stock Account* ' of the college , or its free funds , not locked up by the will of the donors for specific purposes . We say nothing of at least $ 100,000 more laid out within the same time on extensive alterations of the college edifices , and on buildings for the several professional schools ; because most of this sum was contributed for these very ends , and could not have been devoted to any other . We look chiefly to the " Stock Account , " the most useful of all the college funds , which is now only about half as large as it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , upon bricks and stones , - this taste for architectural abortions . It is matter of constant regret with the Corporation and the community at large , that this free fund is not larger , that so many of the benefactors of Harvard tie up their gifts for particular objects , some of which have but a remote affinity to the great purposes for which the college was founded , so that the benefaction is rather a burden than a benefit . During the period of which we now // speak , not one dollar has been appropriated from this general fund to aid indigent students , or to lessen the general expenses of a residence at Cambridge . To all applications to devote money to these purposes , which are generally admitted to transcend nearly all others in importance , the Corporation have always answered , " The college is too poor nothing can be spared from the Stock Account . " The excuse will he very ready , we are well aware , that these buildings were needed . We admit it , but ask again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains a kitchen , about a dozen recitation-rooms , and a chapel , - the latter being admitted now to be too small , illshaped , and inconvenient . A separate and very modest building for a chapel might be erected on college land for $ 15,000 ; another simple edifice , to give as much accommodation as is afforded by the remainder of the present building , might cost an equal sum ; on University Hall , $ 65,000 were expended . The college library now contains about 53,000 volumes ; a plain , fire-proof building , which would hold 100,000 , and thus give room for any probable increase for half a century to come , might have been built on college land for $40,000 ; Gore Hall cost $ 73,000 , * and from its size and grandiose construction , $750 have to be annually expended simply for the fuel that it requires . As soon as Gore Hall was completed , a subscription was made , after much effort , amounting to about $21,000 , to buy books with ; and three fourths of this sum have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard College , the cause of letters and sound scholarship stands to that of good architecture as 21 does to 73 . In these two buildings alone , nearly $70,000 , out of a fund which should have been sacred to science and liberal studies , have been thrown away upon towers , buttresses , hammered stone , and other architectural frippery . We are very sorry to allude to these facts ; they give a rude shock to our feeling of affectionate admiration for our * It is curious to find the following passage in the report of the college Treasurer for 1835 : - " It is intended the next season to erect on the ground within the College Square a granite Library building , to be paid for out of the funds received from the late Governor Gore 's estate , and to be called the Gore Library . The cost of this building is estimated at about 35,000 dollars . " Es uno disce omnza. // . /Ilma Mater . But the mania for showy edifices , which appears to have seized all public bodies in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be marked out too emphatically for general reprobation . Near Philadelphia , a long row of magnificent Corinthian columns in marble , with exquisitely finished capitals , is shown in place of the defrauded orphans for whom the money spent upon these idle ornaments was devoted by Mr. Girard 's will . The Boston Athenarnm , one of the boasts of our city , now stands before the public in a half ludicrous , half scandalous position , with the agreeable prospect of being compelled to give up to its former owner the land which it had bought , but not paid for , encumbered by an unfinished edifice of extraordinary pretensions , on which every dollar of its disposable funds , amounting to some $ 90,000 , has been expended . One of the costliest churches that have been erected in the city for many years is soon to pass under the auctioneer* s hammer for a similar reason , its pastor being dismissed , and the once flourishing religious society entirely broken up . These facts are full of admonition ; we have alluded to the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling for what is past and can not be undone , but simply as a caution for the future . There are rumors that architectural ambition is panting for another opportunity to show itself at Cambridge ; and we would gladly hear these rumors contradicted . It is to be hoped , that whatever money may hereafter be given to the institution , whether by the legislature or by individuals , will be saddled with only one condition , that not a dollar of it shall ever be expended on buildings or the purchase of land . Putting aside all question , however , about money that has been unprofitably spent , we may say that the available productive funds of the college now fall but little short of $ 800,000 . But of this sum only about $470,000 belong to the undergraduate department , or the college proper , the remainder being the property of the Theological , Law , Medical , and Scientific Schools , or appropriated for purposes not connected with education at Cambridge . Of this last amount , nearly $ 280,000 are specifically appropriated , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain professors and to maintaining the Botanic Garden , the surplus being the " Stock Account , " and certain funds devoted to the library // and to indigent students . Now the salaries of the professors and other officers of instruction and discipline in the undergraduaie department amount to $28,500 a year , and the repairs and other general expenses make up $ 10,500 more . As the income of $470,000 capital does not suffice to pay both these sums , the deficiency is made up by the term-hills of the students . We see nothing that the most rigid economy could effect for improving this state of things , excepting , perhaps , in the item of " general expenses , " which have been greatly increased within the last twenty years , and now amount nearly to $7,500 , thus absorbing nearly the whole income of the general fund , or " Stock Account . " We beg pardon of our readers for entering into these dry details ; but they are necessary in order that a subject of much importance may be clearly understood . The pecuniary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , is somewhat remarkable ; in one aspect it is immensely rich , and in another it is very poor . The explanation is to be found in the great change which has taken place during the last half-century in the general character and sphere of operation of the college . For the first hundred and fifty years of its existence , Harvard College was what its name purports , an institution for training youth in those liberal studies which are of higher grade than the branches usually taught in academies and schools , though they are only preparative for the education that is strictly limited to fitting one for professional pursuits . Only the academic degrees , strictly so called , were then given out ; that is , the two degrees in the Arts , and the honorary title of Doctor either of Divinity or Laws . In a word , the undergraduate department constituted the whole college . Now , it is hardly half of it ; so many professional schools and other establishments have sprung up around it , so many funds have been left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them having hardly any connection with the education of undergraduates at Cambridge , that it is no longer only a college , nor even a university , but a vast nondescript establishment for the general promotion of science and letters . Nay , it has even lost its name within a few years , and for the first time in two centuries has come to be designated in its own official publications as " The University at Cambridge . " We suggest in a note some reasons for questioning the propriety of this // 108 Eliot 's Sketch of Harvard College . new appellation , which seems to have been rather hastily adopted. * * We find the following note appended to the last edition of the annual catalogue of the college - " HARVARD COLLEGE ' is the name given to the institution by the Charter of 1650 , which still remains unaltered and in force . The legal style of the Corporation is The President and Fellows of Harvard College , ' and their rights and privileges are confirmed to them under that name by the Constitution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is done is entitled , The University at Cambridge and Encouragement of Literature , &amp;c. , ' and in its first section Harvard College is spoken of as the said University . ' in the second section it is declared to be the duty of all legislatures and magistrates to cherish the interests of the University at Cambridge , which is also the name given to the institution by the Statute of 25th June , 1789 , enacted to carry the second section of the fifth chapter of the Constitution into legal effect . " The name of Harvard University ' prevails extensively ; more so , perhaps , than either of the other designations ; and it is sanctioned by the h igh authority of Mr. Peirce and President Quincy in their respective histories . But Harvard College ' and the University at Cambridge ' are the only names known to the Charter , to the Constitution , and ( it is believed ) to the legislation of the Commonwealth . " The specific appellation , or proper name , of any thing is to be distinguished from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description or definition of it , that serves to point out the object to which the proper name is applied . Thus , we may speak of " the ship of the line recently launched at Charlestown , " meaning thereby the " Vermont " ; the latter is its proper name , the former is a brief definition of that name , or description of the object to which it belongs . So a stranger might inquire after " the public classical seminary in Boston , " of which he had forgotten the proper name , which is " The Boston Latin School . " In this country , the words college and university have always been used as synonymous , and we hear of " Brown University " and " Yale College " as names applied to two institutions of precisely the same class . We find another instance in the records of Harvard College as far hack as 1693 - " The Corporation having been informed that the custom taken up in the college , not used in any other universities , for the commencers to have plumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite proper , therefore , to speak in general terms of " the university at Cambridge , " or " the college near Boston , " or " the school of the prophets at Newtown , " or " the oldest college in the United States " ; every one knows that the proper name of the nistitution thus designated , the name given to it in honor of him whom the General Court in 1661 called its " principal founder , " the only name by which it is known in its charter , under which alone it holds all its property and privileges , and performs all its legal acts , is HARvARD COLLEGE . The chapter in the Constitution relating to it hasfor its general title , " The University at Cambridge , and Encouragement of Literature , &amp;c. " ; but throughout the first section , which relates exclusively to " the said university , " the institution is called by its proper name of Harvard College , just as in the second section , the " encouragement of literature " is explained to mean cherishing the interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the public schools in the towns included . In all its own official acts and publications , so far as we have ascertained , // 109 There are a few instances in the earlier history of the college , in which money was bequeathed to it for certain purposes that had little fellowship with its original design . Thus , in 1716 , the Rev. Daniel Williams left it an annuity of ? 60 a year , " for the support of two teachers among the Indians and Blacks " ; and the proceeds of this annuity having unluckily been allowed to accumulate , the college is now paying $ 650 a year to two persons , that they may teach and take care of a little tribe of uncertain color and genealogy on Cape Cod , who are called by courtesy the " Marshpee Indians . " We presume the Corporation would gladly resign this trust fund to any person or institution who could legally in all its catalogues annual and triennial , its diplomas , its lists of public exercises at commencement , &amp;c. , till within three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College , " or " Harvard University , ' - the two terms , as we have said , being considered synonymous , though , in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred , the former alone is used . The first meeting of its governors of which the official record is preserved is called in that record " the meeting of the governors of Harvard College , held in the college . " On the tombstone of every one of its presidents who is interred at Cambridge , he is called the President Collegii Flarvardini , or . /lcademiee Harvardiana3 . Only on the monument recently erected to John Harvard himself , erected by the graduates of the college to show their gratitude to him as its principal founder , the institution is called , with singular infelicity as it seems to us , " the University of Cambridge , " and the fact is nowhere even alluded to , either in the English or the Latin inscription , that his name had been given to the college . It seems proper , at any rate , that some one name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its governors themselves . We have before us four publications , all of which may be considered as official , which have appeared within the last six months , and in no two of them is the college designated hy the same name . The first is " A Sketch of the History of Harvard College , " by Mr. Eliot , its Treasurer ; the second is the annual catalogue for this year " of the University at Gambridge " ; the thjrd bears on its outer leaf " Harvard University . Treasurer 's Statement , 1848 " ; the fourth is the Triennial , which has this curious designation ,  --  " Catalogus Collegii Harvardiani 5EU Universitatis Caretabrigiensis . " This last reminds one only of the alias under which a rogue is described in a criminal indictment . There is , at least , one serious objection to the name of " The University at Cambridge " ; which is , that one great branch of the university is not at Cambridge , but at Boston ; and another portion of it will soon be established at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the University at Cambridge , " when the Medical School comes to be spoken of , we read that " the Medical Lectures form a department of instruction ire Harvard University . " it is well that this fact is mentioned , for otherwise the Medical School might seem to have been turned out of doors . We object further to this modern change of name , that " the University at Cambridge " has been for many centuries the appellation of a venerable establishment in the mother country , whose honors we have no wish to appropriate . It is not seemly that our own excellent college should be known only as a John Smith , Jr . // take charge of it ; it is now a draft upon their time and care , it encumbers their Treasurer 's books , and does not in any way promote the growth of liberal studies at Cambridge . So , also , in 1790 , Ilrs . Sarah Winslow was moved to give Harvard College ? 1,367 , Massachusetts currency , " for the aid of the town of Tyngsborough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not leave the fund to the town authorities , to he thus applied , does not appear ; probably she thought the college treasurer was a better financier than the town-clerk , and would take better care of her money . At any rate , the whole income of her fund is regularly paid by the college to the parson and the pedagogue of T yngsborough . It is certain that old Harvard is none the richer for these two funds , though they increase its nominal property by more than $ 20,000 . These are extreme cases , it is true ; but they illustrate our point , which is to show that the college proper may he really very poor , though seemingly in possession of great riches . The numerous schools and other establishments , which have grown up under its auspices , all have large funds which are strictly appropriated to them , and can not be diverted to other purposes . Yet , in legal strictness , these funds all belong to the " President and Fellows of Harvard College , " who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only chartered body that is known to the laws , and empowered to hold property . In fact , this corporation , holding a perpetual charter secured in the constitution of the State , filling its own vacancies , managing exclusively its own concerns , - the visitatorial power over them having been long since reduced to a mere shadow , - and being composed of a few gentlemen of the very highest repute for learning , ability , and uprightness , forms an excellent depositary of funds which are to be held in mortmain in this State for any conceivable purpose . Old Mrs. Winslow made a capital hit in selecting her trustee to take care of the minister and the schoolmaster of the good town of Tyngsborough forever . Had she trusted some other public bodies , the fund ere now might in great part have disappeared , - not , perhaps , from embezzlement or misappropriation , hut from negligence , wastefulness , or unlucky investments . Riches held in mortmain are peculiarly apt to take to themselves wings and fly away . The Smithsonian Fund has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly and justly made it up out of the public treasury . And where is the greater part of the enormous fund left by Stephen Girard ? Harvard College takes better care of the money intrusted to her , and faithfully applies it to any purpose the testator may indicate . Her reputation in this respect is getting to be widely known , and we fear that it may soon prove inconvenient to sustain it . If a wealthy manufacturer should leave half a million of dollars to the college , the whole income of it to be applied to keeping a cotton-mill in Cambridge in operation for ever , we have no doubt the Corporation would gratefully accept the trust , and watch diligently and anxiously over the turning of every spindle for centuries to come . We speak lightly of this matter , but in truth we are a little jealous for the existence and prosperity of that school of the prophets , which , till within fifty years , monopolized the care and attention of the Corporation of harvard College , and which is now in a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which have as much to do with the original purpose for which it was founded as with cotton-spinning . It is not that the respective objects of these institutions are mean , unworthy , or of little account . Far from it ; most of them are of that high and liberal character which challenges the admiration and support of every well-informed lover of his race , every well-wisher to the highest interests of mankind . But they absorb the time and energy of the g4ivernors of the college ; they give it a deceptive appearance of wealth , when in truth they only make it poorer ; they divert the attention and generosity of the community , which would otherwise all he turned towards the fostering of proper academic studies at Harvard ; they borrow its money ; they multiply inordinately its occasions for appealing to public munificence , so that the college appears like a horse-leech , whose cry is constantly , " Give ! Give ! " they become formidable rivals to those exclusively intellectual pursuits , to that love of letters and sound scholarship , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar aim of a life at college ; and though often seemingly successful at the outset , they subsequently become in many cases a dead weight and an encumbrance , injuring the good name of the college , and lessening its means of usefulness . Let them be confined to their proper place ; let each be established on its own independent footing ; // let not Harvard College be expected to furnish all the machinery , all the management , all the funds , for the cultivation of every science , and for the promotion of every enterprise , be it of an intellectual , a philanthropic , or an industrial character . But it is time to give some particulars , and to judge from them whether this recent enlargement of the sphere of operation of the seminary is , on the whole , a benefit to it , and whether it tends to promote the objects for which the college was first instituted . Take one of the most recent additions to the establishment , and one of which the community generally has most reason to be proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building , instruments , observers , &amp;c. , for this institution , about $ 70,000 have already been expended , one half of which sum was subscribed , after urgent solicitation , by the merchant princes of Boston and its vicinity , and the other half was lent , or given , as the case may be , out of the funds of the college . Possibly this loan may now be repaid , if the munificent bequest of the late Edward B. Phillips should take effect , placing $ 100,000 in the hands of the Corporation for the exclusive benefit of the Observatory . The very learned mathematical director of the establishment , the skilful observers with their excellent instruments , have already accomplished much for astronomical science and the growth of their own fame ; probably it is one of the best appointed observatories in the world . But has it any particular connection with the proper business of* the college ? Are diligent youth there trained in liberal studies ? Does it exert any influence upon the course of academic exercises ? Does a student go there once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peep at the moon through the big telescope ? If not , might not its whole management and control with greater propriety be confided to the State , to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , to the Smithsonian Institute , or to a corporation of its own ? Why should Harvard College be burdened with it ? Its effect upon this institution may be summed up as follows - it has used up for the time being over $ 30,000 of the college funds ; it has taken away almost entirely from his duties as an instructor one of the ablest of the college professors , whose place in the recitation-room is supplied by a tutor at considerable expense ; it has made the college in appearance about $ 130,000 richer , and thus lessened its chance of obtaining any thing more from the liber // ality either of the State or of ' individuals , while in reality the institution is made many thousand dollars poorer . If ' , at any future time , the progress of science should call for other and better instruments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , or devote to it a further portion of its own slender funds . How much of the time , care , and effort , which the President and the Corporation would otherwise have given to the undergraduate department , have been absorbed during the last ten years by the Observatory , we have no means of estimating . They are but seven mortal men , after all ; most of them are deeply engaged in very laborious professions , and it is to he presumed that they find the management of the college no sinecure . We will take , as the next instance , the Lawrence Scientific School , founded about two years ago by the extraordinary munificence of one who , without office or other adventitious aid , has obtained a just and enviable celebrity , both at home and abroad , as a merchant , a philanthropist , a statesman , and a benefactor of letters and science . The school which he has established is an experiment , its objects and arrangements making it really the first of its kind in the world ; being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak with confidence of its effects , and we have room now only to consider a minor question respecting it , as to the propriety of making it one of the departments of Harvard College , and blending its fortunes as closely as possible with those of that seminary . It has a Faculty composed of nine professors or instructors , six of whom are borrowed from the undergraduate department , two from the Observatory , and one who is attached exclusively to the new school . The Rumford Professor of the Application of the Sciences to the Useful Arts , whose services had been enjoyed exclusively by the undergraduates for some twenty years , is now transferred to the new establishment , though members of the Senior class may still attend his lectures on the payment of an additional fee of ten dollars a year . The audience for the lectures of the distinguished Lawrence Professor of Zo6logy and Geology is also made up almost entirely of members of the college and the Law School , who pay a further additional fee , of equal amount , for the privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " several other special courses are to be given by those college professors who are now annexed to the Scientific Faculty ; and 10 * // the Seniors may attend any of them , " on the payment of a fee of five dollars per course . " Notwithstanding the liberality with which the Scientific School was endowed , its expenses and wants are very great . It has as yet but thirteen students , and the Laboratory which has been built for them at large cost , on college land , is capable of accommodating one or two hundred . The whole amount received for tuition in the school the last year was little over $1,000 , about $400 of which was derived from the " additional fees " charged to undergraduates ; the mere general expenses of the school for this year , not including the professors ' salaries , exceeded $ 2,400 . The charge for tuition in the school , therefore , is necessarily put very high ; the " special students in chemistry " pay $150 a year , besides supplying themselves at their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using . As Cambridge is an expensive place to live in , we fear , considering the position in life of the particular class of young men for whom this institution is designed , that these high charges alone will be fatal to the success of the scheme . Under the circumstances , we are not surprised to find the announcement , in reference to the contemplated professorship of engineering , that " it has not yet been in the power of the Corporation to fill this department . " Yet this professorship was to be the only real addition made by the school to the means of instruction formerly provided at Harvard ; professors of chemistry , geology , botany , mathematics , and the application of science to the arts , the college already had of its own . In view of these facts , we can not resist the conclusion , though we have come to it very reluctantly , that the Scientific School as yet is a tremendous burden upon the college , and yields to it no advantage or profit whatsoever . That the services of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , from the undergraduate department to the new institution , is perhaps no serious loss ; Harvard had more professors than it could find employment for , and the number of students in the new school being yet so very small , there is little or nothing for them to do there , and they can still find time for their proper academic duties . But it is a very serious thing , that undergraduates should be charged additional fees to a considerable amount , for the privilege of attending lectures which formerly made a part of their own // course of instruction . It has always been matter of deep regret with the friends of the institution , that the tuition fee arid incidental charges at Cambridge are so high ; hut the charge of $ 75 a year was thought at any rate to cover every thing ; for this sum the college bargained to give each student , during the four years of his undergraduate course , all the instruction that he could receive with profit . If the lecture rooms of the Scientific School were crowded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go there ; it would be said that they had studies enough to at* tend to , and that these lectures were designed for a different class of youth . Now they are permitted to attend for the twofold object of making up an audience where there would otherwise be bare walls , and of defraying out of their own pockets a portion of the large expenses of the Scientific School . Slender as the general funds of Harvard College are , we should prefer to see this pittance paid out of them to the aid of the new school , rather than made a fresh burden upon the students . Candidates for admission to the Scientific School must be eighteen years old , and " must have received a good common English education " ; these are the only real qualifications for entrance . Tbis regulation shows at once the class of students for whom the school is designed , and the sort of education which it is intended to give . Harvard College was instituted for the promotion of liberal studies , and for nearly two centuries it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is usually comprised in a full course of academic studies at college ; a considerable degree of proficiency in classical and mathematical learning is required as indispensable for the very commencement of such a course . What would tbe founders of Harvard have said to a proposition for converting it into an ordinary English high school , even of the first class ? Certainly , we do not undervalue the work that is done at such a school . It is admitted that even primary schools must exist ; and , in one sense , the instruction given at them is certainly far more important and useful than the education which has usually been obtained at Harvard . But what then ? Is the college to undertake to do every thing , - to take even the unbreeched philosophers , and teach them their A B C ? Or is it well that every primary and grammar school , and every academy in the country , // should be tied on to the tail of Harvard College , and the whole should constitute one grand hotchpot establishment , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can be required between the cradle and the grave ? In our opinion , this venerable institution will best serve the purposes for which it was founded , and the cause of letters and education generally , by adhering strictly to its legitimate work , by undertaking to give nothing more or less than that exact , thorough , and finished training which fits a man to perform honorably all the offices , both public and private , of peace and war . Its vocation is to send forth scholars , in the technical meaning of that word , - not mere practical chemists , or tolerable engineers , or scientific mechanics . These may be better schooled and exercised elsewhere . It is a misnomer that they should be called liberally educated , or university men . How many more trial institutions of this sort are to come under the care of the Corporation it is difficult to tell . rube late Mr. Bussey has left an immense estate , amounting probably to $ 350,000 , of which the college is soon to take possession , and devote one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School at Roxhury . The undergraduate department , or Harvard College proper , is not to receive one dollar from this grand bequest ; but its officers and governors , its Corporation and treasury , are to be burdened with the whole management and direction of it ; and if we may judge from the instances already given , the burden will be a very serious one . Professors are to be appointed who will lecture there on the rotation of crops and the mixing of manures , and teach ploughmen how to draw furrows straight , and graziers how to fatten oxen . Is not this a benefaction of a very doubtful character to the cause of liberal studies ? Is it not rather an injury than a benefit , considering the purposes for which Harvard College was instituted , and to which for a century and a half it was exclusively devoted ? It gives an outward , but wholly deceptive , appearance of prosperity to the institution . It enlarges its borders , and gratifies the honest pride of those who have the control of its affairs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the glories of their administration . But , as in the case of the annexation of Texas , Oregon , New Mexico , and California , the coming generation may have cause to wish that their predecessors // bad been less ambitious of extending their territories . The Divinity School was " annexed " only about thirty years ago , and it is generally admitted now , that it is a millstone about the neck of the college , and that the college in its turn is a fatal obstacle to the success of the school . The two can not flourish too*ether and the true friends of both heartily wish that they might be disjoined ; but this is impossible . The Medical School , luckily , is three miles off , and , in the main , takes care of itself ; though it has occasion every now and then to borrow some money of the parent institution , and some of its professors have to eke out their salaries by holding other offices in the college . The Law School alone flourishes like a green bay-tree ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the college , that it also could be removed to Boston , where more of its students could live at home , and all could attend the courts . It is evident , we think , that the college proper , the institution to which John Harvard gave his fortune and his name , is in danger of suffering the fate of the Roman maiden , Tarpeia , and being crushed by the weight of the ornaments of brass , simulating gold , which are heaped upon it . Notwithstanding the shower of benefactions that bas seemed recently to fall into its lap , it is actually poorer , weaker , and less efficient than it was many years ago . Thus , in 1835 , the " general stock , " or common fund of the college , exceeded $218,000 ; it is now less than $ 176,000 . At the former period , the " general expenses , " not including salaries , were but $ 4,843 ; last year they amounted to $ 7,374 . Again , the average number of students who graduated annually in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sixty-two and a fraction ; for the ten years ending last commencement , the average is not quite fifty-eight . Yet , in the interval between these two periods , the population of Boston has increased from 40,000 to nearly 120,000 ; and the increase in wealth and general intelligence , and the desire for a thorough education for the young , have been at least in equal proportion . If the college only performed the same proportion of the work of instruction for the neighbouring community which it did thirty years ago , the number of its students would now be half as large again as it was then , instead of being actually smaller . It is true that these facts may all be easily accounted for , without imputing blame to any one ; but they are none the // less significant and unwelcome to the friends of the institution ; they are none the less facts . The common fund has been diminished by the expense of building Gore Hall ; the general expenses have been increased by the immense enlargement of the business done under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of students was unusually great during the ten years ending in 1824 , because $ 2,500 a year , or one fourth of the State grant , was then appropriated to aid those in indigent circumstances . Though the college charges to the students have not been increased , - except in the matter of those " additional fees , " which are voluntary , however , as the students are not obliged to attend the lectures for which they are paid , - yet the expenses of living at Cambridge have been considerably enlarged , owing to the growth of the population and the rise in the value of property . Moreover , as the poorer class of students , who were formerly encouraged to come to Harvard by the aid they received from the State grant , have ceased to enter its classes , these are filled in a larger proportion by the sons of wealthy persons , and a different standard of expense , in regard to dress , pocket-money , furniture , &amp;c. , has been established , which renders it almost a hopeless matter for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be , also , that the desire in the community for a liberal education , technically so called , has been diminished , - that a full course of academic studies is no longer held in so high esteem as formerly , or deemed so necessary a passport for eminence or usefulness in life . If so , we regret the change more than any circumstance that has yet been mentioned ; and we fear that the college , if not in some measure accountable for it , has still been under its influence in most of those particulars to which we have just alluded . A taste for the cultivation of the physical sciences has of late gained ground throughout the civilized world , and especially in the United States , with wonderful rapidity ; and the necessary consequence has been , that classical learning , old-fashioned scholarship , literary pursuits , and the moral sciences are no longer held in so much estimation as before , and if they are not often openly decried , they are now seldom pursued with enthusiasm , and have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities were instituted more particularly for the prosecution of these " liberal studies , " // as they are termed ; though the physical sciences , for the last century or two , have very properly been admitted into the curriculum of academic exercises , the cultivation of the litterw humaniores has always been the special object and the crowning glory of these institutions . Harvard College , as we have seen , was almost exclusively devoted to them for the first century and a half of its existence . But what a change has taken place , chiefly within thirty years ! So many of the natural sciences have been crowded and jammed into the course of instruction , that the studonts are wearied and distracted by the number of the heterogeneous tasks imposed upon them , and learn nothing thoroughly . The oldfashioned studies have not been given up altogether ; but they have been pushed into a corner , and the student has his option with regard to many of them , during a large part of his college course , whether he will pursue them or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the students get a smattering of every thing and a knowledge of nothing . And still , as if tbe newly awakened scientific zeal and practical tendencies of the age had not yet suflicient room and dominion , the various outlying establishments of the college of which we have spoken have been created for their especial benefit . The cultivation of physical science , and even of the mechanic arts and trades , is the sole object of most of them . A young man , with no previous training but a common English education , may now enter the college as a " special student in chemistry " ; that is , he may make himself a good scientific chemist , - and nothing more . This object , certainly , is a very good one ; but the question is , whether a college or a university is just the place where facilities ought to be offered for its attainment . We have not room to consider here the causes of this sudden development of zeal in the prosecution of the natural sciences ; nor is it necessary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , the great reputation which many of their cultivators have consequently obtained , the perambulating associations for their advancement , and the belief that a knowledge of them may somehow be made directly profitable in the pursuit of riches , and that in studying them we are dealing with things , and not with mere words , are enough to account in great part for the high place they now hold in the public estimation . We are not going // to contest their right to that place , nor in any way to discuss the comparative claims of letters and science as objects of pursuit through life . This would be about as idle as to ask whether eating or drinking was more essential for the preservation of our animal existence . The only points are , whether a liberal education is either necessary or desirable for any class in a community like ours , - and whether any education can properly be termed liberal , that is , exact , comprehensive , and generous , from which classical learning , and a study of literature and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excluded . Certainly , a well-disciplined intellect , a cultivated taste , an enlightened conscience , some familiarity with the first principles and the vexed questions of philosophy and theology , some acquaintance with the languages and literature of modern Europe , some knowledge of pure mathematics , logic , general politics , history , philology , and political economy seem almost equally desirable , and even essential , for the future statesman , divine , lawyer , physician , and the men of other liberal callings . We would not push out astronomy , physics , chemistry , geology , and the several branches of natural history , in order to make room for these ; but neither should the former be excluded , so that these physical sciences may occupy the whole space , and monopolize the young student 's attention . The only practical question is , whether room can he found for all of them in the four years of an undergraduate course ; and if not , which of them can with least injury be put off to the end of the academic period , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which is to qualify a man for the particular walk in life that he has chosen . But we must quit entirely this branch of our subject , the full discussion of which would carry us far beyond our present limits . We have done no more than to state the question ; and this is all that is really needed , as most of those who are likely to see these remarks would agree with us as to the answer which should be given to it . Our object all along has been to set forth the wants of Harvard College proper , and its claims upon the public for patronage and support . The doors of the institution are not opened wide enough , considering the amount of treasure deposited within its walls . The machinery of instruction is there in great abundance . There is the noblest library on this side of the Atlantic there are apparatus and scientific collections , which are ampie // for all the purposes of the mere teacher ; there are professorships enough and to spare , most of them being filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments of letters and science . Why should not a much larger number of students profit by these unequalled advantages ? The college could receive twice as many as it now has , without the necessity of making any perceptible addition to its means of instruction . It is often as easy to teach many as to instruct a few ; it makes no difference to the professor whether he lectures to a dozen auditors , or to a hundred . It is no great object for the college , perhaps , that its halls and recitation-rooms should be filled ; the institution can support itself in its present state for an indefinite period , through the funds which are specifically appropriated to keep up its various offices . But it is of immense importance to the public generally , to the cause of education , to the State , that these rooms should be crowded to their utmost capacity . They would then be centres of intellectual light and heat , that would radiate to every corner of the Commonwealth . The sole reason why they are not thus crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambridge . For vastly the larger number of the youth of Massachusetts , the effect of this high cost is just the same as if the institution were a thousand miles off . There the college is , - an admirable institution , and an education within its walls is very desirable but they are not able to take so long a journey . Reduce the cost , and you bring the college home to them , to their very doors . But how can this be effected ? The charge for tuition is but a part , and not a very large one , of the whole bill . It is but seventy-five dollars a year , while the expenses of board , rent , fuel , clothes , books , and other incidentals make up nearly three hundred dollars more . If the former charge were struck off altogether , it would have no great effect towards opening the institution to poorer students ; and for most of those who now form the classes at Harvard , it is not desirable that it should be struck off . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and willing to pay a full equivalent for what they receive ; and the present charge is not one third of what the instruction actually costs , or of what it is worth . Neither are we in favor of granting aid indiscriminately to indigent students from a beneficiary fund . This would be marking them out , - stigmatizing them , they would think , - as // objects of charity . If , in point both of character and ability , they are fit objects of a university education , they are entitled to receive one from the State ; it should be given to them , not as alms , but as their due . Their right to it is of the same general character with that of every child in the Commonwealth to admission to the common school ; it is hardly more for their interest than for that of the public , that they should receive it . They should be paid what is necessary in order that they may attain it , just as the national government pays the cadets to come to West Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world can afford . On the other hand , if they are indolent , wayward , or dull , beneficiary money is thrown away upon them ; they should be sent home , and initiated in other pursuits , for which academic studies are no necessary preparation . We know of no other mode of remedying the evil now complained of but the establishment at the colleges in this State of a sufficient number of scholarships , somewhat like those which have long existed at Oxford and Cambridge in England , and which in the Scotch universities are called bursaries . The income of one of these offices should be large enough to defray all the necessary expenses of a student at college ; $ 300 a year at Harvard would probably do no more towards this end than $ 200 at Amherst or at Williamstown . No one should be allowed to become a candidate for a scholarship , who did not need pecuniary aid to enable him to remain in college , and who did not belong to the first half of the class in academic rank , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the applicants thus qualified the scholarships should be distributed in due order according to their relative merit , as ascertained by a severe examination . When obtained , they should be held only for a year , unless the incumbent , at the end of that time , after again inviting all competitors into the ring , could make good his claim to one of the scholarships attached to the next higher class . Thus , if twenty of these offices should be established at Harvard , there would be five for each class . Those belonging to the Freshman year should be given to the five applicants , needing the income of the office , who should appear best at the preliminary exaniination for admission to college ; provided , however , that the general result of the trial showed that they were as well qualified to enter as the best half of the // whole number examined . Those who succeeded in this competition would be provided for during the Freshman year , and then they might become competitors for the five Sophomore scholarships ; and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is evident , would be offices both of honor and emolument , and not mere beneficiary establishments ; each one would be a fit reward of past exertion , and a stimulus to future effort . They could not be held either by drones or dullards . The salaries attached to them would be on the same footing with the pay of the professors ; they would be earnings , not alms , - dignities , not badges of poverty . The creation of a sufficient number of them would at once popularize the whole system of college education in the State ; they would do away with the injurious distinction which now exists between the colleges and the common schools , - the former being exclusively for the rich , or the moderately wealthy , the latter being filled in the main by the poor . Their influence , in fact , would be nearly as great on the lower seminaries of learning , the academies and common schools , as on the colleges themselves . Every boy in Massachusetts , however indigent and obscure his position , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble ambition , would know that a university education was open to him , a full course of liberal studies , obtained with high honor , and a full support secured to him while prosecuting them . At the same time , the openness of the competition and the severity of the trial would effectually separate the bran from the wheat , and those who had mistaken a mere dislike of manual labor for a call to higher and more intellectual pursuits would find it necessary to fall back upon the avocations for which alone nature had qualified them . Individuals and societies , who often receive applications to aid indigent young men in their classical studies , and frequently see cause to doubt whether it would be an act of real kindness to comply with the request , would be relieved at once from this uncertainty , if there were a good number of scholarships in our several colleges . I ' hey could then say , that to real merit and unquestionable ability the path was entirely open , and there was no need of asking charity to smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feelings of the meritorious and the capable , by relieving them even from the appearance // of accepting alms ; while it would confine arrogant mediocrity and ambitious littleness within their appropriate sphere of action . The effect on the colleges themselves would be most beneficial . rVhe number of students would be largely increased , for the hope of gaining so brilliant a prize would draw together many competitors for every scholarship that was established and the additional fees for tuition thus received would swell the funds of the institution without any thing like a proportionate increase of its expenses . At present , the machinery and appliances of instruction in each of these seminaries are large and costly out of all proportion with the amount of work actually done , or with the number of educated men annually sent forth into the community . The means of instruction in every department of science and letters must be provided , whether there are a dozen or a hundred students to profit by them . There is not raw material enough to employ more than half of the motive power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is bad economy . Harvard , for instance , pays over $ 28,000 annually to its professors and other officers , and would not pay $ 2,000 more , if the number of its students were doubled ; it would not pay $ 5,000 less , if it had no students at all , for its permanent funds , for ever appropriated to the support of the academic department , produce an income of nearly $24,000 . Since the beginning of the present century , less than $ 5,000 has been given to the college by individuals for the purpose of adding to the number of students in the academical department , or for increasing the raw material ; while the private donations to enlarge the means of instruction in that department , and to build up the professional schools , have amounted to $ 700,000 . But which is the more advantageous use of money , - to give forty thousand dollars to establish a new professorship , which is not wanted , because there are already more instructors than there are opportunities to teach , or to appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there may be at least one person more to profit by the professorships already created ? Far more important , however , than any pecuniary results , would be the effect of the proposed foundations on the zeal and industry of the students themselves , and on the whole air of the place considered as the seat of liberal studies . Coinpetition // kindled , by the prospect of such honors and emoluinents would raise a flame in the most sluggish bosom , and stir up all its energies for the generous strife . Nor would the excitement be confined to those alone whose limited means enabled them to enter the arena and compete for a scholarship . Enthusiasm in any cause among the young is always contagious ; and the candidates for scholarships , if the plan were fully carried out , would be numerous enough to govern the tone of feeling and action in the whole class . Now , so large a portion of every class is composed of those whose position in life makes them independent of scholastic honors , and who consider a college diploma only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indolent , reckless , and dissipated habits often become fashionable among the whole body of undergraduates , and many are drawn into the vortex whose natural tastes incline in the opposite direction . The few who have firmness and ambition enough to adhere to the proper pursuits of the place form a small band by themselves , and , far from having influence with their fellows , they become isolated even by their studious habits , and are pelted with nicknames and exposed to a constant shower of undergraduate gibes . The establishment of scholarships enough would enlarge this band into a majority of the whole number , and turn the stream of opinion and action the other way . Those who know from experience the gregarious tendencies and contagious excitements of college life will hardly consider this picture as exaggerated , or that there is little likelihood of effecting a change in it , if so powerful a cause should be put in operation . A year ago , the several colleges in this Commonwealth united in a memorial to the legislature , asking that a fund might be created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already filled the fund for common schools up to the limit which was first proposed for it , and made it quite as large , in the opinion of the best friends of these schools , as is at all desirable . The application failed , probably because the legislature did not think fit to make a large grant from the public funds to chartered and independent institutions , to be used for purposes that were not specified . We learn that the application is to be renewed this year , with a request that the whole fund may be appropriated for the aid of indigent students . If so , we hope it may succeed , espe11 * // cially if the aid be given through the establishment of such scholarships as are here proposed ; since there is no reason why those who are indigent , indeed , but also sluggish , wayxvard , or feeble , should be encouraged to seek a liberal education , or be supported by the public bounty . The foundation of a sufficient number of State scholarships in every college in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with their noble libraries and abundant means of learning and instruction , to every capable and ambitious boy in the State , however poor and humble , would be indeed a splendid act of public munificence , second only to that memorable vote of the General Court in 1636 , which appropriated a whole year 's income of the Colony to laying the foundation of Harvard College . It would be no less politic than liberal ; for the good to be obtained by the objects of the act , by the youth for whom the scholarships are intended , would be proportioned not merely to the sum thus directly granted to them , but to this sum added to the large accumulations of public and private munificence for many years , which have made these institutions such rich storehouses of all the apparatus of learning and science . It would be giving a little that they might have the benefit of much . And what act could be more consonant with the entire framework of our civil polity , with the genius of our republican institutions , than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those higher seminaries of learning which have hitherto been confined almost entirely to a privileged class , which have existed in the main only for the rich , or for those who could find liberal and influential friends ? It would be fostering the cause of liberal studies , and at the same time spreading the generous influences of them broadcast over the whole community . The benefaction , we have already said , would be almost as sensibly felt by the common schools and academies as by the institutions to which it was immediately directed . Every ambitious boy in these lower seminaries would see a splendid prize suspended before him to stimulate his exertions , and no accidents of birth or fortune could lessen his chance of obtaining it . The higher walks of professional life , the honors of the pulpit , the bar , and the senate , would be as open to him , and with equal advantages of thorough classical training for them , as to the son of the wealthiest man in the State , provided only that he had the talents and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances , in leaving the plough , the warehouse , or the loom . Massachusetts had not the honor of taking the lead in the reform of common schools , though she has nobly followed the example placed before her in this respect by one of the monarchies of the Old World . But she has the opportunity now of being the first to offer the advantages of a full course of university training to every one of her sons who is able to profit by it , and thus of making her colleges virtually as free as her elementary schools . And no great exertion or sacrifice is necessary to secure these ends . The sum required is not very large , and it can be raised without taking a dollar from the revenues that have sufficed for the last twelve years to meet all the general expenses of the State . The proceeds of the sale of the pu*Aic lands in Maine are no longer needed for the common school fund , which has reached its limit ; in a few years more , there might be amassed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is all that is needed . The income of this fund would be enough to maintain forty State scholarships at Harvard , and thirty each at Amherst and Williamstown , one of which would defray all the necessary annual expenditure of a student at either of these institutions . Few will doubt that the good to be effected by these foundations will largely exceed their moderate cost . In no way could the public bounty be more effectually applied to aid the cause both of liberal studies and elementary instruction , to elevate the character of the people , to protect the interests of science , religion , and letters , and to promote the reputation of the Commonwealth . Six years ago , before the project of a university fund to be created by the State was formed , we urged the private benefactors of our colleges to turn their liberality towards the foundation of scholarships , as the most effectual means of increasing the usefulness of these institutions . As we still hope that this scheme may be partly carried into effect by individuals , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must excuse us for placing before them a short extract from the argument which we presented on the former occasion . " Dr. Wayland remarks in strong language on the want of stimulants to exertion in our colleges , a want which we see no means // of supplying , except by the method just proposed . The rich endowments of the English universities enable them to hold up numerous scholarships , fellowships , and situations in the Church , as the fit and even magnificent prizes that await distinguished scholars ; and , defective in other respects as the system of these establishments is , the good actually accomplished by them must be attributed almost entirely to these noble rewards of industry and talent . In France and Germany , numerous and honorable offices in the seminaries themselves and under government are the almost sure recompense of distinguished pupils . ln the United States , we have nothing of the kind . A scale of rank , it is true , is kept in the interior of the college ; but it becomes known beyond the walls only on Commencement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the completion of his course is felt as a transient pleasure by his relatives and friends , though it is productive of no solid or permanent results . Even the first honors of a class are perceived to be a flattering , rather than profitable distinction , and destined to be soon forgotten . No wonder that many students of considerable ability decline to engage in such a fruitless race , and even refuse the honors when offered to them . But let a sufficient number of scholarships be endowed , and the spur would be felt by every member of the institution . The cost of founding one would not be more than one fifth of the expense of establishing a professorship , and the name of the donor would be for ever connected with the most efficient means of promoting the welfare of the seminary , and advancing the interests of letters . To preserve the importance aud respectability of the scholarships , they should be rather few in number , than small in profit ; but the beneficial effects of their establishment would not be perceived to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an influence through the whole body of the students . Founders who are much interested in a particular science might confine the benefit of their funds to pupils distinguished only in their favorite study ; but the best interests of letters and education require that the bulk of the prizes should be given for general scholarship . If this scheme could be carried into effect , we believe that a new spirit would be awakened among the students , and a new chapter commenced in the history of American colleges . The operose machinery of exhibitions and commencements , affording very insufficient proof of industry and learning , might be done away , and rigid examinations , closed by the formal award of the merited scholarships , be the only public , as they are the proper , tests of the efficiency of the institution . "
