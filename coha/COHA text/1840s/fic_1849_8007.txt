Higginson , Thomas Wentworth , 1823-1911 : THE TWOFOLD BEING . from The twofold being ( 1849 ) The dew of youth on her pure brow lay ; Her smile was the dawn of Spring 's softest day ; Spring 's rosy light was on all her way . She seem 'd an oasis in desert lands ; We thank 'd God for her with lifted hands , Then turn 'd again to the weary sands . But Life came on with its withering glare , And swept down all the sweet beauty there , And left the fount dry and the branches bare . When I look 'd again on her alter 'd face , The glow had all vanish 'd , and left no trace ,  --  Not a lingering gleam of her maiden grace . Yet that form , as in earliest beauty fair , Can my mind shape out , in this evening air : Not a trait , not a shadow , is wanting there . So now two beings for one I find ; One walks on earth , one lives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . O Seer ! which the reality ?  --  The beauty , all gone ere again I could see ; Or this vision my soul hath eternally ! Yet there may be more than the eye can scan : Have such bright creations no wider plan ? Doth God love the beautiful less than Man ? It seems as if nothing could fill our dearth ; But the beauty that stayed not on dark cold earth May have fled again to the land of its birth . It fled the pangs of life 's constant rack ; But , when the soul takes the heavenward track , It shall come like a sweet child nestling back . For the loveliness that Earth 's fairest wear Must be one and the same with the beauty there Of the transfigured angels of heavenly air . And the parted soul shall take its stand In familiar guise ' mid the sister-band ,  --  Deck 'd with the glory of God 's right hand . And for us , when the walls of flesh are riven , And to open 'd spirit-eyes is given To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fathomless joys of that wondrous scene , Will come once more the presence serene Of that pure beauty 's unearthly mien . Then shall Time 's veil uplifted be , And our life 's long dreams of anxiety , Like clouds o'er a sunny hill , shall flee . And it will be seen by the spirits pure , How little is left upon earth to endure , When we learn that all which is fair is sure .
