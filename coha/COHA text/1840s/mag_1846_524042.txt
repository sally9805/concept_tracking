txt THE PREss ! what a moral and social power is comprised in that term ! The PREss ! a sceptre swayed by an invisible hand ! The PRESS ! a throne on which a veiled prophet is seated ! The PRESS ! a sovereign whose mighty behests are without appeal ! a tribunal whose decrees , like those of Providence , execute themselves ! an impersonal despot , exercising without definite responsibility self-created power ! Is the press one estate of the realm ? It is unrecognized and unacknowledged by the technicalities of the Constitution . Its existence is only connived at ! Some that have felt its potency , have called it the fourth power . In practical truth , and actuality , it is the first power of the state ! Sovereign , Lords , Commons , and-the Pauss ! The order of formal announcement is the inverse of their actual importance . The most insignificant takes the leadthe place of power is in the rear . To behold this mighty intellectual engine of human advancement surrounded with all the accessories which can augment its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once allied with unlimited power of capital , mental agencies of the first order , enterprise which acknowledges no limits , and a perfect emancipation from the trammels of censorship-we must , in a word , look to LONDON . The original object of a journal was the collection and circulation of " news . " News ! that is to say , information of those current events in which the puhlic feels an interest . Hence a journal was called a " Newspaper . " This is still , and will ever continue to be , one of the chief , if not the most important , of its functions . But besides being a register of passing events , it has become a commentator upon them . It is a judge as well as a recorder . It is a self-constituted tribunal , to whose sentence all are amenable . It is the most // efficient of tribunals , because the sentence itself constitutes the punishment . its punishments are inevitable , so long as its decisions are in accordance with that law of which it is the administrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further , a prognosticator of approaching events . With the character of the judge , it combines that of the prophet . Yet , like other prophets , it often appears to predict , when it only announces that of which it has secret means of information . It often , therefore , seems to lead public opinion when it really follows it . The light it sheds on public questions is sometimes only reflected . Its rays , collected from innumerable scattered and unperceived sources among thatvery public itself , are sent back in a condensed and concentrated state . The Press is to the scattered and divergent rays of public intelligence what the burning-glass is to those of the sun . It brings them to a definite focus , where their concentrated power exercises a force to which the most obdu rate substances yield . But public opinion is divided on all questions of general interest , and especially on political questions . Each great p arty finds its appropriate organ in the Press ; and sometimes , as in the case of the Parisian Press , every nuance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more limited in the London Press , owing tot he vast capital necessary to establish and sustain a daily newspaper . Parties , also , in England are more ready to compromise differences , for the sake of the strength gained by cooperation . Newspapers are less multifarious , therefore ; and more capital being devoted to the management of each individual journal , and the paper being sold at a higher price , there is a possibility of securing higher and more various talent in its conduct and direction . The morning papers of London are the great organs and interpreters of public opinion in England . Of these , the PosT is the exponent of the high Tory aristocracy , and eminently the organ of the beau monde . More than half its readers take it up without reference to its political lucubrations . Its leading articles , or editorials , as we call them in America , are characterized by a rabid spirit of bitter and Sept. unscrupulous personality . It is the unbending supporter of all those traditions of the aristocratical oligarchy , which are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The columns of this journal are open to the contributions of those members of the rigid Conservative party , who think they can more eflectually give vent to their opinions and feelings in that way than in the House ; and these diatribes are issued by the fashionable journal under editorial responsibility . Some of the most virulent of these personalities are understood to proceed from the retired Secretary of the Admiralty of the Tories , the Right Honorable John Wilson Croker . This gentleman , who is now enjoying the otium cum dignit ate upon a large pension , to which he became entitled on retiring , after above twenty years spent in the public service , belongs to that class which , in England , are somewhat illiberally stigmatized by the title of political adventurers , or trading politicians . He was originally at the Irish bar . A practitioner at the Irish bar , was on the point of our pen ; but , alas ! we forgot the wide and mournful distinction between simply being at the bar , and practicing there . Mr. Croker was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . He was known in Dublin chiefly by the publication of a lively satirical criticism in verse on the drama called " Familiar Epistles to George Frederick Jones , " who was then proprietor of the Dublin Theatre . Having succeeded in getting the favor of an aristocratic patron , he was returned to the Imperial Parliament for one of the nomination boroughs , where he soon signalized himself by his advocacy of his Royal Highness the Duke of York , in the delicate investigation promoted by Colonel Wondle ; which , notwithstanding the clear truth and justice of the case , ended in the discomfiture arid ultimate ruin of that officer , and the promotion of the Irish member to the office of Secretary of the Admiralty . The more serious of the political effusions from the pen of this writer , find a place in the Quarterly Review ; and those of mere temporary and passing interest , appear in the culumns of the Morning Post . * $ Mr. Croker is also known in literature by his edition of Boswell 's Life of *5ohnson ; by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation . // The MORNING HERALD has varied much , from time to time , in its politics . At present , its Toryism is not less rabid or virulent than that of the Post ; and it aims at sharing the fashionable circulation of that journal . It affects to be the organ of the Humanity party , under which term are comprised the advocates for the abolition of Slavery , the abolition of Capital Punishment , and the mitigation of penal enactments . In religious matters , it represents the Church of England party , in its lower section , the high church being taken more exclusively under the fostering wing of the Post . The former p aper , accordingly , deals roughly with the P useyltes , whom the latter handles more tenderly .

The STANDARD is an evening paper ; the acknowledged organ of the High Church party , and commanding general respect for the talent with which it is conducted , and for the example it offers of the possibility of taking a strong political tone without forgetting the amenities which should mark the conduct of opponents towards each other in the contest . This paper is conducted by an Irish gentleman , Dr. Gifford , the son of one whose name was rendered memorable in the civil distractions which prevailed in Ireland in the year 1798 . Whatever faults may be ascribed to the father , even his bitterest public opponents can not say they have descended on the son . This paper was formerly noted for editorial articles of much merit , exhibiting high classical acquirements , which proceeded from the pen of another son of green Erin , the late Dr. Maginn , who co*perated for several years as assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and always has been , an organ of the liberal party , inclining to those opinions which in England are characterized as radical ; and although giving general support to the Whig party , yet it is unsparing in its 283 censures when that p*irty wavers in the onward course of reform . In short , the Chronicle is a moderate Radical paper , stopping short , however , of universal suffrage and chartism . The GLOBE , an evening paper , has always been the recognized organ of the Whig party , and is notable for nothing else . It derives its support from the subscriptions it receives from the Whig aristocracy and their connections throughout the country . The SUN , another evening paper , advocates the same opinions , and represents the same party , as the Chronicle . We now come to the great leviathan of the Press , celebrated wherever journalism is known or a Press spoken ofTHE TIMES . The Times office is one of the lions of London , to which distinguished strangers are taken , as they are taken to see St. Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , the Times consisted of a single sheet of four pages , of the largest size . Its arrangements for the supply of intelligence being extended , and its advertising business being considerably increased , the size of the paper was , about that time , enlarged ; and printing presses were brought into operation sufficiently large to work off a double sheet , with the same expedition and at the same cost as a single sheet had been previously worked . The magnitude of the paper was then enlarged to eight pages , of the largest size . Within the last two years , the general extension of commerce in England , and more especially the vast extent of railway projects which were brought before the public , increased the demand for advertising space to such an extent , that a further enlargement of the paper became necessary , and a supplement , consisting generally of a second double sheet , was added , thus augmenting the paper to sixteen pages , each of which consists of six columns . Each of these columns consists of two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of a common octavo page ; and since the pages of octavo volumes , printed with the usual closeness , contain about forty lines , it follows that each column of the Times contains as much printed matter as would nearly fill six such pages ; and that the usual double number of that paper , now published daily , contains as much printed matter as would be sufficient // to fill about six hundred pages of an octavo volume , printed with the ordinary closeness . * This matter is collected , composed , written out , set in type , corrected , made up into columns , then into pages , set in forms , and worked off , to a number varying from twenty five to fifty thousand , t according to the demand , all within the space of each succeeding twenty-four hours . And this prodigious intellectual and mechanical result is obtained daily through the year , Sundays excepted . The editorial department of the Times varies to some extent , from time to time , according to the capacity , talents and acquirements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usuallydistributed among three persons , one of whom takes charge of the home department of politics and intelligence , the second , of the foreign and colonial matters , and the third , of commerce and the money market , including the daily article devoted to city affairs and the Stock Exchange . There is a director , whose duty is to attend to the making up of the l ) aper , the proper arrangement of its contents , the communications of correspondents , and other obvious matters of business . The munificence with which those who devote their talents to this journal are rewarded , may be judged from the fact that the three principal editors are allowed each about a thousand pounds a year . Under the foreign editor is the corps of foreign correspondents . This is a department in which the Times stands quite unrivaled . A salaried correspondent is stationed in each of the chief cities of Europe , as well as in other quarters of the globe , whence any information of public interest may be looked for . The correspondents discharge towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge d'affaires at foreign courts discharge towards the British Government . They are usually so accredited , and put in such relation with influential persons in the places where they are respectively stationed , and above all , are so liberally empowered to reward those who may supply them with early and important intelligence , that they constitute the chief means by which this remarkable journal has acquired and sus tamed its character as a source of early and correct information on foreign subjects . The scale on which this system of correspondence is maintained , may be judged from the fact that in Paris the correspondent of the Times keeps a bureau , in which three assistants are continually employed in translation , transcription , and the other details of the business of the paper . Between this bureau and the London office expresses are sent whenever they are found necessary . These expresses have passed two or three times a week during the present year . On the arrival of the India mail at Alexandria , an agent is authorized to run an express to London , which outstrips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days . This machinery for the rapi&amp;supply of foreign intelligence is not peculiar to the Times , although that journal uses it on a more liberal and efficient scale than other papers . All the London morning papers keep salaried correspondents in several chief cities of Europe , and occasionally run expresses , when important intelligence is expected . The immense revenue of the Times , however , gives it the power of resorting to these means of information on a much grander scale than any other journal . The press used for printing the Times is capable of working off the paper at the incredible rate of six thousand impressions per hour , being little less than two per second . One side of the paper is set in type in the early part of the evening ; a portion of the columns of the other side being reserved for the reports , or intelligence which may arrive in the course of the night , matter being always ready set up in columns , which may be inserted or postponed , according to the quantity of the intelligence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is the custom of both Houses , and more particularly of the Commons , to continue their debates to a late hour of the night , or rather , to an early hour of the morning . And it almost invariably happens that the speeches most imAeresting to the public , are those delivered at the latest hour . The report of these , nevertheless , * The magnitude of each page of the Times is 24 inches long by 16 inches wide . Each page consists of six columns . t On the day after Sir Robert Peels opening speech on the Corn Laws , fifty-four thousand copies of the Times were circulated . // always appears in the morning papers , which are published between six and seven o'clock . In cases in which an important debate begins at an early hour in the evening , the commencement of it appears in the evening papers . In connection with this , some amusing anecdotes are current . Thus , by the celerity of railway transport , it happens often that one part of a debate is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from London before the debate itself is finished The celebrated oration of Brougham on Law Reform was commenced at half- past five in the afternoon , and was not terminated until a little before midnight . One half of this speech was reported , printed in the evening papers , dispatched to the country by the night coaches , ( railways did not then exist , ) and read at twenty 4 miles from the town before the speaker had concluded the other half ! The " Reporters " constitute a most important body in connection with the London Press . In the best organized papers , and especially the Times , these functionaries are grouped in several distinct classes , requiring different capabilities , having different responsibilities , and differently paid . The Parliamentary reporters are the first of the class . It isan error to suppose that their duty is the mere mechanical process of transferring to paper in stenographic characters the words of the speakers . All the superficial space of all the papers in London would not afford room for a report of that kind . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce ; and this must be done off-hand . He must have tact and quickness to give the essence of the speech . What is important and striking must be retained ; the less material wholly omitted . That words may not be put into the mouth of the speaker which may be disclaimed , the report is usually given in the third person . Jo the case of speeches of great importance , delivered by Parliaroentary leaders , or in the cases of occasional bursts of eloquence , or in strong personal invectives , the passage is given verbally , in the first person , and usually with surprising fidelity and accuracy . The scholarship of reporters is often exhibited by the readiness with which they take up and report classical quotations , under circumstances in which it is evident the author quoted can not be referred to . This , however , is not always a test of classical familiarity . The reporters have always messengers at their command , by whom , after , or even during the debate , they communicate with the members , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents of importance are read by members in their speeches , they are always given verbatim in the reports . In this case it is customary with members to come to the House provided with duplicate copies of each document for the reporters . Parliamentary speakers generally but not invariably speak extempore in the only sense of that term in which any orator ever does so . That is to say they prepare the substance and outline of the plan of their speeches , leaving the language in which the statements and arguments are to be clothed to the suggestion of the moment . ln some cases , however , particular passages are written and committed to memory . Thus it is said that Brougham wrote the peroration of his speech on Law Reform three or four times , elaborating every word of it with all the care bestowed on the composition of an ode or an elegy . Yet when he delivered it he misplaced one word and ( in his own estimation ) spoiled it . In more rare instances the entire speech is deliberately written and committed verbally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Shiel , and alxm*ays the case with his great speeches . In these cases where speeches or parts of speeches are previously written by the speaker , a copy of the speech is generally given to the reporter of the journal which advocates the same political opinions as the orator . Ludicrous circumstances have sometimes occurred from this practice . On the occasion of a great meeting to be held in a populous district of England , Mr. Shiel was expected to deliver an important oration , which should display in a striking manner his peculiar oratorical gifts . As usual , he wrote the speech in his study in London , committed it to memory and sent the manuscript of it to the Morning Chronicle just before he left town for the place of meeting . A disturbance , however , unexpectedly broke out on the ground , which deprived the orator of the opportunity of giving vent to the intended speech , and , as there were then no railways , it was too late to send to London to countermand the report , and it accordingly appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinite // amusement of the opponents of the honorable gentleman . The Parliamentary reporters of the leading journals work by relays . The number employed by each journal varies according to the general efficiency of its arrangements , the capital embarked in it , and the revenues it dispenses . Some of the morning pnpers employ ten , some twelve , and some as many as sixteen parliamentary reporters . Let us take for example the case of a journal employing twelve . At the opening of the Houses one of these gentlemen takes his seat in the gallery of the Commons , and another in that of the Lords . After an interval of forty-five minutes these two rise and start for the office of the paper , being instantly replaced by two others who are in waiting for that purpose . After the lapse of another forty-five minutes , these last start off and are replaced by a third pair , and this succession goes on until the whole corps of twelve are exhausted ; after which the pair who began the evening commence another " turn , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If both Houses continue in their debates so long , such a corps will discharge the duty for four hours and a half before the first reporters are called on for a second " turn . " But this does not often happen . One House ( generally the Lords ) closes its debate before the six reporters allotted to it are worked out , in which case the balance attach themselves to the batch allotted to the Commons , and thus protract the interval between the successive " turns " of the same hands in that House . It may be asked why so great a number of reporters are necessary . It must be remembered that the writing out of the notes which are taken during three quarters of an hour 's debate occupies a much longer time than the debate itself . Thus it will happen that what has been noted down in forty-five minutes will occupy three or four hours in writing out for the press . It happens notunfrequently that the entire interval between two successive turns of the same reporter is insufficient for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged to postpone the remainder until after his next " turn . " Reporters exercise a discretion as to the length and completeness proper to be given to the speeches of different mem hers ; and happy is the man whose " turn " falls on some one or more longwinded , prosing country gentleman , or some one of those speakers whose force lies in repetition of the same arguments again and again in different words . When such rise the reporter lays down his pen with a gratified air and thankful look , raises his person , rubs his hands and stretches his legs . Notes are altogether superfluous . He merely listens to the diluted oration , gathers its substance if it have any , and on returning to the office writes down , in half a dozen lines , " What this little little speech was about-bout*bout2** In the language of the Gallery a " heavy turn " falls to the lot of him who has to report the speeches of Sir Robert Peel , Lord John Russell , Lord Stanley , Lord I3rougham , the Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other of those names to which the reader of the morning paper is sure to look , and every word of whose tongue anxious thousands will ponder on . Here the reporter must put his shoulder to the collar and really work in the traces. , Here no abridgement can be tolerated , and if the occasion he important the first person must be used and the speech given verbatim . This reporter has a hard " turn , " for the whole interval between it and the next " turn " is insufficient for what he has to write out . But cases occur which are harder still , In reporting speakers such as we have just referred to , there is some little satisfaction felt in the dignity and importance of the speech and the occasion , and in the ' consciousness of the vast number who will next morning read what has cost so much painful labor to provide . Where , however , a dull and spiritless millionaire , ambitious of notoriety without the talent to acquire legitimate reputation , happens to be a part proprietor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dire necessity weighs on the unfortunate scribe , compelling him to give word for word that which has not received the attention of any individual within the walls of the house except the unhappy reporter himself . Among the prizes which occasionally fall to reporters we must not forget to mention divisions . When the House divides , the members on each side of the * Moore 's Two-penny Post-bag . Abbott 's speech against Catholic Emancipation . // question go out at separate doors , the " ayes " at one and the " noes " at another . They are counted as they make their exit and their names taken down . This operation occupies generally half an hour , just two-thirds of a " turn . " But the greatest godsend to the poor reporters is the " counting out . " By the rules of the House forty members are necessary to form a quorum of the Coinmons . It is competent for any member present , whenever he thinks that less than forty members are present , to move " that the House he counted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove to be under forty the meeting is zipso facto dissolved . On such occasions curious scenes are presented in St. Stephens . When the speakers who are expected to address the House between the hours of seven and nine offer no very strong attractions , the members who are perhaps waiting for the next question find a lounge in the lobbies , a chat in the waiting-rooms , an amusing volume or a newspaper in the library , or a maintenon cutlet and a flask of champagne at Bellamy 's , infinitely more agreeable than a seat in the benches listening or trying not to listen to the balbutiating of some west country Baronet . The House in one sense of that word is pretty full . But the members who fill it are not in their " places " in the parliamentary sense of that term . Some malicious member suddenly rises and moves that the House be counted . Messengers who are kept by the cabinet in waiting for the purpose rush with breathless haste to all parts of the House , lobbies , waitingrooms , libraries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and before the doors can be closed for the " counting " the necessary forty is made up to the infinite vexation of the gentlemen in the gallery who expected a release . This class of reporters are , as they ought to be , well remunerated , at least on the most respectably conducted morning journals . Five or six guineas a week can not be regarded as excessive compensation for such labor and responsibility , and such exhaustion both of body and mind . Although this occupation does not directly and necessarily lead to professional advancement , yet it affords occasional opportunities of which genius has often availed itself It boasts of having counted among its members the most distinguished ornaments of the Bench . The late Chief Justice of the Queen 's Bench , Lord Ahinger , was formerly a reporter . The Law Reporters form a class not less respectable , though , in the interests of Journalism , less important than those who report the debates . Barristers who have not yet acquired sufficient practice , usually avail themselves of this occupation , being consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many find very convenient . The reports of the proceedings of the courts of justice are thus supplied . The Police Reporters are of the lowest caste . The papers do not always employ expressly such functionaries . They report independently , selling their versions of the proceedings to any and all journals that will huy them . Finally , at the foot of the scale , stand the penny-a-liners , a class whose peculiar province it is to collect the particulars of accidents and offences , and in general of all incidents occurring , the mention of which in a journal is interesting to the public . The name of this class is derived from a practice which some journals pursued of paying for the intelligence supplied hy such collectors at the rate of a penny per line . It will be evident that this branch of the business of Journalism is subject to various sonrces of abuse . The more respectable papers of London endeavor to protect themselves against these evils by accepting such intelligence only from reporters with whom they are well acquainted , and over whose good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives them . Thus , even in this humble department of intellectual labor , character does not absolutely go for nothing . Of the wonderful fidelity of the London reporters , especially those who attend the houses of Parliament , and all great political meetings , many examples may be given . Members of both Houses have on various occasions brought the printers of the leading journals to the bar of the House for alleged misreporting of their speeches , but in almost every such case , the journalist has come off triumphant . Lord Limerick and Mr. George Dawsoa successively brought the " Times " to the bar in this way ; but on the members who had been present being appealed to , they declared that the reporter had given the passages complained of verbatim , as spoken . The abuses of reporting are more particularly // prevalent in the police department . Some papers have allowed a certain license to their police reporters , to be exercised under discretion , by which a coloring moreor less humorous or pathetic , as the case might be , was recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first developed in this department of journalism . The police reports of the Morning Herald were at one time read with as much interest as the Pickwick papers since excited . This practice , however , has been condemned by the more reputable papers , and is not now pursued . There is , however , a much more serious abuse incidental to police reporting , and which the most sincere efforts of even the most respectable journals can not entirely repress . In cases in which parties are so unfortunate as to be brought before a police office , whose position in life , or whose sex , renders them more than commonly sensitive to the publication of their names in a newspaper , it sometimes happens that the reporter , not being above such proceedings , prepares a report , in which the case is highly colored , and the names of the parties introduced in the manner which he imagines would most wound their feelings . This is dexterously introduced to the eye of the parties before it is sent to the newspaper , and it rarely happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppression or modification of the report . This abuse has been much fostered where a single reporter only attends a police office . But even the competition of two or more is no effectual preventive to the abuse , since a mutual agreement to share the fees thus exacted , leaves the evil flourishing in all its vigor . Still , much may be and has been done by the integrity of the conductors of the leading daily papers in suppressing this nuisance . It may be truly stated that there is at present no daily paper in which such abuses are practiced . But if the abuse of suppression be subdued or mitigated in the daily press , the more colossal nuisance of extortion by menace is carried to a frightful extent in the conduct of certain well-known weekly papers . These journals drive a double trade of infamy . Not only do they pander to the basest propensities of their readers by circulating foul personalities and obscene slanders , accompanied by the names of individuals , but they carry on the traffic of black-mail to an extent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world can afford a like example . Agents from these journals find means of communicating with those who , having the means of gratifying their demands , are either by nervon* temperament or by imprudences of conduct obnoxious to exposure . The late Duchess of St. Albans was extensively victimized in this way . The agent usually calls on the timid victim , or addresses a letter , informing him or her that certain reports have reached the editor , which can not be excluded from the columns of the paper unless immediate and effective steps be taken for that purpose . The extortionate demand is generally complied with . It might be supposed that journals notorious for a traffic so ntrocious , would be excluded from all places of respectable resort , and that no decent family would permit them to be received in their house . Our American readers will , however , be surprised to learn , that these papers are received in every club in London-are received in aristocratic houses-that the day of their publication is the Sabbath , and that one of them is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be , however , a great mistake as well as a great injustice to confound all the weekly papers in this condemnation . The Examiner and the spectator , both of Which appear on Saturdays , are models of journalism . The editorial articles in the former are well known for their elegance of style and the brilliancy of their wit . These are from the pen of Mr. Albany Foablanque , who is also proprietor of that paper . The proprietorship of the London journals is , however , in general , ( indeed we believe invariably with the exception just mentioned , ) distinct from the editorship . The editors are salaried functionaries . Those of the leading daily papers are either promoted from provincial journals , or rise by degrees from being reporters to be correspondents and assistants in various grades , ultimately rising to the editorial chair . Mr. Barnes , who was for many years principal editor of the " Times , " was a graduate of Cambridge , and had been a reporter to that journal . Mr. Murray , who conducted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporter . In the ethics of the press there is a point which has long been a vexed question . Is it morally necessary that the personal political opinions of the editor // of a journal or the salaried author of its articles should be in accordance with those which the journal advocates and suliports ? The mass of mankind would answer at once in the affirmative from mere moral instinct and without even considering the question . It is a point , nevertheless , on which opinions have not been at all unanimous ; and instances can certainly be produced of respectable men conducting a journal , in the capacity of its salaried editor , which took a part in politics contrary to their private opinions and feelings . During the period when the Times newspaper supported the Tories and opposed the doctrines of the Whigs and Liberals , its principal editor was Mr. Barnes , whose personal feelings were well known to be liberal . It is contended that a journalist is analogous to a barrister . He is a feed advocate who is not supposed to express his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his abilities the opinions which his client desires to be advocated . It is even contended that he may consistently with moral principle give his advocacy successively to opposite parties . That this view of the ethics of Journalism is universally adopted in England we by no means affirm ; hut that it is acted on to a considerable ex. tent even in the management and direction of the most respectable papers is incontestable . Whose opinions it may then be asked is any given journal supposed to advance ? Not necessarily those of the editor as is evident . Then as to the proprietor that term is often a noun of multitude . Among the proprietary of a Tory paper individuals may be found who are Whigs or Radicals , and among that of a Whig or Radical paper will often be found Tories and Conservatives . But even in cases where the paper is the property of an individual , it by no means follows that its politics are identical with those of its owner . A short time ago one individual was the sole proprietor of four London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Observer , " the " Englishman , " and " Bell 's Life in London . " The Morning Chronicle at the time was *a Whig-Radical journal ; the " Observer " advocated the politics of the ultra-Tories ; " Bell 's Life in London " adopted the more liberal Tory opinions and the " Englishman " was a sort of r6chauff* of the " Observer . " Soon afterwards the proprietor finding that the circulation of the " Observer " was declining , ordered its politics to be changed to those of extreme Radicalism , while " Bell 's Life " veered round to rabid Toryism . The Observer " at a later period shifted again round to ultra-Toryism , and " Bell 's Life " became an ultra-Radical organ . These proceedings indicate very unequivocally the object of the owner of this miscellaneous newspaper property . He desired simply to fabricate goods to meet the demands of the-market , an ( l provided such variety as that he should be sure to please every customer . A reporter employed for one of these papers , some years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a literary contributor to the " Observer " and the " Englishman , " the proprietor wi-shed him to lake the line of the most extreme Toryism . He was , however , as he said himself , of all existing Radicals the most violent and uncompromising , and like Sterne 's Parson , " trusted that he had a conscience . " " Conscience ! " shouted his astonished employer- " conscience ! sir , what in Heaven 's name has conscience to do with the affair ? Zounds , sir , it is the first time that I have met with a gentleman of the press hinting at a conscience . The last editor I had was a clergyman , and he invariably before he wrote on any subject used to ask me which side he should take . " " That clergyman was a scoundrel , " replied the scrupulous Homme de leltres . " I have no right , sir , to impose subjects on you , and will avoid or take up subjects as you may see fit ; hut whatever I write upon I shrdl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Finding this person an able writer and quite inflexible in these views of his duty , the proprietor thought it would be more his interest to change the politics of the papers than to lose so valuable an auxiliary , " so , " said the narrator , " the two papers were changed in a trice from the most abject servility of Toryism to the most exalted abstractions of Radical Utopianism. ** The circulation of a journal in England is perhaps more affected by the skill of its conductors in anticipating great political changes , or their vigilance and activity in procuring early intelligence of coming events than by any other circumstance . We are indebted to the same source for the following anecdote of Mr. Perry , who , as editor and proprietor of // the " Morning Chronicle , " amassed a considerable fortune . It will show how precarious newspaper property may be , even when managed with the most unquestionable ability . Perry had written a leading article in the month of June , 1815 , which was marked with all his usual spirit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipations were on every sound and rational calculation sure to be verified by the event ; and although they were against the current of the hopes and wishies of the public , still the result would show the superior sagacity and penetration of the writer in a manner to promote the character of the " Morning Chronicle . " The object of this article was to demonstrate the incalculable chances against their success in the war in which the Allies had then engaged . He demonstrated beyond all possibility of doubt the almost impossibility of a victory being gained , and the infallible and deplorable consequences which must ensue from a defeat . Nothing could evince a sounder judgment or a more thorough acquaintance with all the details and general principles of the case . The article was in type and the type in the galleys , and the article would have appeared next morning . During the night the news of the victory of Waterloo arrived ! The type was ordered to be distributed and an article containing a congratulation on the godsend was substituted for it . Had this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " would have become the butt of the press and the laughing-stock of the country . Upon this accident of the hour of the arrival of a courier depended the value of the paper to the amount of several thousand pounds . Of all the journals which have ever circulated in any country the " Times " presents the most striking example of sagacity in the anticipation of political contingencies and the successful activity in the early collection of intelligence . During the great continental war which closed with the battle of Waterloo this journal had fast sailing sloops and other vessels of light draft chartered in its service , which under neutral and even hostile colors were accustomed to run into the ports of the continent , and become the vehicles of intelligence of events passing in various countries of Europe . This information often outstripped the Sept. , resources of the Foreign Office , and Downing street had frequently to acknowledge its obligations to PrintingHouse Square for information which the King 's messengers and diplomatic agents failed to supply . The surprise of the public at the announcement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lord Spencer , and the accession of L4ord Althorp to the peerage in the leading article of the " Times " will not be forgotten . " The Queen has done it all , " echoed from one end of the kingdom to the other . This was communicated to the public in the columns of the " Times " when it must have been properly a cabinet secret . It was whispered at the moment that the " Times " was indebted to Lord Brougham for this information . The memorable announcement of the intended measure of the Peel Ministry for the repeal of the Corn Laws , giv en in the " Times " last December , will not be soon forgotten . The burst of astonishment it excited through the country , and the indignant incredulity of the press respecting it , will be long remembered . The announcement was distinct and circumstantial . " The Corn Laws were to be totally repealed ! " - wonderful ! " The measure was to be a cabinet measure ! " - more wonderful ! " It was to be proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Duke of Wellington in the Lords ! " - most wonderfu1 ! The " Herald , " a Cabinet paper , laughed at THE JOKE ! The " Standard , " a Peel organ , pronounced , officially , the statement to be A LIE ! The " Morning Chromiicle " put on a grave face , thought the " Times " would scarcely risk its character by making such an announcement if it had not good grounds-hut did not know what to think . Nevertheless , the " Times " deliberately and circumstantially reiterated its assertion . In two months ' time Sir Robert Peel did propose the measure in the Commons , and subsequently the Duke of Wellington proposed it in the Lords . The " Herald " and the " Standard " found out that they had been tricked and cajoled : but they would rather be tricked and cajoled they said , than condescend to obtain information by the means resorted to by the " Times . " Meanwhile , the circulation of the " Times " on the day of opening the debate touched fiftyfour thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its // boldness as for its caution . It acknowledges no party , nor does it allow any individual that dictatorship in its management which generally is granted to a chief editor . Its organization is a sort of despotic oligarchy , in which responsibility attaches to no individual . It is eminently the exponent of public opinion . The political leaders may be named whose opinions are represented , and whose advancement to power is promoted by each of the other leading journals , and there is a party which , coming to power , would necessarily convert these journals respectively into ministerial organs . But the " Times " is never a ministerial organ . It will not permit itself to be identified with any party in the political arena . Those opinions , whatever they be , which are about soon to prevail , these are the opinions advocated by the " Times . " It accordingly always seems to lead and guide public opinion . That is a mistake , however . It in fact follows public opinion , although it appears to go before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the most inconceivable accuracy of perception in public affairs . It gets credit , nevertheless , for even more penetration than it possesses ; for its pecuniary resources are so vast , they are so profusely dispensed , and its influence in the highest quarters us so powerful , that its means of private and early infdrmation are infinite , and when it acts on such information , it gets frequently the credit of acting from sagacity and general views . The " Times , " with its double-sheet supplement , has frequently sixty columns of advertisements , br which it probably receives a sum not less than five hundred pounds ! The nominal price of the paper is fivepence , but it is sold to the news agents , through whom only its retail sale is carried on , for fourpence . It will be apparent that the produce of its sale even at its highest amount of circulation , is insignificant compared with the revenue derived from its advertisements . ' Five hundred pounds is , however , considerably below the amount to which the daily receipts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of other daily papers published in London has occasionally attained . During the fever of railway speculation last year , it is well known that a thousand pounds per day were received by each of the leading morning journals ! This extraordinary stimulus gave birth to a newspaper , which may , by possibility , produce a revolution in English journalism . The enormous profits flowing into the treasuries of all the papers , and more especially of the " Times , " at that epoch , suggested to certain persons of enterprise and capital the project of establishing a new daily paper of independent , popular , and liberal politics , aiming , in its management *and organization , to share the market with the " Times . " The great success attending that part of the Paris journals called the " Fenilleton , " suggested the idea of introducing such a department into the new journal , and as the names of Eugene Sue , Alexandre Dutnas , George Sand , and De Balzac , had dope so much for the circulation of the Debcts , the Constitutionnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unreasonably supposed that a like expedient might be attended with similar success in London . Dick-. ens was accordingly sele&amp;ted as the daystar of the fenilleton of the new journal , an enormous pecuniary honorarium was guarantied to him , and his name was annoanced with due pomp and ceremony . Theotherdepartmentsof the paper having been duly filled , editors enthroned , the diplomacy of the journal settled , and an army of reporters and correspondents duly enrolled , the paper was issued as the opening of Parliament with the tide and style of " The Daily News . " A very brief period , however , was sufficient to convince the proprietors that newspapers grow , but can not be made . They do not start , like Minerva from the head of Jupiter , into sudden and instant maturity . Dickens and the feuilleton did not tell upon the circulation . Whether this was owing to the public not being yet accustomed to the feuilleton , or because of mismanagement in the way of bringing it forward , we shall not inquiie . The thing was a dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who speedily withdrew from the concern , and has since retired to Switzerland , whence it may be hoped that the productions of his fertile pen may be received in a form more acceptable to the public and profitable to the author . Besides the failure of the feuilleton , it became evident that there was not that practical acquaintance with the business of a daily journal in the chief editorial department , which was necessary to ensure // a successful competition with the other London journals . In this cmergency the proprietors of the concern came to the bold resolution at once to reduce the price to one half that of the other papers . This reduction , however , was in reality much greater than it appeared . The price of the London daily papers is fivepence , ( ten cents , ) of which one penny , or two cents , represents the stamp . Since the stamp still remained the same , the reduction from ten cents to five cents was in reality a reduction from eight cents to three cents ; or a reduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . This measure was taken on the 1st June last , and has now , ( 1st August , ) been about two months in operation . The result is variously reported by the friends and the opponents of the paper . We have no reason , however , for inferring that it does not promise a successful result . If it prove so , the ultimate effect must be to lower the price of the other journals ; an effect which has been produced in Paris by like means . The post-office arrangements , as well in London as Paris , are very incompatible with the objects of the press . The delivery of letters , arriving from various parts of Europe , taking place generally in the morning , the mails are so regulated in both capitals as to arrive from all , or almost all , quarters between three and six in the morning . The letters and dispatches which they bring are of course not distributed until it is too late for the daily papers . Under these circumstances , the journals ot both countries have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , in both cases , a common express , in the expense of which the leading papers unite , running daily each way between the two capitals . By this means , although a letter sent through the post office , either in London or Paris , is not delivered at its destination until thirty-six or forty hours after it is posted , yet the journals of the one capital are transmitted to the other frequently in half that time . Besides these expresses in common each of the leading papers has a special express for its correspondence when occasion requires it . The Paris correspondent of a morning paper is a functionary scarcely inferior in importance and responsibility to the foreign editor . It is his duty daily to take a general view of the news , and the Sept. , editorial comments of the Paris press ; to get translations made of important articles , and to prepare a foreign leading article , to be ready for insertion on its delivery in London . He receives all that portion of the continental correspondence which must pass through Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire of the south , south-east , and south*vest of Europe . The correspondents of the paper located at Madrid , Lisbon , a onne ; - in Switzerland , in Italy , in Greece , Egypt , Syria , Malta , all address their letters to the Paris correspondent ; who condenses them into an article , which he forwards by special express , together with the original correspondence itself , to London . They reach the office in London on the night after they are dispatched from Paris , and appear in the journal of the following morning . The Paris correspondent is recognized at the dilkrent government offices in that city . As the ministers are generally willing to stand well with the London press , every reasonable facility is given to him to collect the early information which he seeks . if , as sometimes happens , the journal which he represents be opposed to the existing cabinet of the Tuilleries , then he attaches himself to some one or more leading members of the opposition , who having probably been formerly ministers , easily find indirect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the influence of money-which the correspondent can generally command when its application is beneficial-of obtaining the desired supply of information . It is known , however , that both M. Thiers and M. Guizot are each of them represented in the London press ; in other words , the Paris correspondent uses them and they use him . A peculiar mechanical difficulty is just now beginning to be felt by the London daily press , and from its nature will be more and more embarrassing , until an expedient is supplied by human ingenuity to surmount it . We have already explained that the chief work of the paper , in almost all its departments , is done between seven in the evening and six in the morning . After the foreign expresses have arrived , which they usually do about midnight , and the last relay of reporters have brought in and written out the report of the close of the debate , and the division , the last portion of the paper is composed , made up and put on the galleys . All is now ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the paper , say the " Times , " is twenty-four thousand . The press can do this in four hours , that is to say , by eight o'clock . The produce of the first two hours ' work is dispatched in bundles to the various railway stations , for country circulation . The later portion is reserved for London . But what is to be done if the progress of intelligence or the reduction of price produced a serious augmentation of circulation ? The latter principle has been brought into operation in the case of the Daily News , the circulation of which is said already to have reached twenty thousand . Suppose , as is very possible , it shall attain forty thousand ; how is the demand to be met by a machine which can not work off more than six thousand copies an hour , and must complete its work in about four hours ? This difficulty admits of only two methods of solution . The matter of the journal maybe set up in duplicate in type , so as to be worked simultaneously by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one practical objection . The expenses of the printing-office would he at once doubled by it . Besides , there would be some difficulty , if not impracticability , in getting this duplicate composition of type effected with the necessary expedition . The second expedient would he , to ohtam a cast or stereotype of that which is originally composed in type . But no method of stereotyping yet discovered , is sufficiently expeditious and perfect for this purpose . The method of transferring the printed page to a surface of zinc is excluded , because it will not admit of being printed by any but a lithographic press , which , in the present case , is inadmissible . In short a great reward will be obtained by the first ingenious inventor who will contrive a method of producing , with the necessary expedition and perfection , a duplicate of the galleys of a newspaper , either by stereotyping , or by any other practicable means . Those who tranquilly glean information and amusement from the broad sheet of a morning Journal , as they sip their tea and consume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain of body and mind which has attended the parturition of that vast amount of intellectual matter spread before them . " A London newspaper , " said Lord Lyndhurst at a late public dinner , " is a volume  --  a volume of no trifling magni tude  --  and that volume the production of a single night ! " This was a short and pregnant description . Among the various labor which it involves , there is perhaps none more wearing to the mind than that of the chief editor , and yet , except in the leading Journals , this labor is hut inadequately rewarded . The reporter has his task prescribed . His materials are prepared ; he has only to ork them up . If the speeches be dull he is not expected to enliven them . If argument be wanting , he is not expected to supply it . But the editor , night after night , from week to week and from month to month , in season and out of season , in spite of the anguish of private misfortune , in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaustion , is expected to pour forth original or quasi-original reflections and observations , and to fill a certain number of inches of newspaper column . Often , in his despair , he is inclined to fall back on the heap of matter collected by his sub from the correspondence . But alas ! this , in general , proves to be sorry stuff . He can not in very shame venture to father it . Yet one or two " leader&amp; ' must be furnished , and if the passing events do not supply a suitable topic , one must be made , or an old one furbished up . He sits then the livelong night , waiting the arrival of the foreign expresses , and to comment on the slips supplied from the reporter 's room . At length four o'clock strikes . Ihe galleys are arranged . The printer takes the . helm , and the editor , with heated blood , flushed temples and aching head , seeks his home , and gets to rest about the period when his fellow creatures generally are about to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe where the press can be said to be free , is carried on in a different spirit from that which animates it in England ; and certainly no French newspaper can , as an organ of public opinion , be for a moment compared with the leading Journals of London . If the Paris paper be inferior to the English in this respect , they are infinitely more so as vehicles of intelligence . The vast machinery for the collection of news , kept in constant operation by a London morning paper , is altogether unknown to French Journalism . There are a greater number of newspapers published in Paris than in London . Vrobably , also , a greater number // in France than in England . The individual circulation of the French papers is also , on the average , greater than that of the English Journals . Yet notwithstanding this the political influence of the English Journals is incomparably greater . The general staff of collectors of intelligence being much less in the case of the French Journals , and the rate at which their . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the capital necessary for the establishment and management of a Journal is proportionably less . It is not the practice of the commercial community to use newspapers as means for advertising to so great an eitent as in England . The revenue of a French Journal is , therefore , very much smaller than even of a third or fourth rate English provincial paper . All these reasons conspire to prove how much less important and influential an agency is a French than an English newspaper . Nevertheless , there is and has been great ability displayed in the editorial columns of the Paris journals . They have numbered among their contributors some of the most eminent names which are found in the annals of France for the la*t half century . Until his accession to ministerial power , M. Guizot was a writer for the columns of the Journal des Debats ; and if he do not , even now , supply a portion of its contents , it is not because he is above such a task , but because the duties of his office engross his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally a leading writer in the Constitutionnel , and finding thatjournal toomuch trammeled by its party ties for his purpose , he established , in connection with the celebrated and much lamented Armand C'arrel , the National , which still continues to be the organ of the most liberal section of the Chambers . The power of journalism in France , is in a great degree frittered away by the multitude and minuteness of its divisions . Each paper is the organ rather of individuals than of parties . Thus , if you ask what principles the " Journal des Debats " advocates , you will be answered that it supports the Duke of Broglie and M. Guizot . Ask what party is represented by " La Presse , " and you will be told that of M. Mol6 . Ask what doctrines the " Constitutionnel " supports , and you will be told that it promotes the return of M. Thiers to power . Ask what are the principles of the " National , " and you will be answered those of MM . Odillon Barrot , Dupont de l'Eure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you will learn that it is the personal organ of M. Guizot . A stranger , unconnected with French politics , and reading dispassionately these journals , will find himself at a loss to discover any substantial difference between them . The columns are filled with the names of their friends and their opponents , until they tire the eye . But few great principles of government or legislation are discussed . The magnitude of these journals , and the actual quantity of matter they contain , are on a scale commensurate with the minuteness of the sections of the political community which they represent . It is no exaggeration to say , that there is frequently as much printed matter in a single number of the " Times " as in all the journals of Paris put together . The price at which these papers are sold is on the same relative scale . The common annual subscription for a ditily paper , ( published also on Sundays , ) is forty francs , and some are even less . This is at the rate of about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary price of the journals of this country . But the French journals are subject to a stamp duty , which slightly varies with their magnitude , but may be state4 as equal to one cent . Therefore , their actual price is the same as that of the New York Sun , the Philadelphia Ledger , and other papers of that class . The English journals are subject to a stamp duty of two cents , and their ordinary price is ten cents , Exclusive of the stamp , they are , therefore , four times more expensive than the American , and eight times more costly than the French journals . In this comparison , however , we omit the consideration of the quantity of matter they contain . The power of journalism is , therefore , more concentrated in England . It is more a question of measures than men in London-more a question of men than measures in Paris . He who desires to be informed of public events in Paris , must go to a Cabinet de Lecture , and look at a dozen little newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance may be passing , of which not one of these journals , nor all of them together , will give him information . In London , he has one of the leading morning papers on his breakfast-table , in which he knows that // he will find every current event of importance noted , and frequently coming events clearly and distinctly foretold . This relative condition of the Press in the two countries is easily explained . in England freedom of speech and publication is of old date . The Press is an institution of long standing . It has grown with the growth of the British Constitution , assuming , from age to age , and even from year to year , a more and more important and influential position . It is , and has long been , part and parcel of the State . The long consciousness of its freedom has taught it discretion in the use of it . True , this power , like all others exercised by human agents , is abused ; but happily the abuse of journalism among newspapers in England is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals . In France , on the contrary , journalism dates from the Revolution , and scarcely even from that , for it was laid in a trance , in a state of coma , during the Consulate and the Empire . And during the Restoration , its power was scarcely existent in a wholesome condition ; and even since the Restoration , has not the Government of the Barricades , wisely or not it boots not here to say , enacted laws which place journalism in France in a condition very different indeed from that of the British or American Press ? Still , however , there is a reasonable degree of freedom , and perhaps as much as the public is capable of bearing . Perfectly free journalism can not safely be tolerated if not accompanied by a corresponding freedom of public discussion . The fierce passions raised by the Pres* must have a vent . The right of public meeting for the legitimate discussion of political questions ; in a word , the right of petition and of all those acts necessary to effect the objects of petition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The one without the other would be attended with danger . But in France the legislature in its wisdom , moved thereto by the Cabinet of Louis Philippe , has judged it necessary to the well-being of the State to annihilate the right of public meeting . This was accomplished by the laws of September , which followed the Fieschi catastrophe , and of which M. Thiers was the author . More than a certain very limited number of persons can not assemble for a political object in France without incurring the dire penalties of the law . Under such a system freedom of the Press is a delu sion , a mockery , and a snare . It will take another half century for the French Press to acquire , by its proper and natural growth , that vigor to which the English Press ' has attained , nor will even that period bring it to maturity , unless the nation advances sufficiently in its constitutional growth to force on its government the repeal of those laws which at present deprive the people of the right of public meeting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst of Journalism . It has no parallel in the journals of other countries , so far as we know . None , certainly , either in France or America . The most polished , witty and elegant newspi*per composition extant , is to be found in the columns of the " Examiner . " This paper owes its high reputation to the talents of its distinguished proprietor and editor , Mr. Albany Fonblanque. its politics are of the highest tone of liberalism . It is eminent for the integrity and consistency of its conduct , and for the gentlemanly spirit in which its polemical articles are penned . Its reviews in literature and the drama are spirited , and , in general , Just . The dramatic portion , however , is obnoxious to the charge of very glaring favoritism . Though this is no doubt dictated by friendly feeling towards an individual well worthy of esteem , yet it should be remembered that the undue and preposterous exaltation of one artist operates injuriously on those whose unfavored merits are passed over in comparative silence . We have thus endeavored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metropolitan Press . We have forborne to make comparisons , or even allude to our own journals . From many of the defects attending the Press in Europe , we are exempt , not because we are less prone to error , but because the same causes do not operate here . In like manner the necessity for the same complicated and expensive machinery for procuring information does not exist with us . This observation more especially applies to the department of foreign correspondence . Nevertheless , something has been done in this way among our journalists , and some of our papers have now regular correspondents in several parts of Europe . The peculiar circumstances attending our general government and the location of Congress renders our system of parliamentary reporting different and of subordinate importance . In all great popular // meetings , however , where speakers of established reputation have been expected to appear , reporting has been conducted in a manner not at all inferior to that of the best journals of London . But the cause which must for ages to come at least keep the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found in our very political iustitution* themselves . We have not , and so long as our institutions continue can not have , that centralization to which the press of England and France owes its importance . If , instead of London , with its two millions of inhabitants , its unbounded wealth and unparallelled commerce , England possessed half a dozen or a dozen little Lonlons , each claiming equal consideration , where would be its TIMEs , its CHRONICLE , or its PosT ? If , instead of Paris , with its million of inSept. , habitants , its royal palaces , its museums and lihraries , and its thirty thousand foreign visiters , France had a little chief city in every department , having its own legislature , its own government and its own Press , where would he the DEBATS , the COYSTITUTIONNEL , the PRESSE , and the SIEcLE ? Instead , of these we should have had some dozen or so of Times ' and Chronicles , in England , and equally numerous Debats , and Constitutionnels , in France-none rising beyond the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is inseparable from our system , is in itself a social benefit or not , is not here the question . Be it for good or for evil , soit is . Without centralization we can not have those powers for the very existence of which centralization is indispensable.
