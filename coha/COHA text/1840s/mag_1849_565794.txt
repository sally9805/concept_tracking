txt THESE volumes are a valuable addition to the library , which our American Missionaries are creating . The originators of the modern missionary enterprise probably did not imagine the messengers of the gospel among the heathen would enlarge science by their researches , and adorn literature with their writings ; yet such is the fact , and it is by no means the least important of the many incidental benefits resulting from the attempt to spread the gospel through the world . We always welcome such publications as Perkins 's Residence in Persia , Biugham 's Sandwich Islands , and the volumes now before us , because we know that the authors have had better opportunities than any other foreigners-diplomatic functionaries not excepted-for learning the real condition of the people whom they describe . Respecting China , above almost every other country , we need just such information as none but missionaries can give or acquire . With that strange country the whole civilized world has long been connected , directly or indirectly , in commercial relations ; and yet to the world China has // been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarded against the profane approach of strangers , and tolerating foreign commerce only at a siiigle point of contact with the outside world . The Chinese appear as a distinct race , not only opposite to us in place , but in almost every characteristic . They write , speak , sing , aud , we are half inclined to believe , think and feel in ways so diverse from our own and those of every occidental people , that if we don bted the biblical account of creation , we should take China for the strongest proof that mankind had not a common origin . Mr. Williams quotes an amusing account of their pectiliarities , from a sketch in the Chinese Repository . We give a few sentences of the description . " On inquiring of the boatman in which direction Macao lay , I was answered , west north ; and the wind , he said , was east south . We do not say so in Europe , ' thought I , but imagine my surprise when in explaining the utility of the compass , he added that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel , I saw a group of old people , some of whom were grey beards ; a few were chiruping and chuckling to singing birds which they carried perched on a stick or in cages , others were catching flies to feed them , and the remainder of the party seemed to be delightfully employed in flying fantastic paper kites ; while a group of boys were gravely looking on and regarding these innocent occupations of their seniors with the most serious and gTatified attention . " On going abroad , I met so many things contrary to all my preconceived ideas of propriety , that I readily assented to a friend 's observation , that the Chinese were our antipodes in many things beside location . ' Indeed , ' said I , they are so ; I shall expect shortly to see a man walking on his head : look ! there is a woman in trowsers , and a paAy of gentlemen in petticoats ; she is smoking a segar , and they are fanning themselves ; ' but I was taught not to trust to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter wore tight under garments . We soon after met the steward of the house dressed in white , and I stopped to ask him what merry-making he was invited to ; with a look of the deepest concern he told me he was then returning from his father 's funeral . Soon we passed where we heard sobbing and crying , and I inquired who was ill ; the man suppressing a smile said , It is a girl about leaving home to be married , who is lamenting with her fellows . ' " - Vol . II , pp. 92-94 . But China has higher claims upon our attention than those which mere curiosity creates . As the oldest existing repository of civilization ; and as having possessed for ages many of those discoveries and inventions which have done more than any , thing save the gospel to promote our own progress , that country demands respect . We are not indeed inclined , with our author , to remove the deluge some centuries farther back , to accommodate the chronology of the tniddle kingdom ; though we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , might seem to have come down unchanged from the ages before the flood . Nor can we admit , with some who can believe any thing rather than the Bible , the reality of those dynasties which are said to have reigned in that country before the days of Noah although a remarkable flood is mentioned in their annals , nearly // simultaneously with that in the Scriptural account . Nor are we less skeptical as to the notion which some dreamers have propounded , that the Chinese language was the language of Paradise ; for it does appear to us that such a language must have been altered into a better one , by some enterprising descendants of our first mother , long before the first brick was laid in the tower of Babel . Our incredulity on all these points is fortified by the fact that Chihwangti , who is represented as the most distinguished of Chinese Emperors , caused the records of the past to be destroyed , so far as he was able , about 250 B. C. , in order to make himself the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not but reverence the nation which was old when Romulus founded Rome ; whose classic writers were contemporary with Ezra ; which has maintained its distinct national character , not merely for centuries , but for milleniums ; and which has continued to increase , until its empire extends over a larger surface than any other , and its population is numbered by hundreds of millions . There is something to be honored in a people whose history reaches to the building of the Pyramids ; and whose great teacher , having compiled the knowledge then ancient , died a century before Socrates , while his mausoleum , still reverenced by his countrymen , remains.in the midst of a forest , that has many times decayed and been renewed since he was buried . We can hardly avoid feeling some romantic interest in a government whose Monarch was called Peace , when that babe was born at Bethlehem , who was the Prince of Peace , and by the side of which the oldest empire of the European world is only a thing of yesterday . Mr. Williams has satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the human family . He has opened China by giving its statistics in all the accuracy of numbers , and by revealing the details of that patriarchal administration . We have little fault to find with his arrangement , except that the larger part of the first volume , containing the geographical descriptions , might perhaps have been better compressed into tables , or at least arranged as a Gazetteer and thrown into an appendix , where it could have been referred to alphabetically . A few pages of letter press , with the excellent map whicli.vac* companies the work , would have given a clearer idea of the features and condition of the country . Few readers will plod through the enumeration of the boundaries , population and l*oductions of provinces , and capitals , and , chief towns , when the constant repetition of most unpronounceable or unrememberable names is added to the general sameness . An editor , himself a distinguished writer , recently remarked , in a newspaper article , that every author ought to serve an apprenticeship to the printer 's trade , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our author may be referred to as // illustrating the faults in style which too long attention to this art may produce ; and his composition , from its rigidity and mechanical structure , seems to have been set up without copy . Nor is it until we are nearly through his volumes , that the composing stick is fairly transformed into a goose quill , and the angularity of the letters changed into a running hand . We may give our readers some idea of the value of these volumes , by attempting to exhibit , from the information which they contain , some view of the causes which have produced the isolation , permanence and prosperity of the Chinese empire , and some thoughts which have occurred to us in regard to the probabilities of their future . We begin with saying that in our opinion , Mr. Williams has conclusively established the credibility of the census made in 1812 , which enumerates the people of China at about three hundred and fifty millions , who have a higher cultivation , and are better secured in their personal rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A partial explanation of the fact that this great people has been so little affected by the causes which have been continually revolutionizing Europe and a large part of Asia , may be found in the configuration of the country . tinlike what we see ou our own continent , the mountain ridges in that land are parallel to the equator , while a single chain stretches from North to South on the Western boundary , so that almost the whole of China is environed by this natural wall , except the eastern coast , whose bulwark is the Pacific . Ranges within this enclosure divide the empire into three basins , through which mighty rivers flow into the ocean . When it is remembered what protection has been afforded to Italy by the Alps , and that to pass over that great barrier with an army was the greatest achievment of Hannibal , not to *ay of Napoleon , some conception can be formed of the seclusion which this belt of snowy peaks must have secured to a people , whose coast was washed , not by the waves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but by the vast ocean that separated continents inhabited by races that for ages never dreamed of each other 's existence . Thus fenced in by God , this nation dwelt apart , undisturbed by the contentious and commotions that were stirring the kingdoms . Alexander marched beneath their gates , but heard no sound of the busy multitude within . Baylon was built , conquered , and ruined , yet the Chinese remained unmolested . Even the Roman Empire had spread to the outposts of the known world , and was declining , before its fame crossed the celestial mountains , and reverberated through the Middle Kingdom . The Chinese language , too , has been a barrier almost as effectual as the everlasting hills , excluding the people who use it from all acquaintance with foreigners . Its forms , constructions // and pronunciation are so essentially different from those of any other tongue , that it is the work of a life time to master it completely . The labors of Morrison , and the present efforts of our own missionaries , attest the difficulties with which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the current year , gives au able exhibition of the obstacles to the acquisition of the Chinese language . While living in such isolation , walled in by mountains , guarded by the ocean , and separated by the most difficult peculiarities of language , the Chinese have had very little inducement to go abroad themselves , or to attempt any improvement of their condition by intercourse with foreigners . rpheir civilization , so far as those arts are concerned which minister to human subsistence or luxury-has been , from immemorial ages till a very recent date , far in advance of the nations with whom it would otherwise have been most natural for them to be in habits of intercourse and mutual influence . Their own country including every variety of climate and production , has afforded them in the form of internal trade the advantages of foreign commerce . Their own " middle kingdom " has been the world to them , as the " orbis terrarum " of the Roman empire was to the people of Rome . All who dwell beyond their boundaries are barbarians to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are detested accordingly . Thus the prejudice against*foreigners which is natural to men of every language and of every race , having had nothing to counteract it , has been in China one of the most powerful of causes which have operated upon the institutions and the history of the empire . The propensity of human nature which in the Greek language identified the foreigner with the barbarian , and which in the Latin made every stranger an enemy , is the key to all Chinese ideas of " foreign relations . " The agriculture of the Chinese and their modes of living explain the possibility of a population so enormous as that which exists upon their soil . " The greatest part of the cultivated soil in China is employed in raising food for man . Woolen garments and leather are little used , and cottol and mulberry occupy but a small proportion of the soil . There is not , so far as is known , a single acre of land in the empire sown with grass seed , though the sedge in the marshes and grass on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore almost no human labor is employed in raising food for animals , which will not also serve to sustain man . Horses are seldom used for pomp or war , for traveling or carrying burdens , but mules , asses , and goats are em-. ployed for transportation and other purposes in the northwest . Horses are fed on cooked rice , or chopped straw and beans , and in Kirin on oats . In the southern and eastern provinces , all these animals are rare , the transport of goods and passengers being done by boats or by men . The natives make almost no use of butter , cheese , or milk , and the few cattle they employ in agriculture easily find their living on the waste ground around the fields and // villages . In the south , the buffalo is used more than the ox for ploughing the rice fields , and the habits of this animal make it cheaper to keep him in good liking , while he can also do more work . " The winter stock is grass cut upon the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being wanted for making cloth , flocks of sheep and goats are seldom seen-it may almost be said are unknown in the east and south . " The common viands are pork , ducks , geese , poultry , and fish , all of which are raised cheaply . In the houses and boats of the poor , it is not uncommon to see a pig , or two or three ducks , kept in a pen or cage and living upon the refuse of the family . No animal is raised cheaper than the Chinese hog , and the hatching and raising of ducks affords employment to thousands of people , each of whom can easily attend to hundreds . Geese and poultry are abundant , but fish forms a far larger part of the common food of all classes than birds , being not only caught in seas , lakes , and running waters , but reared in poolS and tanks , to an extent hardly conceivable by those who have not seen it . All these sources require but little more than the mere labor and implements for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fishing , no pasture grounds , no manuring , no barns , are needed , nor taxes paid by the cultivator and consumer . " - Vol . I , pp. 218 , 219 . An interesting account of the uses to which the bamboo is applied , shows the resources of the country , and may be taken as illustrating that portion of the article in our last number , on " The World Made for Man , " which exhibited the uses of the vegetable kingdom . " The bamboo is cultivated about villages for its pleasant shade and beauty , and a grove furnishes from year to year cuims of all sizes for the various uses to which it is applied . No plant imparts so oriental and rural an aspect to a garden or village as the clumps of this graceful and stately grass ; the stalks shoot up their wavy plumes to the height of fifty feet and upward , and swaying themselves to every breeze , form an object of great elegance , well befitting so useful a plant . " This plant may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese to such a variety of purposes , some of them indeed better accomplished elsewhere by different materials , that it may justly be called their national plant . It is reared from shoots and suckers , but after it has once rooted is not much attended to ; the common yellow species extends over all the southern and eastern provinces , but the varieties mentioned by Chinese writers amount to sixty , of which the black skinned sort used in making furniture , and the low , fine branched one affording the slender twigs employed in the manufacture of writing pencils , are the best known . The tender shoots are cultivated for food , and are , when four or five inches high , boiled , pickled , and comfited , but not the tender buds and flowers , cut like asparagus ' as represented by Murray . The roots are carved into fantastic images of men , birds , monkeys , of monstrous perversions of animated nature : cut into lantern handles or canes , or turned into oval sticks for worshipers to divine whether the gods will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for all purposes that poles can be applied to in carrying , supporting , propelling , and measuring , by the porter , the carpenter and the hoatman ; for the joists of houses and the ribs of sails ; the shafts of spears and the wattles of hurdles ; the tubes of aqueducts , and the handles and ribs of umbrellas and fans . " The leaves are sewed upon cords to make rain cloaks , swept into heaps to form manure , and matted into thatches to cover houses . Cut into splints and slivers of various sizes , the wood is worked into baskets and trays of every form and fancy , twisted into cables , plaited into awnings , and woven into mats for scenery of the theatre , the roofs of boats , and the casing of goods . The // shavings , even , are picked into oakum , and mixed with those of rattan , to be stuffed into mattresses . The bamboo furnishes the bed for sleeping , and the couch for reclining ; the chop-sticks for eating , the pipe for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hang before the door , and a broom to sweep around it ; together with screens , stools , stands , and sofas for various uses of convenience and luxury in the house . The mattress to lie upon , the chair to sit upon , the table to dine from , food to eat and fuel to cook it with , are alike derived from it : - tlie ferule to govern the scholar , and the book he studies both originate here . The tapering barrels of the sdng , or organ , and the dreaded instrument of the lictor-one to make harmony , and the other to strike dread ; the skewer to pin the hair , and the hat to screen the head ; the paper to write on , the pencil handle to write with , and the cup to hold the pencils ; the rules to measure lengths , the cup to gauge quantities , and the bucket to draw water ; the bellows to blow the fire , and the bottle to retain the match ; the bird cage and crab net , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duct , wheel-barrow and hand-cart , &amp;c. , &amp;c. , are one and all furnished or completed by this magnificent grass , whose graceful beauty when growing is comparable to its varied usefulness when cut down . " China could hardly be governed without the constant application of the bamboo , nor the people get along in their daily pursuits without it . It serves to embellish the garden of the prince , and shade the hamlets of the peasant , compose the hedge which separates their grounds , assist in constructing the tools to work their lands and feed the cattle which labor upon them ; and lastly , as the Chinese verily believe , brings forth its seeds in years of famine to supply the deficiencies of other crops . There is nothing they paint and draw so well , and its siliceous tubes furnish an admirable material for the display of their skill in carving and writing . " - Vol . I , pp. 276-278 . But these causes are insufficient to account for the prosperity and permanence of this people . Indeed the wonderful industry and skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are themselves no small part of the phenomenon to be accounted for . We must look deeper to discover the foundation which has given stability to their institutions . The peculiarities of their government , the diffusion of education , and the nature of their reli2ion afford this basis . Their political constitution is patriarchal in theory , and evidently originated in the same state of society which produced their style of architecture . They both arose when men dwelt in tents . The Emperor is the sire of the nation , and his officers are the elders of different households . The monarch is the only source of power , but he is bouud to rule according to the laws which he has recognized and established . Several Boards , or Councils , at Pekin , assist the supreme authority in regulating the empire . They are entitled by Mr. Williams , the Cabinet , the General Council , the Board of Civil Office , the Board of Revenue , the Board of Rites , the Board of War , the Board of Punishments , the Board of Works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Judicature , and the Imperial Academy . Our limits do not permit a description of their duties , but the bare enumeration may awaken respect for an administration which probably few have supposed to be so perfectly organized . // The imperial power is strengthened by the fact , that the titular nobility is " a body whose members are without power , land , wealth , office , or influence , " and are therefore immediately dependent on the sovereign . Mr. Williams notices also the strict surveillance , and mutual wsponsibility among all classes , so that every man , by being held responsible for his neighbor 's conduct , is obliged to be his brother 's keeper . " No one is permitted to hold office in his native province , and " no officer is allowed to marry in the jurisdiction under his control , nor to hold land in it , nor have a son , or brother , or near relation holding office under him . " The advantage which is thus given to the government is illustrated by the Austrian empire . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft of Metternich , if it had not retained different races within its sway , speaking different languages , having no affinity but that of a common master , and therefore eager to gain the favor of the Court by subduing each other to its control . The recent republican movement has been stopped by skillfully managing these hostile races , arraying the Croats against Hungary , and sending Hungarians to conquer Lombardy . While the Chinese Emperor has no standing army , he has in the constitution of the empire a support which it is almost inipossible to overthrow , and which supersedes the necessity of those vast and costly armaments by which the thrones of European despots are upheld . The magistrates are not acquainted with each other sufficiently to be able to form secret conspiracies , and the people are distrustful of these officers and of one another , while the immense population is itself a hindrance to any commotion , since he who leaves his work to revolt must soon starve . Nor , according to these volumes , have the Chinese much reason to complain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many European countries . The extent to which the means of education are afforded to the people indiscriminately , and the rewards which are connected with the pursuit of learning , are also to be enumerated among the influences which sustain the government and strengthen its authority . According to the true patriarchal theory *h* most eminent in knowledge and intellectual ability should receive the highest office , and thus the administration of the state be committed to the most worthy . Consequently , in China , examinaations are had regularly , when the candidates for honorable positions present themselves ; and civil offices are obtained , as in this country military rank is obtained by West Point graduates . But when we speak of education , it must be remembered that it is Chinese education , not a training which produces independent and original thought , but one which reproduces ancient modes of thought with scrupulous exactness , * Familiarity with // 223 the writings of Confucius and the other classics , is the evidence of wisdom , and scholars are judged and rewarded according to their acquaintance with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their fathers . Such a system must produce similar mental characteristics wih all the regularity of a machine . Yet it is due to their literature to cite the tribute paid by Mr. Williams in his quotation from another . " The Chinese student not being secured from error by the light of revealed religion , can only derive his moral precepts from his school learning . He is certainly therefore fortunate in the possession of a body of ancient national literature , which , while it cultivates his taste and improves his understanding , contains nothing to influence his passions or corrupt his heart . The Chinese are not compelled , as we are , upon the authority of great names , and for the sake of the graces of style and language , to place in the hands of their youth , works containing passages which put modesty to the blush ,  --  works in which the most admirable maxims of morality are mixed and confounded together in the same page with the avowals and descriptions of the most disgusting licentiousness . The writings which the Chinese put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect wholly unexceptionable. " - Vol . I , p. 435 . These classics , enjoining continually the highest respect for ancestors and the most absolute deference towards the Emperor as the supreme power , impress upon the mind of the nation the idea that reverence for the constituted authority is the first and greatest of all duties . This is in effect their religion , for they have no other . Neither human sacrifice , nor the deification of vice , stains their worship . They have no hierarchy , although the Emperor is Pope ; and their state religion is a mere pageant . Confucius " never taught the duty of man to any higher power than the head of the state , or family , though he supposed himself commissioned by heaven to restore the doctrine and usages of the ancient kings . " Buddhism has spread widely , and Romanism numbers many converts ; but these are regarded , like the national rites , as an empty show , save in the sanction they give to the wors1hip of the fathers , which constitutes the true worship in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this subject are interesting . " The hall of ancestors is found in the house of almost every member of*he family , but always in that of the eldest son . In rich families it is a separate building ; in others , a room set apart for the purpose , and in many a mere shelf or shrine . The tablet consists of a board called chin chu , i. e. , house of the spirit , about twelve inches long and three wide , placed upright in a block , and having the name , quality , and date of birth and death , carved in the wood . A receptacle is often cut in the back , containing pieces of paper bearing the names of the higher ancestors , or other members of the family . Incense and papers are daily burned before them , accompanied by a bow or act of homage , forming in fact a sort of family prayer . The tablets are ranged in chronological order , those of the same generation being placed in a line . When the hall is large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adorn it with banners , and insignia of wealth and rank , and on festival days it serves as a convenient place for frien* to meet , or indeed for any extraordinary family occasion . A person // residing near Macao spent about $1500 in the erection of a hail , and on the dedication day , the female members of the family assembled with his sons and descendants to assist in the ceremonies . The portraits of the deceased are also suspended in the hall , but effigies or images are not now made . " In the first part of April , during the term called tsing-ming , a general worship of ancestors , calledpvi shan , or " worshiping at the hills , " is observed . The whole population , men , women and children , repair to their family tombs , carrying a tray containing the sacrifice , and libations for offering , and the candles , paper and incense , for burning , and there go through a variety of ceremonies and prayers . The grave is also carefully repaired and swept , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turf are placed at the back and front of the grave , to retain long strips of red and white paper ; this indicates that the accustomed rites have been performed , and these fugitive testimonials remain fluttering in the wind , long enough to announce it to all the friends ; for when a grave has been neglected three years , it is sometimes dug over , and the land resold . " - Vol . II , pp. 268 , 269 . The government , organized so firmly , and sustained thus by a religion which makes reverence to elders and superiors an act of worship , has a stability which accounts for its permanence , separated , as it has been , from the commotions that have disturbed and overturned other kingdoms . Its influence upon the character of its subjects is exhibited by Mr. Williams in the following passages , which we have selected from his description of the traits that distinguish the Chinese . " They have attained by the observance of peace and good order , to a high degree of security for life and property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remarkably homogeneous manner , by the diffusion of education and property , and equality of competition for office ; and industry receives its just reward of food , raiment and shelter , with a uniformity which encourages its constant exertion . If any one asks how they have reached this point , we would primarily ascribe it to the blessing of the Governor of the nations , who has , for his own purposes , continued one people down to the present time from remote antiquity . The roots of society among them have never been broken up by emigration or the overflowing conquest of a superior race , but have been fully settled in a great regard for the family compact , and deep reverence for parents and superiors . Education has strengthened and disseminated the morality they had , and God has blessed their filial piety by making their days long in the land which he has given them . Davis lays rather too much stress upon geographical and climatic causes in accounting for their advancement in these particulars , though their isolation has no doubt had much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however these traits have been mentioned , the Chinese are still more left without excuse for their wickedness , since being without law , th*y are a law unto themselves : they have always known better than they have done . With a general regard for outward decency , they are vile and polluted in a shocking degree , their conversation is full of filthy expressions , and their lives of impure acts . " More uneradicable than the sins of the flesh is the falsity of the Chinese , and its attendant sin of base ingratitude ; their disregard of truth has perhaps done more to lower their character in the eyes of Christendom than any other fault . Thieving is exceedingly common , and the illegal exactions of the rulers are burdensome . This vice , too , is somewhat restrained by the punishments inflicted on criminals , though the root of the evil is not touched . While the licentiousness of the Chinese may be in part ascribed to their ignorance of pure intellectual pleasures , and the want of virtuous female society , so may // their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their thieving to the want of sufficient food or work . " " On the whole , the Chinese present a singular mixture ; if there is something to commend , there is more to blame ; if they have some glaring vices , they have more virtues than most pagan nations . Ostentatious kindness and inbred suspicion , ceremonious civility and real rudeness , partial invention and servile imitation , industry and waste , sycophancy and self-dependence , are with other dark and bright qualities , strangely blended . In trying to remedy the faults of their character by the restraints of law and the diffusion of education , they have no doubt hit upon the right mode ; and their short comings show how ineffectual both must be until the gospel comes to the aid of ruler and subject , in elevating the moral sense of the whole nation . " - Vol . II , pp.95,98 . The question whether this remarkable people is to remain unchanged , as immovable in the future as in the past , is a question to which we are naturally led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all Chinese peculiarities . The attempts which have been made heretofore to bring the Chinese people into active communication and sympathy with other nations , have been almost entirely unsuccessful-absolutely so in respect to permanent results . If we look only at past attempts , we find little encouragement to future effort . Since the promulgation of the gospel , there have been various efforts to introd uce Christianity in one form or another into China ; but Christian ideas and principles have never obtained a permanent footing there . In eighteen centuries , the leaven of the gospel has not been able to work itself into the minds and hearts of that singular people . There is reason to believe that some of the very early teachers of the Christian church preached in China ; and it is certain that those missionaries of Asia , the Nestorians , traveled through this country and diffused some knowledge of Jesus . For centuries they toiled and gained converts , but the only remaining monument of their labors is a tablet of stone erected in the eighth century , and containing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorial , in existing Christian communities , can not be found . The Roman Catholic church has sent , beginning with the thirteenth century , some of its most devoted and persevering ministers to establish the Papal power in the Middle Kingdcivn . The followers of Loyola , Dominic and Francis , have emulated each other in hardships and abundant labors to extend their own orders , and enlarge the spiritual dominion of the Papal See . They have used the skill and the arts which have been so successful in founding and maintaining their system in every other portion of the earth . They have lavished wealth , distributed indulgences , yielded to the national prejudices , changed the popular rites only in name , permitted idolatrons practices , flattered , and threatened . They have worked apparent miracles , made // 226 The Middle Kingdom . themselves useful to the magistrates , and kind to the poor , until their learning and charity became famous . At first , and for a while , they achieved great conquests . Their converts were counted by thousands ; even the Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kingdom , and were thus enabled to arrange and work the machinery which had subdued Europe ; but with what success ? So soon as they attempted to interfere with the only form of religion which was observed by the nation , namely , the worship of ancestors , they were banished from the Empire , and obliged to preach by stealth if they inculcated anything contrary to the national belief . The result of the experiment is thus summed up . " That there may have been true converts among the myriads of adherents to Romanism is probable ; but what salutary effects has the large body of Christians wrought in the vast population of China during the two hundred and fifty years since Ricci established himself at Nanking ? None , absolutely none , that attract attention . The five or six thousand native Romanists at Macao are as a whole less enterprising and industrious than their Pagan countrymen ; and they are no more charitable or cleanly . What they are in the interior is not known except by hearsay from a few natives . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little leaven of godliness there has been in the lump , and both priest and people can not well refuse to be judged by evidence furnished by themselves . " - Vol . II , pp. 324 , 325 . When the gospel preached by missionaries of primitive zeal in the first ages of the Christian church , has failed to produce any permanent effect ,  --  when Romanism with all its appliances has not succeeded in preventing the practice of the ancient idolatry even among its own converts , it seems discouraging to think of new efforts . Nor is there much encouragement in the results of diplomatic missions to China from the governments of other nations . The repeated embassies from European governments to the court at Pekin have increased , rather than diiriinished , the arrogance of the Chinese ; since the legations were regarded as acknowledgments of inferiority , and the prostrations and ceremonies necessary to a conference with the Emperor were construed as concessions to his authority , while the accompanying presents were received as a tribute . If we are to judge only from the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a world by itself . But the past is beginning to be disconnected from the present . New agencies have recently been introduced , and already their influence is beginning to be seen in their results . That war of Great Britain upon China  --  a war which after all the excuses that can be rendered in behalf of the invaders , was still , in the language of our author , " entered into and carried on to obtain indemnity for opium seized , and , setting aside the nicety of westem // international law which the Chinese government knew nothing of , justly seized , " - has terminated in the removal of many obstacles which had secured the Chinese mind from foreign influence , and has opened a breach for the entrance of the mightiest revolutiuiizing agencies . When Rev. Robert Morrison , in the year 1807 , alone and almost unbefriended , went to Canton , and began the labors which ceased only with his earthly existence ; few would have imagined , that in that humble but fervent soul there was carried to the millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , in the coming ages , a radical transformation on the people who had remained among the nations ever since the deluge , tinchanged and alone , as a granite pillar among the sands of the desert . Truly the kingdom of heaven comes not with observation . That holy man published a dictionary of the language , and with Dr. Milne translated the entire Bible , and was then taken from his labors , before a single evangelical church had been gathered , and when only one or two converts had been gained to the faith in Jesus . But during the last fifteen years , the seed has begun to germinate , and although planted in silence and darkness , and with tears , it is already bearing blossoms and fruit . The gospel preached in simplicity , and accompanied with the power of the Holy Spirit , can overturn the bulwarks which have withstood the revolution of centuries . The influence of the gospel on the mind and heart is what the Chinese character needs . This will inspire it with new life , will give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaken intellectual activity , and so create that consciousness of inward force which is the only basis of progress . Man can not penetrate the secrets of providence to discover for what cause the Chinese have been permitted so long to maintain their seclusion . Perhaps the valuable arts and discoveries which they have preserved would have been lost if entrusted to others ; and perhaps God may have yet some great work for them to accomplish . Of this however we may be confident , that if they reject the knowledge of the truth and the means of moral renovation and improvement , they must sooner or later yield to *ome other race with a higher standard of virtue ; for God has written it in all history as with a sunbeam , that the righteous shall inherit the earth . A great nation is now beginning to be planted along our westem shores , to whom the waves of the Pacific will afford an easy passage to the land of Sinim ; ' for the ocean that was once a barrier is now a broad highway . China will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have forced an entrance for commerce , but of other and mightier forces ; and the world 's experience is at fault , if China can stand immovable // in the presence of such a race and such institutions as are now to be established right over against her , looking in upon her from the east . Civilization having pursued its westward march over continents and oceans , will shortly return to its birthplace , with all its trophies and its accumulated riches arid powers ; and when the circle is complete , and the globe is belted and girdled with lines of uninterrupted intercourse , and with the universal circulation of knowledge , we may anticipate that prophecy will ere long become reality , and there will be " new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness . " The use which we have made of the volumes before us , has probably given the reader a better idea of their value , than a more critical analysis could have afforded . We hardly need say that they contain many entertaining sketches of manners and customs which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To all who desire valuable information rather than mere amusement , we cheerfully recommend the work as a repository of interesting and instructive facts concerning a most wonderful people . We have ourselves learned from the perusal of Mr. Williams 's volumes a far greater respect for the Chinese as to their literature , their government , their domestic habits , and their morals ; yet we turn from the perusal with an increased feeling of gratitude for our ancestry . If our ancestors , long after China was adorned with gorgeous temples , were worshipers of Odin in Scandinavian forests , they nevertheless had something that could be called religion ; if they loved war , they hated despotism ; if they lived at first in huts , they learned by-and-by to build castles , and churches , and Westminster Halls ; if they had not the arts of civilization by tradition from Noah , they acquired or invented them ; if their institutions exhibit no antediluvian lineaments , they embody principles older than the creation : and we thank God that we are of their lineage . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the one is a junk , the other an ocean steamer . The former , made of teak , may have lasted already a hundred years , and is constructed exactly upon the model that was in use long ere the Norsemen ventured in their rude open barks upon the stormy German Sea . It is finished withirf and without with minute attention , and is capable of furnishing as comfortable a dwelling for its inmates in ages to come , as it has in the past , if circumstances are not altered . rphe steamship , constructed of iron , on a model chosen not for its antiquity but its merits ,  --  fashioned not like the junk in imitation of a monster of Chinese imagination , but after the same principles with God 's machinery in the living fish whose path is in the wavesnot subject to the arbitration of the inconstant elements , but contaming in itself the power of locomotion at a speed which outstrips // the breeze and resists the storm ,  --  typifies in its construction and energy the race which in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete and mighty . The junk has floated safely in the peaceful waters where it has hitherto been sheltered from the tempests that have shaken the outside kingdoms ; but the winds and tides , impelled by new forces , are setting towards those enclosed and tranquil *vaters . The breath of God is abroad upon the deep , and will disturb the billows . The voyagers must awake , and seek a safer ark , or they will be overwhelmed.
