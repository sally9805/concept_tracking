TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THIS FRAGMENT FROM THEIR HISTORY IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED . PREFACE . As Washington was the good principle , so Arnold was the devil of the Revolution . How his reckless courage raised him from a captain to the rank of Major-General  --  the highest in our service  --  how his promotion was kept back ; how he became intoxicated with success or blinded with presumption ; how he married the beautiful Miss Shippen , of Philadelphia ; how he plunged into extravagance ; how his profligate and daring character was developed by his exigencies ; how he became involved ; how he was courtmartialled and reprimanded ; how he meditated revenge ; how he opened a secret correspondence with the enemy ; how it was conducted by himself and Andre , under the fictitious names of Gustavus and Anderson ; how he obtained the command of West Point , and conspired to surrender it to the enemy ; how he was detected  --  fled , and was consigned to eternal obloquy , are matters of history . In the construction of the drama . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole transaction is in itself a tragedy . The denouement accords with poetic justice . There are punishments worse than death : Arnold was frustrated in his schemes ; stripped of his rank ; banished from his country ; branded with infamy ; and lived and died an execrated traitor ! Andre perished the victim of his imprudence and temerity ; and in his execution , death closes the scene with tragic solemnity . I have placed the virtue of the piece where it is always appropriately placed , in the bosom of a woman . Mrs. Arnold  --  who is the only female introduced  --  is the conscience of Arnold incarnate . From her he receives those reproaches that he must have often felt in his dark and mysterious soul . That his wife was ever acquainted with his designs has never been historically settled  --  much less that she ever countenanced them ; and when she becomes acquainted with them in the drama , it is only to reproach him . Although our own produced a traitor , yet the gentler sex appear to have been patriots without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble countrywomen , especially a virtuous and accomplished lady of Philadelphia , would so far forget her duty as to betray her country . PERSONS OF THE DRAMA . Men . Arnold , an American General , ( the Traitor . ) Andre , a Spy , Adjutant General of the British army , ( his victim . ) Clinton , Commander of the British forces .

West Point  --  Fort Putnam  --  Stony Point  --  Highlands on the Hudson River  --  The Clove below Haverstraw and Governor 's Island , in the Harbour of New York . Main text ACT I. SCENE I. WEST POINT  --  RAMPARTS OF FORT PUTNAM . Enter Varick . Varick . Varick All 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pass 'd the watchful round , and here A while pause on the turf-clad parapet To drink the beauties of this midnight scene ! The mountain masses tow'r in gloom , and throw Their bold abutments in the tranquil stream ; The moon shines clear above , as if her orb  --  Hung in the blue immensity  --  her light Pour 'd on the time-worn crag , the gliding flood , And forest foliage , mingles with darkness And flings o'er all a dim and mystic veil . How hush 'd and silent all ! save where , as if A spirit pass 'd , the night-wind rustles by  --  Or from the distant hills the wailing cry Of the wild panther falls ever and anon Upon the ear , his hunger plaint to nature For a nightly boon ; these , and at intervals The melody of some lone whip-poor-will Breaks thro ' the stillness of the deep repose . But what comes there ? a boat ' t would seem , row 'd rapid , By the quick flashing of the gleaming oar . And now they reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , A horn sounds . The signal of the water battery . A voice Voice What , ho ! the guard . Varick . Varick The guard ! Enter Sergeant , Serg't . Sergeant Sir ! your orders ? Varick . Varick To the landing place , the signal thus demands . Serg't . Sergeant I waited but your word . exit Sergeant Varick . Varick What now ? perhaps some special messenger , Some passing comrades , or some new recruits , For in these stirring times of revolution And of war , events are clust'ring round these Rocks , or flitting by like clouds that pass or Hover o'er the mountain peaks  --  for here within This rocky citadel hath Freedom garner 'd Choicest hopes ; and built upon these rugged Clifts the portal of the great highway between The sister States . But who comes there ? Enter Lamb . Lamb . Col. Lamb Comrade ! ' T is I  --  Varick . Varick Hail commandant , why break your slumber At this lonely hour ? Lamb . Col. Lamb My couch was sleepless ; The night alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when lo ! the warning horn Gave fresh incentive to half-born desire . Varick . Varick ' T is well , perhaps the exigence will ask Your counsel ; were you not here , we were compell 'd To make intrusion when you sought repose . Lamb . Col. Lamb What means the signal ? Varick . Varick As yet I know not , But await the answer with my messenger 's Return . Lamb . Col. Lamb Sir , have you made your nightly rounds ? Varick . Varick In truth they were but even now completed . Lamb . Col. Lamb How were the watch upon the distant hills ? Varick . Varick All bright awake and keenly vigilant . Lamb . Col. Lamb And then the redoubts , that guard the approaches ? Varick . Varick Well mann 'd , and arm 'd , with ample preparation . Lamb . Col. Lamb And the patrols that spy each mountain pass ? Varick . Varick All , all alert . they scout each gorge and ravine . Lamb . Col. Lamb The lower posts  --  respond they to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send us back , " all 's well . " Lamb . Col. Lamb Enough ! they stand as our dependencies , And , when demanded , must receive our aid ; For since the passage of our army led By Washington , in hasty march , across The Hud-on 's flood , we of the western shore With weaken 'd garrisons , from frequent drafts , Are left uncover 'd , and the more expos 'd To sudden ouslaught from our lurking foe . Varick . Varick ' T is true ! and rest upon our own resource . Lamb . Col. Lamb Therefore would I commend you vigilance , Lest Stony point , late by the daring Wayne So bravely rescu 'd , should bloodier fall . Varick . Varick What would the noble Chief now meditate By moving thus upon the Eastern bank ? Lamb . Col. Lamb Most probably a menace to New York ; There lies the stronghold of the hostile power , And since the succors sent by France , guided By gallant Rochambeau , have made good footing On our shores , Rhode Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the British host . Varick . Varick We thus divert them to their own defence . Lamb . Col. Lamb Exactly thus , and hold communication Ready with the forces of our brave ally . Varick . Varick Or offer concert to a joint design . Lamb . Col. Lamb ' T is evident  --  but the crafty enemy , Perhaps with new accretions to his arms , Seeing attention drawn to distant points , Knowing what rich munitions here are stor 'd , And the injury their capture would inflict , May rush upon us like a sudden storm And carry ruin to our dearest hopes ; For this , I warn you to be vigilant . Varick . Varick And as I love my country and her rights , I 'll show that vigilance . Enter Sergeant ( saluting ) . He comes ! speak quickly , what intelligence ? Serg't . Sergeant One that bears despatches from head quarters Demands admission to the Commandant . Varick . Varick Enough , the Commandant by chance is here , Allow the bearer , therefore , free approach . Exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then exit . Varick goes to meet the stranger . Varick . Varick What , Tallmadge ! is it you , my gallant friend ? I bid you truly welcome . Tall . Tallmadge Brave comrade , Thus to meet once more is joy .  --  Varick . Varick Allow me , Commandant , to present a worthy soldier . Lamb . Col. Lamb Of whom I oft have heard , but ne'er was favor 'd Thus , to meet till now . Tall . Tallmadge Count me unfortunate ; But to the duty which I now perform , Tho ' late , believe th ' acquaintance gives most grateful Pleasure . gives him despatches . Lamb . Col. Lamb Gentlemen , without apology I will retire , while you hold company ; This seal 'd despatch , perhaps , requires some note Of instant scrutiny and prompt reply . exit . Varick . Varick And comrade ! now , while here my watch and give To earnest curiosity the import Of all the tidings of the current news , Which public movements , or our private friends Involve ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tallmadge Rumor is freely rife , but not official , That i ' the South some sad discomfiture Has met our arms . Varick . Varick Who there has been defeated ? Tall . Tallmadge The story runs , that Gates , with but nine hundred Regulars , and such quick-gather 'd bands Of patriots , brave but undisciplin 'd , As hurri 'd from their ploughshares and their homes , In vain resisted the o'erwhelming might . Varick . Varick Perchance ' t were not so bad ; indulge a hope : Ne'er carve despair upon a freeman 's heart . Set forth the rest , as mottled destiny Shakes out her budget on our bleeding land . Tall . Tallmadge Here , in the North , our Washington , alone And unsupported by the pow'rs that be , Has boldly met our allies , with assurance That all engagements made shall be fulfill 'd . Alone , for all have shrunk , e'en Congress , hardly Numb'ring twenty-one , stands almost pow'rless ; He is the war , cool , calm and undespairing , And like a mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thro ' the storm . Varick . Varick And the army ? Tall . Tallmadge The army and their chief Are one , firm as these rocks tho ' suffering ; Subsisting on the coarsest food , barefooted , Their clothes in tatter 'd shreds , with Valley Forge And all its wint'ry horrors deep impress 'd Upon their memory , and the same prospect In these wilds , these heroes still remain unmov 'd ; Devoted to their country 's cause ; no shock Can shake a freeman 's soul ! Varick . Varick What else ? Tall . Tallmadge That Arnold will command these posts . Varick . Varick What Arnold ! the gallant Arnold ? Tall . Tallmadge The same . He sought the situation long , but yet Indirectly , and thus was scarcely deem 'd In such an application earnest  --  indeed ' T was hard for Washington to comprehend That such a spirit fiery and fearless , That rioted upon the carnaged field , And madden 'd with the glorious conflict , Would e'er sit tamely down and hold within These battlemented walls , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Varick ' T is strange , indeed ! Tall . Tallmadge But yet most truly so ; For when of late our host the Hudson pass 'd , Arnold appear 'd in camp , and there was proffer 'd In command the left wing of our army . This he declin 'd , alleging that his wound Had long disabl 'd him from active duty . Again he pli 'd his quest as suitable To his condition . Washington at length Convinc 'd of his sincerity in urging Thus his claims , or won by importunity , Acceded to his warm desires , and nam 'd Him Commandant of all these mountain holds . Varick . Varick ' T was well bestow 'd . Tall . Tallmadge An honorable post . Varick . Varick And one where he can rest his shatter 'd limbs . I know his suff'rings , for I was with him On the field of blood-stain 'd Saratoga , Where ' midst the battle 's fierce and deadly rage , The rattling musquetry and deep-ton 'd cannon , The shout of combatants and trumpet clang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the cloudy smoke that densely shrouded The close lines , and cheering on with sword aloft , He reckless dash 'd amidst the enemy . Tall . Tallmadge ' T is thus the story of his valor runs . Varick . Varick His horse was soon kill 'd under him , and he Laid wounded , as before , in Canada . Tall . Tallmadge There can I certify the history , For I was of that band whom Arnold led , Like Hannibal , thro ' a rude wilderness ; In those lone solitudes where time had spent Its hermit hours ! we wended , toiling on Thro ' mountain-pass , o'er the rough waste , or down Some cataract-encumber 'd stream , floating Perilous , deep freighted in our bark canoes . Varick . Varick Daring enterprize ! Tall . Tallmadge Still held we on , unaw 'd , Though press 'd by hunger , and thro ' wet and cold , And all those dark vicissitudes that martyr Up existence , till we stood in threat'ning Attitude before the walls of proud Quebec ! Varick . Varick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Morgan , And by that hero led ' mid all the inclement Fury of a December storm , that shed Its drifting snows ; we penetrate the town . When in the full career of victory , News flies that Arnold had been carried wounded , From the field , and Montgomery had fallen ; His patriotic blood had thus pour 'd out The crimson record of its worth upon The pure white mantle which the heav'ns had laid On earth ! Varick . Varick Unfortunate ! Tall . Tallmadge We must retreat . Yet it was full of admiration , when , With iron resolution , Arnold , though Borne down with suffering , despite of pangs  --  Despite of dreary distance from his home , Despite the rigors of an arctic winter , Still dar 'd , with some few hungry suff'ring men , To hold his leaguer round the hostile town . Varick . Varick And that , too , as I have heard , with the dread Pestilence raging thro ' his camp  --  folding Within its loathsome clasp , the victims who Were spared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tallmadge ' T was so . Oh ! Varick , oft when I have held My watch thro ' those long northern nights , and gaz 'd Upon the frost bright stars , and dream 'd of all That they had seen in by-gone ages , thought Forced the contrast , how once fair Italy Had lur 'd the Carthagenian , with its Clustering vines and gold hued fields , to dare The Alpine heights ; but no attractions urged Our leader on ; naught but his stern resolve ; He had no vista but the leafless woods , Where the wild winds moan 'd , and one wide wintry Desolation , where the gaunt wolves howl 'd alone . But his soul was like the granite of his Native hills so firm ; while thro ' the low'ring Gloom , hope only kept a fitful spectre Dance , like th ' aurora borealis gleam ! Var . Varick Brave to temerity , as we have seen When first we met on Lake Champlain ; ' t was there , Tall . Tallmadge At Valcours Isle  --  Var . Varick He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but bade those inland billows Bear his country 's flag with glory wreath 'd ; and Sent her sov'reign voice in the loud roar of Cannon echoing thro ' the woods and hills . Tall . Tallmadge Was ever brighter valor , as he fought That day , or more success when silently At night he pass 'd the enemy , eluding All his vigilance . Var . Varick Grant you not ' t was still More glorious , when on th ' ensuing day He was o'ertaken by the enemy , And in his crippled galley combatted For hours against their overwhelming might Most desperately , until surrounded By seven large sail , he fiercely broke away , Stranded his craft upon the shelving shore , Wrapped her in flames , with colors waving still , And was the last to leave her deck and ' scape The jeopardy ? Tall . Tallmadge Oh , glorious Arnold ! Var . Varick Hail to the hero ! Tall . Tallmadge Arnold and Liberty ! A firing is heard . Var . Varick Ha ! some affair of the outposts , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , adieu ! Tall . Tallmadge And As the Commandant here comes , I will arrange With him my personal . Exit Varick . Re-enter Col. Lamb . Lamb . Col. Lamb These despatches Apprise me fully of the late appointment ; For General Arnold all shall be prepar 'd : Meanwhile , good major , you must be aweary Of your travel and the night , so enter  --  And partake a soldier 's fare . Exit Tallmadge . Re-enter Varick with soldiers bringing in a prisoner . Var . Varick Bear him here ! This man , good Commandant , with others arm 'd Was passing the defiles , and to the challenge Of our keen patrol refus 'd all answer ; Made fierce resistance ; they were soon dispers 'd ; The rest were fleet of foot , and he alone Was captur 'd .

How number you ? Pris . Prisoner Enough for stirring action ! Lamb . Col. Lamb Then there shall be one less ; but not to-night . Your doom shall be deferr 'd till future day , And till the will of our new coming chief Shall speak upon the matter ;  --  now , away ! Pris . Prisoner Hear me once more ! Lamb . Col.

Arnold The pomp of my reception pass 'd , I haste To seek these cliffs and their lone solitudes ; To brood upon my wrongs , and meditate The mighty compensation , which I mean To vengeful take for their accumulation . Here , let me gloat my avaricious eyes Upon the object of their long desires ; ' T is that which I have sought so serpent-wise Winding around each obstacle , until My coil is here ; the light indeed is holy , Even when it gleams in hell , and throws its Lurid glare upon a demon 's revels ; But ' t is holier when it clearly shows Your foeman 's warm and palpitating heart Denuded to the thirsting knife !

All This were to be borne ; but after fondness Such as I have shewn my country , and all That prodigal expenditure of time , Of health , and blood , and life extremely risk 'd , To be disgrac 'd ; to have my honor as A soldier marr 'd ; and oh ! shall I name it ? To be branded by a public reprimand ! Sear 'd with the marking iron ! till the brain , Fired with the inextinguishable flame , Writhes with the torture !  --  There is a sorrow Of the heart , when tears will flow and quench , but , There is a sorrow also of the brain That has no tears ; it petrifies !

Arnold Canst thou redress my wrongs ? Md . A. Wife of Arnold I know those Wrongs , perhaps beyond redress , but deep and Poignant as they are , a woman 's solace I would yet supply . Arn .

' T is hell ! what hell is equal To the hell of mind ! Md . A. Wife of Arnold How dreadful do you Speak , and with enigma . Still would I pierce That gloom , and with the torch of love and deep Devotion , bring comfort to your bosom . Arn . Arnold Forgive me !

Arnold Thou would'st support the Revolution ? Md . A. Wife of Arnold Yes  --  I ! Arn . Arnold Yet ' t was not always thus you thought ? Md . A. Wife of Arnold True ! For I was born of those who stand for high Prerogative , for kingly privilege , And the stability of olden order ; But then when I became a rebel 's wife  --  I took a rebel 's sentiments , and follow Faithful , right or wrong , my duty 's dictates .

Wife of Arnold From Andre ? Arn . Arnold Ay , the English Andre , whom first you knew when Britain 's force Held occupation in your native town . Md . A. Wife of Arnold Just so  --  well , not of late ; you saw the last Of that epistolary chat , which op'ning Long before , yet since our marriage , has held Way , with your most cordial approbation .

He has a temper sweet , yet melancholy ; Is eloquent with pen and tongue ; displays An artist 's graphic hand , and often breathes A poet 's strains , with graceful harmony ! Arn . Arnold A poet , said you ? a poet , wife , is  --  One that list'ning hears heav'ns wand'ring melodies , And notes them as they glowing leave the seraph 's Lyre ! There are few poets ! Md . A. Wife of Arnold True , true , most true ; We 'll rate him , then , but not so high , perhaps Not genius , yet he shines most talented A gentleman . Arn . Arnold And you will write him soon ? Md . A.

Wife of Arnold Oh yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this wild sublimity ; for nature Here , with voice of varying tones , wakes oft Mysterious echoes in the human Soul . Arn . Arnold And as a soldier he would ask still More than these poetic dreams , some knowledge Of our movements , views and strength ; write all , and Freely , too , for we have nought to fear , perhaps Thereby the more to gain . Md . A. Wife of Arnold Since thus you say , My letter shall be ample in detail ; ' Twill serve to while the leisure hour , and as My lines progress , you shall persue , and kindly Then suggest fresh thought to aid me further . Arn . Arnold So speed you , and farewell , awhile . Exit Madame Arnold .

Varick He was consign 'd for double Safety to the rock scoop 'd vaults , that excavate The fortress . Arn . Arnold There will I visit him , when Night shall shroud its hours , to gain intelligence . Perhaps , most useful to our cause . The time And mode will save us from all babbling talk ; And solitude will jointly work to soften Him to pliancy .

Exit . SCENE II . Parapet of the Fort at Stony Point . Tallmadge and Varick . Tall . Tallmadge Heard you the music , comrade ? Var . Varick Aye , the deep Rolling of the drums , and then at intervals The horn , that marshals on the cavalry ! Tall . Tallmadge The troops approach  --  where is your General ? Var . Varick Attendant on the Commander in Chief , And I am here to pass communications . Tall . Tallmadge There breaks the valiant vanguard on the sight ! Var .

Tall . Tallmadge Canst thou discern who marches next ? ' t is clouded From my view . Var . Varick ' T is knox and his artillery . Tall . Tallmadge He of the stentor voice ! methinks I hear Him roaring his commands on that dark wintry Night , when Washington , with desperate resolve , At Trenton dar 'd the icy flood , and crush 'd The Hessian in his sleep-wrapp 'd lair . Who next ? Var . Varick ' T is Wayne and Pennsylvania ! the daring Band , that storm 'd these rocks , and here of yore , revenged The ruthless butchery that stained Paoli 's Fields . Tall . Tallmadge I see , and as the column moves , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He leads New England 's gallant sons . The men Who never idly waste their deathful lead . So Bunker 's Hill , with gory trophies strewn , Or Bennington , the blood-dyed field can tell . Var . Varick ' T were vain our praises to recount for all , Where all have bravely done . Tall . Tallmadge In truth the array Is glorious ! as the bright bayonetted Ranks defile , one feels a nobler throb ; their Country hails those warrior sons , that bluntly Bear the toils of war , not for ambition Or its dark designs , but to securely Found the freedom of this land , and thus transmit Its blessings to the latest times . Var . Varick My eyes Are wrapp 'd upon that warlike train : look where They wind amid the hills , mass follows mass ; Their arms refulgent with the setting sun ; Their plumes are dancing with the measur 'd tread ; Their banners floating proudly on the breeze , Till distance hides them , or the devious Way .  --  Tall .

Var . Varick The army Scarce will reach their final post ere break o ' Day . Tall . Tallmadge Know you the points they then will there assume ? Var . Varick At Orangetown canton 'd , the left upon The river 's bank  --  ' t is La Fayette 's command  --  The right thrown inland , which will thus secure The passes to these mountain holds , ready To move on instant warning east or west , Or else below , as Greene , now named Commander , Shall control .

Exeunt . SCENE III . The Cavern beneath the Fortress .  --  Prisoner alone . Pris . Prisoner Gloom wears the time apace . To be thus torn From active life , and that so suddenly ; Doom 'd thus to solitude ; upon one 's self Turn 'd in ; to count the throbbings of the pulse ; To know no other world , but memory ; To feel the gnawing tediousness of slow Delay ; oh ! this is death made sensitive ; This vault is but the tomb of hope , where it Lies a beauteous corpse ! Time is measur 'd To me by the drop , and as it falls , I Shrink as if its touch were agony ; my Foes ' malignity will fix my fate ; yet Will I die unflinching : for mercy pleads In vain amidst these cruel civil feuds ; No triumph shall be drawn in that I 've shewn Myself a craven to my cause .

Arnold Hast thou in truth no Deferential awe for that majority That speaks a people 's will ? can it be wrong ? Pris . Prisoner Must it be right , when brawling demagogues Lead on the unthinking mass for their own Selfish ends , and urge rebellion ? Arn . Arnold Can ought Be more conducive to our country 's good ?

Taken arm 'd , And that within our lines , with these avowals On thy lips , thou wilt be hang 'd for one or All . Pris . Prisoner I know it . Arn . Arnold Then would'st thou save thy life ? Pris . Prisoner And how ? For life is dear , and instinct urges Its salvation . Arn . Arnold He with whom thou speakest Can sink or save thee . Pris . Prisoner Say , then , who art thou ? Arn . Arnold Arnold ! Pris . Prisoner Arnold ? a valorous name , and One that carries weight within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arnold This fortress I command ; My word knows no control ; perform what I Require , and I will save thee . Pris . Prisoner I take thy Promise ; and now name thy terms . Arn . Arnold Our public Service calls , with hostile posts , for frequent Intercourse : communication with New York Is now desir 'd , that we may hold with secret Friends intelligence of all such matters Now transacted there ; point , therefore , out some Trusty messenger , that he may bring and Bear despatches ; whilst thou a pledge of his Fidelity shall stand . Pris . Prisoner Nought but this dreadful And close hedged emergency should force me There . Arn . Arnold Nay , no demur , ' t is there thy fate depends . I will defer from time to time thy case , And if my will is done , thou shalt escape . Pris .

His rude log cabin  --  where he Dwells alone  --  stands high upon the cliff , hung O'er by forest trees ; the fall of waters From a neighb'ring brook speaks to the solitude , And all night long his lamp , trimmed with a watchful Care , gives out its gleam . You can not miss your Way . Draws an inkhorn and paper from his pocket and writes , Take this , ' twill be thy talisman , and Thus accomplish all thou would'st desire . Arn . Arnold And If I do , so sure art thou rewarded . But for thy present and thy future weal Keep well your counsel , and on the subject Of my coming now , I task your silence . Farewell . Pris . Prisoner Adieu . Exit Arnold . Thus do I pass from Death To Hope . This man has power to save me  --  an Only chance  --  so must I trust him ; one ray Of trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if the shadow of death 's valley Rested here . Yet this is life , and as its Wheel goes round , we rise or fall ; nor know when Journey we too fast or slow : yet nature Gives self-preservation as the law  --  though Seemingly I act against my cause , thus Gaining knowledge for my foe , yet the veil , That limits all our views , hangs with a dark , Impenetrable web , that baffles human Speculation . Thus all may work to other Ends ; and with this hope I 'll calmly hug content , And leave the rest to Providence and time . SCENE IV . Gorge of the Mountains  --  Log Hut . Enter Old Man of the Mountain . Old M. Old Man of the Mountain The night wanes on ; the moon hath set ; the very Forest boughs seem full of sleep ; here and there A few discordant sounds break on the solemn Quiet ; the owl from yon wither 'd hemlock Hoots at the setting stars ; and the green throated Frog croaks from his grass-edged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeps among the loftiest Branches ; while the rattlesnake lies coil 'd under The poisonous ivy . Now is the time To cull the healthful plants , when they are wet With midnight dew , that gives them double virtue ; Such as the Ginseng , with its vermillion Berry , that loves the deepest shade ; and then Wild Basil , that here flow'rs this month , and heals The serpent 's bite ; and Seneka , that pictures The wild dry woods with its rose-color 'd leaves ; And Coltsfoot that grows beside ; and Sweet Fern : And the Wild Indigo with its yellow Flowers . These can I seek now unmolested , And pass unquestion 'd by the fierce marauders , That oft now traverse these lone glens ; for these Are troubled times , wherein the conflict is For Liberty or Loyalty ; mad are The combatants : thus does the race accurs 'd Drive ever blindly on , but fast or slow , They find at length , thank God ! the grave , the hostel Of democracy ! A blight once drove me From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solitude from men and men 's affairs ; but Fate has in the vortex thrown me once again ; Events have thicken 'd uncontrolable ; So I have play 'd my part full gently ; humor 'd Their follies ; indifferent , or rather Pleas 'd to see this mutual immolation ; I stand a neutral , inwardly sneering , And thus hold all their clues . But who comes here ? Enter Arnold , muffled in a Cloak . Ho ! wanderer ! Arn . Arnold Well met , good father , canst Tell me ought of him they call the Old Man Of the Mountain ? Old M. Old Man of the Mountain ' T is I that thus am sometimes Known ; what brings thee here ? Arn . Arnold To ask a favor . Old M. Old Man of the Mountain ' T is at a darkling hour . Arn . Arnold Why so ? Old M. Old Man of the Mountain Seest thou Yon strip of cloud , that like a scroll of blackness , Wraps with slow advance that fiery star ? Arn . Arnold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That star is Aldebaron . Arn . Arnold I know Him well . For I , like all who sail , have often Watch 'd him on the stormy deep ; what then ? Old M. Old Man of the Mountain Him Follow close the three mysterious kings That shine in belted Orion . Their look Is sparkling and contentious ; so the fate Of what thou now would'st undertake , must hang Upon an adverse three ; for thus the aspect Of the heavens was spread , when first I saw thee . Arn . Arnold Dost thou believe , old man , this idle reading Of the stars ? or would'st thou , by this mystic Divination , shroud thyself to vulgar Eyes , with supernatural awe ? Old M. Old Man of the Mountain ' T is not The stars , or what they ever work with secret Influence , tho ' ' t may be for aught we know , Sages have sanction 'd this belief far back In hoar antiquity  --  but , beyond all This , there often comes a deep foreboding . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the outer world . These speak , as ' T were , with dark prophetic force , and picture What the future hour portends . Arn . Arnold Know then ! there Stands , old man , a spirit now before thee , That though at times depress 'd , and trodden down With wrong or care , or sicken 'd by some dark And atrabilious flow ; yet , when it feels Itself again as now , in all the vigor Of its innate power , its own immortal Essence strong  --  grasps fortune with an iron Will , and dares defy both heav'n and hell ! Old M. Old Man of the Mountain Since Thus thou rashly fling'st at fate , distinctly Speak what thou desire . Arn . Arnold Then tell thy bent ; art Thou for Freedom , or the Royal cause ? We Are but man to man , respond then freely , For thou need'st not fear . Old M. Old Man of the Mountain That will I , for I Know no cause ; I own no master ; no pilgrim , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arn . Arnold If Thus thou bafflest all attempt at candor , I 'll try what charm this paper holds with thee . Gives paper to the old man , who goes to the light in his cottage window , and returns . Old M. Old Man of the Mountain " Ha ! his life in peril ! if in thy power , Obey implicitly the bearer 's will ; " ( aside ) He sav 'd my life with hazard of his own . ( toAr . ) I am thy slave ; command , it shall be done ; And by the doing , shown , that gratitude Still blooms within this wither 'd heart of mine . Arn . Arnold Then bear this package to New York . There place It in the post : thro ' the same channel wait Answers for Gustavus : I will be here Upon the due return . His life , whom thou Wouldst save , hangs on thy faithful execution . Exeunt . END OF ACT SECOND . ACT III . SCENE I. Governor 's Island , in New York Harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort . And . Andre ' T is a fair eve : yon sky is glowing clear With amber light ; and a few crimson clouds Still hover where the sun has set ; the breeze Comes freshen 'd from the crimpl 'd waters ; the wide Expanded bay around the wooded shores Looks dark and shadowy ; e'en the spire-mark 'd City feels this twilight calm . ' T is only Here and there some gliding bark shows its white Sail ; in the midway air the seagull floats Upon its tireless wing  --  the lone wild hunter Of the crested deep ! ' T is soothing truly Thus , the day 's rough passage o'er , to saunter Here ; and may the coming night bring sweet repose ! For in the past I was annoy 'd with gloom-dy 'd Dreams  --  wherein I wandered midst wild mountain Scenes  --  rough with their dark defiles and cragged Cliffs ; and as I roam 'd , there met me one  --  such As poets paint the demon  --  the blended Form of man and devil ; his greeting first Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and he would lead me on , but then There rose a voice as mournful as the wind That leads the winter storm  --  it murmur 'd wo ! And then a second , and a third , as ' t were A dying wail , reiterated wo ! And then , methought , there came three phantoms , dress 'd As ' t were in shrouds , and seiz 'd me ; and they cried " We 'll bear thee to the spirit-land , " thereupon The demon yell 'd as from despair , and fled ; And as I upward look 'd , three raven birds , Huge as the Condor , hover 'd over us , Slowly flapping their sable pinions , while Their eyes , so gory red , look 'd down ; and as The scowling clouds chas 'd on their scud , all grew Dark and icy cold ; I awoke trembling With horror , and with clammy sweat bedew 'd . Strange , ' t was three ! three voices ! three phantoms ! and Three birds ! In classic lore the fates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lachesis Spins out the thread , which Atropos , with fatal Shears , clips off . Yes , ' t was a fever 'd dream ; and Does it aught portend ? In this mysterious Life , is that intelligence within us So subtly link 'd with the invisible , That visible becomes , and pictures out The future to the mind , when slumber bars It from the outer world ? and was it thus , That they of ages past , the olden seers , And those that spoke prophetic , told of things To come ? Do whispering spirits thus reveal The secrets of our pletting fate ? and give From out th ' unravell 'd womb of coming time Dark intimation of the fatal germ That ripens in its folds . But hence , ye thoughts That dally with despair ; I am a soldier ! Bound where duty calls to meet , unflinching , Ev'ry blow that destiny may deal : thus Shake I off this gloom , resolv 'd to breathe this Hour that sheds its hallow 'd calm . The past is Gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems Hardly sure , unless we deeply feel , and Seize the pleasures it may strew . But lo ! here Comes Sir Henry . Enter Sir Henry . Clin . Clinton My friend , accept my greeting ! And . Andre And mine to you , my chief . Clin . Clinton Knowing your wont To walk the ramparts as the evening falls , I sought you here , that we may thus commune Alone . And . Andre What weighty circumstance , Sir Henry , Calls for that attention you would now bestow ? Clin . Clinton The secret correspondence . And . Andre That , indeed ! Clin . Clinton Ay , Andre . I have been for some time past In deep conjecture lost , to know who wrote Unasked , unpaid , and from the Rebel ranks , Gratuitously thus gave information Of such deep import . And . Andre And whom would you suspect ? Clin . Clinton Maturely weigh 'd , and by comparison Of varied facts , the fast conclusion comes , That it must be some officer of highest Rank ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probability than Arnold ? And . Andre Than Arnold , say you ? with such conjecture I accord ; none other can it be than Arnold . Clin . Clinton The same ; who more than he has cause To curse th ' injustice done his hardy service ? Who in promotion been so long delay 'd ? Who mark 'd with more disgrace by reprimand ? Besides , the bias that his marriage blends With his dissatisfaction . And . Andre Convincing Proofs , and I could furnish more . I knew his Lovely lady well before her marriage , While the royal best was quarter 'd in her Native town . Since then , she oft has honor 'd Me with such communicated news , as Constitute the incidents of social Friends ; and in her letters oft , some other Hand has here and there inserted hints , that Rhyme most strangely with this same unknown ; but Further expose , where a lady wrote , you 'll Not require . Clin . Clinton That courtesy forbids ; and Thus , my friend , tho ' I ere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd by a martial Court , seem 'd thrown degraded from employ ; ' t was Little worth to court him then . But now there Comes a change ; he holds West Point ; and so ' twill Give a magnitude to this affair . For By a recent and most plain despatch , which Thou canst read , Gustavus , as he signs , agrees To render up himself in such a mode , As shall confer direct the best advantage On our Sovereign 's arms . And . Andre With these proposals Will you close ? Clin . Clinton When all is sure ; tread not too Fast : the mode must first be fix 'd ; its terms defin 'd . In using traitors , guard from treachery , Lest while we plot , there should be counterplot , And sad disaster foil our hop 'd advantage . In short , we must , by interview , be certain Of our man ; and from conjecture , pass secure To confirmation . With this unknown we Long have play 'd in mask , let now his features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Henry , will you Then depute to execute so delicate A task ? Clin . Clinton I had , indeed , propos 'd another , To the purpose suited well , but now engross 'd With other cares ; and therefore have resolv 'd , My friend , to place this business in your Hands . I know your talents in affairs ; indeed , Gustavus , by his letter , so requires , As you will see ; my special confidence Is thus distinctly shown . And . Andre In truth , ' t is so , My well lov 'd chief , and thus I own , what you Desire is my command ; I owe you all ; For thou has shed the almost only ray That e'er has warm 'd my clouded life . Thy fost'ring Care has rais 'd me up , and over duty Due my king , I render him that acts my Father . Clin . Clinton I love thee , Andre , as a son . But now a truce ; let 's use despatch : for see This enterprize may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour : should fortune Smile upon the part you bear , thy Sovereign 's Favor will most freely flow , and glory Wreathe its laurel on thy brow . And . Andre My chief , direct , I Pant to execute your slightest will ; This heart once knew a hopeless love , but now Ambition of the purer kind throbs there : And I , at thy command , could mount the bastion 'd Rampart , to carry victory , with sword In hand , among the fierce and thronging foe , Though Death stood in reserve , with all his spectral Band ! Clin . Clinton I can not doubt your ardent zeal , but Would commend you caution ; ' t is not that vein Of gallantry , that fits the open field , That you will now require , but the address That winds its way through each intrigue ; that loiters Now , and now strides boldly on , until each Obstacle be fairly pass 'd , and ev'ry Object of its views be won . And . Andre Instruct me Then , and I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though dissimulation Be to me so strange , yet shall my nature , Tutor 'd to the part , act well the cunning Drift that it must play . Clin . Clinton So , then , we 'll now away . Exeunt . SCENE II . Front of Smith 's House , near the Hudson River . Enter Arnold and Smith on the Piazza , conversing . Arn . Arnold This French alliance now revolts my soul . Smith . Joshua Smith Why comes it thus repugnant to your views ? Arn . Arnold Because it binds us to our ancient and Most crafty foe ; that foe so deadly hostile To our faith , in whom ' t is mockery or Deep laid fraud to fight for Liberty , when All her sons , themselves , are held as feudal Slaves . Smith . Joshua Smith What then are her designs ? Arn . Arnold To sever Britain 's Empire ; and by dependence chain Us to herself . Smith . Joshua Smith Will no advantage spring From this ally ? Arn . Arnold None , save to those the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose Of their own designs , hoodwink the people . We took up arms to vindicate our rights , But not to sunder all allegiance To the crown  --  then independence was declar 'd ; In that , though premature , I did concur ; Tho ' ' t was the work of these same upstart few . No vote submitted to the nation 's will ; From step to step they rashly urg 'd us on ; At last they flung us in a tyrant 's arms . Smith . Joshua Smith Indeed , I feel the reason strong in what You say . Arn . Arnold Truth carries in itself its point ; I speak thus freely from my love and hate , That to my country , this to those who drag Her down . Smith . Joshua Smith Be guarded , General , your int'rest Calls for caution . These men have gall 'd you . Arn . Arnold I Will not fear , and do defy them ; my zeal They can not quench ; my sword will always hew Its way . Among the masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , here am I , with shatter 'd limbs , the remnant of rough Service ; the persecuted ; one kept back And pinion 'd down ; I ! that within my mighty Grasp had held this Continent , and travers 'd It with giant steps , and carried victory Through pathless woods and mountain wilds ; and ferried Its colossal floods , from where the arctic Snows lie in eternal winter , to soft Savannahs blooming with an endless spring ; But no , this tree unfetter 'd range found no Approval with my masters ; and measur 'd I must be by pigmy scales , and cropp 'd in My dimensions . Sound of a distant bell . But hark that bell ! Smith . Joshua Smith It peals At nine the curfew . Arn . Arnold A good old custom ; And it brings to mind the time of innocence And youth , ere fierce ambition , with its haggard Train , had thrown its fitful gleam of lurid Light upon our thorny way ; the quiet Hamlet where I liv 'd , with all its rustic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd With noiseless step stole down the blushing sky As to the bosom of a bride ! But now The hours wax late . Remember still to show Thy zeal for our good cause . Smith . Joshua Smith As I have ever Done . Arn . Arnold For which thou hast my commendation , As of my predecessor . Thy social Rank and wide acquaintance with both high and Low ; thy close proximity to border Lines , in this secluded spot , thus margin 'd On the Hudson 's bank , gives thee good scope and Sure , for quick intelligence . Thy care then Show . Smith . Joshua Smith So count on my alertness . Arn . Arnold Hark ye ! Good Smith ; of late from this thy domicile , Thou hast observ 'd the frequent passage to And fro , across the bay , of flags of truce . From frequent hints thou wouldst enquire their purport ; And now I will explain thee . That Robinson .

Those flags his letters brought Of such an import ; to which  --  the immediate Business  --  was subjoin 'd , that Robinson Had power to tender such preliminary Terms , as ' twixt our country and the British Court ' t was hop 'd would work accommodation : He now delays on board the Vulture , and Thence , solicits through another flag , but Recently received , an interview , that He may freely there explain , which , when agreed . Will terminate this bloody contest . Thus On this point your sentiments are mine , ' t is An event we cordially both wish for ; Give then your aid to carry out the plan , And so advance your country 's welfare . Smith . Joshua Smith Count On my aid most cheerfully bestow 'd , I Deeply rate , and would promote this object 's Meeting . Arn .

Smith . Joshua Smith So be it well , you have my promise : I Will go . Arn . Arnold But should th ' affair be trammell 'd aught With dull protraction , our guest must have , and We provide for his accommodation . Smith . Joshua Smith As where ? Arn . Arnold In this , thy house . Smith . Joshua Smith My family ! Will not their presence then prevent ? Arn . Arnold Remove Thy family , by visits to their friends , And such domestics , from whose wagging tongues , We may feel apprehension . Dost thou accord ? Smith . Joshua Smith If so thy will . Arn .

Enter Clinton and Andre walking on the Ramparts . Clin . Clinton I had despatch 'd , you know , the Vulture , sloop Of war , with Robinson on board , as high As Teller 's Point , that with the shore an easy Intercourse might thus be made : he , on pretence Of making claim for properties of his , Alleg 'd as forfeited by rebel law , Had held , as we agreed , a correspondence On the point with Arnold ; thus had we not Unreasonably suppos 'd a meeting Might occur , at which our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the higher powers : for now these letters Are at hand , with like details from Arnold .

And . Andre And may I Then , Sir Henry , my attempt once more renew , To bring about this interview ? For though Our guard-boats , not forewarn 'd , fir 'd on th ' approaching Arnold , as he came to meet my former Visit , and thus did baffle what was well Begun ; yet may we now with more precaution Doubtless hope for more success .

And . Andre This further Confidence calls on my part for further Zeal ; and I will strain each venturous nerve To make the purpose of our project tell . Clin . Clinton But yet be cautious how your conduct sway This perilous affair : use no disguise , As Arnold 's letters prompt , nor enter yet The hostile lines ; nor take , or on your person Bear , aught that can in written form betray ; Nor place yourself by acting thus , I strictly Charge , within the grasp inexorable Of martial law .

Come , haste , thou twin concoctor ! we will breathe It low ; lest the list'ning toad should hear and Deem it foul : now ' mid these bush-grown woods , whose Hoarded gloom will shroud each blush of shame ; here Will we whisper in the conscience-quiv'ring Ear our plan ; and meet like gliding ghosts amid The shades so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why comes he not ?

I would not see my purchaser , Who buys me as a slave , and curls his lip Contemptuous as he pays me gold . No ! My face ne'er crimson 'd at the sight of man ; But now I feel the tingling blood burn sharp The heated cheek ! Come , then , thou friendly night , Fold me in thy murkiest gloom , deep as Th ' infernal shades , that wrapp 'd the fiend when first From heav'n , his foot revolting , trod the halls Of hell !

And . Andre These are precautions Well design 'd . What more ? Arn . Arnold Thou know'st the massive Chain , that now athwart the Hudson hung , clogs , For defence , its navigable stream ; I Have from this detach 'd a link , on pretence Of repair ; a fragile rope its place supplies ; Its rupture easy on the slightest shock ; Thus as your craft are mounting with the flood , This late obstruction will no hindrance give .

Our Chief , in conference With Rochambeau , is absent now , but will Forthwith return , perhaps , some four days hence .

I 'll bear it all ; and if not all , divide The burden , so it press less strong ; from others Ken he may disguise what thus corrosive Works , but every shade reveals its subtlest Hue beneath the scruitinizing glance that Arms a wife .

He ask 'd For Arnold ; but for two days past , none knew Or had seen aught of Arnold : he seem 'd perplex 'd ; Inspected all our works ; and thus departed . Var . Varick And such was Arnold 's guile to favor his Escape ; for as about to make his morning Meal , he was appris 'd of Washington 's approach , As he return 'd from off his Eastern tour ; A little after , intimation came Of Anderson 's arrest : the traitor took It cool , gave out that hasty bus'ness call 'd Him to the Point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The captive Feels attentions thus bestow 'd ; your kindness Warms my heart with grateful glow . Tall . Tallmadge Humanity Should strew the track of ruthless war , with soothing Deeds ; this maxim were my guide ; but that apart , You wake such interest by your deportment , That all my feelings haste to mitigate Your lot . And . Andre Indeed , the evidence is so , This genial warmth expands me . Tall . Tallmadge A soldier Learns to sympathize with what may be each Soldier 's fate . Had but success your enterprize Once crown 'd , you then had gain 'd ambition 's lov 'd Renown ; applause had met thee with its sweetest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was rich in bounty  --  yet now  --  And .

Tell me my fate . Tall . Tallmadge Speak not of that ; Hope what is best : I would not add , to those You feel , a pang ; but let us lead such converse Gently on , as soothingly may woo your Spirit from its instant grief . And . Andre Nay , I insist ; Come , frankly speak ! tell me the light wherein I shall be view 'd by Washington , and such Tribunal as he may convene ? Tall .

Andre Nay , I Entreat , most worthy Sir , keep not this matter In such close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raises on our Darken 'd view . Tall . Tallmadge Since thus you urge ; a sadd'ning Tale recurs that memory can never Hope to wipe away . I had a much lov 'd Friend in early days , my college chum , his Name was Hale ! Soon after that disastrous Fight , that drove us from Long Island 's shore , our Leader needed information of our Foe 's designs and strength , and at the call , then Made by Washington , Hale volunteer 'd , went On his mission , and fulfill 'd its scope ; but , As he compass 'd his return , the British Seiz 'd him at their outer posts . Know you its Sequel ? And . Andre They hang 'd him as a spy  --  but sure This instance tallies not with mine ? Tall . Tallmadge Precise Alike , and like your fate ! And . Andre So say you ? yet I can not thus conclude  --  for , see , comes no Extenuation from the fact that I Was brought within your lines against my will ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Command ? If I assum 'd complete disguise , Such act was subsequent to entry , and By the peril justified , that then my Safety ran : this can not frame the crime , it Must be full at first , or fail . Tall . Tallmadge Now , by my Faith , I would not rob a tittle from your Hope ; urge in defence these well laid thoughts and More : but dwell not now , and so without avail , On what will cast its shadows on the mind . And . Andre I will not brood ; but reasen must have way . If then my fate is fix 'd , as you would say ; And that you say , and thus pronounce in terms So positive , that none may now deny My doom confirm 'd ; why then this board were mock'ry . Conven 'd to try what is predestin 'd ; where Judgment twins with accusation ; or why Is execution on a sentence thus Forgone deferr 'd ? If I must die , speed were Mercy . It can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! There 's honesty display 'd In consultation . Tall .

SCENE III . West Point . Enter Tallmadge and Varick . Var . Varick My friend , now pity me , I need your best Advice . Alas ! what stain now crusts my honor ! Thus to have had connection , tho ' unconscious Of his crime , with this most infamous and Base of traitors ! Point out my course , you know Me innocent ; how deep were all deceiv 'd . Tall . Tallmadge Varick ! had you but told me that the sun , When shining with his brightest glow , was black ! Or that some other strange anomaly Existed in the course of well-pois 'd nature , I had believ 'd it sooner than the charge , That , on his country , Arnold thus had play 'd This falsehood . Whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career , thus falsely step and Fall ! Pity you ! indeed , my friend , I do ; Full well I know your yet untarnish 'd honor ! This implication shall be wip 'd away ! Demand inquiry ! Var . Varick I shall , and that forthwith ; This base deserter stands alone : this time Will show . He had a most miraculous Escape ; for on the sudden and o'erwhelming News , that his accomplice was arrest , he Hurried to his wife , told her his danger ; That they must part , perhaps for ever ; and Left her in a swoon ; then on a ready Saddled horse he gain 'd the river  --  there took A barge , and bade the lusty rowers pull As if he bore a flag , and gain 'd the Vulture ; Soon after , Washington arriv 'd . His special Messenger , as well you know , by Jameson Despatch 'd , with all the papers found on Andre When brought in , had miss 'd his Excellency , As he took the upper route from Hartford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And tho ' eluding all pursuit by rapid Flight , he found a ready but disgraceful Refuge with the enemy  --  He fied , and Left behind a name for execration ! Tall . Tallmadge Ay , ay , eternal execration ! and , Thus , lost to his honor , lost to his country , Dies  --  he that once so brilliant shone  --  with ling'ring Pangs a moral death ! Var . Varick How fares his victim ? He seems resign 'd , tho ' of his coming doom Not quite yet conscious . Var . Varick In that behalf , what Orders have been taken ? Tall . Tallmadge Tho ' ev'ry usage Of relentless war demanded speedy Doom , yet Washington , led by humanity , Deferr 'd all rash process ; and , that inquiry Might more formally be made , he has detail 'd A Board of Officers , and those of hightest Rank ; the pris'ner thus has opportunity To urge his utmost plea . Var . Varick When meet the Board ? Tall . Tallmadge I have th ' accus 'd in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has been most constantly with you Since first his capture ? Tall . Tallmadge Yes , almost : in fact When Andre , with his captors , first came in Where Jameson commands , I then was absent : But soon thereafter did return . I heard The incident , which seem 'd a mystery Puzzling to solve ; dress 'd as a citizen , ( For Andre had doff 'd , at Smith 's , his first costume ) Yet loaded with such documents , ' t was hard To place him ; yet as he pac 'd the guard-room To and fro , I caught the soldier 's habit As he turn 'd upon his heel ; tho ' thus assur 'd , ' T was but with pain , to think that one so young , In manners so refin 'd , and of such noble Bearing , should be thus involv 'd . But all surmise Was lost ere long , in my astonishment , When , he requesting , I perus 'd the letter He had penn 'd to Washington ; there Andre Had avow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in truth , he fill 'd the Adjutancy Gen'ralship of Britain 's army . Till then I had not dream 'd th ' affair was so involv 'd With such importance . Var . Varick A Melancholy Tale . What led him on ? zeal or ambition ? Tall . Tallmadge Both . For , as we journey 'd to the Point , and Saw its mountain battlements , our converse Ran upon its capture ; I ask 'd the post To him assign 'd , had all proceeded : he Pointed out a batt'ry ; trac 'd the route that To it led upon its rear ; and that , indeed , With more precision than myself had done ; Show 'd where he would have rang 'd the ridge , and enter 'd , Sword in hand , the parapet ; as he detail 'd , I could but admire th ' enthusiastic Fire that glowing , lit his countenance : his Eyes were sparkling ; his soul with ardor so Elate , imagination almost seem 'd To cheat him with reality . Var . Varick The more We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curse the traitor , by whose wiles He thus was lur 'd to ruin . But speed me News when you have learn 'd his trial 's issue . Tall . Tallmadge Be so assur 'd  --  I will . Exeunt . SCENE IV . Scene opens showing the Board of Officers convened . Fourteen Generals seated at a table , in a Hall . General Greene , President .

Voice Have you not acted Thus ? And . Andre Believe me , no ; such deed were foreign To this head and heart : I not willingly Have play 'd the base impostor . A voice . Voice Why in disguise ? And . Andre The tale is plain and short : we had the right By ev'ry rule of war , to meet the proffer Of an adversary ; to favor this We met on neutral ground . I landed from the Vulture ; was habited In uniform , wrapp 'd in an outer coat To shield me from the cold . I fairly ran My risk . Greene . General Greene Why then the change ? And .

Andre I have not more to add or Give to this relation ; what I have said Must work its own conclusion : I tread my Path alone ; my motive sought the service Of my King ; what seem 'd a vile disguise , I Have explain 'd .

Old Man of the Mountain Ay , ay , events tread Fast upon each other 's heels : there are treasons Hatch 'd  --  but burst in the shell , and murders foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ev'ry man looks shy At his neighbor , as tho ' he fear 'd him ; and Ambition , malice , pride , revenge , hatred , Are all playing wild pranks ; men are well-nigh Mad , and look ferocious ; hell runs riot : This uproar is call 'd Revolution . Lamb . Col. Lamb Ha ! Old man , thou play'st the censor well . What word Of Andre ? Old M. Old Man of the Mountain His hours are told . Lamb . Col. Lamb Know you his Doom ? Old M. Old Man of the Mountain He dies upon the gibbet . Lamb . Col. Lamb When so Decided ? Old M. Old Man of the Mountain But yesterday . Lamb . Col. Lamb In his defence How hath he then comported ? Old M. Old Man of the Mountain ' T was said , most Nobly . He stood alone midst enemies , And they array 'd with power imposing ; yet Was he calm , and undismay 'd ; disclaim 'd each Subterfuge and all concealment ; nor ask 'd The pris'ners common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other than himself ; Then high-ton 'd honor seem 'd to make him dumb : But of his own most fatal implication He naught withheld , but frankly told the tale Thro ' ev'ry circumstance ; thus obviating Proof . He labor 'd not from dread , but deep desire To palliate his acts from meanness . Lamb . Col. Lamb And He will justly perish . Old M. Old Man of the Mountain ( aside ) The lone and friendless ! The fatal Three had bound him ! Lamb . Col. Lamb What mutt'rest Thou ? Old M. Old Man of the Mountain What is decreed is just ; how many Did arrest him ? Lamb . Col. Lamb They number 'd three . Old M. Old Man of the Mountain Ay , three ; Thou think'st it chance , and yet ' t was three ! Lamb . Col. Lamb What then Is that ? and does it weigh thee ? Old M. Old Man of the Mountain Why wouldst thou Know ? ' t were scorn to thee to ask for thy belief ; This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mystic Three , that governs All begins , and thence descending , links th ' unseen To what , in human ken , is visible . Lamb . Col. Lamb Thou art a strange old man . Saw you the doom 'd ? Old M. Old Man of the Mountain I saw him in his beauty , with that pensive Eye ; the bloom of health was mantling on his Cheek . Who , as he gaz 'd upon that manly Face , had deem 'd it ripen 'd for corruption ? Yet the worm , when next he feeds , will glut that Dainty morsel . Ha ! ha ! I wish I were Asleep . Lamb . Col. Lamb His sands run low ; his course is short Between his prison and the grave ; while greedy Time , with avaricious haste , counts up its Loan , and shuts the door on loit'ring hope . Old M. Old Man of the Mountain Yet Round the door hope lingers still , for sympathy Companions hope : while , too , we speak , each effort Now is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make each trial that may turn aside The sad catastrophe : with this intent , Commissioners are now at hand , requesting Audience , that they , with freshen 'd eloquence , May argue ev'ry fact and rectify Conclusions : to this your Chief gives now consent , And Greene receives the delegation . Lamb . Col. Lamb ' Twill Naught avail . Old M. Old Man of the Mountain ' T is labor lost ; I say , amen . There must be three ; thus , the first was Arnold ; He lives a victim , but extinct to honor ; Then Andre dies ; show me the third . But list , What mournful sound is that of drum and fife ? A fun'ral dirge ; these woods and glens seem full Of death , as if the haunt where wand'ring spirits Kept their wail . Enter Funeral Train . Whom bear they out ? Lamb . Col. Lamb One taken In arms , and executed as a tory ; He suffered at the dawn . Old M. Old Man of the Mountain May I inspect The corpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Man approaches and then steps back . ) Old M. Old Man of the Mountain ' T is he , the third ! My worst forebodings true . Lamb . Col. Lamb I must direct This sepulture . Exit while train moves on . Old M. Old Man of the Mountain Alas , unhappy friend ! And after all not saved ! The traitor Arnold Has left thee also in the toils like Andre ; Yet I will follow thy remains ; see where Amid these forest shades they lay thee ; there Will I plant the turf upon thy wood hid Grave . This duty done , the last sad obsequy , I 'll witness Andre 's friendless close ; and then For ever fly to some lone wilderness , And to its solitudes consign this haggard Form . Exit . SCENE VI . Andre in Prison . And . Andre And I am doom 'd to die ; this being now So palpable in its discernment , must Fade away , and all that holds corporeal Functions , in its rightful tune , be then dissolv 'd In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinity  --  And then eternity , so terrible , With all its dread conjecture , stands yawning ! The disembodied Spirit ! shall it wander Till the judgment hour , a phantom gliding Thro ' the murky midnight air , or riding On the drift  --  as fiercely course the wintry Storms  --  mingling its wail alternate utter 'd With the moaning blast !  --  or sleep awhile that Dreamless sleep !  --  to be awak 'd , and then , oh , Horrible !  --  unless repentance has wash 'd Out the score  --  to feel such pangs , as now torment The flesh ! or undergo those agonies That wring the soul  --  and as it flies , to scent Th ' untiring scourger on its track for ever And for ever ! But now this bosom throbs With warm emotion . Oh ! lost Honora ! The heart , in sorrow 's hour , thus yearns to first Affection  --  thou wert my early love when All was bloom  --  and youth was fondling hope upon A bed of roses ! thy father 's stern command Fell on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black and blighted . Sweet spirit , Thou hast found an early grave ! I come ! stand On those mystic shores , and give its welcome To my ghost ! Ah ! in this hour of death , believe That I had ne'er forgot thee ! ( Draws a miniature from his bosom . ) This portrait Of thy angel face  --  as ' t were thy shade ! has Been my solace ; thro ' all the dangers I Have pass 'd  --  whatever lost , with this preserv 'd I still was rich ; I gaze by day  --  and there Read fondly in those eyes , the softness of Thy soul on earth ; I hear , or seem to hear Again , the music of those lips ! and then When slumber holds imprison 'd reason seal 'd , And in nocturnal revels fancy leads Around the heart its dance , thou com'st a sweet Illusion ! thy recollection , like some Rose-hued cloud , hangs o'er my setting sun ! Soon Shall I rest  --  yet on my lonely grave , no Hand with tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autumnal winds shed wither 'd leaves , And sing with solemn sound at midnight hours Their dismal dirge . Enter Tall . What now ? Tall . Tallmadge Alas ! my friend , I bear no news to soothe thy lot . And . Andre Sir Henry 's Commissioners were met ? Tall . Tallmadge By Greene . And . Andre Was no Impression made ? Tall . Tallmadge None made , tho ' ev'ry plea , That ingenuity could urge , was us 'd To place your evidence in light ; and thus The resolution of the Board remains Unchang 'd . And . Andre This closes , then , each avenue To hope . Tall . Tallmadge ' T were cruelty to say not so . And . Andre What deep solicitude has not Sir Henry Shown ? His heart bears all the mould of kindness , Nor would I leave him aught for self-reproach . In my presentment , I foresaw results ; This letter , thus prepar 'd , I pray you send Him ; ' twill note him of his strong advice , which , Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fault there be is mine .  --  But more , a widow 'd Mother , of her son bereft , will mourn me ; And those my gentle sisters ! who would fondly Cling upon their brother 's form whene'er he Met them  --  they have often counted o'er and O'er the tedious days , that stay 'd my wish 'd return ; And often stray 'd upon the sea-beat beach And watch 'd athwart the idle waves , and hop 'd My coming  --  ah ! they will weep my fate , and With tears as briny as those waters , on Whose endless roll for them henceforth no vision E'er will gleam , save shadowy memory ! May HE , who soothes , bind up their broken hearts ! I would provide them ; my commission sold Will be of moment : I ask Sir Henry Here to execute this legacy . Speak , Wilt thou despatch it by a faithful hand ? Grant this to me a dying man . Tall . Tallmadge I pledge My word it shall be done . And . Andre This then fulfils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would I ask another boon : bear this To Washington ; it holds the last petition I shall ever make to earthly power . Tallmadge ! There is no horror in the grave for me ; Its dreary silence ; its cold corruption ; The icy worm , with whom I soon shall be In brotherhood , create no dread ; for I Am borne above these terrors , when I feel Thus conscious of a life well spent , and that With honorable aim ; but let me die A soldier 's death ; drive thro ' my heart the reeking Steel ; or pour upon this breast the volley 'd Lead ; or lash me to the cannon 's mouth , and , With its dread explosion , hurl the fragments Of my shatter 'd form in air , I will not Flinch ; but spare that felon cord ; nor string me , Like a dog , to hang in gibes ! If aught there Be , that in my character , would on yourself Or countrymen , impress a generous Esteem ; if aught , in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim , policy , And not resentment , claims ; oh ! let me know These sentiments prevail , by being told I shall not meet this branded fate . Tall . Tallmadge Oh , heav'ns ! I would ' t were in my power to grant your wish , And , with such solace , to the opening tomb Soothe your short passage ; for I can sympathize With what so galls your honorable pride , Nor will I fail to urge , what now your panting Hopes would see prevail  --  what else may then refer To these committed trusts  --  again I pledge My honor to perform  --  what other service Would you now have done ? And . Andre None , worthy Tallmadge ; But leave me to my meditations  --  I Would be alone  --  I now await your Rev'rend Chaplain ; my time is short ; and , for his pious Visitation , I would arrange my mind . Exit Andre into a back apartment . Exit Tallmadge . SCENE VII . Front of Andre 's Prison . Enter Lamb with soldiers marching . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamb . Col. Lamb Attend ! thus run the General Orders , Observe their purport :  --  " Andre is convict As a spy , and by his own confession ; He will be hang 'd at mid-day , on the morrow ; Let due solemnity attend this painful Execution . Each general officer And staff , will lend their presence : this measure Tho ' severe , is just : its mode , by usage Fix 'd , the laws of war have meted ; it has Its warrant in the public safety ; haply Has Freedom ' scap 'd th ' assassin 's knife ; and tho ' They blush to hear the traitor 's name , the people Still may ever rest assur 'd , fidelity Will stand their guardian . " Now to your posts . Exeunt soldiers . Enter Tallmadge . What Now betides , good Major ? Tall . Tallmadge You are , Sir , here On duty ? Lamb . Col. Lamb I am detail 'd the escort To command , upon the morrow . This night I have the pris'ner in ward ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's urgent last request To Washington . Lamb . Col. Lamb Met you success ? Tall . Tallmadge He sought To die by arms ; he fears not death , but shudders At the halter 's ignominy ; it was Denied . Lamb . Col. Lamb A wretched destiny ! Tall . Tallmadge Deeply Lamented by Washington ; his kindly Heart at first seem 'd well inclin 'd to favor The petition ; but then in council it Was urg 'd , that such a change would argue doubt Of guilt  --  he either was , or he was not , A spy  --  if this , he should be freed ; if that , No half-way measure could be rightfully Pursu 'd . Lamb . Col. Lamb Will you communicate this stern Adherence ? Tall . Tallmadge No ; ' t was deem 'd the most humane , To spare his feelings , that his request remain Unanswer 'd . Lamb . Col. Lamb I know it painful rends his Excellency 's noble heart , to thus consign Th ' unhappy youth to such a fate . Tall . Tallmadge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has each gentler usage tried to soothe The suff'rer 's lot , even to the furnishing His meals , with delicate attention , from His own table . Lamb . Col. Lamb But one alternative Remain 'd to snatch him from his doom . Tall . Tallmadge And that ? Lamb . Col. Lamb Andre 's exchange for Arnold ! Tall . Tallmadge But were that Possible ? Lamb . Col. Lamb In confidence , the proffer Has been made ; but tho ' acutely Clinton Feels for Andre ; tho ' he would sacrifice So much to save his life ; yet have the rigid Rules of war forbade the harb'ring of such A thought , as giving up a traitor ! This Proffer was refus 'd . Tall . Tallmadge And he , lamented Both by friends and foes , will perish . Lamb . Col. Lamb In truth , Lamented ; but yet each patriot heart Must feel that Providence has to our country Shown its watchful care , by his detection : Had but this monstrous plot progress 'd , and ripen 'd With success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Middle States ; broke Up our mountain holds ; driven us headlong To the plains ; and left the enemy possess 'd , Upon our rear ; check 'd our communications ; Enabled the foe to baffle movements , By anticipation ; discourag 'd friends ; Show 'd that our country had its venal villains , Who only waited for their price ; in short , Had strew 'd around incalculable mischief . Tall . Tallmadge Congress their gratitude have shown , by those Rewards just lavish 'd on his captors . Lamb . Col. Lamb Well Merited for their fidelity ! Tall . Tallmadge But What of Smith ? Lamb . Col. Lamb There runs a rumor that he Will be tried ; but then , most probably , escape ; No proof can bring his guilty knowledge home . He might suspect , in fact might know ; but it Would rather seem , the traitor us 'd him as A tool , and kept himself in dark reserve Without accomplice . Tall . Tallmadge So now adieu ; we Shall participate in those solemnities That wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said , for they are such when man in judgment Sits on man , as now  --  imperative , yet Mourn 'd  --  regretted , but still truly righteous . Each preparation is arrang 'd for due Effect  --  an inner and an outer guard Will move in strong array : the scene will be Impressive ! and teach the foes of freedom Caution ; and while it thus diffuses awe , ' Twill to the people , as they throng to view This strange and sadd'ning spectacle , give firm Assurance that their cause , upheld by God And right , at last must gloriously triumph ! Exeunt . SCENE VIII . Andre . Morning of his Execution . In Prison . And . Andre That hour is near ! the last  --  the hour that comes To all ! I stand at thy mysterious Portals , Death ! Ghastly phantom ! thy clasp is Cold  --  the passage to that other world , where Thou wilt surely guide , impenetrably Dark ! Already am I of thy shadowy Realm , tho ' living  --  the vap'ry fold is round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  men look with awe Upon the doom 'd ! the trav'ler of destiny ! Whose track no torch 's gleam can trace  --  no answer Follow th ' inquiring call sent after him , Tho ' trumpet-ton 'd  --  from out that land from which No echo comes ! The morning breaks , the last That e'er will break on this devoted head Until the resurrection 's . Thro ' my grated Window I have watch 'd the drowsy dawn , since The first crowing of the cock , its wakeful Sentinel ! yet have I calmly slept away The night just pass 'd , so tranquil sweet , and dreamt Of home ! my childhood 's home  --  I dreamt of England ! Land of my birth , farewell ; these eyes are now For ever clos 'd upon thy rural charms ; Thy hedge rows green ; the rustic spires embosom 'd Mid the trees ; the limpid stream , by angler Haunted ; and feudal tow'r , with ivy mantled . Are but illusions now of memory ! How I remember , as I left thy shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t were , rising O'er the horizon ; and my last long look Still linger 'd o'er the wave till night came down Upon the ocean , and thy beacon lights Sunk one by one like setting stars ! Again Farewell  --  for this has pass 'd  --  that fever 'd dream Of love and martial aspiration  --  if Not , the clod will cool them all : and yet how Hard the soldier 's lot  --  to die with all that Deep humility that reconciles his God , while he sustains a proud and stoic Front to man ! But then the great heart reader , HE will pardon all ! I am prepar 'd ! Come , Haste my final march , with all its solemn Pomp of arm 'd array  --  and flash of sabre ; And the glitt'ring bayonet ; and cadence Tread of moving soldiery ; and the low Breath 'd music of the fife and muffled drum ; These are my fun'ral rites that harbinger The tomb ; and ' mid the mournful stillness of The eye-rivetted multitude , will rudely Hymn , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Enter Tallmadge and Lamb . Tallmadge ! ' t is kind in these last moments thus To come , and with the presence of a friend Bring consolation  --  take while you can my Warmest greeting  --  I soon shall greet no more ! Tall . Tallmadge I come not now , dear Sir , to proffer words That idly speak of sympathy , enough , I feel ; I would not now beguile your thoughts From loftier meditations , nor try To fortify that manly firmness , which Ever finds its best resources in itself . Let me assure you , that your late commands Are now fulfilling , or fulfill 'd ; and at This trying hour , if by my presence I Can aid your comforts , I rejoice . And . Andre ( to Lamb ) Is all Prepar 'd ? Lamb . Col. Lamb The escort wait . And . Andre I will attend You . Exeunt . SCENE IX . Octer Court of the Prison . Guard drawn up . Enter Lamb , Tallmadge and Andre . And . Andre Soldiers , receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindness shown , while In your custody , I warmly thank you ; Tho ' policy thus seals my doom , my fate Would yet seem doubly stern , should vengeance quench All pity in my fall ! ( Turning to Lamb ) And now I stand Sir , at your service . Tall . Tallmadge ( to Andre ) Accept this arm ; but Say , before we move , what is there aught beside I can perform ? And . Andre Naught , Tallmadge ! save that you Ever witness to the world , that Andre as A brave man died ! As the curtain slowly falls , exeunt omnes , to a slow march , and dirge-like music . FINIS .
