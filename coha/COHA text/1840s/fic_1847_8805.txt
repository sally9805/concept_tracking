The Scene is laid in Philadelphia . Main text ACT I. SCENE I.  --  TUESDAY . ( Washington Hotel , Chestnut Street , Philadelphia .  --  Phil Peters seated at the window of his parlor in a dressing-gown . ) Phil . Phil Peters So , here am I , in the city of Brotherly Love , at last again ; with fine weather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends  --  why should I not enjoy myself ? But I wonder where Sam Markham is ? I called at his house last night , but he was not to be found  --  ( looking out of the window . ) By Jove , like a more celebrated personage , scarce is he spoken of , when lo , he comes  --  ( knocks at the glass . ) Ho , Sam ! Sam , how are you , man ? Come in , come in . Sam Sam Markham ( from the outside ) . Ah , Phil , how are you ? I 'll be with you in a moment . Phil . Phil Peters Why what the devil can be the matter with Sam ?  --  formerly as cheerful as the morning , now as gloomy looking as a rainy Sunday in March . Something has gone wrong , I can see a mile off . Sam Sam Markham ( enters the room ) . Well , Phil , glad to see you . Phil Phil Peters ( rising to meet him ) . Why , Sam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have the doctors pulled you down , or have you fallen down and the surgeons set you up ? Speak , man . Are you suffering under a recovery from an ague caught on the Wissahicon , or have a fine and recovery lost you your property ? Speak , I conjure thee ! Art thou " in love , in debt , or in drink ? " Sam . Sam Markham I am in love , and almost hopeless ! Phil . Phil Peters The devil ! In either of the other contingencies I might have prescribed for you . In the one case some accommodating usurer , or possibly , a friend might have been found to aid you ; in the other , extra soda might have alleviated your miseries . As it is , burnt brandy wo n't save you . ' Pon my word , I know not how to help you : to minister to mind diseased is not in my line of practice . But , man , you exhibit no signs of the tender passion : I do n't observe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your beard is untrimmed , or any other proper symptom . Sam , I am sorry to find you in love , but I should like you to do the thing in an orthodox style . Why , man , your coat ought to be six months at least behind the fashion , your hair disheveled like an oak torn up by the roots ; your beard the fac-simile of a new clearing in the " Far West "  --  and here you come with a coat well brushed , and locks redolent of Pomade de Chantilly , of Moelle de Boeuf pure , only adulterated with half a dozen chemical poisons . Let me know your symptoms . Sam . Sam Markham Oh , Phil , be serious ; I am in no mood for jesting . Phil . Phil Peters Ah ! you have become " melancholy and gentleman-like , " eh ? Sam . Sam Markham You are disposed to be complimentary this morning , sir ! Phil . Phil Peters No , cool ! freezing to all the world , eh , and warm only towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byronical ! Sam , Sam , that wo n't do . Come , tell me now , like an honest fellow as you really are , how does it act ? Have you sacrificed to the muses , committed yourself to paper , taken to blue post , or , in a fit of despair , to blue ruin ; or have you sold yourself body and soul to the blue devils ? Have you given up law , and taken to lawless and affected rhymes ? Do you begin to have vague visions of the " rus in urbe "  --  have you purchased a suburban villa ? Sam . Sam Markham None of these things have I done . Phil . Phil Peters I 'm glad of it : particularly respecting the last catastrophe . I do protest , Sam , that , good friends as we have always been , I would discard you forthwith if you immured yourself in a city cottage . Of all the miserable places on the face of the earth , fond as I am of the real country , commend me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lock me up in a penitentiary ; but oh , propitious fates , spare me this ! But seriously , Sam , if I can assist you in any way , command my services . Sam . Sam Markham Phil , my dear boy , that is the pleasantest word I have heard for a long time . Phil . Phil Peters Ay , ay , Sam , let us be patterns of friendship , and cut love ; let us hang together , and suffer Cupid to depend in despair from his bedpost by his own bowstring  --  not a la Turc ! Sam . Sam Markham Nay , Phil , no jesting on this subject . Phil . Phil Peters Well , well , since you are so serious about it , I promise discretion . But who are your rivals , or have you any ? Sam . Sam Markham Ah , Phil , till a week ago I had but one  --  now there are two of them . Phil . Phil Peters But who are they , and what are they ? Sam . Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diego Perez de Vargas , a very " pounder " among the novelists  --  his brain , Phil , runs riot amid all sorts of absurdities .  --  The very " spirit of Fustian , " as friar John hath it , must preside over his destinies  --  his natal star must have been a theatrical one , he is so fond of catastrophes : unless , indeed , the moon claim him as her own . Phil . Phil Peters ( aside . ) Bravo ! I have him safe from the melancholies now ! Sam . Sam Markham He is never at home except under the shadow of a guillotine  --  his pulse never beats with any sort of alacrity , except when there is a current of blood flowing knee deep around him  --  and I verily believe that if all his works were subjected to a strong pressure , they would yield a hogshead of poisonous liquids !  --  Phil , if your nerves be not of iron , and your digestion patent , read not his works  --  else will you share the fate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " till he could find no door to his room . Phil . Phil Peters What a volcanic genius ! Sam . Sam Markham In person he is corresponding  --  a butcher , a very carnifex , with a beard like that of Hudibras , " In shape and hue so like a tile , A sudden view it would beguile . " This is the most devoted lover , and of the longest standing , and the head and front of my offending just now , is , that one day , in contradiction to Walpole 's description of Goldsmith as an " inspired idiot , " I stigmatized Mr. Pontefract Pinchbeck 's genius as " idiotic inspiration ! "  --  He will not speak five minutes to his mistress without threatening to blow out his brains , and he makes love , as I may say , like Jupiter to Semele in the midst of thunder and lightning ! Phil . Phil Peters By the boots of Bombastes Furioso , a formidable rival ! But whom have you to counteract this deadly potion ? Sam . Sam Markham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one be an acid , the other is an alkali  --  of the earth , earthy  --  and a combination of the two would produce a harmless body .  --  If the one be as violent as muriatic acid , the other is as dull as slacked lime . Phil . Phil Peters Bottle up your acids , your alkalies , and your comparisons for the druggist at the corner , and tell me plainly what he is . Sam . Sam Markham He is an Englishman , then : of the most approved pattern , and one of the most unmitigated apes that ever crossed the water  --  freshly imported , sir , from Liverpool , or Birmingham , or Manchester  --  just turned out of a cotton-mill , or button-factory , with other cheap goods for the American market  --  a tourist and a beau , moreover , by Momus , the god of laughter !  --  One of your fellows with a note book , an eyeglass buried under his left eyebrow , and a dusty-looking pair of patient and much-abused whiskers . Phil . Phil Peters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York . Sam . Sam Markham I 'll warrant it : they come out here in shoals to seek their fortunes ; they migrate to our coast , like herrings , periodically . Than your true English gentleman , Phil , there is none more agreeable ; but these Brummagen gentry , these false metal fashionables , this button aristocracy , they sicken me . There are some men in this world whose noses I have an innate and almost irresistible tendency to pull ; there are others whom I can scarcely restrain myself from kicking . Huskisson Hodgson is one of the latter . Phil . Phil Peters By Jove , Sam , you make my legs quiver with a kindred inclination to be at him ! Sam . Sam Markham Such is the other admirer who addresses my mistress , or her fortune , it matters not which . What 's worse , the monster has taken a fancy to me . He is one of the most intolerable and intolerant bores that ever haunted a gentleman , and I know not how to get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that I want to borrow money of him . I take my revenge in part , to be sure , by relating to him the most astounding stories , and stupendous anecdotes , which he will print when he returns home , as the communications of " an intelligent American ! " Phil . Phil Peters If you love me , Sam , turn him over to me . If I do n't load him to the very earth with the most antiquated rubbish that ever amateur Englishman carried home from his foreign travels , if I do n't stuff his wallet and his brain with " facts " and scraps enough for twenty books  --  above all , if I do n't give him seasoning Page 179 sufficient for a Michaelmas goose , never call me your friend again . Sam . Sam Markham He thinks of traveling through the Western country . but if you will favor him with a sufficiently horrible account of manners and customs there , you may save him some time and some money , and he will go home none the less wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their eyes in their pockets , cased in an impenetrable armor of groundless and invincible prejudices . Phil . Phil Peters Ay , ay , true Englishman all the world over ! Make what you will of him , Johnny Bull is a queer mortal . With an eye for all the world 's miseries , he overlooks his own . Keenscented to discover , grasping to seize , and tenacious to hold possession of any odd and unprotected corner of the universe , he yet moralizes sagely upon the rapacity of republics in general , and of the American vulture in particular . Take him upon the side of his prejudices , and he is the most credulous of beings : humor him on that score , and you may palm off upon him as gospel truth the most absurd improbability that ever was conceived by mind of man . You may persuade him that nine pair and a half of handcuffs make a national slave-ship . You may convince him . in short , of anything that administers to his national vanity , or gratifies his national prejudices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he wanders over the whole earth fortifying his old prejudices with new ones , and running down everything that differs from what he sees at home . He seems to think that the best way of glorifying himself is to depreciate everybody else . Russia is one of his bugbears , and he runs Russia down ; the United States is another , and therefore he abuses her . Such is John Bull ! Phil . Phil Peters So much for the nation . As for the individual , Hodgson , again I say , trust him to me . I will so inform him , that he shall go back to England an American tourist of the first water . For his benefit , I will forthwith become a magazine of impossible lies . Sam . Sam Markham Which he may work up , if he will , into paper cartridges : eh , Phil ? Phil . Phil Peters Precisely so . Sam . Sam Markham But you must give him time , place , and circumstance . Phil . Phil Peters Never fear ; I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what an absurd fellow I am ! Here have I turned everything topsy-turvy by inquiring the character of the suitors before I know anything of the lady . My friendly zeal must be my apology for this inadvertence . Sam . Sam Markham Put on your coat , Phil , and we will first take a stroll and afterwards call on her . You may then judge for yourself . Phil . Phil Peters ( putting on his coat . ) By the way , Sam , you must have fallen in love as a man breaks through poor ice , without any preparatory admonitions , for I heard nothing of it from you in your letters . Sam . Sam Markham It is so . And now let us walk . ( Exeunt together . ) SCENE II .  --  PARLOR IN MR . FIZGIG 'S HOUSE . ( Discovered Mrs. Fizgig and Garafelia . ) Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig Garafelia , my dear , we must go and visit the Prosys to-day . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Oh , ma ! do drop those horrid people ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , my dear ; but your father says they are rolling in gold , and he thinks , besides , that Mr. Prosy has a good deal of political influence amongst a certain class . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Well , I suppose I must go ; but I tell you what , mamma , Emily Slapdash told me the other day , that they were not exactly people comme il faut . Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig ( rather sharply . ) Now , Garafelia , my dear , Miss Emily Slapdash may be what is called a very fashionable person , but I ca n't persuade myself that any young lady who flourishes and flounces about at such a rate in a ball-room , and talks so loud in company , and out-dresses the fashion , can be a very good judge of what is gentility and what is vulgarity . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig But ma , I 'll tell you what I know for certain . Old Mrs. Prosy said , the other day , that she would rather read a cookery book than the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is it possible ? But perhaps she has scruples of conscience . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig No , ma ! It is the dreadful depravity of her taste ! Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig But do you know , Garry , that young Prosy has just returned from abroad ? He has been to Rome , and Vienna , and Paris , and London , and Grand Cairo , to inform his mind , and improve his manners , and has just got home . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Why , mother , why did you not tell me before ? I will go immediately , and pay Mrs. Prosy a visit ; for , perhaps , young Mr. Prosy has had some terrific adventures in his travels , and I should like to hear of them before anybody else . Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig ( looking out of the window . ) Here comes Miss Emily , your tutor in matters of fashion , and I 'll leave you to receive a lesson . ( Exit Mrs. Fizgig . Bell is rung . ) Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself outright for my sake , and that it were in the order of nature for a gentleman to blow out his brains , and marry his lady-love afterwards ! Oh that I had a lover who would swallow a pint of laudanum , and have it pumped out again , for my sake  --  or , at least , one who had killed his man in a duel , or dirked his friend in a scuffle , or committed some sweet and unnatural crime , that there might be some romance in our loves ! But , alas ! the times are averse . Pontefract Pinchbeck , indeed , threatens many things ; but Pontefract Pinchbeck has hitherto done nothing . His simple threats , however , are so sublime and awful , they make me love him better than the rest . There is the English  --  ( Door opens , and enter Emily Slapdash . ) Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash Ah , my dear Garry , how do you feel after all the dissipation we have had ? ( Embraces Garafelia . ) Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For my part , I have never been in better spirits in my life . I have not , for ten nights , been in bed before two  --  oh , I am in the most extravagant spirits ! There 's the Count Dryerustio has waltzed with me numberless times ; there 's Tak-emin , the great politician , has danced with me every night ; I have been the belle of the season  --  and , best of all , there 's de L'Or , the rich gentleman from New Orleans , has been very attentive : and I think if I play him carefully , he may offer himself one of these days , and then , hey for Paris !  --  and , by the way Garafelia , how comes it that , with all your admirers , you have never married ? Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig ( in a solemn voice . ) I Marry !  --  Emily , marriage is the destruction of romance ! Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash A fig for romance ! Give me a handsome establishment and plenty of money ! If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , so much the better ; such a man is more easily managed . Billikins , now I think of him , Billikins was very attentive to you , and the whole world decided you were engaged . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig I marry Billikins  --  that tame little earth-worm !  --  Poh ! Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash But then his money . My mother said to me , when I came out , " Now , Emily , do n't let yourself be caught by any of these poor , romantic , witty young men ; but save yourself up for a millionaire . " I have followed her advice , and expect , one of these days , to have a magnificent offer . But there 's the Englishman so smitten with you , Garry . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig To tell you the truth , Emily , he does talk delightfully about dukes , countesses , earls , baronets , and duchesses he was so intimate with at home ; and he is the fifteenth , in reversion , he says , of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid he has not sufficient sublimity in his composition for me . You understand me  --  he is wanting in grandeur of appearance , and impressiveness of manner . Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash Then there 's Sam Markham . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Yes  --  with no more romance in him than in a scrubbing-brush ! Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash Why , Garafelia , you surprise me ; he is universally liked amongst the young men , and I thought , till now , universally admired by the young ladies ; and is , besides , one of the most promising young lawyers in the State . I came very near falling in love with him myself , once . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Emily , my dear , there is one fact which forever condemns him in my eyes . He let slip a most delicious opportunity of murdering a man ! Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash Mercy upon us !  --  how ? Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Listen to me . He was awakened , one night , by a noise at the front door of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistols , and having ascertained that the noise proceeded from a burglar , who was forcing an entrance , he took up a position near the door , to wait the event . Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash Good Heavens ! you frighten me ! Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Will you believe it ! Instead of blowing out the fellow 's brains , like a gentleman , he meanly waited till the man had entered the house , and then pounced upon him , like a base police officer . Instead of killing , he captured ; instead of " giving him his walking ticket to the next world , " ( as Mr. Pinchbeck observed , when I told him the story , ) he quietly trotted him off to the nearest watch-house . Can any one tolerate such a meanspirited mortal ? ( Bell is rung . ) Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash ( shrugging her shoulders ) . Well , what think you of the magnificent Pinchbeck ? But ( taking out her watch ) I have no time to wait for your answer , for I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful flame-colored head-dress I saw there yesterday , before Julia Tawdry lays her hands upon it . So good-by . ( Exit Miss Slapdash , and enter Pontefract Pinchbeck . ) Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck Good morning , charming Garafelia . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Good morning , Mr. Pinchbeck . Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck Oh , divinest Garafelia , thou that blinkest in the firmament of society , like the lone star of Texas that was , call me not Pinchbeck ; but let me be , henceforth , Pontefract to the  --  or curses light upon my head ! ( Bell is rung . ) Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig ( aside . ) Oh , how exquisite are his phrases in his agonies ! how charmingly he blasphemes in his misery ! I must drive him to despair . ( Aloud . ) Pray , Mr. Pinchbeck , do not urge such strange requests . Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck ( raising his voice ) . You refuse , then , to entertain my poor suit  --  to grant the wretched boon I crave ? ( Phil and Sam coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Sam Sam Markham ( to Servant ) . Why , Patrick , have you a wild bull in there , or a locomotive  --  which ? Servant . Servant Neither , sir ; it 's only Mr. Pinchbeck . Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck Mark me , Miss Fizgig , if that pure carbon heart of yours does not relent , if you remain so obdurate , I will cut my own throat , or somebody else 's  --  Phil . Phil Peters Christopher Columbus , how desperate he is ! Sam . Sam Markham Ay , with the resolution of Sancho Panza , he will defer his self-punishment to a convenient season . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Go on , for mercy 's sake , Mr. Pinchbeck ! Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck I will blow out my brains  --  I will go mad ! Sam . Sam Markham Improbable , Mr. Pinchbeck , inasmuch as it is doubtful whether you have brains to blow out , or go mad with . Phil . Phil Peters Truly , Sam , if we are to judge the lady by the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going it ! Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck I will throw myself out of my third story window  --  I will hang myself with my cravat !  --  Sam . Sam Markham Now , Phil , now 's our time to cut down Pinchbeck . ( Sam opens the door , and the two enter . ) Good morning , Miss Garafelia , good morning , Mr. Pinchbeck . Allow me , Miss Garafelia , to present to you my friend , Mr. Peters , from New York . I promised to make his time pass agreeably in Philadelphia , and I have therefore taken the liberty to bring him here . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Any gentleman from that literary emporium of cheap publications is welcome . Pray , tell me , Mr. Peters , have any new novels come under your observation lately , in New York ? Phil . Phil Peters Allow me one moment for recollection , Miss Fizgig , and I will inform you . Some I am certain I have seen . Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck ( aside ) . Curse that Markham : he always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now , when I was just getting up a full head of steam , he comes like a coldwater pump , and condenses the vapor of my high imaginings . I must be off before he lands upon me . ( Rises to take his leave . ) Sam . Sam Markham Ho , Pinchbeck , how goes the " Murderer 's Daughter "  --  how many poor devils has your mortal imagination committed to the earth already ? Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck ( aside ) . Damn !  --  I knew it ! ( Aloud . ) " Dejanira , or The Poisoner 's Wife  --  a Romance of Greece "  --  I have already informed you , sir , is to be the title of my forthcoming work .  --  Good morning , Miss Garafelia  --  good evening , gentlemen . ( Exit Pinchbeck , in confusion . ) Phil . Phil Peters Now I consider the matter , Miss Fizgig , there have been published lately , a novel by Cooper , and one by  --  Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Yes , yes , but I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well  --  Really , Miss Fizgig , I scarcely understand what you mean by the " new style . " Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Why , I mean after the manner of Eugene Sue , and Ainsworth , and so forth ,  --  that character you know . Phil . Phil Peters Oh !  --  oh yes ! There has just come out , translated from the French , " Azrael , or the Deadly Huguenot Captain  --  a Romance of the times of d'Aubign . " Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig What an overpowering and impressive title  --  what a captivating heading for a book ! It alone should immortalize the author . Phil . Phil Peters Then we have , by a native author . " The Bloody War-path of the Laughing Hyena  --  a Tale of the Border Wars , " which , I am told , beats Cooper all to rags , inasmuch as it is far more terrific , far more bloody , and far more Indian or savage ! Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig I shall be devoured with anxiety till I see those two books . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sam Markham No doubt . Such works are dispersed , like the seeds of disease , everywhere  --  they are like their parent folly , ubiquitous . Published for a trifle , they find purchasers in every village . Men who could write better , if they met with encouragement , are forced to descend to such books as these , because they can not obtain fair compensation for works that demand longer study and greater labour . The want of an international copyright law enables the publisher to grind the American author to the earth , and plunder the foreign author of the fruit of his toil . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Hoity-toity , Mr. Markham , one would think you had been an author yourself . But I am so rejoiced , Mr. Peters , that the books you mention have come out , for I have just finished my last novel . In it there is one admirable character  --  " Marianne " the author calls her . Phil . Phil Peters Ay , I have seen the book . She is the heroine  --  angelic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( aside ) . Yes  --  that 's the recipe ; one part celestial  --  one part diabolical !  --  Keep them separate in the same vessel like oil and water , and you have an undoubted heroine ! Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig The character is , indeed , admirably drawn ; and then the plot is so artistically worked out and developed . She poisons her husband and nine of her children consecutively , with as many different life-destroying mixtures  --  Sam Sam Markham ( aside ) . And says her prayers regularly over each one of the lot , I 'll be bound ! Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Oh the delicious monster  --  the charming iniquity ! Sam . Sam Markham But , Miss Garafelia , do n't you think the story of the man who tickled some half dozen of wives to death , would make an equally good subject for a novel ? Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Oh , you vulgar wretch ,  --  what an idea ! Phil Phil Peters ( aside ) . Sam has been taken in ; that 's clear ! What an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love-scrape as soon as possible . ( Aloud . ) Yes , I perceive , Miss Fizgig , that my friend Markham here is infected with that absurd prejudice cherished by some old-fashioned people against the present style of novel writing . Surely , we have enough of nature about us every day to satisfy us , without being pestered with it when we read for amusement . The actual and the probable are within every one 's reach ; but it requires a great genius to overleap the barriers of nature , and land on his feet in the regions of impossibility ! Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Spoken like an oracle , Mr. Peters . Sam Sam Markham ( aside ) . Ay , like the lying oracles of old  --  confound his impudence ! Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Yes , Mr. Peters , you have expressed sentiments for which I honor you ; I foresee we shall agree very well . Yes , indeed  --  give me the writings which stretch to the utmost the sinews of the imagination , and call forth all the romance of the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I hope Miss Fizgig will cut the Gordian knot herself .  --  Nothing is so fatal to love as the ridiculous , and I should think that Sam has had a sufficient dose for one day . ( Aloud . ) Sam , I would not curtail your visit , but I myself must leave this presence , as I have just bethought myself of an engagement which must not be neglected . Sam . Sam Markham And I ought to have departed long ago ! ( Both rise , and take their leave , and exeunt . ) Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Oh , the sweet Peters !  --  the bearer of good tidings !  --  Now for the novels whose titles are imprinted on my very soul ; Patrick shall fly for them forthwith :  --  " Azrael , and the Laughing Hyena ! " ( Exit with enthusiasm . ) END OF ACT FIRST . ACT II . SCENE I.  --  WEDNESDAY . ( Pontifract Pinchbeck alone in his study , enveloped in a flashy dressing gown . ) Pinchbeck . Pinchbeck Good Heavens , what will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poisoner 's Wife , my Romance of Greece , and where I shall now locate my plots , conspiracies , and other strange deeds , I know not . I believe we Romancers have now peopled every square mile of the earth with villainous vagabonds . I know , for my part , that I have left no corner of Europe , Asia , Africa , or America , unvisited in my career of mystery and blood , with the exception of the North Pole , and that , Eugene Sue has choused me out of . I shall be dished if I ca n't invent some novelty ; the world demands ever new excitement , good , bad , or indifferent in its tendency . Oh ye Muses , that preside over cheap literature , aid me ! Oh thou great Genius of the " Romance of Crime , " on thee I call ! Descend , immortal Sue , pupil of the thrice-immortal Vidocq ! I have it now !  --  If the earth be sodden with human villanies , if the highways be paved with defunct malefactors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will descend to Tartarus , and draw my hero thence ! Ay , on the strength of this idea I will go and order a new coat , for assuredly my fortune is made . ( Pinchbeck puts on his coat , murmuring ) Glorious thought !  --  Luminous idea ! ( And exit . ) SCENE II .  --  A PARLOR IN SAM 'S HOUSE IN CHESTNUT STREET . ( Sam and Phil sitting at the window , conversing . ) Phil . Phil Peters Why , Sam , you have a very good look out here . Sam . Sam Markham Yes  --  I can , if I please , see everything that 's going on . Phil . Phil Peters Well , suppose you be my Asmodeus for a little while . Sam . Sam Markham I 've no objection . Ask , and I will answer your questions . Phil . Phil Peters Who , then , is yonder man with an inquiring air , hurrying along at such a furious rate ? Sam . Sam Markham That is one of our most distinguished lawyers . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely distinguish right from wrong ; his brain is a mere web of technicalities . Why , sir , he can not say his soul 's his own , without dividing it into part and parcel , and if he means to tell you there 's a man across the street , ' t is ten to one he goes round the whole block to define his position . Phil . Phil Peters Hold !  --  he is a common character . But who is that vulgar-looking woman that just passed by in her carriage ? Sam Sam Markham ( laughing ) . Vulgar-looking woman ! Stop , for mercy 's sake , Phil , or you will put an end to my informations and my life . Why , man , she is one of the leaders of the ton here . How she would fume if she could imagine what you have said ! Phil . Phil Peters Leader or follower , she reminds me , in her silks and satins , of certain prize porkers I have seen , enveloped in lilac gauze . But who is yon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were intended as Boswell was , to root up longburied twaddle ? Sam . Sam Markham You have read the man aright . He is a gossip  --  a collector of scraps of scandal  --  a broker of tea-table stock  --  a picker at reputations . He has the propensity of small poodles  --  to pick up tritles  --  and is a favorite amongst that class of ladies that usually enterfain such animals  --  Phil . Phil Peters My dear fellow , recollect I have three relatives belonging to the much-libeled race of maiden aunts , who all cherish lapdogs . Sam . Sam Markham He frequents the clubs  --  he visits ladies of a certain age  --  his eye is ever wandering nervously around in search of material for gossip  --  he wallows in scandal , and even sleeps , as I may say , in sheets of defamation . Phil . Phil Peters Enough ! enough ! Tell me who is this pompous signor swelling and strutting through the street ? By his port and majesty , I should judge him to be the English lion . Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the street . Shall we call him in as he comes this way , and bait the bull ? Phil . Phil Peters By all manner of means . Sam . Sam Markham Well , first let me give you a hint or two . I have told you what he is  --  he has forced his way into good society , nobody can tell how  --  can see nothing admirable in this country or its institutions , of course  --  but is eloquent upon oysters . And now , Phil , you must play the " half horse , half alligator , " for the nonce . Mind you give it to him in strong doses , and fear not overacting your part ; for the poor simpleton has such extraordinary notions of the western country , that he will swallow anything , however preposterous ; and it is a pity he should be disabused , he is so innocent in his belief . ( Knocks at the window . ) Ho , Hodgson , come in , and have a chat with us . ( Turning to Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! the victim comes . Oh , I forgot  --  his only definite idea of a western man is connected with the word damn ! ( Enter Hodgson . ) Mr. Hodgson , how are you , this morning ? Allow me to introduce my friend , Mr. Bragg , of Vicksburg . ( Phil turns away , with his hands in his pockets , and whistles " Old Dan Tucker . " Aside to Hodgson . ) He is , I assure you , a deuced pleasant fellow  --  an excellent specimen of the frank western man  --  and will be delighted to give you any information respecting the country , habits of the people , and so on . Hodgson Huskisson Hodgson ( in a cautious whisper ) . But are you sure he is not dangerous ? Has he no Bowie knives , pistols , or anything of the kind about him ? Sam Sam Markham ( in the same tone ) . Well  --  not more than the usual allowance  --  a " Planter 's Protector , " or so , perhaps , or a swordcane  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , at Mrs. Nogood 's ? Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Oh  --  Miss Garafeliaw was pausitively divoine ; she hung upon my aurm , and while I entertained her with the description of my ancestral halls  --  . Sam Sam Markham ( aside ) . Conceited ass ! Phil Phil Peters ( aside ) . Pheugh ! ancestral halls ! his paternal cotton mills , Heaven save the mark ! Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson The words of love and mutual affection rising to our lips  --  Phil . Phil Peters ( aside hurriedly ) . I must stop this , or Sam will be frantic . ( Walking quickly to the window . ) Hell and damnation ! Sam . Sam Markham Why , Phil  --  ( excuse me , Mr. Bragg , for being so familiar )  --  what on earth is the row ? Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( aside . ) What is  --  auh  --  the savage going to do now ? Phil . Phil Peters Why , may my boiler be eternally busted , if there is n't that are young lady I was keepin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feller . But I 'll be down upon him like an Arkansaw flood  --  I 'll be into him like a Mississippi sawyer . Where are my pistols ? Whoo-oo-oo-oop ! Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Oh , Mr. Bragg , for Heaven 's sake ! in the name of mercy , do n't , do n't ! Sam . Sam Markham Oh pshaw , Bragg , for our sakes now , stay and take a quiet julep , and defer your performances till afterwards . Phil . Phil Peters Waal , I suppose I mought as well , specially as I reckon he ai n't of no account , any how . I will if you 'll give us a chaw tabacca . Sam . Sam Markham ( rings the bell . Waiter comes ) . John , go across the way , and bring us some juleps , and a paper of tobacco . Do n't stand there staring at me , but go  --  quick  --  fly  --  and be back in a theatrical minute .

Sam Sam Markham ( in a whisper to Hodg . ) Oh , no . I assure you we are perfectly safe ; he does not mean anything by it . ( Juleps are brought ; each helps himself . Sam beckons to his servant and whispers . ) Now , John , whatever I order you to do when that stout gentleman is here , do it as if it were the commonest thing in the world . You understand me ! John John ( grinning ) . Yes , sir ! ( Exit John . ) Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( sipping his julep ) . By Gemini , that 's good ! Are you aware , gents , that this is the finest thing in your country ? People talk about your rivers , and all that sort of thing , and they call cotton your staple production , but for my pawt , I consider your juleps and your oysters to be the only things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have some idea of taking a few oysters out to improve the breed in England . Oysters , gents , I may say  --  oysters are the only things which redeem your country . Phil . Phil Peters Do you mean , Mr. What's-your-name , to insinuate that this here country , called the United States of Ameriky , requires anything to redeem its character or anything else ? If you do , maybe I wo n't be into your eyes in less than no time , like a real Kaintucky porker a-rootin ' in the woods . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( covering his eyes with his hands ) . Oh , no , no , no ! Phil . Phil Peters Oh , waal , if you did n't mean nothin ' , Socrates Bragg is not the man to take offence at a trifle ; and I reckon , besides , you ai n't no great shakes . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( aside ) . " No great shakes ! " I must inquiawr if he means to insult me . ( Aloud . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your parlors here  --  aah  --  as I have been led to expect ? Sam . Sam Markham Oh , we have given them up , and expectorate in the French style into our pocket-handkerchiefs  --  those , at least , who have enjoyed the advantages of traveling in Europe . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Indeed ! ( Aside to Sam . ) I would like to ask him ( pointing to Phil. ) about Bowie knives and such things . Sam Sam Markham ( aside to Hodg . ) Well , do it . These Western fellows like to talk big . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( turning to Phil ) . May I inquiawr , Mr. Bragg . whethaw Bowie knives are as common now in Cincinnati and the other frontier towns as they used to be ? Phil . Phil Peters May you inquire ? Do you mean to insult me , Mr. Hodgkins ? Are we not among gentlemen here ? Ai n't we all plain spoken ? Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson I meant no offence , ' pon honor . Phil . Phil Peters ' Nuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're going out  --  Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( piously ) . Thank Heaven ! Phil Phil Peters ( pretending not to notice his exclamation ) . And now most use Bolen 's six-barreled revolving , self-cocking pistols , with a small sprinkle of a Bowie knife on the end of them , in case of emergency ; though some prefer Colt 's repeaters , just for the sake , I calculate , of being singular and uncommon-like . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Good Lord , have mercy upon us ! What a state of society ! But are these weapons publicly carried ? Phil . Phil Peters Oh , yes . We occasionally practice in the streets : and if a little boy or a stranger is once in a while found dead , why it 's nobody 's business , and the coroner 's inquest brings in a verdict of " accidental death . " Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson The infernal spirit of Democracy ! Heaven defend me from such a country . But are rifles still in common use ? Phil . Phil Peters Rifles ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huskisson Hodgson Auh  --  I thought perhaps there might be a market there for double-barreled guns ; and  --  auh  --  indeed , that is pawt  --  auh  --  of my business out here  --  to dispose of . Hum  --  hum  --  ( aside ) By Gemini , I came within an ace of letting the cat out of the bag . Phil . Phil Peters Mr. Hodge-podge  --  Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( interrupting him ) . Hodgson , sir , if you please . Phil . Phil Peters Mr. Hodgson , then , take my advice , and if you hope to escape with anything left of you , speak not in our Western country of a double-barreled gun . We do n't tolerate ' em , sir . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Is it pawsible ? Phil . Phil Peters Yes , sir ; I ventured once to purchase one out of curiosity , and the excitement against it , sir , was so intense in my neighborhood , that I had to throw it into the Mississippi . I tried the infernal big-mouthed cretur once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , if the shot did n't come out just like a fog , and when it dispersed , all that I could find of my bird was the end of his bill . No , sir , the rifle is our weapon ; with that we can shoot anything , from a buffalo down to an Englishman , or a sandpiper . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( aside ) . How he makes one shiver ! Sandpipers with rifles ! Good Heavens ! the extravagance of these Western people is really awful . No wonder they are obliged to repudiate ; and there , by the way , is a hint for my book . ( Aloud . ) But , Mr. Bragg , is tarring and feathering common ? Phil . Phil Peters Law bless you , yes ! Why I myself was tarred and feathered once , and just becoss my bank bust up , and I could not pay my creditors . Sam Sam Markham ( aside ) . That 's right , Phil ; smite him on the hip , and spare not . Hodg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! what a land ! But , Mr. Bragg , were you ever blown up ? Phil . Phil Peters Blown up , sir ! War n't I raised on the Mississippi , and lived on steam since I was a babby . Why , you might as well ask me if I 've been weaned . It 's the commonest thing in natur . Blown up ?  --  more times than I can count up , sir ! Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson What , Mr. Bragg , were your sensations ? Phil . Phil Peters Why , sir , it is the pleasantest and most elevating feeling you can imagine . May I be scalped , sir , if it is not just like being kicked into chaos . No man , sir , knows what the sublimity of life is until he has had a biler bust under him . You may take my word for that , sir . And now , good morning , gentlemen . ( Phil rises to depart . ) But before I go , I will tell you , sir , ( turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting story ; if it is n't , may I be damned , sir , about a bust up . Waal , sir , I was going up stream , one day , to St. Louis , and I had a horse on board , a finer horse , by the way sir , or may I be damned , never trod turf . His name was Roanoke  --  my ancestors came from the Old Dominion , sir , and one day I sees that something was the matter with him , and a knowing hoss he was to smell out mischief . So I goes up , and says I , " Roanoke , what snag ha ' you run against now ? Do you want some feed , old boy ? " says I. He shook his head . " Are you cold ? " says I. He shook his head . " Is the biler going to bust ? " says I. He nods his head . " Right straight ? " says I. He nods his head again . I unties the halter as fast as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll bet ten to one this boat 's biler busts before sunset . " " Done , " and " done , " and " done , " shouts a dozen , when bang goes both bilers like a clap of thunder run mad . May I be damned , sir , if I and my horse were n't the only creatures that escaped . So I lost all my bets , and was obliged to resolve myself into a committee , sir , in a cypress swamp , to exonerate the captain , engineer , hands and biler from all blame , collectively an individually . I tell you what , sir , may I never taste Monongahela again , if I did not get aboard the next up boat in a mighty thick rile . Good morning , gentlemen ! Sam Sam Markham ( winks to Phil ) . Do n't go yet , Bragg . Sit down again , now , and tell us a little more about your parts . Mr. Hodgson is very much interested in that section of the country , and a stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm always ready cocked to go off , for a stranger 's information . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Thank you  --  auh  --  what sort of people have you out there ? Phil . Phil Peters Waal , we 've got some o ' most all kinds : Pukes , Wolverines , Snags . Hoosiers , Griddle-greasers , Buck-eyes , Corncrackers Pot-soppers , Hard-heads , Hawk-eyes , Rackensacks , Linsey-woolseys , Red-horses , Mud-heads , Green-horns , Canada Patriots , Loafers , Masons , Anti-Masons , Mormons , and some few from the Jarseys . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Heavens ! All savage tribes , I presume ; but I thought your government  --  auh  --  had removed all the Indians beyond the Mississippi . Phil . Phil Peters No , sir ; there are still many savages this side the river . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson What is the average product of your lands , per acre , Mr. Bragg , in a good season ? Phil . Phil Peters Oh  --  of snakes  --  ten cords is considered a very fair yield , making two bushels of rattles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of the reptyles  --  of musketoes , four bushels  --  of other vermin , six bushels is called a tolerable crop . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Good Lord ! Snakes by the cord ! But I mean corn and other grain . Phil . Phil Peters Stranger , in the West we never keep account o ' sich things . We save enough to eat , and feed our hogs , and send the rest to market ; and if the rivers ai n't dry , and the steamboats do n't get snagged , run into , blown up , or seized by the sheriff , it gets there in the course of time , and we presume is sold ; for that 's the last we hear of it . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson And you have no agents to attend to it when it arrives ? Phil . Phil Peters Oh , yes  --  we hires agents o ' course . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson And you never call upon them to give an account of their sales and receipts ? Phil . Phil Peters No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man 's life is worth to do so unpopular a thing . It 's an unheard of notion , stranger  --  an obsolete idea . Nobody thinks of sich a thing , except once in a while a mean feller , and he has to cut stick  --  quit our parts , sir , in short order , I reckon . " Tramp " ' s the word , and he emigrates , sir . ' Sides , there 's the chance o ' your agent 's drawin ' on you . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Drawing on you ? With funds of yours in his hands , auh ? Phil . Phil Peters Yes , sir  --  click ! And may be you find half an ounce o ' lead lodged in your phrenological developments . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Shocking ! Phil . Phil Peters Well , jist to show you the workin ' of the thing : You see we made Bill Toddy our agent  --  good fellow  --  fust rate chap  --  great on liquor . Now , supposin ' I goes to New Orleans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young ' un , jist fork over that are change , will you ? " What d'ye think Bill does ? Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Why , he takes out his ledger , balances his account , and pays you what he owes on your sales . Phil . Phil Peters That jist shows how much you know of human natur , Mr. Hodgeskin . Now I should calcerlate that Bill would naterally get his back up at that , and say  --  " Soc Bragg , you 're a poor devil , "  --  or , " Soc Bragg , you 're a dirned dropsical water-drinker , "  --  or , " Soc Bragg , you 're everlastin'ly beneath my notice . " And then we 'd have one of the awfulest musses that ever did take place in New Orleans . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Mr. Bragg , the state of society in your country is even more disorganized than I had supposed . Phil . Phil Peters Yes , sir-r-r , it ca n't be beat , as you say . Most people in farrin parts have very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what a glorious place it is out West . It is of an entire different stripe from your foggy England , where you have to drink port , and ale , and beer , and sich like onnateral tipple . It 's another kind of streak , sir-r-r ! Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Auh  --  Mr. Bragg  --  auh  --  do you drink much malt liquor in your pawts  --  auh  --  I have a brothaw  --  auh  --  that is  --  yes  --  yaas  --  Phil . Phil Peters Look here , stranger , why do n't you speak as if you war n't afraid o ' what you was sayin ' , instead o ' coughin ' like an old steamboat  --  puff  --  auh  --  puff  --  auh  --  puff  --  auh ? Speak out like a ringed pig . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson I merely ausked if you drank much malt liquor in your pawts . Phil . Phil Peters Do we drink spring water ? No , sir ; we drink Tom and Jerrys some  --  gin-cocktails putty considerable  --  but mostly stone fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barefooted ! I had no idea , I must confess , of the misery of this country . Demme , I 'll write a communication , when I get home , to some of the charitable societies . No shoes !  --  not even moccasons ! ( Aside . ) It 's a judgment on them for their oppression of their colored brethren . Phil . Phil Peters No shoes ? What does the man mean , Mr. Markham ? Sam . Sam Markham I fancy Mr. Hodgson does n't take your meaning . Phil . Phil Peters That 's it , eh ? I was afeard the stranger was pokin ' fun at me  --  and then I 'm dangerous . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Oh , no , no , no ! I assure you . Phil . Phil Peters Well , stranger , whar was you raised ? I thought even a Yankee knew that " stone fence barefooted " is the polite English for whisky uncontaminated  --  pure , sir ! Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( aside ) .

Sam Markham I believe , however , Mr. Bragg , that some parts of the country are very poor , indeed . Phil . Phil Peters Poor , sir ! It 's considerably the richest country that ever was created . Why , I 've seen many a tree it took a man and a boy to look to the top of . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson That 's a very singular circumstance ! Phil . Phil Peters Fact , sir ! Sam . Sam Markham But I mean , Mr. Bragg , that meat is sometimes very scarce . Phil . Phil Peters Oh , meat !  --  yes . I was out one year in a log cabin , a little out of the common trail , and sometimes we did n't see a piece of meat for three months at a time , and lived perty much on sweet punkins . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Pumpkins ! good Heavens ! This goes beyond anything I ever heard or read of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poverty in Ireland , but never can there be greater misery than this . But did you not become very weak under such a diet , Mr. Bragg ? Phil . Phil Peters Wa-a-l , sir , we fell off some , but were pretty nigh as strong as a ten-horse steam ingyne for all that . Why , stranger , my father that spring swum across the big Satan , in a freshet , with a dead painter in his mouth , and a live alligator full splurge after him . It was a tight race , I tell you , and I did laugh , and no mistake , to see the old man puttin ' out . The crittur just bit off the heel of his boot as he got ashore . He did ! Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Horrible ! A dead painter between his teeth ? And how did he come by his untimely end ? Phil . Phil Peters What , the painter ? How should he ? My father shot him , sir , and a most almighty good shot it was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , but  --  Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( trembling ) . And  --  and  --  what was the provocation , sir ? Phil . Phil Peters Why , I rayther allow the animal was just a takin ' a sketch of him , and would have had him , sir . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Good God ! Shoot a gentleman  --  an unoffending artist  --  Phil . Phil Peters Shoot what ? I 'm speakin ' of a painter , sir ! Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson And is n't a painter a fellow Christian  --  a man as well as you ? Has n't he a soul to be saved ? Phil . Phil Peters Well , that ar ' beats  --  a painter a Christian ! Why , sir , we consider , them in our parts the worst kind o ' heathen ! Sam Sam Markham ( stifling a laugh ) . I apprehend , Mr. Bragg , that Mr. Hodgson lies underneath error . He thinks you mean a man that paints  --  signs , you know , and portraits . Phil . Phil Peters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm dirned if he is n't a greenhorn ! Why , mister , a painter 's a wild animal  --  a catamount , sir  --  an exaggerated kind o ' Bengal tiger ! Sam . Sam Markham I fancy , too , that Mr. Hodgson misapprehends your account of the lack of meat . I dare say , now , you had plenty of venison . Phil . Phil Peters Oh , yes  --  plenty of venison  --  no lack of vittels . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Venison ! Sam . Sam Markham And wild turkeys , perhaps ? Phil . Phil Peters Wild turkeys ! oh , yes  --  all out doors was full of them ; ' sides , ' coons , squirrels , beavers ' tails , ' chucks , bear-meat , skunks , and other varmints . Lots of fodder we had , that are a fact  --  but no meat ! Tell you what , sir , it 's paddling right up stream in a canoe , to live without meat . The old man did grumble some , I tell you ! Hodg . Huskisson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and venison  --  and no meat ! Sam . Sam Markham I believe I must explain for you , Mr. Hodgson . The term meat in the West is understood to apply solely to salt pork . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( aside ) . What a monstrous slang these savages speak ! ( Aloud . ) Have you any Englishmen out there ? Phil . Phil Peters Britishers ?  --  I tell you , sir , we have the scum of all creation in our parts . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Auh , auh ! and  --  auh  --  what is the usual currency of that part of the country ? Auh  --  what do you pay your debts with ? Phil . Phil Peters Ha ! ha ! ha ! ( Laughs . ) Pay our debts with !  --  that 's a good joke  --  may be I wo n't tell that when I get home . We slope , sir ! Absquatulate !  --  Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( to Sam ) . What does he mean ? Sam . Sam Markham ( to Hodg ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it 's dangerous ! Phil . Phil Peters As for our currency , it 's rayther promiscuous , as I may say , jest now  --  mostly ' coon-skins , howsomever.  --  You see the Owl Creek , and the Wild Cat , and the Sore Bear , and the Salt River , and the Alligator banks all went slam-bang to eternal smash , and since then , it 's ben very mixed ! Sam . Sam Markham Did n't a certain bank , called the Big Riley Bubble , explode also ? Phil . Phil Peters Take care , Mr. Markham , I do n't stand that , sir-r-r  --  I have a mighty pisen feelin ' about that concern . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Why , Mr. Bragg , had you any interest  --  Phil . Phil Peters Stranger , if you do n't shet your mouth a little closer than a Gulf clam , I 'll fix your flint in short order . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Excuse me , Mr. er-eh-Bragg ; did n't mean to offend , ' pon honor . Phil . Phil Peters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bubble Bank .

We can do that , sir-r-r , whar I was raised . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson I 'm dumb  --  auh ! Sam . Sam Markham Lethe shall with me be another name for the Big Riley . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Have you any knowledge of the State of Arkansas , Mr. Bragg ? Phil . Phil Peters I 've ben thar , I reckon  --  I have hunted all over them parts , almost clean out to the jumping off place of creation . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson And  --  auh  --  do you know anything of Ramdown County ? Ah , auh  --  my fauther took some lands there for a debt about ten years ago , and I have some idea of  --  of going out there to examine the property . There are several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map I have of it . Phil . Phil Peters Do I know Ramdown County ? I 'd like to see the man would tell me I do n't , that 's all . I 'm getting tired of a peaceful life . It makes me bilious !  --  ( Hodg. edges away from him . ) Ramdown County , sir , is an eternal bog  --  one of the damndest , ugliest , dirtiest , deepest , nastiest , cussedest swamps that ever was created . ( Solemnly . ) Mr. Hogskin , you had better venture into New Orleans in yaller fever time than show your face there . Why , sir , the only dry locations in it are taken up by the wust kind o ' squatters  --  and if you escape , sir , the alligators , rattlesnakes , moccasons , bears , painters , quagmires , hurri-canes , highwaymen , freshets , Injins , and bilious fevers , you will be murdered by the settlers , and no mistake ! Sam Sam Markham ( aside to Phil ) . Phil , that is too bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the towns  --  Oxford , Babylon , Sodom , Nineveh , Moscow ? Phil . Phil Peters Towns , sir ! There is n't but one log cabin in the lot  --  at Sodom , sir  --  and that 's a place even the boatmen do n't like to stop at . ( In a solemn whisper . ) It 's a mortal unhealthy place for strangers  --  several have disappeared there ! Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Dear ! dear ! dear ! catch me there ! But Moscow and the others ? Phil . Phil Peters Moscow is fifty feet above ordinary water mark , and only accessible in wet seasons  --  and has no inhabitants . Oxford is fifteen feet under water at all times , and death for fever and ague , besides being dreadfully infested with musketoes , alligators , and howling savages . Babylon was swallowed some years ago by an earthquake ; and Nineveh was washed away by the Red River last spring , and it deserved to be swept off , sir , for I am credibly informed , there was nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such poor places , but to be washed away ? Any more inquiries , stranger ?  --  happy to give you information . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson No , I thank you , sir  --  auh  --  I believe I wo n't go there . Phil .

It 's a powerful sickly country for people who ask too many questions , and ai n't satisfied with what they get there  --  it goes against one 's grain when we see a man stuck up , I tell you . And now I 'll cut dirt ! Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( producing a note book ) . Allow me one  --  auh  --  moment , Mr. Bragg  --  have you any objection to my taking a note of this conversation for a-a-a work I have in contemplation ? Sam Sam Markham ( aside ) .

I understand not this railroad business  --  the Governor 's message puzzles me  --  the new tariff I ca n't make head nor tail of ; but I wrote to Frothy in Congress to keep himself quiet , and leave it alone any how . The news from New York is inexplicable ; stocks may rise or stocks may fall . The article I wrote for the Harrisburg Argus has been misrepresented ; I did not think it could be done . Then Garafelia 's conduct worries me . ( Enter Mrs. Fizgig . ) Mrs. Fiz , my dear , I am anxious about Garafelia . She keeps these three gentlemen tagging after her , but I am afraid prefers Pinchbeck . Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig And what particular objection have you to Pinchbeck ? Fiz . Mr. Fizgig Objection ! Why could n't she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect of political distinction . I should like amazingly to have a son-in-law in the legislature .  --  And to take to that insane writer of feverish and disjointed novels , who knows no more of politics than a dead donkey . Strange that his folly should find admirers . Confound this ginsling literature ! Garafelia Garafelia Fizgig ( entering ) . What do you mean by gin-sling literature , father ? Fiz . Mr. Fizgig I mean such stuff as your friend Pinchbeck writes  --  full of all sorts of beastly worthies  --  just as I call the concoctions of his rival , Softy , that best man-milliner of well-dressed and undigested bandits , toast-water literature . Pinchbeck and Softy , a worthy pair ! Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Compare Softy to Pinchbeck !  --  a duck-pond in a calm to an ocean in its wrath ! Father ! father !

Phil Peters But you can read signposts  --  and yonder staring you in the face I suppose , as at the entrance of most bridges , you will find that most admirable precept  --  " Keep to the right , as the law directs . " There is a moral in that commandment , Sam , which , rightly understood , is , or should be , the foundation and epitome of all law . Unfortunately , the law is like some of your excellent good advisers in this world .

Phil Peters Ay , but I never took to it much , and now could scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that I know that the remainder of a bottle of champagne may be worth something , but the reversion would n't fetch a copper . Sam . Sam Markham You learnt , then , nothing in your studies ? Phil . Phil Peters Far from it ; I gained much information . But above all , I imbibed a salutary terror of the Law ! Sam . Sam Markham Come , Phil , it 's nearly dark , so let us make our way homewards . We will go together this evening to old Fizgig 's ; he will bore you terribly about politics , for he is a great schemer and statesman in a small way . Never mind what you say to him , so you say it boldly , for that is the great secret of obtaining credit in this world , and fear not to tell him bad news , for the old fellow has so many irons in the fire , that he is sure to reconcile himself to anything . Mind , now , you must pretend to know something about the matter whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither know nor do , neither meddle nor make in such affairs , and furthermore have a mind to go to the Theatre tonight , to see what 's to be seen , and hear what 's to be heard . Sam . Sam Markham You are determined , then ? Phil . Phil Peters Yes . Sam . Sam Markham Well  --  let 's be off at any rate . ( Exeunt together . ) SCENE V.  --  PARLOR IN MR . FIZGIG 'S HOUSE .  --  EVENING . ( Mr. Hodgson and Miss Fizgig conversing . ) Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson A churming day we have had , Miss Garafeliaw ; it reminded me  --  ah  --  ah  --  of the last mawning I spent with the  --  ah  --  Duchess of Devonshiawr . She was a particulaw  --  aw  --  aw  --  friend of mine , and we felt quite  --  ah  --  ah  --  melancholy at pawting . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Indeed , Mr. Hodgson ? I was not aware you were so familiar with the duchess . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Oh , deaw  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her  --  her cawstle . I met her in the garden before breakfast .  --  " A churming mawning , Mr. Hodgson , " said she . " Yaas "  --  said I  --  " vawstly so , your grace . " And then I went into breakfast , where we had  --  auh  --  auh  --  some very foine Dutch herrings  --  which makes me remember it . ( Enter Sam , and salutes the two . ) Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Mr. Hodgson and I were just speaking , Mr. Markham , of the other side of the water . Sam . Sam Markham Ah !  --  Pray , Mr. Hodgson , how did you come over  --  in a packet or steamer ? Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Oh , by the steamaw , of course . No body travels in the packets now . I came over in one of those splendid triumphs of British awt  --  those swift and unsurpassed vessels  --  Sam . Sam Markham They are very fine steamers , no doubt . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Yaas , sir  --  they are matchless  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , as to that , Mr. Hodgson , the Great Western , I believe , is your crack steamer , is she not ? Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Yaas , sir , she is , and  --  ah  --  I should  --  ah  --  like you to find me her equal . Sam . Sam Markham Well , Mr. Hodgson , without bragging what the Mississippi , or the lost Missouri could have done , I will tell you what the Fulton , our first steam frigate , which some of our journals in the English interest have chosen to call an " old tub "  --  I 'll tell you what she did once . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Well , sir , I should be glad  --  auh  --  to hear it . Sam . Sam Markham Mind now , Mr. Hodgson , I do n't mean to boast , for perhaps it was not a fair trial . But I wish to convince you that your vessels are not so much beyond those of the rest of the world as you make them out to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Sam . Sam Markham Well , sir , one day the Great Western started out of New York on her return trip , heavy laden , to be sure , and the " old tub " came out after her , passed her , sir , with ease , and , if I recollect aright , not only went by , but round her , before the two reached Sandy Hook . This , sir , did a vessel which our own people turn up their noses at . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Reaally , Mr. Markham , I can scaarcely  --  auh  --  believe this story . Sam . Sam Markham I saw the thing done , sir , with mine own eyes . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson But it is so demned impawsible , may you not have  --  auh  --  mistaken the vessels ? Sam . Sam Markham No , sir , there can be no doubt about their identity . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Well , sir , I must say , I 'm demned if I believe it . It is one of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you really comprehend that you have insulted me ? Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Peopall , sir , who exaggerate so , must expect  --  auh  --  to be insulted . Sam . Sam Markham Very well , sir , you shall hear from me anon . Pardon me , Miss Garafelia , for involving myself in a quarrel in your presence , but I trust you will acquit me of all blame in this matter . Good evening , Miss Garafelia . Good evening , Mr. Hodgson . ( Exit Sam . ) Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Oh , what a charming duel there will be ! Mr. Markham begins already to rise in my estimation . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( alarmed ) . Why , do you really suppose , Miss Garafeliaw , that the man will challenge me ? Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig No doubt of it , no doubt of it ; how delightful it will be ! Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( aside ) . Demned delightful ! Uh-h-h , uh ! what shall I do ? ( Aloud . ) Miss Garafelia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hope . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig I throw any obstacle in the way of such a romantic encounter ? Mr. Hodgson , you wrong me ! Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( aside ) . There perishes my last hope ; this is a demned unpleasant affair .  --  The she  --  assassin !  --  The malignant squaw ! ( Aloud , in an agitated voice . ) Good evening , Miss Garafelia . ( Exit Hodgson . ) Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Fortune , I thank thee ! Now , if no unlucky accident intervene , now shall I have the satisfaction of finding in the survivor , a homicide lover at last ! END OF ACT SECOND . ACT III . SCENE I. THURSDAY .  --  TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING . ( Pinchbeck in his room prepared for walking . ) Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck This quarrel I hear about between Markham and Hodgson , is an infernally unlucky affair for me . If I ca n't stop the affair , I 'm dished ; if they fight , I might as well give up . Garafelia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pretended , for I do perceive , of late , my threats and agonies , by dint of too oft repetition , begin to lose their effect . I must go forth and terrify cockney . ( Exit Pinchbeck . ) SCENE II .  --  ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING .  --  PHIL 'S ROOM . Sam Sam Markham ( alone ) . I wonder what under heaven has become of Phil ? Here was I half the night , and here have I been since daylight this morning , waiting for him , and he comes not yet . But that he will get into less trouble than any of the rest of my friends , I would wait no longer for him . ( Enter Phil . ) Why , Phil , where have you been all night ? Phil . Phil Peters Oh , I met a friend at the theatre , who invited some three or four of us to take supper , and stay all night , some few miles out of town , at his residence . This invitation I accepted ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Has Garafelia been cold ? Sam . Sam Markham I am about to ask of you , Phil , the greatest favor that one man can ask of another  --  to involve yourself in a crime , with the origin of which you have no connection . Phil . Phil Peters What means this , Sam ? Sam . Sam Markham I have been insulted , deeply insulted . My word has been doubted , and you must manage the affair . Phil . Phil Peters Why , who in the name of wonder has quarreled with you ? Sam . Sam Markham I have quarreled with Huskisson Hodgson , who told me , in effect , that I lied . Though I can reconcile the course I intend to pursue neither to my conscience nor my judgment , yet have I not the moral courage to encounter the scorn of the world , nor control over my unruly passions to forego revenge . I intend to challenge Hodgson . Phil . Phil Peters It is indeed a terrible dilemma . Fight , and you peril your peace of mind forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distinction in life , besides that , life itself ; fight not , and you lose your reputation in the world , and men whisper " coward , " and women look askance upon you . Sam . Sam Markham It is true ; but , right or wrong , I have made my election . Will you stand by me ? Phil . Phil Peters Sam , it is a fearful responsibility , but I accept it ; the rather , as I suspect that Hodgson to be a spirit capable of grossly insulting another , and then shuffling himself out of the difficulty afterwards as best he may . Sam . Sam Markham I can imagine your feelings , Phil , and I thank you . Phil . Phil Peters I will call on him at once , for these matters are better settled quickly . Sam . Sam Markham And I will go home , where you will find me . ( Exeunt together . ) SCENE III . ( Huskisson Hodgson alone in his room . ) Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Egad , I see I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so cursed peppery ! He will cut my throat with a Bowie knife the first time he meets me in the street , I am sure , or drill me with a six-barreled pistol . Oh , Lord , I wish I were out of the country . I thought he put his hand to the back of his neck very suspiciously before he left the room . And there is a fellow opposite my door , whom I suspect to be on the watch for me ; and the police of this wretched country are so demned miserable . ( Enter Pinchbeck . ) Good morning , sir . ( Aside . ) Ah , how queer I feel ! Here comes a challenge , I 'll be bound . Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck Mr. Hodgson , I believe ? Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson The same , sir . Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck Pardon me , Mr. Hodgson , for intruding upon you . Allow me to introduce myself , " Mr. Pinchbeck . " You have heard of me , I presume ? Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Cau n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pinchbeck That 's singular . However , I come to offer my services in this difficulty between yourself and Mr. Markham . I thought , sir , that being a stranger here , you might be at a loss for a friend to act as your second . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Ah  --  I am much obliged to you , sir , but  --  I  --  I  --  ah  --  have not been challenged yet , and  --  auh  --  I do n't believe he has the courage to do it . Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck Do n't you believe it , sir ; he is a regular fire-eater ; can hit the ace of hearts , nine times out of ten , at fifteen paces , and has already drilled three opponents in the field . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( aside ) . Oh , Lord , there is no hope for me ! I 'll bolt , demme , I 'll bolt ; but I must gammon this customer . ( Aloud . ) Demn the odds : I can assure you , sir , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck You are then resolved ? Call upon me , sir , if you want a friend . ( Aside . ) It 's all up with me and Garafelia . I must depend upon the demons . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( aside ) . Ah , ah , ah , ah ! I wonder why I feel so cold ? ( Aloud . ) Yes , sir , resolved  --  ( aside ) to make my escape if I can . Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck Then , sir , good morning : call upon me , call upon me . ( Exit Pinchbeck . ) Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Demme , these blood-thirsty Americans smell out a fight as crows scent carrion . Demn their instinct ! What devil sent that fellow here ? ( Servant opens the door . ) There is a gentleman below wishes to see you , sir . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( aside ) . I 'm murdered now ! ( Aloud . ) Is he a ferocious-looking man ? Here , here , ( gives Servant money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Servant No , sir , he is a very genteel young man ; but he says he must see you . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( aside ) . Well , I might as well resign myself to my fate . ( Aloud . ) Ask him up . ( Exit Servant . ) Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Ah , ah , ah ! I wish this interview were fairly over . What a heavy and murderous step he has ! Phil Phil Peters ( opening the door ) . Mr. Hodgson ! Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Oh , Mr. Bragg , how d'ye do to-day  --  toppish , eh ? ( Aside . ) There 's no fear of him , he looks so open . Phil Phil Peters ( overhearing him  --  aside ) . Ay , like the smile of the alligator . ( Aloud . ) Mr. Hodgson , I presume you imagine , from the occurrences of last night , the purport of my visit ? Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Really , Mr. Bragg  --  ah  --  ah  --  I am at a loss to comprehend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  s  --  hum . ( Aside . ) He looks like a leader of the Manchestor riots . ( Aloud . ) Eh  --  auh  --  well , Mr.  --  Phil . Phil Peters Well , sir  --  Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( aside ) . There 's a cool malignity about the backwoodsman , this morning , which is horrible . ( Pulling up his shirt collar , and affecting to be at ease . ) Wo n't you take a cigauhr ? Phil . Phil Peters Mr. Hodgson , I must first demand an answer to the message I bring . ( Hands Hodgson a note . ) Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( aside , pretending to read it ) . I knew it ; the instant I laid my eyes on his cut-throat visage , I felt that there was violence at hand . I 'll play the game recommended by the Arch Humbug , as they call him in New York  --  Archibauld Humbug , I presume . He makes a raather good distinction for an American : to give reasons or to explain , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Turning to Phil . ) Look ye here , Mr. Bragg , I am willing to give Mr. Markham satisfactory reasons  --  Phil . Phil Peters An unconditional apology is the only reparation that will be accepted . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( aside ) . How demned rough and overbearing these Americans are ! ( Aloud . ) But , Mr. Bragg , I will afford any explanation a reasonable man can  --  auh  --  auh  --  desire . Phil . Phil Peters An unconditional and abject apology , Mr. Hodgson ! Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( aside ) . How demned close these Americans are ! ( Aloud . ) I am willing  --  auh  --  Mr. Bragg , to say that I am sorry , but  --  auh  --  I 'm demned if I 'll apaulogize . Phil Phil Peters ( aside ) . Gad , I must give him a touch of the canebrake again . ( Aloud . ) Look ye here , Mr. Hodgson , you refuse distinctly , as I understand , to apologize to my friend ? Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apaulogize ! Phil . Phil Peters Then , sir , I 'm " demned " if you wo n't be shot . My friend , sir , can shave the eyebrows of a wild turkey at a hundred yards , without drawing blood , and he is as cool , by the Eternal , sir , or may I never drink a hail-storm again , as the inside of an iceberg , and a damned deal cooler , as I take it . I look upon you , sir , if you do n't apologize , as nothing better than a Pawnee bullet pouch ! Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson A Pawnee bullet pouch ! What a cursed uncomfortable idea ! Phil . Phil Peters Yes , sir , take my advice , and apologize ; else may you consider yourself in as bad a box as a tree 'd barr-rr-rr ! Hodg Huskisson Hodgson ( aside ) . What demned painful similes the fellow utters ! ( Aloud . ) Sir , demned if I 'll apaulogize . Phil . Phil Peters Well , then , good morning , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are at a loss for a second , allow me to recommend my friend , Mr. Ball Bowies , now staying at the Mansion House . Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson ( aside ) . Auh ! demn polite and accommodating .  --  ( Aloud . ) I thank you , sir , I have  --  auh  --  a friend I can call upon  --  auh  --  and you will hear from me in the course of the day . Phil . Phil Peters I shall make a point of remaining in my room , No. 41 . Good morning , Mr. Hodgson . I 'm sorry for you  --  you 're a gone sucker ! ( Exit Phil . ) Hodg . Huskisson Hodgson Heaven be praised ! I am not yet extinct , nor do I intend to remain here to be murdered . " Gone sucker ! " Does the simple , uneducated , un-Christian savage think I am going to stay here to be made a bullet pouch of ? Does the heathen fancy I 'll wait to be tree 'd like a bear ? Huskisson Hodgson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will leave as soon as may be , this accursed Philadelphia , which they call the city of brotherly love , ( habitation of demons rather , ) and will go home forthwith , to the quiet , peaceable , civilized , well-governed , happy land of my birth , where no impolitic exuberance of food makes men unruly and fierce  --  where no laxity of government makes the people democratic and ferocious  --  where a happy starvation keeps down the spirit of the unwashed  --  to merry old England ! SCENE IV .  --  PARLOR IN FIZGIG 'S HOUSE .  --  NOON . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Strange that I hear nothing of the progress of this affair yet ! Methinks ' t is almost time that one of the parties should have been brought home in a bloody dressing-gown . I have observed no unusual stir among the passers by  --  I have kept watch upon the street like a sentinel ; but though I have noticed several surgeons , I have seen no wounded men . What can be the meaning of it ? I must put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can keep the secret no longer . ( Enter Emily Slapdash . ) Emily Miss Emily Slapdash ( eagerly ) . Oh Garafelia , pray tell me the particulars of the quarrel here last night  --  I am dying to hear . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Why , how on earth came you to know anything of it ? Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash I ?  --  why it 's all over town . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Astonishing ! I told nobody but my waiting maid , with strict injunctions of secrecy . Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash Nevertheless , it came to our house with the milk this morning , and we had the report for our breakfast . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig And has the duel taken place ? Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash I have heard nothing authentic as to that ; though , according to my woman 's account , the milkman poured out the blood of both the combatants through gaping wounds , at the same time that he transferred from his cans our daily allowance of ambiguous fluid . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a false alarm . I shall be shockingly put out , if they do n't fight . What could possibly have hindered them ? But it 's always the way with me  --  I 've no luck at all . Whatever I wish done is sure to be prevented ! ( Enter Mrs. Fizgig . ) Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig Why , young ladies , what are you talking so earnestly about ? An engagement , or a marriage ? Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash A sort of engagement , Mrs. Fizgig  --  this expected duel . Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig Is it possible ?  --  between whom ? Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash Why , Mrs. Fizgig , ca n't you imagine , when the quarrel occurred in your own house no longer ago than last night ? Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig In my house ?  --  last night ? And you were in such extravagant spirits this morning , Garafelia ? Speak , daughter , how is this ? Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Why , ma , I did n't tell you  --  I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig And you have let the quarrel proceed , and said nothing all this time to prevent a fatal termination ? Wretched , wretched child ! If blood be shed , on your head will be the guilt ! Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Now , mah , you are so particular and queer ! Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig But it may not be too late yet . I must see my husband . ( Exit Mrs. Fizgig hurriedly . ) Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig There , Emily , is n't ma a strange woman sometimes ! Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash Why , Garafelia , I think she is right in the present instance . Education has made me selfish ; precept and example have made me worldly ; but I can not think of bloodshed without horror . But , to change the subject , have you heard the last news from Paris ? Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig No  --  do tell me . Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash Tournures , they say , are totally exploded ; they will soon be obsolete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pastoral bonnet is flaring up again , and all the fashionable ladies are going to turn shepherdesses . Simplicity 's the one thing needful now . Every one of our ladies have come home lately from Europe " au naturel . " For my part , I like the change  --  I go for variety  --  and , besides , I think the fashion suits my style . Look at me ! Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Yes , I perceive you have wasted away considerably in the last few days ; but I concluded you had danced yourself thinner . Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash Oh dear , no , you amiable simplicity ! It is a much simpler and quicker operation than that . I went to the milliner , who took out a wadding from one place , and a padding from another , and soon reduced me to what you see . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Emily , Emily , how can you take so much interest in these follies ? Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash Ha ! ha ! ha ! You 're romance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am amused with you . Do you know I believe the reason we are such great friends , is that we are so totally unlike ? But here is a chance for you to combine fashion and romance . Why do n't you turn shepherdess , and feed sheep ? Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig None of your namby-pamby romance for me . I tend flocks !  --  never !  --  except it were on the side of a volcano , or the brink of a precipice . There might be some excitement then in the thing . Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash Well , well , let 's go up to your room , and there you shall give me a full account of the quarrel from which we have wandered . Here we shall be continually interrupted . ( Exeunt . ) SCENE V.  --  FIZGIG WRITING IN HIS ROOM . ( Discovered Printer 's Boy waiting . ) Fizgig . Mrs. Fizgig Aha , I think that will settle " The New York Diary of Politics . " I flatter myself that will sicken him of attacking me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I throw in a few more grains of pepper and allspice , another small dose of stinging political sarcasm . They 'll feel that , if I ai n't very much mistaken . Here , ( gives boy a shilling , ) hurry back to the office , and mind they set it up right . ( Exit boy . ) And now for an article to help me out in my speculations . If I can keep the Great North American Gold Mining Company afloat ten days longer , I 'm a millionaire . But whom have we here ? ( Enter Mrs. Fizgig , in disorder . ) Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig Oh , Fizgig , Fizgig , that girl of ours  --  Fiz . Mr. Fizgig Good God ! what has happened to her ? Tell me quickly . Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig Nothing to her  --  but Mr. Markham and that Englishman met here last night , and murdered each other . Fiz . Mr. Fizgig Murdered each other ! Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig I mean they quarreled about something or other , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never uttered a word on the subject till just now . Fiz . Mr. Fizgig Ay , there 's the fruit of these bloody-minded books . But this is a serious business . A quarrel in my house ! Treason , by heavens ! I 'll call upon the mayor and aldermen . I will make a political and state offence of it  --  the militia shall be ordered out . Give me my hat ! ( Exit Fizgig in a hurry , and Mrs. Fizgig after him . ) SCENE VI .  --  GARAFELIA 'S ROOM . ( Discovered Garafelia and Emily conversing . ) Garafelia . Garafe lia Fizgig Emily , did you ever see any of Mr. Pinchbeck 's poetry ? It is very tender and consuming , I assure you . Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash No , he never favored me with any of his compositions . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Listen , then , and I will read you a sonnet he sent me not long ago  --  Though thunders roll around my head , And lightnings flash , blue , white , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which drag the planets out of heaven , Though with earthquakes the soil be crackt , Still will I be thine only  --  Pontefract ! Oh let us , then , love one another , Not like some frosty sister and brother , But with the Phnix ' self-consuming flame ! Garafelia  --  oh , what a dear romantic name  --  Thy tones do rival St. Cecilia  --  Canst thou not love me , Garafelia ? Canst thou not love me ? Then will I , Under your window cursing , die ! To shake off these burning chains , I will blow out my miserable brains  --  And my epitaph shall be in letters big , " Pontefract Pinchbeck , slain by Miss Fizgig ! " What do you think of it ? Is n't it heart-rending ? Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash Why , it seems to me that the verse halts terribly once in a while , and it certainly is a little irregular . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Irregular ! Emily ! That 's the very thing and the only thing I miss in his poetry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rage now ; the more confused the better , so there be regularity in the confusion :  --  if a man can bring in a rhyme periodically a quarter of a yard off , his reputation is established . We  --  we , the ladies , have established this principle . Woe unto the unhappy poet that dares to disregard it ! Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash And what think you of the rule ? I should like to know , that I may say something when I 'm asked about such matters ; for , to tell you the truth , except that I read some of the Waverley novels at school , and a few fashionable novels since , I have not been very literary . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig For my part , I admire exceedingly this manner of writing poetry , and particularly that stanza , which , booming along at first like the roar of distant artillery , clatters suddenly down like a pile of paving stones ; for example :  --  Fiercely blazed the mouth of the bottomless pit ; There the dark angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : And near him a pale and shrinking form did sit , Which ever and anon uttered a deep groan , Followed by a sad moan You see what power of description this admits of . Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash Well , I do n't know much about these things , and I suppose you are right . But I think Mr. Pinchbeck flies about too much from one thing to another . I can scarcely perceive the connection . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig My dear Emily , we are not talking of logic now , or geometry ; connection in poetry is not to be expected  --  nay , the reverse ; for a want of it indicates a vivid fancy and fervent imagination . Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash There is a third objection I have to Mr. Pinchbeck 's sonnet , or whatever you call it . I think it 's very impolite and ill-mannered in him to threaten to blow out his brains under your window . Consider what a scene it would make  --  and they would have you in all the police reports . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic disposition . Think what a consolation it would be to him to have me looking on . Fancy how dramatic it would be . Pontefract below in his shirt sleeves  --  moonlight  --  pistol in each hand  --  excited crowd  --  several police-officers trying to seize him  --  he ever and anon shouting , in a terrific voice , " Stand back at the peril of your lives ! "  --  I meanwhile appear above  --  hair disheveled  --  nothing but a nightgown on  --  then Pontefract turns to me  --  makes a final and tearful appeal  --  says he 's going  --  I ask him , " Where ? "  --  he answers , he does not care , but probably to a place I do n't like to mention  --  I weep bitter tears , but declare I ca n't take pity on him  --  he raises one pistol to his head , and applies the other to his heart  --  when somebody rushes in , seizes his arms , and he is carried off raving distracted ! Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash Very pretty , on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should imagine that he is already raving distracted . I have seen Mr. Pinchbeck in society and he always seemed to me to be in a continued state of what I understand by " acetous fermentation "  --  a phrase I picked up the other day in a discourse on turneps , addressed to American farmers , which I accidentally saw in the newspaper ,  --  and the little I have heard him say has been frothy and worthless enough . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Ah , Emily , you must not bear so hardly on the little eccentricities of genius ; by his works should he be judged  --  they show him in his real majesty ! Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash Well , there is no accounting for tastes , and that puts me in mind , it is time for me to go home to dinner . So good-by . ( Emily puts on her bonnet and shawl , and exit . ) Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig ( looking after her ) . The foolish butterfly ! SCENE VII .  --  PHIL ALONE IN HIS ROOM . Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four o'clock , and no message from the Brummagen hero . ' T is a long time to keep a man in suspense , but I do argue well from this delay  --  I trust the cockney has thought better of the matter , and taken to his heels . How strange and unaccountable a thing human nature is !  --  how various , how changeable , how impossible to be calculated upon ! Prophesy , proud mortal , if you will , the course of the winds and the waves for the next twenty-four hours ; but seek not to divine the thoughts , and strive not to foresee the deeds of any the meanest man on earth , for four-and-twenty seconds of futurity . Who would have dreamt that so sensible a fellow as Sam Markham would have fallen in love with such a piece of folly as Miss Garafelia Fizgig , beautiful as she is ? However , I think if I do but keep myself quiet , and wean him gradually , there is no doubt of his ultimate recovery . And there is this Hodgson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage to support it afterwards . Well , well , let the world wag its own way , especially as it ca n't he made to wag any other .  --  Half-past four o'clock . ( Yawns . ) Well , I see no object in remaining here any longer . I 'll go and beat up the Englishman 's quarters ;  --  but no  --  if he 's for flying , let him go in peace  --  though I should like to have some definite information for poor Sam , I 'll compound the matter , I believe , as I can not leave the house , by betaking myself to the front-door steps , and staring the ladies out of countenance , as is the fashion of well-bred strangers visiting New York .

Phil Peters Why , our antagonist , the Englishman , contrary to the usual practice of his nation  --  for I will say this for them , that they have seldom shown themselves wanting in pluck  --  Hodgson , I say , has absconded , and thus saved us from the police , who have somehow or other got wind of the affair . He took the train early this morning for New York , and will embark in the first steamer for England , where , without fear of his life , he may concoct his book , and in peace and quietness , finish it off with a concluding chapter , conciliatory , charitable , and extenuating , on the " demned blood-thirstiness of the Americans . " Sam . Sam Markham Phil , you have relieved me of a great load . If I know myself , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lead a forlorn hope to a desperate attack in my country 's cause , than stand up once in a duel . Phil . Phil Peters So would I , Sam ; but let 's dismiss the subject  --  all 's well that ends well  --  and now tell me truly , since I have done something for you , and one rival is disposed of , does not your love begin to cool ? You have never yet asked me what I think of Miss Garafelia  --  I consider that to be a good sign . Sam . Sam Markham To tell you the truth , Phil , I begin to perceive that she is not quite perfect . Her romance is certainly excessive  --  but that may wear off . Phil . Phil Peters Never . It is an inherent and natural weakness in her character . She is a fool ; and fools never reform . Sam . Sam Markham Perhaps so , Phil , but then her charming sensibility  --  Phil . Phil Peters Beware , Sam , lest you be shipwrecked on that rock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you will find the former to be far the better in the long run .  --  " Susan , my dear , this chicken is too much done to-day . "  --  " Oh Phil , I am sure I ca n't help what the cook does . But it is always so now  --  nothing "  --  sob  --  " that I have anything to do with now is well done . It was n't so "  --  sob  --  " before I was married "  --  sob  --  and off she goes into a violent crying spell , while Phil swallows his dinner in gloomy silence , and begins to suspect he has made a bad bargain . Sam . Sam Markham You are too severe altogether . Phil . Phil Peters Not a whit . I repeat it  --  ' t is a pity she has not a little common sense . Sam . Sam Markham Ah , Phil , will you banish all romance from the world , and with the little maid in the old nursery tale , inquire of every admirer , ( sings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Make a fire in the kitchen ? Or the little God of Love turn the spit  --  spit  --  spit ? " Phil . Phil Peters Faith , not I  --  I am no man to condemn romance . No man ever became great without romance , enthusiasm , or call it what you will  --  no woman ever held long the possession of a high-minded man 's affections without it .  --  But I would have it founded on good sense . Sam . Sam Markham And is there nothing in love ? Phil . Phil Peters Ay  --  much  --  everything ; but love will not burn forever , if folly be the fuel . Sam . Sam Markham Your perfect woman , then , must be a sort of icicle . Phil . Phil Peters I do n't pretend to have any idea of a perfect woman  --  but I do not admire a wary , suspicious , cold and distrustful woman ; with a heart inaccessible as the North Pole with its fortress of ice around it  --  impenetrable as adamant , impervious as India rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discriminating woman , with a spice of romance withal . Sam . Sam Markham Ah , Phil , I do suspect you much to be one of those who never love . Phil . Phil Peters Nay , nay , you wrong me there . Light-hearted and reckless as I have always appeared to the world , the fountains of deep and holy feeling , nevertheless , have their abode within  --  Yes  --  she was one of those delicate flowers which the wintry frosts seldom spare  --  one of those exquisite blossoms which our climate produces , only to nip them ere they come to maturity . The curse of our country , consumption , laid his lean and clammy hands upon her , and she faded away as gently , and almost as imperceptibly as the snow melts in the spring . The disease came over her , as one of these sharp , biting , and almost visible eastern winds , spreads itself over a fair and beautiful landscape , creeping along and blasting each living thing with a chill and deadly air . She perished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has long shrouded her mortal frame . Sam . Sam Markham Pardon me , Phil , for arousing sad remembrances . Phil . Phil Peters Ask no pardon ; ' t is good to be reminded sometimes of those that are departed . But enough of this . ' T is a holy secret , which I whisper only to the air . Good-by ; I 'll be back in half an hour . Wait for me if you 've nothing particular to take you off , for I want you to introduce me to Pinchbeck to-day . Sam . Sam Markham I shall be here . Phil . Phil Peters Well , then , au revoir . ( Exit Phil . ) SCENE II .  --  PARLOR IN FIZGIG 'S HOUSE .  --  GARAFELIA ALONE . ( Enter Emily . ) Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash Have you heard the news this morning , Garafelia ? Mr. Hodgson has vanished . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig What  --  did those detestable and meddling policeofficers arrest him ? Did he break prison  --  rend chains  --  scale walls ? Emily . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in durance vile , " and has only departed from Philadelphia to avoid this duel  --  for it appears , or at least there is strong reason to believe , that Sam Markham challenged him . At any rate , Mr. Hodgson is not to be found within the city and liberties . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig ( With a resigned air . ) That 's just to torment me . If it had been anybody else , they would have fought to the death , or at least fired off one load of powder and lead apiece . Well  --  we must submit to our destiny , I suppose . Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash For my part , I am glad the affair has ended so happily . I 'm in a great hurry , but I knew you would be terribly disappointed at the result of this business ; so I thought I would just stop and tell you . I 'm on a round of morning visits . Look at my list ! ( Shows a paper a foot long . ) I do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half as much for me . Nevertheless I am very gracious and loving , wherever I go , and mammas with ugly daughters , pretend to be very fond of me , though I know that they hate me like the old Harry . That amuses me . So , good morning , Garry ! ( Exit Emily Slapdash . ) ( Enter Mr. and Mrs. Fizgig . ) Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig So , daughter , there has been no blood spilt after all , I hear . Tell me truly , now , are you not glad of it ? Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig ( sulkily . ) No ! Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig You are , now , you are ; you know it ! You are not such a monster , I am sure . Fiz . Mr. Fizgig You are glad , Garry , or you ought to be . Here was your old father running over the city from one end to the other yesterday , drumming up constables , collecting a posse comitatus , procuring warrants  --  Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very precarious condition , totally worn out with his labors , and was so tired he did n't sleep a wink last night . Fiz . Mr. Fizgig That 's true ; and , moreover , I lost at least twenty thousand dollars by attending to that diabolical business . Twenty thousand dollars slipped through my hands yesterday on a speculation which would have cleared me that sum , which is the same thing . Here have I been plotting , these two months , to depress the price of certain stocks , and yesterday I could have bought them cheap ; to-day they are up again . ( Aside . ) Thank fortune , I have still a chance for a son-in-law in the legislature . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Dross ! dross ! Fiz . Mr. Fizgig ( in a passion . ) Twenty thousand dollars ? " Dross ! dross ! " And what do you suppose that rascally Pinchbeck fellow is after , but your gold  --  your " dross , " as you are pleased to call it !  --  the fortune I shall leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul of romance , attentive to me because of my money ! Fiz . Mr. Fizgig Yes , confound the thief ! I 've a great mind to kick him out of the house ! Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig ( aside to Fiz . ) Now , Fizgig , for Heaven 's sake , hold your tongue . Fiz . Mr. Fizgig I wo n't hold my tongue ! I 'll say what I think ! Pinchbeck is a disreputable fortune-hunter ! Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig ( aside . ) He 'll make her marry him out of pure obstinacy and perversity , or romance , as she will deem it . Fiz . Mr. Fizgig He 's a disgrace to the city ; he 's  --  Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig Come , Fizgig , it 's time for us to go look at those curtains I was telling you about . You were in such a hurry a few minutes ago , and now here you are keeping me waiting by the half hour . Come along , come along . ( Hurries Fizgig off , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dross ! Pinchbeck ! Scoundrel ! Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Thou poor , calumniated , scandalized Pinchbeck , my heart yearns towards thee ! SCENE III .  --  PARLOR IN SAM 'S HOUSE .  --  SAM TYING UP A PARCEL . ( Enter Phil . ) Phil . Phil Peters Come , are you ready ? Sam . Sam Markham Yes , I have nerved myself to enter the dragon 's den . Phil . Phil Peters What 's that you are putting up so carefully in paper there , Sam . Sam . Sam Markham A novel I intend to take to Miss Garafelia . Phil . Phil Peters Is it stuffed with amiable miscreants ? Is every chapter in it like a column of a country newspaper , devoted to disasters of every description ? Does each individual page , like one of Livy 's prodigies , sweat blood ? Sam . Sam Markham Faith , not it . It is one of Cooper 's . Phil . Phil Peters Take my advice , then , Sam , and leave it at home ; for it is not suited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sam Markham How so ? Phil . Phil Peters Why , Sam , is it possible that love so blinds your eyes ? Do you not see that she devours horrors with as much relish as a butcher 's dog mumbles a bloody calf 's head ? Sam . Sam Markham Nay , Phil , do not strive to open my eyes ; for if I am disappointed here , I shall be melancholy all my days . Phil . Phil Peters Bah , Sam ! People talk about being miserable all their days ; but they do n't know what they 're saying . Old Time , that greatly misrepresented personage , soon salves up these sores , though they sometimes leave deep scars . ( Sighs . ) Sam . Sam Markham Ay , ay , you can stand there with a whole heart , and moralize to all eternity , I 'll warrant . Phil . Phil Peters But , man , look to the other side of the picture . There is to everything , in this world , Sam , a side to be wept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes , too , a third , checkered . It is the part of worldly wisdom , and often too of the spiritual , to be upon the laughing side . Not that I would have a man trifling when he ought to be serious , as I often am . Sam . Sam Markham Bravo , Phil , what a sage you are becoming ! Phil . Phil Peters Well , well , I 'll drop the moralizing didactic , and take up the moralizing illustrative . Let us imagine three cases . In the first picture , I see Mr. Samuel Markham , Esq .  --  his youthful affections blighted , his hopes of a happy futurity withered and destroyed , his rising eminence blasted  --  descending to a premature and welcome grave . Sam . Sam Markham Hold , hold , for mercy 's sake ! Uh ! I feel as if an undertaker were screwing down my coffin ! Phil . Phil Peters Oho ! you do n't like this view of the case so much , eh ? This is the weeping side . Again I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see him some year or two older , and some degree or two wiser , laughing in his sleeve at the follies and absurdities of Mrs. Pontefract Pinchbeck  --  nay , start not , Sam , I repeat it , Mrs. Pontefract Pinchbeck , and congratulating himself on his lucky escape . Sam . Sam Markham Ah , Phil , you will never see that day . Phil . Phil Peters Perhaps not . That was the laughing side . And now for the checkered . Lo , here I find you the luckless husband of Miss Garafelia Fizgig , that now is ; tormented by her levity , mortified by her folly , put to shame by her ridiculous behavior ; some of your very good friends pitying you , and some laughing at you ; your enemies condoling . Sam . Sam Markham I ca n't say I think you are any great things of a seer ; you would n't make your fortune by prophesying . Phil . Phil Peters Not by prophesying the truth , certainly , particularly disagreeable truth . Sam . Sam Markham And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Phil . Phil Peters Not at all , man . These things may pass muster in a mistress , but they are the very devil in a wife . And , mark me , but for these two rivals , you would have been heartily sick of Miss Garafelia before this . But let 's be moving . Sam Sam Markham ( aside ) Does he know me better than I know myself ? It may be so ! ( Aloud . ) Well , come on ! And now for Pinchbeck ! ( Exeunt together . ) SCENE IV .  --  PINCHBECK IN HIS STUDY , WRITING . Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck How admirably the idea develops itself  --  how lovingly the fiend attends upon my call .  --  Faith , I believe my genius improves every day , like brandy . Fifteen lawyers swallowed up by an earthquake , with canceled bonds in their pockets . What a stroke ! I shall certainly cast into the shade every living author . ( Enter Servant . ) Servant . Ser vant There are two gentlemen at the door who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pontefract Pinchbeck Ask ' em up ! ( Exit Servant . ) Can they be duns , or are they some of my admirers or disciples ? ( Enter Sam and Phil . ) ( Aside . ) Ah , that infernal iceberg again ! ( Aloud . ) Happy to see you , Mr. Markham . Sam . Sam Markham Mr. Pinchbeck , allow me to present to you my friend , Mr. Peters . He is a great admirer of your writings , and will be flattered by your acquaintance . Phil . Phil Peters ( Aside . ) Confound Sam 's absence of mind , and my own . I never heard of Mr. Pinchbeck , till I came here three days ago , and as for his writings , I do n't know their titles from those of the Ptolemies . Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck I felicitate myself outrageously on making Mr. Peters ' acquaintance , and shall be in ecstacies to show him any civility within my grasp . Will you excuse me one moment , gentlemen ? ( Pinch . goes to the table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aside to Phil . ) There , Phil , he will now murder any man 's writings for you in a jiffy . As for himself , you may compare him to Shakspeare if you will , and in his overweening vanity , he will overlook the quiz . Phil . Phil Peters ( aside to Sam . ) Tell me the titles of his works , or I shall get into trouble . ( Pinchbeck rises , puts up his paper and pen . ) Sam . Sam Markham ( aside to Phil . ) Your question comes too late . But here 's my advice :  --  whenever you 're pressed , take refuge in the Hartz mountains  --  they 're common pasture for all such cattle  --  and Phil , meet me at Fizgig 's . He wo n't show himself in his true colors while I am here . Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck ( coming forward . ) Now , gentlemen . Sam . Sam Markham Mr. Pinchbeck , I must consign Mr. Peters to your charge , as I am obliged to leave you . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peters Permit me , Mr. Pinchbeck , to express , as far as words can express , my delight at finding myself face to face with one so distinguished as yourself ; allow me to declare my admiration of , and I may almost say , reverence for , your character . Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck You are pleased to exaggerate my limited reputation , sir . Phil . Phil Peters Not so , Mr. Pinchbeck . Yours is a name known in every state of the Union . ( Aside . ) ' Gad , I dare say that 's true ! Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck You flatter me , sir . Phil . Phil Peters Far from it , Mr. Pinchbeck . If I spoke my real sentiments more fully , I assure your my expressions would be much stronger . But ( he looks round ) you have books here  --  the works of kindred genius , Mr. Pinchbeck ? Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck Yes , sir I have a small collection , as you perceive . Phil . Phil Peters Might I ask your opinion of certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without offence , Mr. Pinchbeck ? Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck Speak , sir , and I will resolve you . Phil . Phil Peters I am much obliged to you , sir ; the judgment of so distinguished an author will go far towards forming my own . What think you , then , of Sir Walter Scott , as a novelist ? Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck Why , sir , he wants force , energy  --  fire ! He is deficient in invention , and the true sublime . Phil . Phil Peters ( aside . ) Oh ye muses , hear not the heretic !  --  ( Aloud . ) But what of Cooper ? Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck Cooper ! Cooper , sir , has obtained a popularity for which I am unable to account . There is no nature in his works , sir ! He is wanting in a due and just appreciation of the malignity of the savage character ! There is not , to my recollection , one man burnt alive in all his Indian novels . Why , sir , a great genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering to escape him . His style would have arisen , and flown upward with the smoke of the martyrdom , till both were lost in the boundless ether ! Phil . Phil Peters True , sir ; a great genius might have charred an entire settlement at once ! Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck And then , sir , instead of exterminating his Indians by the nation at a time with the small-pox , he has taken them off by driblets  --  here one with a rifle-bullet , there one with the tomahawk  --  oh , sir , he is small and pitiful beyond expression . Phil . Phil Peters As you justly observe , Mr. Pinchbeck , any man with the least appreciation of sublimity , might have ridden on the winds , the very spirit of pestilence ! Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck Look at Eugene Sue ! His cholera will chill the marrow of your bones . Thucydides  --  pish  --  Decameron 's description of the plague is milk and water to it . Phil Phil Peters ( aside . ) Decameron ?  --  Oh , Boccacio the ninny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck A Scotchman , sir , who fled to France during the last Jacobite rebellion , and there added a " de " to the original patronymic . Phil . Phil Peters I recollect . But what , Mr. Pinchbeck , is your idea of fine writing ?  --  and proper subjects ? Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck Give me for subjects the crimes that seal the ruin of hundreds of thousands  --  none of your petty offences . Give me , sir , poison , torture , pestilence , and the rack ! Phil Phil Peters ( aside . ) Faith , no more than you deserve ! Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck Ainsworth and Eugene Sue are my models ! They , sir , and they alone , are the inheritors of immortality  --  the real geniuses of all time . They stand alone  --  monarchs of literature !  --  all the rest are counterfeits ! Phil Phil Peters ( aside . ) ' Gad , sovereign in all cases , like the patent medicines of the day ! Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck My aim , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without vanity , I may say that my efforts have not been altogether unsuccessful . But which of my works do you , Mr. Peters , candidly consider the best ? Phil Phil Peters ( aside . ) Oh , Lord  --  there he comes  --  I must say something . What the devil did he call his book the other day ?  --  there was something about poison in it , I 'll swear . ( Aloud . ) Why , sir  --  among so many excellencies , I find myself somewhat at a loss to make a selection  --  but  --  if I might venture an opinion  --  I should say that that one  --  I have really forgotten the name  --  singularly enough , for my remembrance of names is remarkably tenacious  --  but I mean that one  --  in which you  --  poison three women with mutton-broth , and bury them by gas-light in the woods , suits my taste as well as any . ( Aside . ) ' Gad , it 's out ! Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck Ay , you mean my " Gottfried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Phil . Phil Peters That 's it ; the black complexion of those men 's crimes is finely imagined . Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck And that idea of burning the gas from the " job , " as they call it in this country , has , I flatter myself , never been surpassed . Phil . Phil Peters True , sir . It is sublime to the very verge of the ridiculous ! Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck That , sir , has been my aim ; that is the great art of novel writing in accordance with real life  --  that is the great principle of the new school of romance ! But really , Mr. Peters , I am sorry , but you must pardon me . Your charming conversation and just criticisms have already made me late for an appointment with my publishers , and you know that wo n't do for us poor authors . I am about to publish a new novel ; but as it is a great secret , I beg you wo n't speak of it . Phil . Phil Peters I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so good day .  --  ( Exit Phil from room .  --  Outside the door . ) Faith , I 'm glad to get off ; he might have asked me more questions .  --  By Jove , Sam did not overcharge his colors : if the Englishman might , for intelligence , have fairly been esteemed the soul of a bale of calicoes , the novelist , for virulence , is the very heart 's blood of a barrel of copper-filings.  --  I want a little fresh air after this formidable conversation . ( Exit Phil from stage . ) Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck A remarkably sensible man , that  --  I will present him with a copy of my next work . And now for the publishers . ( Exit Pinchbeck . ) SCENE V.  --  PARLOR IN MR . FIZGIG 'S HOUSE .  --  ( Sam alone . ) Sam . Sam Markham " She will be down in one moment , sir , " so said the servant . Yet here have I been waiting already a quarter of an hour . I know of no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him waiting in this way . I begin to think there may be some truth in Phil 's criticisms . I will observe her more closely ; ah  --  here she comes . ( Enter Garafelia . ) Garaf . Gar afelia Fizgig Good morning , Mr. Markham . Oh , you naughty man , how came you to suffer Mr. Hodgson to escape your vengeance . Sam . Sam Markham To tell you the truth , Miss Garafelia , I am very glad that he has gone off without disturbing the peace . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Mr. Markham ! how can you talk so ? Is it possible you are of so dull a spirit ? Sam . Sam Markham Why , you would not have had us fight , would you ? Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Would n't I ! If it had depended on me , one of you would have been under the surgeons , or perhaps the sexton 's hands , by this time .

Garafelia Fizgig Why did n't you keep watch on him , and waylay him ? Sam . Sam Markham What !  --  like a foot-pad ? Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig No , like a hero ! ( Enter Phil . ) Oh , Mr. Peters , I am in such distress !  --  the novels you mentioned are not to be found in Philadelphia .

Phil Peters If there be one copy in the city , you shall have it . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Your assurance sets me at ease . Sam Sam Markham ( aside . ) She certainly might be improved . Phil . Phil Peters Have you heard , Miss Fizgig , of the last horrid murder ? Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig No  --  no . Do tell me the particulars . Phil . Phil Peters That I can scarcely do , but I heard in general that a poor man in an out-of-the-way forest in Canada , had murdered his wife and two infant children , and pickled them for his winter supply . It was added that he was supposed to be insane . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Is it possible ! I should like of all things to see the account of it . It would be a welcome addition to my collection .

Garafelia Fizgig Dear Mr. Pinchbeck , have you heard anything more of the escape of Mr. Hodgson ? Is it certain ? Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck There can be no question of it . He went off by yesterday morning 's train , with a trunk bearing his name in full in large white letters , and " Great Britain " in smaller , underneath . But what was the origin of the quarrel ? It took place here , as I understand . Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Oh something or other about steamships ; and then Mr. Hodgson told Mr. Markham , in the most gallant style , that he did n't believe his word . Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck What ! told Markham he did n't believe him ?

For here , if you discard him , here and now will he spill his heart 's blood  --  here , even upon this very Brussels carpet ! Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig What a striking attitude ! Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck Here will he dismiss his miserable and hag-ridden soul , a sacrifice upon the altar of your upas beauty  --  self-slaughter and the peril of his eternal salvation shall lie at your door !  --  Answer  --  for , scorned by the daughter , and forbidden the house by the father , Pontefract Pinchbeck , miserable outcast that he is , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Did my father forbid you the house ?

' T is but six weeks ago that he published " The Bay of Biscay ; or , The Spectre Smuggler of Segovia . " What though his seaport were two or three hundred miles , or more , inland ? Did not Shakspeare make a similar blunder ? But it is all over with me ; Garafelia can never hold out against this last stroke . The Demon Attorney will get the better of the mortal lawyer ! Hold ! I will be even with him  --  I , too , will write a novel . ( Walks up and down the room . ) I will extinguish Eugene Sue . All my heroes shall be assassins  --  all my heroines harlots !

Phil . Phil Peters And what is the cause of this singular explosion of yours ? Sam . Sam Markham Look ! Flagel , or the Demon Attorney of the Rue La Mort ! Phil . Phil Peters Is that all ? That is only a notice of the first number , which is not yet published , but which , I doubt not , will be a tissue of absurdities from beginning to end . That fellow will distance Eugene Sue yet . But do you know what you have done ? You have brought it to pass that Mr. Pontefract Pinchbeck will be esteemed a great genius , while you are looked upon as something little better than a madman ! If you do not wish this impression to become general , come forth with me at once , and anticipate the story . Sam . Sam Markham You are right . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PARLOR IN FIZGIG 'S HOUSE .

You going to enter into the state which is " the destruction of all romance ? " Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Yes ; but I intend to run away : that alters the case materially , you know . I 'm not to be married in your regular hum-drum style . Pontefract is to meet me at four o'clock , at the house of his cousin , Mrs. Flyaway , and there the Reverend Dr. Ranter will join us in holy matrimony , in spite of father and mother , and all the interfering kinsmen in creation !

And he convinced me , besides , that it is much more daring to go off in broad daylight . So here am I bride elect , and you must be bridesmaid and witness  --  for on witnesses Pontefract insisted particularly , much to my mortification ! Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash I , my dear child ? You know I do n't fancy these fantastic arrangements ! Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Oh , you must , you must ! ( Enter Sam and Phil . ) ( Aside . ) Is n't that too provoking now ?

Garafelia Fizgig Oh , dear ! do tell me the story . I dare say it was a very romantic affair . Emily . Miss Emily Slapdash Very ! You must know , I accidentally ran a bodkin into Mr. Peters ' hand ; Mrs. Tattle was present , and you may depend , before the story had traveled ten blocks , I had fallen desperately in love with Mr. Peters , and , in a fit of unfounded jealousy , stabbed him with a stiletto ! Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig What a pity such a beautiful tale should not have been true ! Phil . Phil Peters Much obliged , Miss Fizgig , but I ca n't agree with you in this instance . Sam .

We are to have a little supper and a dance at my aunt 's in the country . I am sorry your devoted lover here , according to the world 's opinion some time ago , is obliged to leave to-morrow for New York , but I will endeavor to make the excursion pleasant for you .

Old Fiz ca n't last long . ( Looks in the glass . ) Pinchbeck , take the last look of thyself a bachelor , for the next glimpse thou catchest of thy face , ' twill be a husband 's . I will abjure novels  --  I will discard romances . Flagel , I 'll have no more to say to thee . Get thee behind me , Sathanas ! I will drink gin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut up other people 's books , as I used to carve other men 's canvass-back ducks ! I 'll neither walk nor work , but ride in my chariot . I will drink naught but Mocha coffee for my breakfast . I will give great dinners , and luxuriate upon pak de foie gras and champagne  --  I will drink no wine but chablis with my fish . My claret shall be of the best , and my Madeira of the oldest . I will have naught but capons on my table . I will import Stilton cheese and grouse from England . Poverty , Pontefract Pinchbeck and thou are henceforth to have not even a speaking acquaintance ! I will have a Cashmere dressing-gown , and import French boots and Turkish slippers . So , so , I think I personate a most unexceptionable bridegroom . Garafelia , I fly to meet thee . Love and wealth beckon me on . I come  --  I come !

Phil Peters How do you now , Sam ? With what eyes do you view the charming Garafelia ? Have you an appetite for dinner ? Sam . Sam Markham Phil , have been soliloquizing here , and was just coming to that point when you entered . Phil . Phil Peters Which ? the lady or the dinner ? Sam . Sam Markham Pshaw , the lady of course ! I believe , after serious reflection , I must acknowledge that I have been a considerable jackass lately ! Phil . Phil Peters I congratulate you on having come to that conclusion . Shall I say , then , like the hospital reports , " Discharged  --  cured ? " Sam . Sam Markham I believe you may ; I evacuate the premises , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil Peters Then , Sam , I may as well inform you that a rumor is abroad , announcing that Miss Garafelia Fizgig has eloped surreptitiously with Mr. Pontefract Pinchbeck . Nobody knows how it originated , but , for my part , I think it 's very credible . Sam . Sam Markham It matters not . Life 's young dream is over . Phil . Phil Peters Better such idle dreams as this should soon be over . But no , no , Sam  --  you have romance enough in your disposition for a dozen love scrapes yet . You have now , I perceive , arrived at that period of life when love is necessary to your existence  --  at least , essential to your well-being . I wish you the best wish I can conceive in your case . When I next come to Philadelphia , may I find you again in love ; but with a woman who has something besides her beauty to recommend her . May she be sensible , amiable , virtuous , charitable ; and her charity of that comprehensive sort which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye for other people 's virtues , and a dull one for their faults . But , above all and in all things , may she be truly religious ; not conspicuous for that outward and seeming religion , which consists in riding regularly to church on Sunday in a state coach , with footmen in splendid liveries ;  --  not carried away by that contracted and mistaken zeal which pronounces " our church , " and " our preacher , " to be the only mail-rout and only sign-post to salvation ;  --  but imbued with that mild , gentle , and forgiving spirit of religion which some few Christian pastors inculcate , and which still fewer exemplify in their lives ! By that time , moreover , may every man in this world , who deserves such a destiny , be in the same predicament . And now let us go and refresh this outward man , for moralizing always gives me a raging appetite . Sam . Sam Markham Agreed ! agreed !

' T is already forty minutes after our usual dinner hour , and Garafelia , with all her romance , had generally a very good appetite . Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig I begin to fear that something serious has occurred . I have been in her room , and her best ball-dress is missing . I have examined her maid , but she either knows nothing , or will tell nothing . Fiz . Mr. Fizgig ( whistles softly . ) Mrs. Fizgig , my dear , I begin to smell a rat . ( Sound of wheels is heard ; Fizgig rushes to the window . ) And my suspicions , alas , are well founded ! Here comes the hussy in a hack , and by all that 's ruinous , Pontefract Pinchbeck with her ! Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig You surely do n't mean that the unprincipled wretch has married my daughter ! Fiz . Mr. Fizgig I scarcely cherish a hope that it can be otherwise  --  that this ignoramus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dear , we soon shall know the truth , for I hear them coming .

Mr. Fizgig Whims !  --  a dutiful child with a vengeance !  --  Whims !  --  And pray , what do you call your fancy for that great personification of Humbug yonder ?  --  ( points to Pinchbeck . ) Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck ( aside . ) The old gentleman is n't very polite to his son-in-law at the first start , any how ! Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Take care , father !  --  Do n't drive me to extremities , lest I say what I ought not to say . Fiz . Mr. Fizgig Out with it , you graceless girl ! Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Well , then , father , if you will have it , allow me to say that if you wonder at my loving Pontefract , you ought likewise to be astonished at my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fizgig ( working himself up into a rage . ) Ah , ah ! that 's what you had to say , is it ? You wanted to insult your father , did you ? A pretty pass the world has come to  --  Ah ha ! Miss Fizgig , you flatter me . You think I am really to be compared to Mr. Pinchbeck , do you ? That is as much as to say that I am mad . Ah  --  an amiable daughter !  --  a choice specimen of filial affection ! Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig Oh , Fizgig , be quiet now : you know she does not mean what she says ! Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig You know , father , I have never thwarted you but in this one instance  --  you know  --  Fiz . Mr. Fizgig None of your nonsense ! Do n't arouse the sleeping lion in my breast ! Never thwarted me ! You have been a constant source of vexation and annoyance to me ever since the day you were born ! Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig Then , father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig ( to Garaf . ) Do n't provoke your father , you silly girl ! Let him work off his passion without interruption . Fiz . Mr. Fizgig Yes  --  go  --  go ! You are welcome to depart !  --  I discard you  --  I disinherit you ! Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig ( aside to Pinch . ) Well , if they wo n't forgive us , so much the more romantic is our love . Love in a cottage with you , dear Pinchbeck  --  Pinch . Pontefract Pinchbeck ( aside to Garaf . ) Ay ! ay ! love in a cottage  --  very pleasant  --  but the money !  --  the money ! Garaf . Garafelia Fizgig ( aloud . ) Come , Pontefract , let us away from this relentless house . But no  --  no ! I can not part thus with the parents who have been ever kind and affectionate to me . I will not leave with bitter feelings the father and the mother who have watched over and protected me . Father , mother , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disobedience .  --  The deed is done , and can not be recalled . Once more I supplicate your forgiveness . Let me not depart with your curse upon my head ! Mrs. Fiz . Mrs. Fizgig You shall not , my daughter , my daughter ! Fiz . Mr. Fizgig Garafelia , you are forgiven . Mrs. Fizgig , my dear , you are right for once .  --  ( Garafelia embraces first her mother , then her father : Pinchbeck kisses Mrs. Fizgig , who exclaims , " Oh , the bear !
