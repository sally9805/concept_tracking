txt FEW books , within our recollection , have been looked for with so much interest , or grasped at with so much avidity , as Mr. Macaulay 's History . The reason of this is obvious : - Mr . Macaulay had written somewhat largely and acceptably on historical subjects : he was generally understood to be a man of rather liberal and popular principles : he was thought to be a writer of great talent , research and accuracy , of a remarkably discriminating and impartial judgment , and of a most original , brilliant and impressive style ; and he was reported to be engaged in a work on that period of which a good history was most wanted . Two large volumes of the work , covering , exclusive of the introductory matter , a period of about three years and eleven months , have at length appeared , and we presume have , if anything , rather surpassed the public expectations . To paraphrase one of Mr. Macaulay 's own senteaces , t he writes ten pages of history where another man writes one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contain as much excellence as another man 's tea . Lord Mahon 's work , so far as we know , was not heard of by the public until it appeared , and has been little noticed in this country since its appearance . First published in 1844 , it has waited five years for republication in America . At length the Messrs . Appleton , one of the best and largest publishing houses in the country , have put it forth in their best style , under the editorial supervision of the able and judicious Professor Reed , of Philadelphia , a man of extensive learning and excellent taste , and one of the fairest , clearest , calmest minds that have lately appeared in the field of American letters . The work could not have passed to the public through better hands , and but that we dislike the mode of expression , we would add , those hands could not well have been employed on a more acceptable work . Both the editor and the publishers are the more entitled to our thanks , forasmuch as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote and slender advantage to themselves : for it could hardly be expected that a work which had waited so long for a publisher should have a very quick or very large sale when published . This fact , however , must not be supposed to indicate a want of taste and appreciation in the public for historical literature . For if Lord Mahon has waited five years to find one publisher , Mr. lacaulay has found three publishers in as many months ; and four or five large editions of the latter are likely to be disposed of before the half of one small edition of the former shall have been sold . Nor do the two works differ more in popularity than in temper and style : Lord Mahon uniformly writes like a gentleman , a scholar , and a Christian ; Mr. Macaulay writes just like himself ; in their views , feelings and dispositions they are almost as unlike as Edmund Burke and Thomas Paine ; in short , however much we may respect so high an authority as popular taste , we feel bound to confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Mahon seems to us as much better than Mr. Macaulay as he is different from him . Nor is this conclusion taken up lightly and unadvisedly ; it is the r&amp;ult of a pretty careful study and comparison of the two works : we know , moreover , that there are a few who agree with us in opinion now ; and we have the confidence or the vanity * Essays , Critical and Miscellaneous .

Though but little if any longer than Mr. Macaulay 's two volumes , it covers a period of nearly fifty years ; and that , too , without any appeni ' - ance of incompleteness or want , or a sacrifice of any matter that would add to the real interest or value of the work . But though about the same length as Macaulay 's two volumes , it is a book which one would naturally be much longer in reading , because it never puts one in a hurry ; abounding in inculcations to linger and contemplate and reflect , it seldom if ever leaves on the mind that sense of positivenesss which men are more apt to crave than to be the better or wiser for having . But Mr. Macaulay 's popularity and Lord Mahon 's merit entitle them to a pretty thorough examination at our hands ; and such an examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as our time and space and ability will permit . We shall endeavor to discuss their respective qualities with tolerabl&amp;candor and moderation ; though we freely acknowledge an aversion to the one and an attachment to the other , which may more or less bias and disqualify our judgment concerning them ; and we shall deeply regret , if , through prejudice or prepossession , we should lay ourselves open to any such impeachment of temper or of statement as we shall feel obliged to urge against one of them . We have thus taken care to indicate in the outset , " the gross and scope of our opinion , " to the end that if any determined admirers of Mr. Macauiav should chance upon this article , they may know from the beginning what they have to expect . Attention was first drawn to Mr. Macaulay in this country , by an article on Milton , published in the Edinburgh Review in 1825 . Most of the author 's admirers whom we have met with , dated their ndmiratioa from the reading of this article ; to this they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became fashionable to bestow upon him . It can not be denied that there is much in the article well adapted to produce such a result . A very small logic wielded with surprising agility , that master-weapon of special pleading , whereby readers are easily made to think they understand the things they do not ; a fearless leaning to his own understanding , and scorning of all who do otherwise , which is often mistaken for the confidence of certain truth ; a cheap and ostentatious mannerism of style , which keeps the author always in view , and the reader always thinking , " what a splendid writer he is ! " a dashing , off-hand , superficial ingenuity of phrase , which it requires little culture , less time , and no thought to appreciate ; a skillful puppet-show of illustrations which is sometimes called poetry , and which , from its rapidity of movement , leaves on the mind a half-impression of life ; and an habitual settling of long-disputed questions , as if there were , and could be , no dispute about them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prejudices for wise and just conclusions ; these things , together with a remarkable absence of those moral and intellectual qualities which invite the reader to linger and reflect , and pause and suspend his judgment , and remeasure his ground , and question his premises , and distrust his opini0ns , and moderate his censures ; all these things sufficiently explain why the article on Milton should have won for its author so quick and wide a popularity . That college boys and boarding-school misses , and sophomores of all ages and sexes should rise from such a piece of reading fully convinced that they knew far more of English history than Clarendon and Hume , was to be expected . And it was equally natural that they should entertain pretty tall notions of the writer who had given them so much knowledge at so little cdst . When , for example , the critic informs us , with characteristic modesty , that " Hume hated religion so much that he hated liberty for having been allied with religion ; " many would , of course , think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had presumed to shed a generous tear for the fate of Charles I. and the Earl of Strafford . " By the way , Mr. Hume informs us , in the life of himself , prefixed to his history , that at one time he almost despaired of the success of his work , the publisher having 500 May , // told him that only forty-five copies of it were sold in a year , and he having " scarcely heard of one man in the three kingdoms , considerable for rank or letters , that could endure the hook , except the Primate of England , Dr. Herring , and the Primate of Ireland , Dr. Stone . " Now if to the remark just quoted Mr. Macaulay had added , that it was probably for the same cause , namely , hatred of religion , that when the historian was thus despairing of his immortal work , " these dignified prelates separately sent him messages not to be discour* ed , " he would have nearly reached the spirit of his more mature performances . But , notwithstanding this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in question , even if no more like it had come from the same source , might well enough have lived very fast and died pretty soon . But the latter part of this effect was happily prevented by a succession of papers written with increasing cleverness and effrontery , evincing the same arrogance of temper , the same keen , cold intellectual virulence , the same hardness and hollowness of heart , and made up of the same monotonous smartness and brilliancy ; yet coming at such intervals that the admiring readers had time to rest and recover from the monotony of one before they entered upon that of another . All these things considered , it seems rather unkind in Mr. Macaulay to come out as he has done in the preface to the English edition of his Essays , telling us , " No attempt has been made to remodel any of the pieces which are contained in these volumes . Even the criticism on Milton , which was written when the author was fresh from college , and which contains scarcely a paragraph such as his matured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornament . " " Call you that backing your friends ? " Nevertheless , we acknowledge for once our entire consent with Mr. Macaulay ; we fully agree with him that the piece in question is worthless ; and we thought so long before his own opinion on the subject was published . For vices of style we believe it has never been surpassed ; for vices ( or are they virtues ? ) of temper it has probably been surpassed only by some of his later pieces . Next , perhaps , to the article on Milton VOL Ill. *O . V. *W SERIES . in popularity , was that on Croker 's edition of Boswell 's Life of Johnson , published in 1831 . This piece opens with several pages of critical plenipotence , nearly or quite equal to anything the author has done ; though his manifest redundancy of good nature has here betrayed him into some rather unlucky exhibitions . He says : " Mr. Croker has favored us with some Greek of his own . At the altar , ' says Dr. Johnson , I recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably mean hv*roi p:Xoi , departed friends . ' Johnson was not a first-rate Greek scholar ; but he knew more Greek than most boys when they leave school ; and no schoolboy could venture to use the word hv*q-o&amp; in the sense which Mr. Croker ascribes to it without imminent danger of a fiogging. " * One would think a man ought to be pretty sure he is right before he goes ahead after this fashion . Yet , if our lexicon does not lie , nothing in Greek is more certain than that the word hv*-o* may be used " in the sense which Mr. Croker ascribes to it , " and that as high an authority as Euripides , ( Hercules Furens , 491 , ) has used it in that sense , all scholars are agreed except Dindorf . Now we know not xvh*t may be the custom in England , having never been to school there ; but it is more customary here to flog schoolboys for insulting and browbeating their fellows , than for such mistakes as the one thus charged upon Mr. Croker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Croker tells us that the great Marquis of Montrose was beheaded in Edinburgh , in 1650 . There is not a forward boy in any school in England who does not know that the Marquis was hanged . The *iccount of the execution is one of the finest passages in Lord Clarendon 's History . We can scarcely suppose that Mr. Croker has never read that passage ; and yet we can scarcely suppose that any person who has ever perused so noble and pathetic a story , can have utterly forgotten all its most striking circumstances . " t The passage of Lord Clarendon alluded to is before us ; where we find the sen * Essays , p. 13S. 83 f Ibid. , p. 136. 1849. 501 // tence against the great Marquis running as follows , the italics being our own : " That he was , on the morrow , being the one and twentieth of May , 1650 , to be carried to Edinburgh cross , and there to be hanged upon a gallows thirty foot high , for the space of three hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head to be cut off upon a scaffold , and hanged on Edinburgh tollbooth ; bis legs and arms to be hanged up in other public towns of the kingdom , and his body to be buried at the place where he was executed , except the kirk should take off his excommunication ; and then his body might be buried in the common place of burial . " A few lines after , the noble historian informs us , that having first " pronounced his damnation , " " the next day they executed every part and circumstance of that barbarous sentence , with all the inhumanity imaginable ; and he bore it with all the courage and magnanimity , and the greatest piety , that a good Christian could manifest . " Now , in some respects , the beheading of the Marquis after he was dead , seems to us a more striking and memorable circumstance than the hanging him . For who that has ever read this pathetic story , would not be most likely to remember that noblest part of the noblest speech we ever read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " he was prouder to have his head set upon the place it was appointed to be , than he would be to have had his picture hang in the king 's bed-chamber ; that he was so far from being troubled that his four limbs were to be hanged in four cities of the kingdom , that be heartily wished he had flesh enough to be sent to every city in Christendom , as a testimony of the cause for which he suffered . " * While on this subject we may as well notice a singular instance of inaccuracy that occurs in the History . Speaking of ancient Britain , he says : " There was one province in our island , in which , as Procopius had been told , the ground was covered with serpents , and the air was such that no man could inhale it and live . To this desolate region the spirits of the departed were ferried over * History of the Rebellion , p. 742 . Oxford , 1843. from the land of the Franks at midnight . A strange race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead was distinctly heard by the boatman ; their weight made the keel sink deep in the water , but their forms were invisible to mortal eye . Such were the marvels which an able historian , the contemporary of Belisarius , of Simplicius , and of Trebonian , gravely related in the rich and polite Constantinople , touching the country in which the founder of Constantinople had assumed the imperial purple . " * Now , unless we be sadly misinformed , this is a strange bundle of mistakes . For the passage of Procopius alluded to has nothing to do with the island of Great Britain , or any province of it . On the contrary , Procopius locates the serpents in an island called Brittia ; not in any province of it , but in the whole island ; and adds withal the story of Charon 's ferry ; but , instead of relating it " gravely , " prefaces his account with a distinct statement that he does not believe it ; but says so many have told him of it , that he might seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Procopius , indeed , often speaks of Great Britain as Britannia , and in pne of his works , ( Bell . Va. ) he gives a full account of the revolt of Britannia from the Romans , and of the election of Constantine as emperor by the soldiers then on service in that island . From all which it would seem that he regarded Brittia and Britannia as two distinct places ; and accordingly he elsewhere says , " The island of Brittia is in the ocean , not more than 200 stadia from the shore , opposite the mouths of the Rhine , between Britannia and Thule . " However erroneous , therefore , Procopius may have been ii* his geography , it seems pretty clear , that to his mind Brittia , with its serpents , and ghosts , and malaria , was not the island where the soldiers elected Constantine to the empire.f To return to the article on Johnson and Boswell . Mr. Macaulay has several other remarks on Mr. Croker , equally amiable with those already quoted . After alleging against * Vol. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 7 , 1849 . See , however , Gibbon , Decline and Fall , chap . xxxviii , near the close . 502 May , // him three rather remarkable mistakes , the gentle reviewer adds , " Two of these three errors he has committed while ostentatiously displaying his own accuracy , and correcting what he represents as the loose nssertions of others . " Again ; " It is not likely that a person who is ignorant of what almost everybody knows , can know that of which almost everybody is ignorant . " Again ; " Indeed , the decisions of this editor on points of classical learning , though pronounced in a very authoritative tone , are generally such , that if a schoolboy under our care were to utter them , our soul assuredly should not spare for his crying . " Finally ; " If Mr. Croker is resolved to write on points of classical learning , we would advise him to give an hour every morning to our old friend Corderius. " * From all which it would seem that our great critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manners are more than he has " imngination to give them shape or words to put them in ; " for which cause he is quite excusable in thus repeating again and again the same manly and generous allusion . And , truly , the jest is so pretty and so original , who can blame him for often recurring to it , and dandling it , and doting upon it ? Doubtless the author 's ebullient , tumultuous good-nature caused him to overlook the exquisite vulgarity of his iterations . But seriously , we are far from thinking it a very criminal thing in a man to make such mistakes as Mr. Macaulay has alleged against Mr. Croker , or as we have alleged against Mr. Macaulay ; but really we can not see what virtue or wit there is in visiting such mistakes with a severity due only to moral vices , while falling into similar mistakes himself . But even granting Mr. Croker to have deserved the usage here put upon him , it seems strange how any man of hut tolerable self-respect , could stoop to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so exceedingly vile and mean , that we can have nothing to do with him unless it be to spit upon him , one would think it were best to let him alone , or at least , not to make an occasion and go out of our way to attack him . But Mr. Croker 's great mistake , we suspect , is , that he " fears God and honors the king , " and this is a mistake with which we are not aware that Mr. Macaulay has ever been charged . Mr. Macaulay 's treatment of Bosxvell and Johnson is much of a piece with that of Mr. Croker ; indeed , the whole article is chiefly made up of a rather unnecessary display of small learning and great insolence . Many of his remarks on Boswell are such as we do not deem ourselves worthy to repeat . Johnson he allows to have been a man of some benevolence , and on that account not undeserving of praise ; yet he does not scruple to load him with such phrases as " the last of Giub-street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ungainly pedant ; " * and his whole account of Johnson 's struggles with poverty and want , is such as we can not well see how a man of honorable and humane feelings could have given ; its tendency being only to excite in the reader a disgust and contempt of that brave , noble , and though rough yet gentle spirit , for the very reasons that ought to draw upon him the greater honor and respect . Though professedly writing a criticism on Johnson , he does not once allude to his greatest work , the Dictionary ; whether from contempt of it , or because he could find nothing in it to sneer at , may be a question : yet he finds room for a wretched scoff about Johnson 's " celebratino ' the close of Lent with sugarless tea and butterless buas. " t Elsewheret he calls this great and good man " a bigot , " which indeed is the gentle word whereby this great professor of liberality usually designates those from whom he happens to differ in opinion . And it is considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his piety , benevolence , patriotism and honesty , Mr. Macaulay , either from some unUindsome design , or from a spontaneous malignity , sets them forth in such a way , and confines his notice to such manifestations of them , that the reader , if he be at all in sympathy with the writer , thinks rather the worse of the good Doctor for having them . But this , in fact , is Macaulay 's usual method of treating the characters of those whose opinions he dislikes , but whose virtues he can not deny . For example , in the great * Essays , pp. 137 , 138. tlbid. , p. 147. * Essays , p. 145. 4 History . 1849. 503 // Duke of Marlborough , he professes to find no one virtue save an unconquerable attachment to the English Church ; and he takes care to represent this virtue in such amanner , that the Duke may appear the worse for cherishing , and the Church the worse for inspiring it . Does he fear lest some men 's virtues may recommend their opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations , and thus contrives to provoke a goodnatured ridicule upon characters whom every good principle and every right feeling bids us venerate ? We hope our readers need not be told that it is difficult to conceive of anything more pernicious and discreditable than such a spirit as this . For , surely , to be of a temper to mock and ridicule the greatest and best of our species , indicates a state of mind and of heart that is very far from favorable to virtue or to truth . In short , this practical atheism of human virtue , which runs through nearly all that Mr. Macaulay has written , is far more vicious in itself , and far more vitiating in its influence , than the honest infidelity of a great many such men as Gibbon and Hume . Again ; Mr. Macaulay says that Johnson 's " passions were violent even to slaying , against all who leaned to Whiggish principles . " * Now , if the critic had any regard for truth , why did he not tell us how to reconcile this statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that , too , when Burke was on all hands allowed to be as sound a Whig as any man in the party . Again ; he tells us , " The judgments which Johnson passed on books were in his own time regarded with superstitious veneration ; and in our time are generally treated with indiscriminate contempt . " t We doubt if this be strictly true . We have , indeed , often seen and heard Johnson 's criticisms questioned , canvassed and exploded , but we have never seen or heard them treated with contempt , nor does it seem credible that any man should treat them so who was competent to understand them . We believe many of his critical judgments are very erroneous ; but even in his greatest errors he evinced a largeness , sobriety and rectitude of mind which , it seems to us , must secure them a respectful consideration from every one who has a proper respect for himself . 1-Jere , again , however , we must plead our ignorance of English customs ; but we feel tolerably safe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat the great instructors and examples of our race in a vain , flippant and contemptuous style , even when refuting their errors . Besides , Johnson 's criticisms , compared with those of his predecessors , seem highly respectable in themselves ; and our only wonder is , how with so little help he could do so much towards making the science what it now is . If we be not mistaken , Coleridge is generally ranked at the head of English critics ; yet it may be doubted whether Coleridge is more in advance of Johnson than J ohnson was of nearly all who had written before him . Of Johnson 's efforts in this line , perhaps the " Life of Milton " is the least satisfactory yet it is very observable , that with all his antipathy to Milton 's opinions , he is incomparably more liberal and respectful towards the poet than Mr. Macaulay is towards Johnson , or even Bacon ; indeed , we question whether Mr. Macaulay ever spoke so liberal and generous a word of any man as Johr*son 's well-known remark concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the few instances wherein Mr. Macaulay has said a little more than he meant ; for his chief virtue as a writer seems to be an itching fondness for saying smart things , which sometimes slightly blurs his perception of the truth . Of these instances , we will give a few merely as a specimen , before leaving this part of the subject . Speaking of Johnson , he says : " If we judged him by the best parts of his mind , we should place him almost as high as he wag placed by the idolatry of Boswell ; if by the worst parts of his mind , we should place him even below Boswell himself . " * Now , we know that Johnson , with all his vigor and reach of understanding , had the moral simplicity of a child ; and like many other great men of childlike natures , and in whom the religious feelings were strong and quick , he had somewhat of a childish regard for ghosts and omens and visions and dreams . Yet even these weaknesses , ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essays , p. 146. 504 May , // doubtedly they were ; nor do we suppose there is any human virtue but is clogged with some unhandsome excrescences , ) seem to us to borrow a certain grace and dignity from the principle out of which they sprung . And such , we venture to say , is the view that any right-minded man would take of them ; and as such he would approach them with respect , and wish to draw a veil over them ; or if truth bid him not conceal them , he would in obedience to the same truth touch them *ently , and take care to show them in such a way as should rather humble us than excite our mirth . Yet these are the things which Mr. Macaulay regards as " the worst parts of his mind ; " which he apparently delights in unfolding , and misderiving , and exaggerating ; and respecting which he tells us , that if in his best moments " some childish prejudices , such as would excite laughter in a well-managed nursery , came across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell from gigantic elevation to dwarfish littleness. " * Speaking of Boswell , he says , " Many of the greatest men that ever lived have writtca biography . Boswell was one of the smallest men that ever lived , and he has beaten them all . " Again ; after mentioning some distinguished writers " But these men attained literary eminence in spite of their weaknesses . Boswell attained it by reason of his weaknesses . If he had not been a great fool , he would never have been a great writer . " And again ; " He had indeed a quick observation and a retentive memory . These qualities , if he had been a man of sense and virtue , would scarcely of themselves have sufficed to make him conspicuous ; but , as he was a dunce , a parasite , and a coxcomb , they have made him immortal . " t These are hut specimens of the usual agility of our author 's pen : in all his many long essays there are but few paragraphs in which similar beauties may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very onderful , very profound ; but especially wonderful in this , that they enable us continually to see the author , or rather to see nothing else . It may indeed be questioned whether there be any truth in them ; but those , we apprehend , who * Essays , P. 146 . Ibid. , pp. 141 , 2. have learned to relish Macaulay , will hardly esteem this a defect ; and all must confess them to be most admirable and exquisite agitations of wit . Some of our readers may have seen Mr. Carlyle 's noble article on Johnson and Boswell , originally published in Fraser* s Magazine in 1832. if so , they must have been struck with the contrast between Carlyle and Macaulay in the whole spirit and temper of their minds , as shown in their respective views on this subject . Perhaps we can not better express this contrast than by saying , Mr. Carlyle evidently thinks , and would have us think , the better of Boswell for his admiration and love of Johnson ; Mr. Macaulay , the worse of Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , Boswell seems exalted , with the other , Johnson seems degraded by the sympathy and connection between them . Carlyle , indeed , docs not attempt to conceal or disguise the mean and bad qualities of Boswell ; neither does he evince any unworthy delight in contemplating and exposing them ; but he evidently regards them " more in sorrow than in anger , " or in joy ; and the manifest reluctance with which he states them , approvcs his just concern for the truth , in thus disclosing what he wishes were not true ; while , on the other hand , he appears to take pleasure in discovering beneath them a vein of manhood which can not choose but feel the touch and obey the call of real greatness and goodness , and which delights in the recognition and the society of what is like itself or above itself in others . Of course , therefore , he does not set forth those qualities in such a way as to excite an overbalance of disgust or contempt : on the contrary , the jll-tem*red sneer which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's character , relaxes and softens down into a good-natured smile , as the reader attains the deeper and juster view which the critic gives him ;  --  a smile of sympathy , not of scorn , and which assuredly is as much more salutary to the reader , as it is more just to the subject . Nor , on the other hand , does he endeavor to put or to keep out of sight the errors and infirmities of Johnson ; but the whole is so done , that Johnson , instead of suffering in his credit from the mean and bad qualities of 1849. 505 // his friend , appears all the greater and better for raising such a man above himself and drawing out whatever of good there was in him . Thus both of them stand before us ennobled by their strange yet beautiful connection ; l3oswell appearing the better for what he discerned in Johnson , and Johnson the better for what he developed in Boswell . Now , we have little sympathy with many of Carlyle 's opinions , nor have we much patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objections to them : yet we can not but think that in this case , at least , his representation is as much more faithful to truth and fact than Mr. Macaulay 's , as it is more grateful to a humane and benevolent temper . For , assuredly , contempt and enmity are quite as apt to misrepresent their objects as affection and respect ; and their exhibitions are much the more hurtful , because their natural effect is to cherish in us the feeling which we are at best too apt to indulge , how mach better we are than others . In the article in question , Mr. Carlyle , notwithstanding his obliquities of style and opinion , writes with a manly earnestness and simplicity which makes us feel that he is thinking and would have us think of something besides himself : if his manner be somewhat affected , it is not the affectation of a selfish , ignoble vanity . There is indeed a zeal in his representation , but it is not the zeal of an advocate : he evidently loves both Johnson and I3oswell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its object , not at itself ; and he manifestly endeavors to clear the way for us to take a full and fair view of the persons before him , not to occupy our thoughts with his own diseased and distorted notions concerning them . It need hardly be said , that one c* nnot well read Mr. Macaulay 's article without feeling that with him the matter is far otherwise . He seems unwilling to be for a moment out of our sight , to let us see or think of anything but himself : there is a manifest laboring to make out a strong case , to see what he can say : he studiously pranks up the subject with the extravagances of mockery and conceit ; puts upon it , as far as may be , the constructions of wit and spleen ; and with morbid ingenuity rakes together an eclecticism of vile images and phrases ; and the result is a mass of exaggeration , overstatement and caricature , which is the more inexcusable in this case , forasmuch as , if Boswell had many bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggerating and overstating them to produce an effect ; and on the other hand , if he had few good qualities , there was the more reason that he should have full credit for those few . Moreover , unless an author be a professed satirist , the rules of good writing , as well as of good natute , require that the unhandsome features should rather be somewhat softened and idealized than caricatured ; because blemishes of face are more exposed , and if made too prominent in a picture , defeat the perception of those better things which lie beneath , and which would become apparent in the varying moods and happier moments of the original . Nor should it be forgotten that justice is in its nature a fearful , cautious , painstaking principle , ever on its guard against too little or too much . Mr. Macaulay , how ever , seldom betrays any signs of apprehension or solicitude on this score ; one would rarely suspect him of tempering and moderating his statements through self-distrust : on the contrary , lie generally speaks In a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and meant the reader should feel , that he had so completely surrounded his subject , and mastered it , and got above it , that no scruples were needful in his case : he could not be mistaken ; there can be no question about it ; his decisions must be just ; and none but a dunce would think of deciding otherwise . In short , to approve the certainty and sufficiency of his knowledge concerning those of whom he is speaking , Mr. Macaulay seldQm failso insult over them , to look down upon them , and thrust his spurs into them , as expressive of his assured conquest and superiority ; in which respect he often reminds us of a class of " fervent reprehenders , " whom hooker speaks of as being " always confident and bold-spirited men ; " and lie adds , " but their confidence , for the most part , riseth from too much credit given to their own wits , for which cause , they are seldom free from error . " Which accounts , perhaps , for much of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May , // what modest , and experience is ever furnishing them new arguments of self-distrust ; and they can not well understand how a man should be so positive and peremptory in his sentences , unless he were going upon the most solid and unquestionable grounds . But of all the things in this article , we confess the strongest repugnance to the author 's explanation of the acknowledged merits of Boswell 's hook . Nor is the smartness of his sentences on this subject any compensation for their manifold and manifest absurdity . And we venture to suspect that he would never have conceived such an explanation of them , but for an overweening desire to shine in paradoxical epigrams and antitheses . Unwilling , perhaps , to deny excellencies which everybody affirmed , or to admit excellencies which he could not explain , or to explain them by any principle too deep for his appreciation , he has fallen , it seems to us , on just the shallowest and absurdest explanation that can be conceived . And his sentences look much more like the flippancies of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sober , manly judgment . On the whole , we very much prefer the explanation given by Carlyle : that the excellencies in question were by no means in consequence of Boswell 's mean and had qualities , but solely and purely in spite of them ; that he wrote a good book , not because he was a fool , but because underneath his folly there was a vein of real wisdom-an eye to discern true worth , a heart to love it , and the art ( or was it the nature ? ) to delineate it . And one of our reasons for preferring this explanation is , that it does not encourage the readers of that book to spurn and scoff at the poor author for the very pleasure and instruction he has given them . We have dwelt the longer on this subject here , because Mr. Macaulay 's paper on Johnson and Boswell rather strikingly exemplifies the strong propensity to illnatured caricature which pervades nearly all he has written . Of this propensity , this ostentatious redundancy of contempt and scorn , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one of our American reviewers , which we the rather quote because it was apparently written for praise ; though we confess it strikes us as somewhat chargeable with the extravagance in which the subject of it so often indulges . " His critical severity , " says this writer , " almost actualizes the ideal of critical damnation He is both judge and executioner ; condemns the prisoner-puts on the black cap with a stinging sneer-hangs , quarters , and scatters his limbs to the four winds , without any pity or remorse . He subjects the commonplace , the stupid , the narrowminded , to every variety of critical torture ; he riddles them with epigrams ; he racks them with analysis ; he scorches them with sarcasm ; he probes their most , delicate and sensitive nerves with the glittering edge of his wit ; he breathes upon them the hot breath of his scorn ; he crushes and grinds them in the whirling mill of his logic ; over the burning marl of his critical Pandemonium he makes them walk with unsandalled feet , and views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need hardly be said , that a man of whom this could be spoken by a professed admirer , is not one from whom much good is to be learned . With the exception of the paper on Johnson , perhaps there is no one of Mr. Macaulay 's articles wherein the bad qualities indicated in the above extract , are more intemperately displayed than in the piece on Southey 's Colloquies , published in 1830 ; though , on the whole , there is not much to choose between this paper and the one on Bacon . The spirit of the whole article is pretty fairly indicated by the following , near the beginnincr : " It is indeed most extraordinary that a mind like Mr. Southey 's , a mind richly endowed by nature and highly cultivated by study , a mind which has exercised considerable influence on the most eiilightened generation of the most enlightened people that ever existed , should be utterly destitute of the power of discerning truth from falsehood . Yet such is the fact . " Again : " In the mind of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either leader or follower , as eithe* sovereign or slave . He does not seem to know what an argument is . " And again : " A peculiar austerity marks almost all Mr. Southey 's judgments of men and ac * Whipple 's Essays , vol. i. p. 19. 1.849. // tions . We are far from blaming him for fixing on a high standard of morals , and for applying that standard to every case . But rigor ought to be accompanied by discernment , and of discernment Mr. Southey seems to be utterly destitute . " * But let not the lovers of Mr. Southey be discouraged ; the gentle , the generous , the high-souled author of Thalaba and The Doctor , it seems , is not alone in this 0 , no ! he has a parallel , the critic tells us , in - Burke ! who , though not ullerb , destitute of reason and discernment , like Southey , belonged however to the same class of minds , differing from him only in deglee , not in kind . He had indeed some reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of passion . " Hence , " says our critic , " he generally chose his side like a fanatic , and defended it like a philosopher . " And again : " It is not difficult to perceive , that his hostility to the French Revolution principally arose from the vexation which he felt at having all his old political associations disturbed , at seeing the well-known boundary-marks of states obliterated , and the names and distinctions with which the history of Europe had been filled for ages , swept away . He felt like an antiquary whose shield had been scoured , or a connoisseur who found his Titian retouched. " t So then , we have now at length a clear and intelligible account of the whole matter . Many , no doubt , will be or have been gratified to learn , that the darkest and bloodiest passage in the annals of our race , was quite innocent in itself , perfectly inoffensive to reason ; only to Burke it was new ; it contradicted his tastes ; and his war against it was but the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stupendous workings of his most noble and manly soul , no deeper principle is to be sought than that of casual association ; and that in his immortal words on this great theme we hear the voice , not of a wise , considerate , deeply-moved statesman , patriot and Christian , but only of a political antiquary and connoisseur . Of course Mr. Macaulay views that movement and its authors in the light of reason . Accordingly one of the gentlest censures we have * Essays , pp. 99 , 100 , 101. * Ibid. , p. 99. seen from him , gentler indeed than he can be fairly supposed to utter against any from whom he greatly differs in opinion , is where , speaking of this band of atheistical brethren , he ventures to suggest , that the religious system of the Middle Ages " might have seemed to deserve a more respectful mention from philosophers and philanthropists. " * If such be his treatment of Burke , it might be expected that Southey would fare rather badly at his hands ; and he does fare as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " No man out of a cloister ever wrote about love , for example , so coldly and at the same time so 0rossly . He seems to have no notion of anything between the Platonic passion of the Glendoveer , who gazes with rapture on his mistress 's leprosy , and the brutal appetite of Arvalan and Roderick . " f It is difficult to believe that this is spoken of the author of that most charming passage , so pure and yet so human-hearted , begin-ning , " They sin who tell us love can die : With life all other passions fly , All others are but vanity , " &amp;c . Again , he says , " What theologians call the spiritual sins are his cardinal virtue s - hatred , pride , and the insatiable thirst of vengeance . . . . Almost the only mark of charity which he vouchsafes to his opponents is to pray for their conversion , and this he does in terms not unlike those in which we can imagine a Portuguese priest interceding with Heaven for a Jew , delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , too , it is hard to conceive that any human being can have in his eye one of the most upright and amiable of men ; a character adorned with every private and public virtue ; the much-loved , much-honored of such men as Wordsworth and Lamb ; and the author of that precious book , The Doctor , in one chapter of which is often to be found more of quiet wisdom , of kindly sympathy , of bland philosophy , and benignant good-nature , than in all we have seen of our critic 's writing put together . It must be confessed , indeed , that on political subjects Southey often wrote more like a partisan than a states 1- Essays , p. 101. * History , vol. i. p. 7. t Essays , p. 101. 508 May , // man ; yet we never have seen anything from Mr. Macaulay written with half the candor and liberality , the calmness of temper , and kindness of feeling , and equanimity of judgment , that we meet with in Southey 's most delightful and instructive biography of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , John Wesley . If iNir . Macaulay considers these works and others like them to be " totally destitute " of reason and discernment , it might be worth the while to know what he means by those two imposing words . It is true , we do not find in Southey 's writings much of the brilliant but feeble declamation or of the no less attenuated than flippant and conceited logic , of which Macaulay is so consummate a master : but really we can not persuade ourselves to think the less of them on that account . Of this logical spider-web-spinning we have a considerable specimen , as usual , in the article before us . Mr. Southey , it seems , in one of the " Colloquies , " brings in the ghost of Sir Thomas More , saying : " Nothino ' is more certain than that religion is the basis upon which civil government rests ; that from religion power derives its authority , laws their efficacy , and both their zeal and sanction . " This absurd and irrational doctrine of course the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held and maintained by almost every considerable author that has written on the subject ; and he winds up his conclusive refutation , as is his wont , with a few sprightly sneers at Southey , such as these : " He never sees at one glance more of a question than will furnish matter for one flowing and wellturned sentence ; " and " We do not well know what his opinion about toleration is ; but , on the whole , we take it to be this , that everybody is to tolerate him , and that he is to tolerate nobodv. " * The orthodoxy whereby our critic overthrows this pernicious heterodoxy of Southey 's is briefly and substantially this : The true basis of civil government lies , not in religion , but in the principles of our social nature and the necessities of the social state : men must live together , or not live at all ; and living together , they must be protected in their persons and possessions * Essays , p. 111. from each other 's evil passions ; and this word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built . To give a specimen of the elevated language used by our potent critic on this subject : " If Mr. Southey allows , as we think he must allow , that it is for the good of mankind in this world to have civil government , and that the great majority of mankind hax e always thought it for their good in this world to have civil government , then we have a basis for government quite distinct from religion . " And again : " We are at a loss to conceive in what sense religion can be said to be the basis of government , in which it is not also the basis of the practices of eating , drinkino ' and lighting fires in cold weather . " * Unquestionably , therefore , the true stay and support of government is to be sought for in an enlightened selfishness , not in a prevailing sense of duty and moral responsibility : men need no other motives to abstain from injuring their neighbors than those which prompt them to eat and drink and make fires ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or are interested to do as social beings , not of what they ought to do as moral agents , that " power derives its authority , laws their efficacy , and both their zeal and sanction : " religion and conscience may indeed be useful as auxiliaries in the matter of obedience to law and government , and as such no wise man will despise them , but are by no means to be regarded as the root or ground or life of such obedience . Now we shall not attempt to refute Mr. Macaulay 's reasoning , or whatever else it may be called , on this subject ; for to presuiue that such a refutation were needful , would be little less than an insult to the understanding of our*readers . We will simply produce a short passage from Hooker , not indeed to show that Mr. Macaulay is wrong , but only that Southey , however widely astray in this matter , has the happiness to err in pretty good company . " So natural is the union of religion with justice , that we iuay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For how should they be unfeignedly just , whom religion doth not cause to be such ; or they religious , which are not found such * Essays , p. 108. 1849. 509 // by the proof of their just actions ? If they , which employ their labor and travel about the public administration of justice , follow it only as a trade , . . . being not in heart persuaded that justice is God 's own work , and themselves His agents in this business ; the sentence of right God 's own verdict , and themselves His priests to deliver it ; formalities of justice do but serve to smother right , and that , which was necessarily ordained for the common good , is through shameful abuse made the cause of common misery . " * Now it seems but reasonable to suppose , and perhaps even Mr. Macaulay would allow , that civil government can hardly stand without justice . If , then , government can not stand without justice , nor justice without religion , we see not but that religion may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though not the only thing , it may be one of the things on which government is necessarily grounded . However , we are not coaceraed to justify Hooker 's view ; it needeth not to be encumbered with our help . We will only add , that it would not be difficult to find many wise and good men , both heathen and Christian , speaking in the same or a similar strain : and on the whole it is not so very evident that men . can he brought to obey government at all , unless they he taught to obey it for conscience 's sake . But even if a still larger number of still wiser and better men were on Southey 's side , this were no sufficient reason why Mr. Macaulay should not differ from him , and be right in so differing ; but some may consider it a sufficient reason why he should not express his dissent in a contemptuous , ill-mannered , insolent flippancy . Perhaps we may as well notice in this connection another specimen of Mr. Macaulay 's small logic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we can hardly suppose himself to have believed it , yet used so skillfully that we can e* sily conceive many readers to have been abused by it . It is from the article on " Church and State , " where he undertakes to demonstrate , in opposition to Mr. Gladstone and divers others , that unity in the matter of the Church is an impossibility , a thing * Ecclesiastical Polity , Book V , ch. 1 . which never has been , and never can be , and which it is the height of absurdity to expect . Now , we have no concern at present with the Church of England or with any other particular church ; but if Mr. Macaulay 's reasoning on this subject be good for anything , it precludes all religious unity and community whatsoever . His argument runs as follows : " Unity , Mr. Gladstone tells us , is essential to truth . And this is most unquestionable . But when he goes on to tell us that this unity is the characteristic of the Church of England , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are compelled to differ from him widely . The apostolical succession she may or may not have . But unity she most certainly has not , and never has had . It is a matter of perfect notoriety , that her formularies are framed in such a manner as to admit to her highest offices men who differ from each other more widely than a very high Churchman differs from a Catholic , or a very low Churchman from a Presbyterian ; and that the general leaning of the Church , with respect to some important questions , has been sometimes one way , and sometimes another . " Then , after mentioning several questions , such as " Calvinism and Arminianism , " " the operation of the sacraments , " and the just grounds and limits of ecclesiastical authority and private judgment , wherein there have been and are great and manifest differences of opinion , he goes on : " All these different opinions are held , avowed , preached , printed within the pale of the Church , by men of unquestioned integrity and understanding . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gladstone 's eloquent exhortations to unity ? Is it not mere mockery to attach so much importance to unity in forr* and name , where there is so little in substance ? . . . And is it not clear that Mr. Gladstone is bound on all his own principles , to abandon the defense of a Church in which unity is not found ? " * This argument has doubtless been by many regarded as perfectly decisive of the question . And if unity of opinion were the only unity possible or practicable or desirable in the Church , unquestionably it would be so ; this being a sort of unity * Essays , pp. 3%-6 510 May , // which it were manifestly ridiculous to assert , and vain to expect . But then it so happens that this is a kind of unity which , we will venture to say , no man in his senses ever thought of asserting or of expecting . The truth is , opinion is in no wise the proper matter of ecclesiastical , any more than of civil or of domestic unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject half an hour without ascertaining so mucb . And can not Mr. Macaulay conceive of such a thing as unity of interest , or affection , or spirit , or organization , with diversity of opinion ? Is a man bound to consider his own opinions infallible , and so make them matters of conscience , and esteem them above everything else ? May not several persons unite in loving and cherishing the same object , without holding the same opinions concerning that object ? May not a man think freely and have his own opinions , without preferring them to everything else , to father and mother , or wife and children , or country , or Church ? Can not a man and his wife differ in opinion without breach of that sacred unity in which it is their duty and honor and happiness to live ? Nay , can not a man differ from himself , change his opinions ( Mr. Macaulay tells us he has changed his ) without ceasing to be at unity with himself ? Must any man , does any wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infallibly true , as to be willing to break charity , and commit civil or domestic or religious schism , and curse all who dissent from him , for the sake of them ? For example , there are among us many and great differences of political opinion ; but is there any American so unworthy of that great and glorious name , so smitten with his own wisdom , so conceited and selfish and base , as to prize his opinions above his country , or above his country 's welfare or honor ? In short , must a man 's opinions , those mushrooms of the brain , be dearer to him than any or all other objects ? And if so , what is this but to make his opinions his god ? Shame , then , on this everlasting ado about our opinions , as if these were the greatest blessings Providence had vouchsafed us !

But this fecundity and fondness of opinion is but one of the forms , and certainly not the least offensive form of that selfishness whence so many evils spring . " For man naturally is scarce so fond of the offspring of his body as of that of his soul . His notions are his darlings ; so that neither children nor self are half so dear to him as the only-begotten of his mind . " * And perhaps this is one , and by no means the least of the evils which it is the very office and aim of the Church to cure , by inspiring us with sentiments and attachments , and by giving us loves and cares and aims and objects and hopes and comforts for which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain . Who knows but that the Church may be among the chief means appointed " to keep the soul low and humble , and to check those self-complacencies which it is apt to grow into by an over weeliing conceit of its own opinions , more than by any other thing whatsoever . " t So much for Mr. Macaulay 's famous argument to show that there neither is nor can be any such thing as unity in the Church , because we know , forsooth , that there always has been , and from the constitution and condition of the human mind , must needs always be more or less diversity of opinion . And sure enough , if there can be no unity but this , then it must be confessed that *inity in the Church is an impossible , or , at least , an impracticable thincr nor is there any remedy at last but every man must be his own church ; and when this is the case , it probably will not be long , but every man will be his owa god . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the state ; for unity is as inconsistent with diversity of opinion in these as in the Church : so that nothing apparently hinders that we must come to this , that * Dr. South , Serm. xxx . Ibid. 1849. 511 // every man is to be his own commonwealth , with a chief magistrate under him . Assuredly , it is not the having their individual opinions , ( though it is considerable that wise men are apt to have but few of them , and to set but little by those few , ) but the making too much of them , the being unreasonably fond of them , and as unreasonably persecuted for them ; it is not the differing in their minds and views , but the preferring their inward , airy and ineffective notions to certain outward , substantial and ennobling objects ; this is the main cause that has split men into so many religious sects and parties , and set or kept them at enmity and strife . And surely it can not be out of place to remember here , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are to " know that we have passed from death unto life , because we love the brethren , " not because we love our own opinions . In the strength of which principle , overcoming the dividing forces of self-wise or self-willed opinion , there is room enough for unity : nor can it be amiss to urge and exhort men to such unity so long as those dividing forces continue to operate ; and if , as things now are , we can not have so much unity as might be desired , this is no good reason why we should not endeavor to have as much as we can . And instead of laying so much stress on opinion , as if this were the only matter of unity , how much better would it be to remember the maxim acted upon of old , by different parties in the Church , that " Catholics , as Catholics , agree always in matters of faith , and good Catholics never break charity , but the best Catholics , as men , may vary in their opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we leave this subject , that both here and elsewhere in this article we use the word Church not in any exclusive or invidious sense , but as expressing the very idea and principle of religious society , leaving it to every man to decide for himself what and where the Church is ; but withal assuring him that , whatsoever and wheresoever he may conclude the Church to be , it will not be much for his own good to esteem her of less importance to him than his opinions ; and that , if he * Fuller , Church History , vol. vi , p. 74 ; Oxford , 1845. can consent to be in unity and felloxvship with others on no ground but this , then he has much reason to suspect , that instead of loving and seeking truth , he is but hugging his own brain-sick notions and fancies dressed up in her imagery . We know not how we can better close this episode , already much too long , than in the words of Jeremy Taylor : " Although the Spirit of God did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as those tongues were of fire , not to kindle strife , but to warm our affections and inflame our charities , we should find that this variety of opinions in several persons would be looked upon as an argument only of diversity of operations , while the Spirit is the same . " And again : " It is not the differing opinions that is the cause of present ruptures , but want of charity ; it is not the variety of understandings , but the disunion of wills and affections ; it is not the several principles , but the several ends , that cause our miseries ; our opinions commence and are upheld according as our turns are served , and our interests are preserved , and there is no cure for us but piety and charity . " And finally : " All these mischiefs proceed not from this , that all men are not of one mind , for that is neither necessdry nor possible , but that every opinion is made an article of faith , every article is a ground of quarrel , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all zeal pretends for God , and whatsoever is for God can not be too much : we by this time are come to that pass , we think we love not God except we hate our brother , and we have not the virtue of religion unless we persecute all religions but our own . " * As for Mr. Macaulay , from the way in which he frequently- ' decides theological and ecclesiastical questions , in both his Essays and his History , one might suppose he had spent a whole life in studying them , or rather , perhaps , that he had never studied them at all . For with an amount of furnishing that might indeed be somewhat remarkable in an undergraduate , he pronounces in a most positive and peremptory manner on subjects where a Bull , a Pearson , or a Waterland , in the fullness of his faculties and furnishings , * Introduction to Liherty of Prophesying. 512 // qwq // Macaulay 's Essays .

' " a ' born utilitarianism , that he might indulge Of course everybody remembers Pope 's with similar effect in the rhetoric of eulogy , verse , describing Bacon as Thus , to the end that he may satisfactorily " The wisest , brightest , meanest of mankind ; " display himself in the censure of the one qwq * Advancement of* Learaing , Book I. * Novum Organurn , Book I , Aph. 68. f Essays , p. 259. // enthusiasm of thought , and not from ambition to startle and amaze . He therefore represents Bacon as far guiltier of practical abuses , and far holder in speculative innovation , than the calm , sober student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . To make good this representation , everything doubtful or reprehensible in Bacon 's conduct ( and that there was much of this , probably none will deny ) is strangely exaggerated and overstrained ; while at the same time everything , both personal and circumstantial , that would go to temper and moderate and relieve the bad impression , ( for there was much of this also , ) is as strangely overlooked or suppressed . Though Bacon 's character should in no wise be held up as a model of virtue and honor , neither can it with any justice be set forth as a special mark of abhorrence or contempt . Morally , he does not appear to have been much , if at all , in advance of his age ; though we suspect it would be found , on due examination , that there were many public men of the time below him , where there was one above him , in this respect . He was not only greatly admired as a thinker , but deeply loved and honored as a man , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; which could hardly have been the case but that , with all his blemishes , he had great moral and social virtues . Though often straitened for means , he was always very generous to his servants : his temper and carriage were eminently gentle and humane : be was never accused of insolence to any human being , which is the common pleasure of mean-spirited men : he did all that wisdom and friendship could do to keep Essex and Villiers out of crime , and never deserted either of them until other and higher attachments compelled him : his conduct in Parliament was always manly , his views as a legislator were liberal , and leaning strongly towards improvement ; and if on one occasion he crouched more than we might wish under the stern rebuke of the queen , it was no more than the whole House of Commons had often done before him : it is not pretended that he ever gave an unjust or illegal judgment as chancellor : his private life was blameless , and abounding in works of piety and charity : and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incur the anger , of the king and Buckingham , when they were in the full career of rapacity and corruption , should perhaps be taken as proof that he had resisted them as much as he could without losing the power to resist them at all . Hallam , who is far enough from sparing Bacon 's faults , and whose censure sometimes appears to verge upon excessive severity , admits , however , that " with all his pliancy , there are fewer overstrained expressions about the prerogative in his political writings than we should expect ; " and that , " though his practice was servile , his principles were not unconstitutional ; " * which is no slight praise for a statesman of those times . And one might hesitate to believe that " the meanest of mankind " could have written the following to a favorite of James I ; especially , considering how much power that favorite had to crush whom he feared , and how much reason to fear one that told him thc truth : " As far as it may lie in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of this kingdom love the laws thereof , and nothing will oblige them more than a confidence of the free enjoying of them ; what the nobles upon an occ* sion once said in Parliament , iLVolumns leges Angli* mutare , ' is imprinted in the hearts of all the people . " t From this and other like passages we may perhaps infer why that accomplished profligate joined in crushing so wise and just a counsellor . With an imperious master , a rapacious minister , and a servile court , it strikes us as rather a matter of grief than of wonder that Bacon should have stooped to some unworthy and ill-favored compliances ; and when we duly weigh the temptations of his place , perhaps we shall conclude it better to pray that we be not led into similar temptations , than to censure him too harshly for yielding to them . One of Mr. Macaulay 's severest charges against Bacon is for writing the " Declaration of the Treasons of Robert , Earl of Essex . " The earl , he informs us , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited strong , perhaps unreasonable feelings of compassion and indignation . The queen was received by the citizens of * Constitutional History , p. 206 , note , Harpers. * Advice to Sir George Villiers . 1849. 5J*5 // London with gloomy looks and faint acclamations . She thought it expedient to publish a vindication of the late proceedings ; " * and she imposed upon Bacon the task of drawing up that vindication . Mr. Macaulay does not question the truth of what Bacon afterwards alleged in excuse of the act , " that he wrote it by command ; that he considered himself as a mere secretary ; and that he was not answerable for the matter of the book , he having furnished only the arrangement and the style . " But the pith of the censure is , " Why did he endow such a purpose with words ? Could no hack-writer , without virtue or shame , be found to exaggerate the errors , already so dearly expiated , of a gentle and noble spirit ? " t A thing bearing some resemblance to this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as everybody knows , was received by the nation with one long , loud. , deep , agonized groan of horror and execration ; whereupon the " patriots " " thought it expedient to publish a vindication of the late proceedings . " The person pitched upon for the , work was John Milton , who probably has the merit of furnishing both the matter and the style of a book enriched with such passages as this " But Charles murdered both his prince and his father , and that by poison . For , to omit other evidences ; he that would not suffer a duke , that was accused for it , to come to his trial , must needs have been guilty of it himself . " t Of this performance , Mr. Macaulay says " Though we think the conduct of the regicides blameable , that of Milton appears to us in a very different light . The deed was done . It could not be undone . The evil was incurred ; and the object was to render it as small as possible . We censure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular opinion ; but we can not censure Milton for wishing to change that opinion For the sake of public liberty , wc wish that the thing had not been done , while the people disapproved of it . But for the sake of public liberty , we should also have wished the people to approve of it , when it was done . " * Essays , p. 253. f lb. , p. 255. * Prose Work vol. ii. , p. 81 . Philadelphia , 184* . Essays , p. 14 . Now we bring up these two cases , not so much for the purpose of justifying either Bacon or Milton , as of showing the singular pliancy and versatility of Mr. Macaulay 's lo*ic . Can it be believed that a man who was governed by firm principle , and was not in some degree the servant of occasion , would so contradict himself on a mere change of persons . Mr. Macaulay can not well deny that the execution of Essex was lawful , while that of Charles was in utter violation of law . Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could he not add that the execution of the earl , whether just or not , and whatever may be thought of the part Bacon took in his trial , was done , and could not be recalled ; and it could not be very criminal in a minister of state to endeavor to prevent the evils likely to arise from the ignorance and anger of the people ? Why should he brand the act of Bacon as an effort to murder the fame of one who had already expiated his offenses , and yet praise the act of Milton as the endeavor of a patriot to appease " the ravings of servility and superstition ? " As to these two vindications , we confess our judgment of the writers would depend a good deal on wheth*r they told the truth ; whether in the pursuit of good ends , or ends which they may have thought to be good , they were careful to use none but just and honorable means ; though we are apt to question the virtue of a purpose that requires or prompts the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehend the issue would not be much to the disadvantage of Bacon . But the darkest passage in Bacon 's life , as we think , and as Mr. Macaulay thinks , is that involved in the charge of bribery and corruptiop , whick brought on his fall . Nor do we suppose any full justification of him in this matter can be fairly made out ; but we see no reason why the illustrious sufferer should not have the benefit of counsel in procuring a mitigation of the penalty ; and that , as well in respect of his character when dead , as of his person while living . Now it is quite notorious and unquestionable , that for chancellors to receive presents , both from suitors in chancery and from other persons , was customary and common in Bacon 's time , and had been so for a hundred years , both 516 // in England and in other European states . And indeed Mr. Macaulay allows this : That these practices were common , we admit . But they were common , just as all wickedness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be commoa . They were common , just as theft , cheating , perjury. , adultery , have always been common . " * But , surely , this is a very disingenuous and unbecoming piece of chicanery . For , if such things as theft , perjury and adultery were common , they were also uniformly regarded , and , when known and proved , punished as crimes ; whereas the receiving of presents was not only common , but was so far from being looked upon as criminal or disreputable , that men of great general integrity and esteem were known to practice it ; concealment was scarce attempted : nor does Mr. Macaulay produce , or so much as pretend , a single instance before Bacon wherein , common as was the practice , chancellor or other minister suffered loss of place or reputation under such a charge : only he asserts in general terms that the practice , though common , " was in the highest degree odious " To make good which assertion he cites a passage from honest " father Latimer , " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse of what it is cited for . The good bishop says : " Nowadays they call them gentle rewards . Let them leave their coloring , and call them by their Christian name , bribes . " Why this should be quoted to prove that the practice " was in the highest degree odious , " is not a little strange ; the passage naturally inferring , what is known well enough from other sources , that the thing had grown so common as to be caressed under an euphuism . The bishop evidently saw with sorrow that a bad custom had become respectable ; and he deserves credit for boldly endeavoring to remove it ; but there is no evidence that his labor was at all successful . On the contrary , the practice seems to have continued and even increased down to the time of Bacon ; the continual plundering of the Church stimulating the passion for wealth and expense much faster than the Reformation quickened the sensibility of virtue and honor . * Essays , p. 267 . VOL . III . 1*O . V. K*W SERIES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public morals , but not any peculiar guilt in one who did not rise above that standard . Undoubtedly it was " a custom more honored in the breach than in the observance ; " yet those who complied with it are fairly entitled to all the mitigation that custom ordinarily brings . Nor does there appear any reason to doubt the truth of Bacon 's words to Buckingham : " Howsoever Ii have acknowledged the sentence just , and for reformation fit , I have been the justest chancellor that hath been in the five changes since my father 's time . " It is true that Sir Thomas More in the reign of Henry VIII. , and Sir Augustine Nicholls in the reign of James I. , had the virtue to refuse such presents as Bacon and many others accepted . Yet the fact of presents being offered without offense to men of such clean hands and pure hearts , shows how general the custom was , and how far from being in the highest degree odious . Doubtless these righteous men should be mentioned with special honor for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not follow that one should be branded with infamy for not being an exception to the general rule , when these exceptio*is were so rare and so distinguished . It is pretty well known that upon taking the Seals Bacon relinquished a salary of ? 7,600 a year for one of only about ? 919 , which was quite inadequate to his reasonable expenses , and was probably left so small in the expectation that it would be made up by the presents of those whom he served . For the practice in question seems to have grown up in part through default of sufficient public remuneration to official persons ; so that there was some ground for regarding stich presents rather as fees than as bribes . Moreover , it is not denied that of the twenty-two instances charged upon Bacon , in the greater number the presents were received long after the causes were ended ; in some they were received before judgment was given indeed , but then the decisions were against the donors ; and in others they were openly and publicly made . All which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sufferer 's no less pathetic than penitent 34 // words : " For the briberies and gifts wherewith I am charged , when the book of hearts is laid open , I hope I shall not be found to have the troubled fountain of a corrupt heart , in a depraved habit of taking rewards to pervert justice ; howsoever I may be frail , and partake of the abuses of the times . " To get over the cases wherein Bacon had given judgment against the donors , Mr. Macaulay resorts to the presumption that he had received still larger gifts from the other side . Which surely evinces rather the desire of an advocate to carry his cause , than the solicitude of a judge to decide fairly according to the facts before him . It is needless to dwell on the insecurity of the best man 's reputation , if this method is to be followed . But this proceeding becomes doubly offensive when we remember ( what Mr. Macaulay doubtless knew ; or , if he did not , then his ignorance only aggravates his presumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up matter against this great man ; insomuch that he complained : " But Job himself , or whosoever was the justest judge , by such bunting for matters against him as bath been used against me , may for a time seem foul ; especially in a time when greatness is the mark , and accusation is the game . " Now Bacon 's enemies were so straitened for matter against him , that they saw fit to include things in which Mr. Macaulay admits " there was no gross impropriety . " Yet the donors against whom Bacon had decided were at their service , and were openly interested in the prosecution ; and of course they could not be ignorant who were on that other side from which still larger gifts had probably been received : nor is is easy to see how anything but a very ungenerous wish to make guilt where it was hardly to be found could suppose that in so great a scarcity of matter so sure and obvious a clue to other matter would have been left unemployed . But the unhandsomest thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , is his urging against Bacon the relinquishing his defense and the sending in his " humble submission " instead thereof ; when it is notorious that he did this at the positive command of the king and the urgent solicitation of the favorite . The constrained and reluctant giving up of his cause Mr. Macaulay resolutely attributes to consciousness of guilt and despair of success ; and that , too , in the face ( or was it in ignorance ? ) of his express declaration : " The law of Nature teaches me to speak in my own defense . With respect to this charge of bribery I am as innocent as any born upon St Innocent 's day . I never had bribe or reward in my eye or thought when pronouncing sentence or order . If , however , it is absolutely necessary , the king 's will shall be obeyed . " Nor can Bacon 's compliance be fairly attributed to peculiar " meanness of spirit , " considering the general obsequiousness and servility of the time , as was often shown by the Commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation . The truth seems to be , that in the case of Bacon , as bath often happened in other cases , the accumulated faults of the office were visited on the individual incumbent . He had done far more official work than any former chancellor in the same space of time ; nobody pretends that he had ever failed to do his ifork well ; and his labors were rewarded , as eminent services are often *rewarded in this world , with official disgrace and death ; and that , too , for abuses which he certainly did not cause and probably could not cure . Nor , perhaps , could they have been effectually cured but by the destruction of the very man who was least guilty of them , and at the same time the greatest that had complied with them : by such a sacrifice they might indeed become so unspeakably odious , that even the worst men would take care to shun them . At the advice of Bacon himself was called together the parliament that crushed him . The parliament was hot and stout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maladministration of the state . But they were more just in their anger than discriminating as to its objects . They demanded victims , and were more concerned for the greatness than for the guilt of the persons sacrificed . Bacon , probably by his virtue , had already Qffended the favorite and through him had lost his former hold on the king . In some respects he would be a most acceptable sacrifice ; for , whether guilty or not , the 518 May , // very height whereon he stood would make his fall the more exemplary . There were enough that wanted the place , and to cover their own ambitioa they could easily pretend his corruption . Besides , if parliament could not get the chancellor , they might entertain the thought of striking higher . And , indeed , the king and Buckingham seem to have been apprehensive that Bacon might triumph , should he proceed in his own defense , ( for who but an angel or a brute could be expected to resist so potent an enchanter , coming to the rescue of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sharpened by defeat , might turn to other objects and demand a dearer sacrifice . At all events , " a sop for Cerberus " was indispensable . " Whether the tyranny be in his place , Or in his eminence that fills it up , I staocrer in . But this new governor Awakes me all the enrolled penalties , Which have , like unscoured armor , hung by the wall So long , that nineteen zodiacs have gone ron nd , And none of them been worn ; and , for a name , Now puts the drowsy and neglected act Freshly on me : - tis surely for a name . " Xothing can be more unfair than to attribute the crushing of Bacon to any peculiar hatred of bribery ; it sprung rather from the general and just resentment of the nation at the tyranny and rapacity of the government ; a resentment that was right in striking , but wrong in the place where it struck . It is remarkable that some have argued the guilt of Bacon mainly from the fact of his being condemned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which nobody thinks of defending , and of which Hallam says : " There is surely no instance in the annals of our own , and hardly of any civilized country , where a trifling offense , if it were one , has been visited with such outrageous cruelty . " * The case was this : one Floyd , a Catholic barrister , in speaking of the titular king and queen of Bohemia , who were Protestants , had expressed his satisfaction " that goodman Palsgrave and goodwife Palsgrave " had * Constitutional History , p. 208 . Harpers. been driven from Prague . For which offense he was adjudged to be degraded from his gentility , and held an infamous person ; to be pilloried four times for the space of two hours each time ; to ride once from the Fleet to Cheapside and once to Westminster on horseback , with his face to the horse*s tail ; to be branded in the forehead with the letter K ; to be whipped at the cart 's tail from the Fleet to Westminster Hall ; to pay a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps this act of the parliament may serve to remind some people of the proceedings of the Star-chamber a few years afterwards . Are we to regard the punishment of Bacon and of Floyd as any just argument or measure of their guilt ? The king endeavored to arrest the proceeding against Floyd ; for parliament had not the lensV show of right to meddle in the matter at all ; but his endeavors ended in greati*xr augmenting the severity of their sentence . Such was the scrupulous justice of parliament in those times Such , then , are our views of this great man 's character ; and whatever may be thought of them , we are confident they have not been taken up without a pretty reasonable examination . The truth is , we can think of no uninspired man to whom all men of ' the present age are so much indebted ; and it seems as if we had rather ungenerously endeavored to indemnify ourselves for his acknowledged greatness by exaggerating his faults . Moreover , we are one of " the next ages " to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for one , we are unwilling to withhold the " charitable speeches " which he trusted to receive . It is surely for our interest to do justice to his fame . Yet , with all the mitigation which the circumstances appeamo warrant , we conceive there is still room for no little blame . We have spoken of Mr. Macaulay 's censure as being excessive ; rather , he makes out an excess of matter whereon to ground it . For our readers err , if they suppose , that because we think Bacon far less criminal than Mr. Macaulay represents him , we therefore incline to blame him less than he does . For nothing is // more certain than that men often overstate the criminality of others for the very reason that they do not feel it , their exaggerations springing from dullness , not from quickness of moral sensibility . Hence their censure is just as disproportionate to the charges they make , as those charges are to the facts upon which they are based . And in reading Mr. Macaulay , one is often struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accusation ; except where he finds something he can call bigotry or superstition ; then , indeed , the inadequacy is all the other way . Thus in the article before us he spares no pains to multiply and magnify Bacon 's offenses ; he allows no mitigation , no relief , and even browbeats those who presume to urge it ; yet he at last assures us that after all Bacon was not a bad man . Wherein we agree with him ; but we could by no means say so , if we thought Bacon to be what he represents him , an ingrate , a sycophant , a taker of bribes , and " the most obstinate champion of the foulest abuses . " Near the opening of this article , he says : " The genius of Sallust is still with us ; but the unfortunate husbands who caught him in their houses at unseasonable hours are forgotten ; " and , surely , one who can thus jest and trifle with the crime of adultery , can hardly be expected to feel a genuine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his moral caricaturing of Bacon and others should probably be looked upon as a matter of rhetoric merely , not of virtue . But the practical mischief of such things is , that they minister to license , not to edification . Nor does he enact the advocate less in respect of Bacon 's philosophy than of his character . Intellectually , indeed , it is not easy to set Bacon too high ; but it is easy to set him higher than to be well supported by so narrow a basis as Mr. Macaulay assigns him . We may , and perhaps we should believe him wiser than those who wrote before him , but not if , to make room for his wisdom , we must conclude all his predecessors fools . He presented , certainly , a most rare and wonderful union of confidence and modesty ; to a faith that would believe anything he joined a scepticism that sifted everything most severely ; and , though well assured of his ability to teach great lessons to mankind , no man ever had an eye and ear more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too elevated and comprehensive not to recognize much that was true and good in the speculations of other men ; and what he so recognized he had the intellectual rectitude to employ perhaps the . more willingly and prize the more highly , because it was not his own ; and he was far too wise a man , his mind was far too calm and clear and serene not to know that if he was to see farther and better than others had done , it must be by standing upon their shoulders , not by crushing them out of the way . We will venture to say that no candid , fair-minded reader of his works would ever suspect him of anything like such a contempt of former writings and writers as Mr. Macaulay attributes to him ; there is nothing in his pages smacking in the least degree of the critic 's modest assurance , ( who can read such a passage without indignation and shame ? ) that " words , and mere words , and nothing but words , had . been all the fruit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty generations . " * Whatever may have been Bacon 's faults , he had none of that mean ambition which has sometimes endeavosed to put out the lights of others kindling , to create an artificial darkness for the better exhibiting of its own . This article has already grown beyond the limits we had prescribed ourselves . Of course therefore we can not think of entering now upon the subject of Bacon 's philosophy , which would require an article by itself , and that , too , " unmixed with baser matter . " We shall hope to present our views of it at some future time ; and we are the more moved to such an undertaking , forasmuch as we believe many have been prejudided against Bacon 's writings , and kept away from them by Mr. Macaulay 's representations of them ; while if any have been drawn to them by that representation , they could hardly have failed to be disgusted at finding , as they must have found , how different those writings are from what they had been led to expect ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relish Bacon as he is , and Bacon as Mr. Macaulay represents him . // We have barely time at present to indicate the general scope and spirit of Mr. Macaulay 's discourse on this subject , and to add two or three passages from Bacon , which may serve to put our readers as their guard , and perhaps induce them to seek their knowledge of Bacon in Bacon himself , or at least elsewhere than in Mr. Macaulay 's statements concerning him . The drift of those statements is fairly exemplified in the foiloxving passage : " Wh*t , then , was the end which Bacon proposed to himself ? It was , to use his own emphatic expression , fruit . ' It was the multiplying of human enjoyments and the mitigating of human sufferings . It was the relief of man 's estate . ' " * And the whole article shows that by " fruit " and " the relief of man 's estate , " the critic understands nothing more or less than what is usually meant by utilitarianism , that is , mere material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bacon 's philosophy , as almost every page of his writings will show , than it would be to represent Nature as designed only for a cornfield , and adapted only to the nourishing and sustaining of our bodies , leaving out all her nobler adaptations to the unfolding , upbuilding and furnishing of the mind and soul of man . The producing of " fruit , " the ministering to human wants and comforts , was indeed one of the ends , but it was by no means the only or even the primary end , " which Bacon proposed to himself ; " as may he seen in the very sentence from which one of the above quotations is taken . Speaking of various errors in philosophy he says : " But the greatest error of all the rest , is the mistaking or misplacing of the last or furthest end of knowledge : for men have entered into a desire of learning and knowledge , sometimes upon a natural curiosity and inquisitive appetite ; sometimes to entertain their minds with variety and delight ; sometimes for ornament and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit and contradiction ; and most times for lucre and profession : and seldom sincerely to give a true account of their gift of reason , to the benefit arid use of men : as if there were sought in knowledge a couch , whereupon to rest a searching and restless spirit ; or a terrasse for a wandering and variable mind to walk up and down with a fair prospect ; or a tower of state for a proud mind to raise itself upon ; or a fort or commanding ground for strife and contention ; or a shop , for profit or sale ; and not a rich storehouse , for the glory of the Creator , and the relief of man 's estate . " * And the same ideas run all through his works from the first page to the last . Thus in the Essay " Of Truth , " he says : " Yet truth , which only doth judge itself , teacheth that the enquiry of truth , which is the love-making , or wooing of it , the knowledge of truth , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , which is the enjoyment of it , is the sovereign good of human nature . T lie first creature of God , in the works of the days , was the light of sense ; the last was the light of reason ; and his Sabbath work ever since , is the illumination of his Spirit . First , he breathed light upon the face of matter , or chaos ; then he breathed light into the face of man ; and still he hmeatheth and inspireth light into the face of his chosen Certainly , it is heaven upon earth , to have a man 's mind move in charity , rest in providence , and turn upon the poles of truth . " Again , in the preface to Novum Organum : " We would in general admonish all to consider the true ends of knowledge , and not to seek it for the gratification of their minds , or for disputation , or that they may despise others , or for emolument , or fame , or power , or such low objects , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would perfect and regulate it by charity . For from the desire of power the angels fell , and men from that of knowledge ; but there is no excess in charity , and neither angel nor man was ever endangered by it . " Elsewhere he speaks of knowledge as " the food of the soul , " ( " pabulum animi " ) and of philosophy as having for one of its ends , " the purifying of the understanding , so as to fit it for the reception of truth ; " and , in short , if there be one subject on which he waxes more eloquent and enthusiastic than on any other , it is the worth of knowledge for its own sake , and for the beauty and * Essays , p. 271. * Advancement of Learning , Book I. 1849. 521 // qwq THE founders of our system did much more than they are apt to have credit for having done , in a policy of conservation lookin0 to the future . And as power in one form or another was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found upon examination , that to adjust the measure and distribute the jurisdiction of power ; to keep it from excess in every quarter and prevent abuses ; to stay its natural growth , control its tendencies , and provide antidotes for the poison of its temptations , was the main drift of that policy . A government may be too strong or too weak ; may have too much power in it or too little . Here was a problem to begin with . In the early State constitutions it is remarkable that with few exceptions the measure of power allotted to rulers was nowhere specijied . Not even words of grant were used in most cases ; much less words of definition . The fathers simply said , let there be such and such departments , with such and such officers in each , and there they stopped . The rest was to be settled by implication -- common law impliccelion . And upon second thought , what better could they do ? Those governments were pure republics . There had been no such governments before . It was impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance , statute fashion , the precise modicum of power that would be certainly enough in every instance , and as certainly not more than enough , would have been alike gratuitous and empirical , when the common law presented a so much safer alternative . Legislation and the common law are very different things . That goes before events , while this applies its judgments to them in the detail of their occurrence . Legislation is conjectural often , and shoots wide of the mark ; the common law acts only upon evidence , and seldom fails of arriving at just conclusions . But when at length the particular State organizations were to be combined in a larger economy for nntional purposes , the question of official endowment became more embarrassing , forasmuch as the agencies now to be instituted were confined and special in their objects , and could only be invested with their needed authority by a sort of cession from the pre-existing governments , or from the people in derogation of those governments . A compromise was necessary . The States were as yet sovereign in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new government could be set up Qver them without a consequent reduction of their power and dignity , the enterprise*had some vanities and jealousies to contend with , and instead of being left as before to common-law adjustments , must depend in great measure upon exact verbal provisions . The result might have been guessed beforehand . The first experiment was a complete failure . The thing was gone about too timidly , ( too grud*ingly perhaps , ) in the very point of ceded power . There was not power enough given to the new economy to keep it alive . The preexistence of the local *ganizations may or may not explain the fact . At any rate , it was a severe tax upon the magnanimity of the States , to be called upon to curtail their own consequence by contributing to the erection of a government , which must necessarily overshadow them in certain respects . Whether from this cause or from sheer misjudgment in apportioning means to ends , the important fact is , that they went no further for the time than to sign " articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the instrument was accordingly termed " a confederacy , " while the second paragraph led 39 // off with these ominous words , " each Stale relents its sovereignty . " Well , as sovereignty , taken absolutely , is a whole of political power ; if the States kept all , the Union of course got nothing ; and so it proved . The new government ( such by courtesy of speech ) was too weakly constituted to be good for anything . The men appointed to administer it , tried to get on by overstepping their authority . That could not save the system . Nothing could save it or make it worth saving . And good reason : it was a confederacy , and not properly a government . It had no subjects . Can there be a government without subjects ? Are not the two ideas correlative , implying each other ? The federal Congress were to do everything by requisitions on the local legislatures . To the people as individuals , they had no access . They did not represent the people . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect . The organic States were the parties they had to do with , the masters they served . They voted by States . They held office at the pleasure of the States , and were liable to be recalled by them at any time , or dictatorially instructed , like ambassadors . In short , their functions and whole character were rather diplomatic than governmental . Rulers they were not in any legitimate sense of the term . Fortunately , this poor contrivance of a confederacy , in lieu of a government , going very soon , as was meet , to its own place , a worthier effort of statesmanship was put forth , " a more perfect union " formed . The federal Constitution ( loosely , but conveniently so called , the word federal having come down to us in a modified sense , equivalent to general , national , central , as applied to that Constitution ) was truly a government , and consequently not a confederacy . Both it could not be . The union formed by it was a real , not a merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in a very altered position , and with a total loss of national power . Everything national was transferred to the new economy , and there consolidated . They very design of the arrangement was to substitute one government nationality for many . The State sovereignlies ( absolutely speakin0 ) were therefore at an end . rJ7he Constitution of l78* left us one mouth of communication with foreign countries , and no more ; one bend of counsel and of empire for purposes of general interest among ourselves . As to these objects , the States no longer existed . They retained , indeed , besides their organism , many important powers ; just as , while they were yet completely sovereign , important powers remained vested in the smaller corporations , the counties , cities , townships of their territories . But as those corporations were voiceless in the halls of the State legislatures , so were the States to be voiceless for the future in the councils of the nation . Nor was the union of county with county more perfect , nor the individuality of their corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government as to general State affairs , than the union of the States is perfect and their separate individuality melted down to a mass , in the one subsisting sovereignty of the federal government as to all concerns of a strictly national character . The two cases are precisely parallel . And this parallel may be run yet further . That we are one nation , and have but one government , so far as the union of the Sthtes is thus consolidated , no man , who has not a supposed interest of his own to serve by contradiction , will deny . The framework is complex , but the political entity is single . And here the question arises as to what we are in other respects ; that is to say , whether we have properly one government or thirty , as regards those points of jurisdiction which have not been made over to the central economy , but are left where they were of old ( under the confederacy ) for local management . The answer would , of cot*se depend upon the bearing in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the local jurisdictions , we naturally say there are thirty governments . And indeed , for special county purposes , township purposes , city and village purposes , there are as many governments as there are political corporations for conducting the detailed business of the people 's affairs . But instead of looking microscopically inwards , let us turn our eyes upon the circumference of things , and contemplate the broad area of the country as a whole . Can we say in that view , that we have a score and 40 July , // ten governments for ends of internal administration ; or is it better theory to say , the government is one even for those ends , the States being thus far unconsolidated p*trIs of the union system , just as the union corporations , as to what concerns their special walks of privilege and power , are unconsolidated parts of the States ? Surely there ought to be no controversy on this point . Does the discretion vested in a board of supervisors make them a government , absolutely speaking , apart from the constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Because that constitution recognizes the organic arrangements of the counties as auxiliary to its own design ; wheels within wheels of its own mechanism indeed , though not apparently connected with its larger and more conspicuous movements . The states and the counties are one . They do not exercise identically one authority in the matter of direct administration , but there is a perfect harmony of action between them , a perfect coincidence of aims , so far as the county policy goes , although the State looks further , and with a wider field of vision . So in the economy of the federal system ; the States , even as regards their reserved powers , are but a sort of counties on a vast scale of magnitude , holding these powers in subordination to the general scope and purpose of the union government , as designing the welfare of the republic at large , and thus of all the states , counties , townships in particular , that compose it . The States are recognized by that government as standing in this relation to it . Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not . It was never intended to merge them altogether . Far from it . Their nationality , and the powers it especially rested on , were merged . But there was infinite moment in preserving their home agency untouched . This agency was wanted for conservative purposes . That was one great object . It was wanted also for the direct convenience and utility of its application to the details of administrative business throughout the country . The framers of the system looked to these details ; and what so hopeful a provision could they make for having them everywhere duly dispatched , as by leaving the State organizations , already in charge of that duty , to continue their functions ? The jurisdiction of the States , in all matters of domestic concern to their inhabitants , was accordingly preserved under the new order of things , and has ever been regarded as an essential feature of that order . It may be from a va6ue misconception of this circumstance that some wellmeaning persons have allowed themselves to be imposed upon by the pretense , which men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country is still what it was at first , " a confederacy . " They seem to think that because the State organisms are not laid aside , it is plausible to regard the States as only brought into joint action in the federal system . And they employ a language corresponding with this error . Have they considered how far the argument wonld carry them ? Would not the very same kind of logic make each particular State by itself a confederacy ? nay , each county , too ? For not only the organisms of the counties are preserved entire in the State systems , but those of the townships also have an integrity and a life of their own in the county systems . Besides , how can the notion of " a confederacy " be indulged in reference to the general government , without the companion whim of a parcel of independent State sovereigntics figuring as high contracting parties to he league ? Accordingly , this whim is rife in certain places , and heads of senatorial dignity are turned with it . The position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase . A position depending mainly , I should think , upon the analogy of that proverb of municipal heraldry , " Once an alderman , always such . " " *Ours , " they say , " is a confederacy of sovereign States ! " As lately as last winter , in a grave written address of certain members of Congress to the good people of the South upon a peculiarly Southern topic , * it was called " a government in which not individuals , but Stales , as distinct sovereignties , are the coastituents . " I do not ask , it would not be courteous to ask , after the health of these gentlemen 's understandings . We * Commonly called Air . Calhoun 's Address upon the subject of slavery extension . 1849. 41 // must take for granted that they are as usual in that respect . And they are serious , too ; they mean what they say . Let me appeal , however , from their reason as sectional politicians to their reason as men ; from their judgment as persons bred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their judgment as men of mind and character , on the indisputable facts of the case . If the States are sovereign , as they were at first , they can , of course , do the same things ; for sovereignty is power-national power . And so the question is , can they do the same things ? To give an instance or two : Can they make war , raise and support armies , equip and send out fleets ? Can they hold diplomatic relations , commission or receive ambassadors , negotiate treaties ? Can they coin money , emit bills of credit , or make their own scrip a lazrful tender for the payment of debts ? Can they regulate commerce , even among themselves ? Can they fix the terms on which a single foreigner shall be admitted to citizenship ? Can they exclude from that privilege a foreigner who has been admitted to it by Union laws ? All these ( to borrow a forensic term ) are droits of sovereignty , of nationality . Do the States possess them ? Is there a power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national and sovereign , of which the States can severally say , It is mine ? But , it seems , a thing may continue to subsist in gross , when all the ingredients necessary to compose it are gone . The sovereignty prattle is still heard , and in high places . There was a very singular specimen of it not long since at Washington . A venerable father from " the sunny South " rose suddenly to order in the federal Senate , because another senator had spoken of one of these territorial subgovernments with a less awful deference than was thought due to the majesty of " a sovereign State ! " Such was the precise form of this interposition . And what is alike creditable to the decorous manners and to the nerves of the honorable champion of the " distinct sovereignties , " he kept his countenance ! These gentlemen will have it , moreover , that the States ( and not the people ) are to he regarded as " the constituents " of the general government , and so the I ) arties represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , that the Constitution of 1 *87 was really the work of the States in their capacity of bodies politic . A proposition just as fair to nssert* as it would be to say that the present constitution of New York was formed by the counties of that State in a similar capacity ; but not nearly so fair or colorable as it would he to affirm that the counties , or yet smaller districts , of the several States of the Union were the constituent authorities from whence that Union arose , forasmuch as the final ratification of the union deed was there consummated . There is no limit to the extravagance of sectional politics . When men are already committed in character to the absurdity of " nullification , " upon principle , it might even he unkind to censure harshly their proceeding to other cognate absurdities , and thus relieving the pressure of one shame upon their minds by the concurrent pressure of several . Perhaps I judge them harshly ; but I confess I think there are some truths which no man is at liberty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the matter if he does . The federal system is a government , and not a confederacy or " league of friendship . " This is one of those truths . It is a government established by the people , as its own caption declares , and as the historical fact of its ultimate adoption shows conclusively . This is another . So far as the federal jurisdiction goes , it is supreme ; and , being supreme , it merges that of the States by a consolidated union , leaving them not only not sovereign as they were at first , but no longer capable of being parties to a confederacy , and for the very reasonthat their sovereignty , their nationality , their capacity of independent intercourse with the nations of the earth , and with each other even , is gone . This is a third truth , which no decent critic of our polity can expect indulgence for a cavil upon . Does not Blackstone tell us ( and we knew it just as well before ) that " the very notion " of a superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inferior ? * Apply this to the relation of the federal and State jurisdictions in regard to national affairs . Does it not show , * 1 B. C. , 244. 42 July , // titus far , a union of consolidation ? And a State which has not the larger and loftier kind of sovereignty that denotes relative independence is not a nation , not a sovereign State. * Courtesy of speech may keep up the flattery of an old title , but the language of facts and principles has no palaver . The only question that admits of debate in this connection , respects the powers reserved to the States for the management of their internal affairs . And here , undoubtedly , the government is one , not of consolidated union , but of combined agencies ; and these agencies are independent of each other , independent mainly of the central authority itself . The tree is now no longer a naked stem ; it is a trunk with many branches . As far as concerns the strictly national powers , it is still a homogeneous body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the territorial departments . These part off at the precise point where nationality ceases and home life begins . What they are good for , and to what end they are preserved and employed , is thus apparent . At the same time , the jurisdiction of the departments is mostly sovereign , for it is without appeal . But it is not of the kind regarded by writers upon public law as State sovereiqnty . All power without appeal is sovereign . The Common Council of New York have a large measure of such power , and it is as truly sovereign as any that the State government at Albany wields . In that case , as in this , there is no appeal , no higher jurisdiction to control or meddle . A board of supervisors has sovereign power ; a colonel of militia has it ; a parent has it . But to make a sovereign Sate , nationality , as well as sovereignty of power , is necessary . The government must have an external aspect ; it must look abroad as well as at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments . It requires an unstinted , unmeasured plenitude of national power to make a sovereign State . Admitting , therefore , that the States of the Republic had once this character , yet , if they lost it by the act of union , how are they now to be regarded as " constitcents " of the federal government ? - * Vattel , 16 , 32 , 234. how continue to suslaia a relation of paternity to a system of which they have become mere members for a subordinate purpose ? But there is another style of constituency that is also made much of in certain quarters . It is said the States are the true patrons of the general government , having , in one way or another , the appointment of its officers , who are thereupon claimed as virtual representatives of these sovereign bodies politic . And the colorable circumstance that federal senators are advanced to their places by the votes of the local legislatures , has led judicious minds into a partial acquiescence in these visionary conceits . Let us see where the truth lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not identically the States ; not a jot more so than the governors are , or even the judges . To see the States in their organic capacity , we must look at their entire organism-legislative , executive , j udicial . Do we see the whole government of the Union in Congress ? I-las the President no necessary part in that government ? It takes the complete agency corps of the Constitution to show the countrys corporate existence ; the complete forms of ordinary government proced re to utter its voice . So that an appointment by two legislative chambers is no more the act of an organic State than it would be if performed by one chamber , by the governor alone , or by the supreme court . But , in the second pl* ce , the power exercised in such an appointment is not State power . It has no natural connection with State officers of any name or grade . The agency is delegated by the federal Constitation. l7he States have it not in their own right . The people of the States , respectively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been called to witness the folly of an effort of the kind . As , therefore , it is neither the State governments , in their entirety , that make the appointments here referred to , nor State power that is exercised in making them , the States are in no respect the constituents even of federal senators , much less of other functionaries in the federal system , whose election is by other agencies , or by the people directly . 1849. 43 // I am well aware of the existence of a loose form of speech , used with much freedom by unthinking persons , and sometimes in accommodatioa to their uaderstandings , by men of eminence and distinction , to the effect that officers of government are the representatives of the districts or bodies in particular to which they owe their elevation . Thus , the city of New York is said to have so many representatives in Congress , and if one of them should die during his term , the city would , till a new election , be regarded as hut partially represented . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that unless we were represented in parliament , ( that is , had members of our own choice there , ) we could not be taxed by English law . General Hamilton himself , in the ninth " Federalist , " speaks of the States being allowed by the Constitution " a direct representation in the Senate " of the Union . Nay , we have similar language in yet higher records . " No State , " say the old articles of confederation , " shall be represented in Congress by less than two nor more than seven members . " This was in 1778 , when the States as such were truly represented by their delegates in Congress ; for as yet the representative character of federal officers was simply diplomatic , and had nothing to do with the people , which explains the casualty of General Hamilton 's writing in the manner above mentioned , that is , according to the idiom of the time , though in reference to the new Constitution which he was recommending for adoption , and of which one of the grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change in the principle of federal representation-making it popular , and putting an end entirely to its local bearing . Little wonder that an idiom thus honored should have been afterwards used , as it has from time to time been , in a way no longer strictly justified by facts ; as , for instance , in a constitutional amendment in Massachusetts , as late as 1837 , it is said , " any town having less than three hundred ratable polls shall be represented thus , " &amp;c. ; and again , in 1838 , it was declared in the present constitution of Pennsylvania , " that no new county should he entitled to a separate representation until , " &amp;c. ; as if towns and counties were ever the peculiar objects of representation to their own delegates in the State governments . I say this form of speech is historical . It began to be used before the federal Constitution was adopted , and the fact that it has been common since , is thus partially explained . But there is a further explanation . Every person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the man of his immediate constituents . They feel as if they had a kind of special property in him ; and as delegates and representatives are mere synonyms in vulgar parlance , the delegate of a county is the county representative , and the senators sent to Congress by the legislature of a State are regarded and currently spoken of as State senators . The ordinary meaning of such expressions is true ; for the refined and important principle of government representation is no part of that meaning ; nor is the principle in question probably understood with any approach to accuracy by one in twenty of the prattlers who thus seem to talk about it , while in fact they only talk about their delegate , their memher , and the like , by way of personal designation . Be this , however , as it may , the officers , whether of the Union or the States , represent , in philosophical truth of relationship , just those for whom they act . A forei *n envoy represents his government ; not the President and Senate who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a diplomatic representative . A member of Congress represents the people ; not this or that petty district , or State legislature , hut the people at large . This is government - representation ; a novelty of modern times , of which the ancients had no adequate c6nception . May our own country grow in knowledge on the sub-ject ! Unfortunately , words without knowledge are too rife among us . The miserable quillet of State constituency is an instance . And this is only one of a sisterhood of quillets which it seems the license of a certain style of political harlotry can never let alone . The doctrine of " confederacy , " the doctrine of " distinct socereignties , " the doctrine that the States are " the constituents " of all things , the doctrine of " the right of instruction " for 44 July , // invading the liberty of public men , the doctrine of free sectional arbitrament as to the obliqation of federal laws-all these are children of one family and go together ; and the seeming design of the encouragement bestowed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its authority contemptible , so that when the day of secession comes , it may neither he a task nor a crime to cut loose from it . 1 trust it has been made sufficiently evident that these wild thoughts are groundless . But even though it were admitted that the general government is of State origin , and has also its living organization from the same source , how could it follow from such premises that the officers of that government represent the States , or are in any way amenable to their visitation and control ? Try it . The actual frame of the government is a given fact . Is any such prerogative of visitation reserved by it to the local jurisdictions ? No pretense of that . What matters it then to the question in hand , whether this given fact is of one origin or another , or whether the functionaries it provides for are appointed by legislative houses , by district voting , or by general ticket ? Can the essential import of the fact be made dependent on these formal circumstances ? One thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , it was at least made for them ; they are in every view the intended beneficiaries of the system . No man doubts it . Of course the relation of duty and responsibility into which the administrators of the government are brought by their official trust , is a relation of duty and responsibility to the people only . The States , as such , have no concern in it ; and if this be so , the inference is inevitable that those administrators represent the people , and them only . Duty and representation are always of one bearing , and go hand-in-hand . There can be no exception to the rule . Whon* , for all beneficial purposes , does every private trustee represent ? And whether his duty have been cast upon him by the net of a living grantor , by a dead man s will , by a surrogate 's letter , or the decretal order of an equity court , is nothing to the purpose . He represents , beneficially , the parties he acts for , and it is exclusively to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account . It is true , our federal senators have their appointments from the State legislatures . But they are not the servants of those legislatures , any more than members of the lower house of Congress are servants of the particular local districts that elect them . The rule of service and of representation is not settled by forms of constituency ; it has absolutely nothing to do with them . Members of Congress have as broad a field of duty as the chief magistrate himself ; their representative character is as large as his . How belittling to hold them up as tools of the particular district electors . On that principle , the federal judges would be tools of the President and Senate ; federal senators tools , not of the States , but of their respective legislative houses ; and even the President , instead of serving and representing a great people , would be a servant of servants , the creature and the slave of a packed electoral board , themselves in turn creatures and slaves of territorial electors . Forms of appointment vary continually all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them ? * Sometimes the immediate " constituents " are the people ; sometimes the two houses of a legislature ; sometimes one house , on the nomination of another ; sometimes one or both , upon the governor 's nomination ; sometimes the governor and a special council ; sometimes he alone . Does the representative weathercock play in all these winds ? It is both natural and fit that federal officers , coming from particular places , whose interests they are well acquainted with , should keep those interests in mind , and act as conduits of intelligence to convey the knowledge of them , as occasion calls , to the council-hoard of national deliberation and business . This is the way to put every subject in full light before the government , and thus to secure the benefit of a rule of representation that binds all the great agencies of public life to labor for the country as a whole , and as a whole to treat its parts according to their relative value in the general scale . Partiality , whether personal or territorial , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the proprietaries of the sys 1849. 45 // tern . The people at large are its visitors . I conclude , finally , that the results of the argument may be recapitulated thus 1 . That the polity instituted by the transaction of 87 was a true government , having direct coercive authorit over in dividuals. y 2 . That the powers of this government were chiefly of the kind called national , and the Constitution was , in that respect , a consolidated union of the particular States . 3 . That as to matters of local policy and order , the separate organism of the States was fully preserved and adopted , with their appropriate powers and laws , unqualified , untouched , save in a few particulars of necessary limitation . 4 . That alike in the federal and State economies , though various modes of appointment were resorted to for filling different offices , the trusts of those offices were entirely popular , the rule of representation and accountability entirely popular . Thus the broad outline structure of the government is fairly before us ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and constitutional energy to fulfil the hopes of its founders and the country , returns upon our notice . Of the entire system , federal and local combined , it must be safe to say , that it had power enough for every purpose , since the Union and the States together formed a perfect nation , both for outward and internal action , to the last tittle of national competency . And after sixty years of trial , no discovery has been made of anything desirable to be done by public authority , which there has not been public authority somewhere adequate to do . But when we come to look at the relation of the head government to the members , and to weigh the central against the scattered powers of the system , the subject takes a delicate aspect and is harder to deal with . Nor is it important to attempt exactness here , forasmuch as the numerous innovations that have been already made in the State constitutions under the question of the original sufficiency or insufficiency of federal strength as compared with those constitutions , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the general and special economies changes of course with every change made in either . That they were well balanced at the first is highly probable . But how they might have worked together under that arrangement , had it been left undisturbed , is now an inscrutable problem . In fact the subject here resolves itself into a new topic , and we pass insensibly from the quantum to the jurisdictional distribution of government power ; a topic of great magnitude , but fortunately involving small difference of opinion among intelligent men , and therefore easily dispatched . This distribution , as made by our primary lawgivers ( and still substantially adhered to by the country ) was partly functionary , partly territorial . In point of function it divided power into three branches ; leyislalire , politicalexecuuire and judicial ; each to be kept as distinctly vested as possible from the rest . The early State constitutions insisted greatly on this ; a great deal more than had been done before in any known government economy . The principle was important as inducing a very useful division of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative point of view , to keep power advised of its own legitimate pnthxvay , to facilitate the popular inspection of it , to keep it from accumulating unduly in particular hands , to check it , guard it , hem it in , and make the manoeuvres of ambition different . The legislature were neither to interpret nor enforce the laws ; the President , neither to make nor interpret them ; the judges , to interpret only , and apply . And what , in this respect , the federal government was in large portrait , the State o*overnments were the same in miniature . Power was to be separated everywhere into its elements ; thus avoiding the dangerous ferment of compounded masses . In legislation , it is true , a qualified veto was reserved to the chief magistrate , not that he might mix himself up at pleasure with the business of the legislative houses ; not that he might undertake to forestall their action by lecturing messages , and then send every bill back that did not suit his fancy or his partisan feelings . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was only to be used upon occasions equally 46 July , // extraordinary . Necessity must constrain the use of it ; or otherwise it must lie dormant as the crown veto has done in England for the last hundred years and more . And though , in reference to the treaty laws and relations of the country , the federal President and Senate are placed in a peculiar attitude , which seems in one view inconsistent with the general jurisdictional policy of the system , there are reasons that at once explain the anomaly , and show it to be harmless . The President is the organ of communication with foreign governments , and is always to be regarded as best informed of what is proper to be done with them . This explains the anomaly of his participation in the treaty-making power . And then the foreign bearing of that power places it beyond the verge of ordinary ambition , and shows his concern in it to be one from which there is consequently nothing to fear . Territorial jurisdiction is the next relief principle that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded and confused central authority . It is a kind of safety-valve to the federal boiler ; a thing not new in our system , but made use of in it to an extent of which there is no other known example ; nor can the advantages of the principle , applied as we apply it , be easily overrated . It is undoubtedly to us a life principle . Other countries know nothing practically of its American utility . England has her shires and townships , but no larger subdivisions . And being territorially a small country , the arrangement may be adequate to her occasions , especially as her government , from its very nature , can bear , and probably requires , a more centralizing tendency of things than would be safe with us . Our policy is different . We are jealous of centralized power . " Divide and conquer , " is a good military maxim . " Divide and render harmless , " is a fair version of it in this connection . To the small districts common to us and England for the dispatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name elsewhere equivalent to nations - covering areas , in. our case , over which national sovereigns might be proud to reign . These States , indeed , are vested with immense masses of sovereign power in the way of local jurisdictions ; superintending the minor corporations of the counties , townships , cities , villages , within their respective horders , and administrating other and larger interests of untold variety that want aids beyond the ability of those corporations to furnish . With the number thirty for a multiplier , and the entire business of a State for the multiplicand , we might contrive to form an estimate of the relief afforded by all our local jurisdictions to the head government of the country . Without some regular process of inquiry the thing is inconceivable . And let it be borne in mind , business done is an exponent of power ; and in proportion as that is drawn off from the centre so is this , and with it the food that ambition feeds upon , or at least hungers after and is stimulated by . The federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own peculiar affairs , that concern the nation at large . For petty demagogues , instead of one centre of gathering we have thirty . And these wretched creatures are near enough to the people to be seen and watched ; while the more dangerous sharks of deep water can also be the better observed , even at the distance of Washington , from the cir'cumstance that the small fry are scattered , and the monsters show at full length . At any rate , the distribution of power and business here referred to is real ; and it constitutes one of the most remarkable , most characteristic , most momentous features of our general framework . The relative dignity of the State governments , as compared with the Union , is an idle question , which some political idlers have occasionally mooted . A contest of pride , between the human body and its members were about as reasonable . But the difference of scope and office between the federal and state systems is too plain to go unnoticed . Let not the truth of the matter of fact be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms a sovereign State ; it has national power . This is no longer predicable of the local organizations . The officers of that government act for and represent the whole people of the republic ; while those of the State systems serve and 1849. 47 // represent the people of their respective States ody . The laws of the two economies differ in like manner . They differ also an settled declarative rank ; for the Constitution , treaties and statutes of the United States are , upon the very highest evidence , the supreme laws of the land . In which respect the laws of the States must be subordinate . Mr. Jefferson regarded the States themselves ns " subordinate governments , " and so called them. * I am not in the habit of consulting this gentle man 's political philosophy , but his views upon the present point are too distinctly stated in some of his letters to leave me an apology for passing them by entirely . " We should marshal our government , " he says in one of these letters , " into 1st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 2d , that of the States , for what relates to its own citizens e clusirely ; 3d , the county republics , for the duties and concerns of the counties ; and 4th , the ward republics , for the small and yet numerous and interesting concerns of the neighborhood . " * According to him , the question of subordination is quite unembarrassed . Let the Stutes enjoy their powers to the uttermost ; but let not their politicians be foolish on the subject . A good deal depends upon the rule of construction to be applied to the special grants of power by which the officers of the federal economy have been endowed . Some will have it that they must be taken strictly . This , however , is a comparatively modern notion , and of party origin . The founders and their immediate successors thought otherwise . It is true , the powers not granted are retained by the people . And there needed no record of the fact to show it . But how does that affect the meaning of the actual grants ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than a fair liberal criticism would assign to them ? Is it because the people are the grantors ? Nay , but for whose benefit ? Admit the people have raised the trusts of all federal officers ; have they not done it for their own advantage ex elusively ? And so to every beneficial purpose , they are grantees also . Arid then the supposed reason , on the one hand , for interpreting their grants with rigor , is counterbalanced by a reason of equal force on the other , for a liberal and generous construction of them , to the end that the people 's settlement thus made upon themselves , ( the language is professional but descriptive and true , ) may not be disappointed . The principle is one of equitable common law . And it is the principle which ought to govern in the case . Take an instance ; us whether the general government , under a power granted in broad terms for regulating commerce , can by implication set up a banking institution . A very rigid construction might bar the means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I one implies the power of the means for the end 's sake . And so of other particulars . Ought not powers granted by the people in trust for a service of their own interests , to be made the most of that the terms of grant allow , for the advancement of those interests ? Common sense answers yes . The common law answers yes . And this , in the pure virgin period of our politics , was the acknowledged rule of the government . In a word , the government was then regarded not only as a whole with separately organized parts , but a whole of which the general and particular economies were in harmony with each other ; being alike popular in design , alike entitled to respect and favor in the construction of the powers assigned to them . The days of feud in the political family of head and members , had not yet come ; the days of stinting rigor tox*ards the powers of the head , and of comparative indulgence to those of the members , were not foreseen , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited in extent , because the interior administration of the country was in great measure withheld from it ; and so was the jurisdiction of the States limited , because the entirety of " foreign and federal " affairs ( to use a phrase of Mr. Jefferson 's ) was placed beyond its reach ; but neither the one jurisdiction nor the other was the less esteemed for its limit 's sake , nor were these urn-48 July , * 2 Writ . 442. j . I have lost my reference for this passage , and have not the book at hand . The words are taken from the published writings of Mr. Jefferson . // its straitened at all , on either band , by narrow-minded jealousy or fear . Everywhere the object in view was public , popular , beneficial . Everywhere the rule of interpretation was liberalized by that object . As , therefore , the agencies of public life were not to be throttled , in order to keeping them out of mischief , we may now advance a step further and inquire as to the measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we approach those smaller details of the system which , however material to the plan and policy of its founders , and however anxiously ndjusted by them in the first instance , have either been looked upon by later lawgivers as too insignificant for a question , when the spirit of meddling was abroad , or too clearly amiss to leave that spirit unprovoked ; for they have been the chief subject of what are termed our modern constitutional reforms . They belong mainly , it will be seen , to the state economies , ( of which at the time the Union was formed there were thirteen , ) and relate , first , to the character and circumstances by which it was supposed that candidates for office ought to be distinguished secondly , to the mode of appointment deemed most likely to secure a fair result ; thirdly , to the qualifications of electors where the election was popular ; fourthly , to the term and tenure of office when attained ; and lastly , to some further means of safety , calculated either to fortify the personal virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust , or to guard against evil from his misconduct in it . Two of the primary States ( Connecticut and Rhode Island ) having continued to act under their colonial charter until long after the final settlement of our national polity , the evidence of what the sentiment of the country was in general , upon matters of conservative policy such as are here referred to , must be taken from the early constitutions of the other eleven . 1 . I begin with the conditions of eligibility to the higher stations of the State governments as shown by that evidence . The first regular constitution of New Hampshire , ( adopted in 1783 , ) required that the governor , to be properly eligible as such , should be an inhabitant of seven years ' standing , possessed of an estate of ? 500 , half freehold , and a professor of the Protestant religion ; that senators ( who must be thirty years of age ) should also be inhabitants of seven years ' standing , have freeholds of ? 200 value , and be of the Protestant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislature , should be residents of two years ' standing , have property equal to ? 100 in value , half freehold , and profess the same religion . By the constitution of Massachusetts ( 1780 ) the governor was required to have a seven years ' residence , and a freehold of ? 1000 ; a senator 's residence must be five years at least , with a freehold of ? 300 , or a personal estate of ? 600 ; a representative in the Assembly , with one year 's residence , must have a freehold of ? 100 , or a ? 200 taxable estate of some kind ; and governor , senator , and representative must all make oath that they were believers in Christianity . The constitution of New York ( 1777 ) required the governor to be of three years residence , and " a wise and discreet freeholder ; " the senators were also to be " freeholders chosen out of the body of the freeholders . " Nothing special as to the other house . In Ne*w Jersey , by the constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislative Council " ) was to consist of persons who had been for one year residents , " and worth at least ? 1000 proclamation money ; " members of Assembly with the same length of residence , must be " worth ? 500 proclamation money . ' ' In Pennsylvania ( 1776 ) it was provided that members of Assembly should be men who had resided in their respective counties for two years , and that they should make oath to their belief in God 's government , and in the divine authenticity of the Holy Scriptures . No similar provision as to other branches of the government , and no property qualification beyond that of having paid taxes . There was , however , to be in this State a Council of Censors , chosen every seven years , to inquire whether the Constitution had been violated , and whether either the legislative or executive branch of the government bad been guilty of usurpation ; with power also , if need be , to call a convention for reform . // By the constitution of Delaware ( 1776 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both they and the governor ( indeed , all persons admitted to public trusts ) were to subscribe a profession of Christianity . The Maryland constitution ( 1770 ) provided " that a person of wisdom , experience , and virtue , should be chosen governor , " being twenty-five years of age , a resident of five years ' standing , " and having within the state real and personal property above the value of ? 5000 , whereof at least ? 1000 to be real estate . " It provided further , that senators must be twenty-five years of age , three years resident , and possessing " real and personal property above the value of ? 1000 ; while delegates to the other house of the legislature were to be twenty-one years of age , one year resident , and with property to the amount of ? 500 each . There was an executive council besides of " the most sensible , discreet , and experienced men , " twenty-five years old , three years resident , with freeholds of ? 1000 value ; and all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Virginia ( 1776 , ) the Senate were required to be " resident freeholders " of the district , and of the age of twenty-five years . The other house of the legislature must be freeholders of their respective counties . The constitution of North Carolina ( 1 ) 770 ) admitted none to be governor till he was thirty years old , five years resident , and had a freehold of ? 1000 value ; no one to be a senator without one year 's residence and ? 300 freehold ; nor any to be of the other house without a year 's residence and ? 100 freehold . In South Carolina ( 1778 ) the governor was required to be a resident of ten years ' standing , to have a freehold estate of ? 10,000 , clear of debt , and to be a Protestant Christian ; his council were to be of like estate and religion , with five years ' residence ; senators must have freeholds of the value of ? 2000 , with actual residence ; or , if non-residents , their freeholds must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians ; but it was enough for representatives in the Assembly , that they should he Protestants of three years ' residence . By the constitution of Georgia ( 1777 ) the governor was to have a residence of three years , and both houses of the legislature of at least one . The members of these houses were also required to be Protestant Christians , and owners of " two hundred and fifty acres of land " each , or property of some kind " to the amount of ? 250 . " Such were the views of the early patriots , as to the kind of men who were most likely to be fit for employments of the higher political grades . They did not think it safe to repose entirely on the unassisted discretion of the people in filling such employments . The people would of course mean well , but they might act without a proper knowledge of the persons they were voting for , or might be misled . It was therefore deemed necessary to draw a line enclosing all the ground of prudent suffrage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shutting out persons of immature age and inexperience , or who had not resided long enough in their respective neighborhoods to be generally known , or were destitute of the evidence that property gives , as well of personal virtue and intelligence , as of felt interest in the country 's welfare and prosperity . Governors and senators , it was considered , should he at least from twenty-five to thirty years old , and should have been for some years established in the districts were they were candidates , so that every elector might be acquainted with their merits or demerits . Nearly all the States thought it advisable that candidates for office should also give a pledge of Christian faith , to show yet farther that they were trustworthy . And in the whole extent of the Union there was hut a single State ( Pennsylvania ) that did not insist upon the se*urity of a property qual*fica1ion , before they would admit an individual of any name or character into the upper provinces of the public service . For even Connecticut and Rhode Island are understood to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that every governor , or every member of an executive council , was required in terms to he a man of property . These officers were in some cases appointed by the legislative houses ; and it was then deemed sufficient to confine the express provision , as to property qualifications , to 50 July , // those houses . In Pennsylvania , the profession of Christianity , with the Board of Censors , seems to have been taken as a substitute for everything else . 2 . Concerning the patronage of State appointment. , there has been from the first no difference of opinion in the country with regard to legislative agents . They have always been appointed by popular election . As to executive agents , ( in the political department as distinguished from that of the court. , ) there has not been the same unanimity ; but in early times the appointment was for the most part devolved upon the legislative houses . This was done in New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Delaware , Maryland , and several other States , under the primary constitutions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well filling of the executive chair , is perhaps doubtful ; but the people may think it a point of liberty to choose their own chief magistrate , as well as their law-makers , and no serious objection seems to be in the way . Next in order are the judges . Who shall appoint them ? The early constitutions say , not the people , but the more prominent ministers of the political government whom the people elect , that is , the governor and senate , or the two legislative houses , with or without the governor 's concurrence . In New Hampshire tIle two houses did it under the first organizing act of 1776 , and the governor and council under the constitution of 1783 . In Massachusetts it was done by the governor , " by and with the advice and consent " of the executive council . In New York there was a special council of four senators , for the sole purpose of exercising the appointing power , and judicial appointments were made by the governor , " by and with their advice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judges ; in Pennsylvania , the governor and council ; in Delaware , the governor and assembly ; in Maryland , the governor and council ; in Virginia , the two houses on joint ballot ; in North Carolina , the same ; in South Carolina , the same ; in Georgia , as I apprehend , ( though the constitution is not explicit , ) the same . Thus the notion of an election of judges by the people was unheard of . Judicial qualifications were peculiar . The people VOL . IV . NO . I. NEW SERIES . could form no just conception of them . At tke same time the judicial office was not political in the vulgar sense of the term , and there was nothing to fear from it in the way of political mischief . Sufficient reasons , one would think , for placing so important a trust of patronage in the hands best capable of discharging it well . In like manner the great mass of inferior civil offices were also left by the people to be filled by persons in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorneys general , solicitors general , surveyors general , secretaries , treasurers , controllers , surrogates , justices of the peace , sheriffs , coroners , and a fry of others , all had their appointments at second-hand , from public agents of the people . It saved the people trouble , and it promoted their interests , without a particle of danger to liberty in any quarter . At any rate , such was the policy of those times . Indeed , not only ci* il functionaries were appointed in this manner , but general and field officers of militia likewise . The truth is , liberty has no concern in the matter , beyond the choice of tho two legislative houses . To control the head is to control the body . Enough for the people at all events , to have both the legislature and the chief executive directly dependent on their votes . 3 . But who of the great popular mass were to be personally the electors of the chief magistrate and the legislature for all could not be indiscriminately admitted to that porilous function . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some would sell their totes , and some their country , if they could . Voting is an intelligent act , or ought to be ; and it is a most responsible moral act . Observe , it is of no value by itself to the performer . It givee him no pleasure ; is not of the nature of property ; labor can not take it for wages ; hunger can not feed upon it ; wealth can not lay it up in store * " En Virginie , " says an old writer In a book of " Researches " , that lately fell under my observation , " le peuple ne sest pas r6serv* d'autre election que celle du corps l*gislatif ; car ii est persuade , et ja croie avec raison , que la masse des habitans d'un grand *tat ne peut connaitre le m*rite particulier des personnes les plus propres * remplir lee fonctions des differentes charges . " 4 51 // houses for future use . It is a naked act , which nothing but a constitution of government can put in any man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from thence but upon a trust that does not permit it to rest in the receiver as his own . He is , therefore , a trusted aqent in th ' * ' whole matter . He fills an office , which his country honors him with , not for his beneflt in particular , but for hers in qeneral . So that claims to the franchise are quite out of the question . And the pretense , so often and so childishly uttered during the progress of our history , that such and such a man was entitled to be a voter , or that he ought in justice to be one , though not legally qualified , is strangely futile . Well , then , the fathers had a right to do as in their judgment the well-being of the country required . And acting on this principle , they gave the franchise of the polls , not to everybody , nor to the half or even a fourth part , of the popular multitude , but only to persons answering particular description , which it was hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of society , while it would shut out persons of a less enlightened or less reliable character . There was some vanity in the arrangements of the different States upon the subject . They were uniform in principle , however , with not more than one exception that I know of , in a point of consequence . The age of competency for voting was fixed at twenty-one years . Not that younger persons might not often be possessed of the requisite knowledge and judgment for the purpose , hut because the majority of minors would not be likely to possess them , and a general rule was necessary . The condition of a short local residence was imposed , say from six to twelve months . Not that persons from beyond the county line would in all cases be deficient in intelligence and trustworthiness for the duty , but because it was thought best in general that they should know and be known in the neighborhood . And what is more remarkable , there was a further condition added , to the effect that every elector must have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must lie within the county where he used his privilege ) in the shape of property . Generally speaking , this stake must be a freehold , though the alternation of personal estate was deemed admissible in some places . With the single exception , I believe , of Pennsylvania , the whole Union was of one mind as to this characteristic circumstance , of holding a property qualification indispensable . Even Rhode Island and Connecticut , under their colonial charters , concurred in it . The amounts specified were different in different places , and each State had its own form of words to express the intent . I have not the New Hampshire constitution of Vi ' 83 now before me . In Massachusetts , the rule was , " a freehold estate within the commonwealth , of the annual income of three pounds , or any estate of the value of sixty pounds . " In New York , it was " a freehold of the value of twenty pounds within the county , " or a leasehold " of the yearly value of forty shillings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and actually paid taxes to the State . " In New Jersey , " fifty pounds proclamation money " was to be the measure of competency . In Pennsylvania , to have paid taxes was enough , " provi'ded always that the sons of freeholders should be allowed to vote , although they had not paid taxes . " This was shaving close . By the constitution of Maryland it was declared , " that every man having property in , a common interest with , and attachment to , the community , ought to have a right of suffrage ; " which right was thereupon given to actual residents , " having freeholds of five acres of land " in their respective counties , or possessing " property in the state above the value of thirty pounds , " connected with a county residence " of one whole year next preceding the election " in which they might claim a suffrage . Virginia is understood to have agreed in practice with the other States , but the constitution merely says the right of suffrage is " to remain as at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing the particulars . In North Carolina , the vote for senators depended on " a freehold of fifty acres of land , " while as to members of the other house no similar nile existed . In South Carolina , " every 52 July , // free white man , who acknowledged the being of a God , and be1ieved in a future state of rewards and punishments , " and who also " had a freehold of at least fifty acres of land , or a town lot , and had been been legally seised and possessed of the same for six months previous to the election " when he claimed his franchise , " or had paid a tax the preceding year , or was taxable the present year , at least six months previous to such election , in a sum equal to the tax on fifty acres of land , " was held a duly qualified elector . And in Georgia , a man was such an elector , who was of lawful age and had resided six months in the State , provided he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds value , and liable to pay tax in the State , or was of any mechanic trade . " Such are all the facts of the case in this aspect of it . Not only therefore was it deemed expedient to have men of property to represent the people of the States in their local governments , but even the electoral franchise was regarded unsafe in the hands of any but citizens of some little substance . And though the rule of looking to property qualifications for the safe vesting of this franchise , must of course have often shut out wise and meritorious persons from the trust it involved , that evil was supposed to be doubly compensated by the concurrent good , of excluding a much greater number of dependent , vagrant , profligate individuals along with them . So at any rate the fathers judged ; and the matter was all important . Beyond a question , the character of our electorships is vital to the country 's hopes . There may be other things that are thus vital ; this is not the less so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Because they have not the material for sound electorships . The grand secret lies here . And will it be doubted that there was in the early population of this country a very considerable mixture of corrupt ingredients ? or that electoral corruption was as dangerous in America as elsewhere ? What alternative then but to vest the sovereignty of the polls in the hands of the better sort if possible ? I stay not now to vindicate the means employed for the purpose ; but was not the purpose right ? Nay more , was not the means , however unreasonable in the eyes of later politicians , effectual to a good degree in matter of historical fact ? 4 . The terms and tenures of official life , as settled by the first lawgivers , come next before us . It will be sufficient for the object in view , to consider the subject in the three instances of governors , senators , and judges . Members of the lower house of the legislature hold almost universally for a single year only . By the first regular constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be chosen annually , but judges were to hold their offices " during good behavior. ** In Massachusetts , just the same . In New York , the *overnor 's term wa* fixed at three years , that of senators at four , and the judicial tenure was by good behavior , determinable at the age of sixty years . In New Jersey , the governor and senate were to be annually chosen , and the term of the judges was to seven years . In Pennsylvania , the governor 's term was one year , senators were to hold for three years , and judges for seven . In Delaware , the governor 's term was three years , that of senators three , and that of the judges during good behavior . In Maryland , the governor held for one year only , senators for five , and judges ( as also the attorney general ) during good behavior . In Virginia , the governor was chosen for three years , the senate for one , and judges held for life or good behavior . In North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year only , those of the judges during good behavior . In South Carolina , the governor and both houses of the legislature were appointed biennially , the judges during good behavior . By the Georgia constitution , the governor and senate were to hold for " one year , but the tenure of the judicial office was not specified in that instrument . In brief , three governors held for three years each , one for two , and the rest fo'r one ; there was one senatorial term of five years , one of four , two of three , one of two , and six of but one ; and of the eleven regularly formed States , eight put their judges upon a tenure of good behavior , two g*ive them terms of seven years , and as to the remaining one , the constitution is inexplicit . So that we may fairly say the sentiment of the cotwtry was divided between one and 1849. 53 // three years as regarded the proper term for a chief magistrate , between one and five years for the senatorial offic. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of life terms , with a tenure of good behavior. o . There is scarce room for further particulars of the conservative policy of the fathers , in regard to public power and the dangers attending it . I will barely touch upon a few . And first , religion  --  the pure principles of evangelical Christianity ; of which near all the primary States made striking recognition , and even insisted upon it , as a condition of eligibility to office , that their servants in political life should do the same . The people required that evidence , along with others , that the men they voted for were honest and would be faithful . Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , Delaware , Maryland , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Georgia , seven States of the regularly con*tituted eleven , were imperative in this , and others went close to the mark . Sects and establishments were out of the question . Christianity in general , the religion of the country 's morals , was the thing they wanted . The only doubt is , whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Again , it was specially inserted in numbers of those early constitutions , that persons selected to administer the government , must be " wise , virtuous , discreet " men , " mcii of erperience , " the best that could be found . The same object was in view here as before . And two things are , I think , implied : one , that of all safeguard . against abuse , the solid worth of those who were to have the power of committing it , was most to be relied on ; the other , that in taking such pains to bring men of great personal fitness and competency into public life , it was intended that they should use the power of their stations according to their own judgment and discretion , undisturbed from any quarter . Persons of such eminent qualities could not be wanted for electoral tools . Thirdly , various oaths were also required to be taken by the officers of government ; i*pecially , an c*th of fidelity and an oath of allegiance to the State . To which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only as to Great Britain , but as to " every other foreign power whatsoever , political or ecclesiastical . " I remark further , as not undeserving of notice , the negative fact that written bills of rights were not as common once as they are now . Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , Delaware , Maryland , and North Carolina ( five out of thirteen ) had them ; the other eight had them not , and yet contrived to get on as well as their neighbors , and to keep as clear probably of all manner of oppression . I mention also , in this connection , that momentous subject , the common law , the largest , most enduring , best bill of rights , that can possibly be imagined . It is the largest , because including all the rights that ever wore enumerated in a written document , and a great many more ; the most enduring , because incorporated with the intelligent moral sense of the people , and so living in their spiritual life ; the best , because the best known , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the readiest in practice . Would to heaven the people felt as they ought , the importance of the common law to their great interest , their liberty . Numbers of the primary constitutions put in strong language the right of all men to enjoy forever this portion of *their civil economy . There were no prejudices against it in those days . On the contrary , it and liberty were regarded as twin beings ; born together , bred together , and holding on their way together , in indissoluble fraternity . One other particular shall close the list . The amending of constitutions has become a vast business in our time . The fathers neither intended noi foresaw this . As to conventions for the purpose , only three of the States , Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , and Georgia , hinted at such a thing . Massachusetts , making a new experiment in the art of policy , thought prudent to say , " that the General Court which should be in A. D. P795 , should issue precepts " for taking the sense of the people " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And " if it should appear that two-thirds of the qualified voters throughout the State were in favor of such revision , " a convention might be called . In Pennsylvania , the strange topic of the Council of Censors seems to have suggested the thought of placing an equally 54 July , // strange power in their hands ; and they were thereupon authorized to call a convention , " if there should appear to them an absolute necessity of amending any article of the constitution , explaining such as might be thought not clearly expressed , or adding such as were necessary for the preservation of the rights and happiness of the people . " The language of the Georgia constitution was to the purpose that no change should be made therein , " without petitions from a majority of the counties , the petition from each county to be signed by a majority of the voters . " When all this should be done , a convention might be called . Let these three cases go for what they are worth ; and now for three more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaring that certain specified parts of is " ought never to be violated , " ( meaning altered , ) " on any pretense whatever , " added as follows : " No other part of this constitution shall be altered , changed , or diminished , without the consent of five parts in seven of the Assembly , and seven members of the Legislative Council . " In Maryland , it was decreed that there should be no change of the constitution , " unless a bill " for the purpose " should pass the General Assembly , and be published at least three months before a new election , and should be confirmed by the General Assembly after a new election of delegates , in the first session after such new election . " In South Carolina , it was resolved " that no part of the constitution should be altered without a notice of ninety days being previously given ; nor should any part of it be changed without the consent of a majority of the members of the Senate and House of Representatives . " Let these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining States have left us no record of what they thought upon the subject . I infer that , in their opinion , the less there was said about it the better . Such was doubtless the general tone of the public mind . There had been enough of revolution to make rest desirable ; enough of confusion and trouble to endear the prospect of repose . Such were the States at first . And now for a glance at their union , with reference to the period of its formation . At that period , the Mississippi was our western boundary ; the British provinces lay adjacent to us on the north , the Atlantic on the east , and we fell far short of the Gulf of Mexico on the south . So that as to territorial extent , the relation of a single State to the Union was according to the ratio of its own area to the contents of this outline . And I hold it demonstrable that , in fair construction , such relation was to be permanent . There was no power vested anywhere to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I shall not forget to speak of it hereafter . when I have more room and time . There were other relations springing out of that . Relative consequence was one . The States could not be enlarged . If , then , the Union might be , and this at the pleasure of its government , what was to protect the individual States from sinking , by and by , to comparative insignificance , while federal power would be growing to excess at their cost ? On the other hand , this power was in some respects dependent on State action . The personal organization of the federal system was placed completely at the mercy of the States in the matter of electorships . Had it been foreseen that the conservative views and measures of the early patriots , in this respect , were soon to be abandoned , and universal suffragu. introduced , it is not unlikely that precautions might have been taken to preserve that system in some measure from the consequences . But as things now stand , the State electorships determine everything . The head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the helm . In regard to patron*ge , the Union government was formed upon nearly one model with the primary States . The chief executive and lower house of Congress were to be elected by the people , and the Senate by the State legislatures . Most other officers were to be appointed by the President and Senate . So that the influence growing out of the patronage of appointments was fairly distributed between the federal and State governments , each taking share according to the extent and character of its dominion . The tenure of the judicial office , as it 55 // Sonnet. affects the general standing and reputation of the bench , affects also , incidentally , the consideration in which the State itself is held . And in this respect , again , the uniformity of the federal and State constitutions brought the national and local governments into circumstances of sympathy and common advantage . In short , except the question of the right of the head government to aggrandize itself by territorial acquisitions from July , abroad , I do not see that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the welfare of the States , as such . And although that question has had practice to give it countenance , I hope to show that it has countenance from nothing in the Constitution , so that the harmony of the federal and State systems was at first complete.
