txt THE system of common or free schools so generally prevalent in this country is mentioned with praise in all lands . It has conferred a most honorable distinction on that section of the American Union , where primary schools for the training of all the children and youth of the state , at the public expense , were first established , and where , from the first , they have been sustained with a constantly increasing interest in the popular mind . It is to the lasting honor of New England that along with so many of the elements of her most ancient institutions , infused into the national character , this principle especially of universal popular education , has already become a national sentiment . The fathers of New England were fortunate , not only in their efforts to found a new empire which should be the home of a free people , but they were fortunate also above all other founders of new states , that they apprehended clearly from the first , the grand features of a policy which must prevail , when their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new and noble empire , and designated the true methods of making that empire immortal . Fully aware that their systems of civil and church polity implied as an absolute condition of success , the existence of great " maturity of reason " and a high standard of public morality , they aimed both to instruct the people and the teachers of the people in the best manner possible . Thus would the commonwealth be furnished with wise counselors and the churches with learned pastors , and the people would be able to appreciate the instructions of their public teachers , and judge for themselves of the conduct of all their public servants . Their efforts grew out of their firm convictions that the truth for which they had suffered so much , and contended with so much success , would make free , even as they themselves were free , both their descendants and all who should embrace it . They were familiarly acquainted with all the forms and results of European civilization , and they were willing to abandon them in the hope of " a better country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old world , for their leading statesmen and pastors had enjoyed all the advantages of those seats of learning , and it was by means of the mental training // thus enjoyed , that their own views of civil polity and religious doctrine were formed , and they were thus enabled afterwards to establish , wisely and judiciously , the foundations of a new state . Knowing that they themselves must pass away , and leave to others their labors unfinished , they saw that their own great conceptions and their own far-sighted policy would be poorly transmitted to future ages by tradition . They knew the utter impossibility of maintaining a commonwealth after their model , if the people were ignorant or swayed by brute passion . Their rulers must he men of enlightened wisdom , while both the rulers and the people were to be alike submissive to the restraints of Christian morality . And therefore , as the author of the first written history of Harvard College has told us , " For some little while there were very hopeful effects of the pains taken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up some in their own private families for public services . But much of uncertainty and of inconveniency in this way was in that little time discovered ; and they soon determined that set schools are so necessary , there is no doing without them . Wherefore a college must now be thought upon  --  a college , the best thing New England ever thought upon . " Thus did they found their university , and every where in all the settlements , as soon as comfortable habitations had been provided for themselves , the house of public worship and the house for public instruction arose simultaneously , thus showing the inseparable connection in the minds of the earliest colonists between their religious and educational institutions and the life of their infant commonwealths . The system of popular education in New England , was one which was designed , not only to meet the * Mather 's Magnalia . Book 3. wants of the people in the first generations , but it was wisely adapted to all the changes of growth and progress from the feeblest beginnings to the full vigor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1647 , eleven years after the founding of Harvard College , and more than two hundred years ago , it was ordered , " to the end that Icarning may not be buried in the graves of the fathers , that every township , after the Lord hath increased them to the number of fifty households , shall appoint one to teach all children to read and write , and when any town shall increase to the number of one hundred families they shall set up a grammar school , the masters thereof being able to instruct youth so far as they may be fitted for the university . " The general outlines of this system , thus early completed , have remained to this day essentially unchanged . The division into three grades of schools , arose naturally from the wants of the community ; each claiming the popular sympathy and support according to their relative importance ; each contributing essentially to the efficiency of the entire system of public instruction . The fathers of New England paid but little regard to the forms of European society when they formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon most of the systems of church polity belonging to the old world . They thought the tn-fold distinction of orders and officers in the Christian church , though ancient , was yet unscriptural . They merged the titles and duties of bishop , presbyter and deacon into that of a pastor of a laity church . But in their system of public education , we find three grades of offices and three orders of teachers clearly developed . We think these distinctions will be likely to remain so long as the genuine Puritanism of New England continues in a thriving condition . // The New England system of ' popular education may well claim , therefore , the admiration of the world , as being the earliest ever devised , as well as one of the most successful . It is yet in the full vigor of youth , though it be among the oldest of our ancient institutions . It has contributed very much to make us what we are , as a free and mighty people . It is that on which we must still depend for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of popular instruction have been formed in other lands , and much has been said in praise of their success . They have been introduced into countries where the manners of the people and the whole social organization has differed entirely from our own . These efforts to elevate the condition of the lower classes in Europe , claim the respect and sympathy of America . Their systems of education should be mentioned to the lasting renown of the enlightened statesmen who formed and introduced them . In these days when the eyes of the world are watching with such interest the popular revolutions of Continental Europe , the influence and results of popular education should be noticed in those countries where so much has been done to disseminate elementary instruction during the last twenty years . They should be attentively examined by such as would seek to improve the schools of our own land . Whatever illustrates the philosophy of popular education ; whatever pertains to the best rnethods of teaching and school management ; whatever contributes to the elevation of teaching as a useful and honorable profession , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign land . As the Romans when masters of the world , hesitated not to imitate the arms of their vanquished foes wherein they surpassed their own , so should we never deem it dis honorable to adopt improvements , let them come from what source they may . At the same time let not a blind admiration of foreign systems of education cause us to forget that we have a system of our own , with features strongly marked as American ; a system long tried and successful . Especially should the aims and tendencies of the various systems be compared . The most complete educational processes applied under the most favorable circumstances , will not transform in a single generation , the manners and sentiments of an entire people into those of a people different in temperament and accomplishing a different destiny . The forms of government throughout Europe may be revolutionized ; the thrones of every monarch may share the fate of that of Louis Phillippe , but the French or German republican will not therefore resemble a citizen of the United States , save only in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly the foreign relations of a people but when an entire change is made in all the educational influences which form the character of the rising generation , then the very life of the nation is affected . The old nation dies and a new empire is born . In this transition period , therefore , when we know not what a day may bring forth as to the stability and character of the oldest and most influential European nations , it becomes us to watch with jealousy , the tendencies of these new movements on the character and fortunes of our own people . And when modes and systems of education are presented for our adoption , with the asurance that they have worked well in foreign countries , we should look at the ultimate designs of those systems where they originated , and ascertain whether they conflict with the great ends of the American system of popular education . Noth // ing marks the whole structure of American society more than the perfect supremacy of the principle of adaptation which is made the test of every thing which claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every proposed modification of the American system of education coming from a foreign land . Nor will this censorship , be it ever so rigidly applied , delay the progress of real improvement . It will not tend to lower at all the standard of attainments , or diminish the industrial activity of the pupils , in any of our literary institutions . In these respects our predecessors have never laid any claim to per . fection  --  and there is yet to be reached a limit riot discerned by our eyes in the progress of improvement . This fact , however , does not render it the less necessary to refer to the plans and search for the true aims of those who have gone before us . They have done that which entitles them to the gratitude of all their descendants . they have committed to us the completion of a work not yet accomplished though perfect in its design , like the building of the ancient cathedrals , needing generations and centuries even , yet perhaps , to complete the original plan . But do we not claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can we presume to speak with respect of the schools and modes of instruction belonging even to recent periods in our history ? It is thought proper to extol the virtues and wisdom of our fathers for what they did in the cause of civil liberty and religious freedom , but in all that pertains to the managements of schools and methods of teaching , the present age is so much in advance of former times that we may say " Let the dead past bury its dead . " We recur not to the past because we think the former days were better or equal to these in respect to the facilities or means of instruction . Every grade of schools in this country has exhibited most surprising marks of progress in all that pertains to the machinery of education . " it is wonderful , " said President Woolsey in his inaugural address , " what improvements have been made in collegiate instruction during the Inst twenty-nine years , " the period of his predecessor 's administration . The standard of attainments in the preparatory schools has advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now acquired at Andover and Exeter by candidates for the freshmen classes of Harvard and Yale , is greater than at the time of graduation at those colleges half a century since . And common schools in the days of the Revolution , in respect to external appearances , would compare with the same grade of schools in our times , much in the same way that the plain sideboard of General Washington compares with the princely furniture , which surrounds it in the East room of the President 's palace . If all the essential forms and institutions of society in the first days of the republic were simple and unobtrusive , and there was little to attract the attention of those accustomed to the conveniences and refinements of modern modes of life , still those times were adorned by the presence of shining virtues and noble men . The same facilities for instruction were not enjoyed , but the great end and aim of all learning was well understood by those who had the management of affairs in church and state . Whenever questions of political philosophy or theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more common than to refer to ancient usages and constitutions , not indeed for the purpose of imitating the external forms , now grown obsolete , but to search // for the elemental principles of truth which gave vitality to those forms , and still live in those that have superseded them . Can nothing be learned in the philosophy of popular education ,  - -  its proper uses and ends in such a country as this , from the study of a system as ancient as the settlement of the country ? Can not something be learned of the mutual relations of each grade of our schools to each other , and how they stand connected with the welfare and glory of the commonwealth , by the study of a system which dates back to Plymouth Rock for its origin , and which has been sustained ever since with unwavering constancy , with an ever growing interest ? It is very true that literary institutions of every grade in this country differ very much from the schools of Europe , even from those bearing the same name . It is doubtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities , will be established in this country , although there can be no doubt but that , in the mature ages of American civilization , there will he found on this soil , institutions of learning equal in respectability to those of the old world . The same will hold true of schools of lower grades . The conditions and circumstances of the pupils in different countries , will render necessary , different standards of attainmcnt , and call for various modes of teaching , and different modes of discipline . If this rule were observed when comparisons are instituted between the literary insUtutions of the old world and the new , there would be less of that wholesale disparagement of our higher schools we sometimes hear , because we have not as yet in this country a grade of institutions similar to the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge , and on the other hand , there would be less tendency to discard institutions properly and naturally Amencan . Let Paris rule , as hitherto , the fashions of the civilized world , if she must . Let her pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our republican tailors and mantua-makers tremble to disobey , but why must we follow the speculations of French republicans and socialists as genuine philosophy ? Why bow with so much reverence to theories of social and political life , whose " local habitation " is in the Cloud Land of German transcendentism ? The ready credence given to many loreign theories of education , and the earnest effort to realize them by introducing them into our institutions , at the same time discarding what is properly the growth of our own soil , proves any thing , but a free and independent spirit . The position we occupy , the destiny we are to accomplish , one would think , might teach us what a truly noble and proud people would not be slow to learn . While it is most evident that the facilities for gaining knowledge have greatly increased and important improvements have been made in the modes of imparting instruction , in all our schools of every grade , are we quite sure that an apprehension , clear and definite in proportion to these facilities and improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its relations to the public welfare ? It is no disparagement to modern improvements , to say that if our predecessors did not enjoy our advantages for acquiring learning , they did very clearly appreciate its prop . er and highest ends , and because their means were limited and the processes of acquisition more expensive and laborious , they might perhaps , for these reasons , be less liable to mistake the means for the ends of learning , and be less likely to suffer the show of mere knowledge to take the place of true intellectual culture . And , most certainly , it was because the relations of // learning to the wants of society in New England , were clearly seen , that even the scanty means of our fathers were so productive of useful results , and the schools which now might be called comparatively poor , were , to former generations , a priceless blessing . It is now often a theme for pleasantry , to hold up , for the amusement of the young , the rude rough apl ) aratus of education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recollection of the " oldest inhabitants , " and was entirely satisfactory to the scholars of those days because nothing better could be had . We meet these contrasts , not only in the lectures of common school agents , on the 1 ) est methods of constructing school-houses and ventilating school-rooms . The shades of President Stiles and the Dominie Sampsons of " sixty years since , " are not allowed to repose quietly on commencement festivals and College Alumni meetings . And if haifa century has wrought such changes , what shall be thought of the schools and teachers of still more primitive times ? History is not wholly silent respecting the schools and colleges of the first ages of New England . We have heard of Master Ezekiel Cheever , the " father of Connecticut schoolmasters , " who early settled in New Haven colony and died at the age of ninety-four , having been a " skillful , painful , and faithful schoolmaster for seventy years . " It seems that teaching was a regular profession in those days . Cheever was the author of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the first , so far as we know , among the New England schoolmasters , to write his own text-book of instruction ; thus early setting an example which many of the best teachers of our times seem ambitious to imitate . Cotton Mather has mentioned in his Magnalia , one Nathaniel Eaton , the teacher of the first grammar school in Cambridge , which , under his successor , President Dunster , was honored with the name of a college . Being somewhat avaricious and excessively severe in school discipline , and finally having apostatized from the Puritans and become an Episcopalian , Mather says , that " he was a blade who marvelously deceived the expectations of good men concerning him , and yet he was a rare scholar and made many more such , though they were taught in the school of Tyrannus . " It may perhaps be soberly thought by some that the schools and teachers of the first generations were of no real service . Placed by the side of the schools of this wonderful era , it may be asked , could such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have served any valuable ends ? Surely our " patent modes of teaching , " our beautiful apparatus and spacious school edifices , our textbooks of such rare excellence and in such numbers too , that a new work in every science is published once a quarter , must have all sprung at once from a perfect chaos of ignorance , and it can not be possible that this glorious era of light and knowledge which we witness , is in any way related to those barbarous ages . So far as regards the l ) resent condition or future glory of the American people , would it not have been about as well if Harvard and Yale had each been founded at least a century later in their respective commonwealths ? It does however appear to be a fact attested by veritable history , that New England , at least prior to the Revolution , was a land famous for its free schools , that at that time , the foundations of a great nation were laid by a people unsurpassed in the world for their general intelligence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our // boast , had existed . for generations , and had been sustained without the aid of boards of education or other useful agencies on which we depend for the advancement of learning . The Puritans did really more than devise an excellent theory of popular education . They transmitted to after ages more than the record of a well meant endeavor , although the fact , that they originated the conception and designated the method by which all the youth of the commonwealth might obtain the rudiments of an education , has gained for them the admiration of mankind . But they reduced their immortal conception to a historic reality . Not in some fancy model of a republic , but in their earliest constitutions we find this recognized as an elemental principle , that every person is born with the right of instruction , that if parents or guardidians fail to fulfill their own natural obligations in this matter , their children must be educated by the state . Nor did they stop here in their great endeavor to form a free and enlightened commonwealth . The common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of measures deemed by them essential . The entire system of education in New England was popular in all its parts . That system embraced the university and the college no less than the primary and grammar schools . This was the ancient theory . It ought to be the modern theory . A system with all its parts so vitally interwoven , should never be separated so as to leave the interests of the higher or lower grade of schools to the care and sympathies of different classes of the community . The higher can not dispense with the lower . The lower can never be so much improved as that the higher may be dispensed with . The college , therefore , must never forget or fail to fulfill its popular functions , nor should any theory of common school education be for a moment sanctioned , which excludes the principle of an intimate and vital relation of dependence upon the higher seminaries . We sometimes hear it said with apparent seriousness , that the common school is the " people 's college , " as though there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing but an abuse of language and the grossest error as to the true idea of a college . Still more frequently is the idea thrown out by Jacobinical editors and flippant demagogues , that colleges and higher seminaries exist for the benefit of a favored class , and are therefore aristocratic rather than popular in their uses and tendences . Incalculable mischief is the result of these most dangerous errors , for on the one hand , they tend to diminish the proper influence of the higher seminaries , to weaken the sympathy of the public mind in their prosperity , and create a prejudice against those who enjoy their advantages . On the other hand , they introduce the most extravagant notions and systems of popular education . Opinions are maintained by the professed advocates of universal education , utterly subversive of all the great ends for which our ancestors established their system of free schools . Until a recent period the true relation of dependence of the lower institutions upon the higher seminaries , was every where admitted , even in the popular mind . The fathers cherished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion to their means , with liberal contributions . On the other hand , there went forth from the universities and higher seminaries , the strongest impulses and influences in favor of popular education . If the mutual relations of the higher and lower seminaries be looked at historically , it will be found that progressive movements have begun in the higher and not in the lower seminaries . The elevation of the // standard of admission to the colleges has been followed by a corresponding advancement in the course of instruction in academies and high schools . Better furnished candidates being thus prepared for the learned professions and the business of teaching , a quickened activity is thus imparted to all the lower grades of schools in succession , and the sensibility of the popular mind is increased in favor of improvement and progress in everydepartment of the general system , so that no more safe or certain plan of elevating the condition of the primary schools could be devised , than to enlist a deep interest among the people in the prosperity of our colleges and higher seminaries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has hitherto prevailed . But unless we mistake , signs of a new order of things are manifest . It is becoming fashionable of late , to entrust some of the most important interests of the body politic , to the oversight of particular associations and agents . The idea seems to have been borrowed from the mode of conducting many of the moral and religious enterprises of the day . However efficient such an arrangement may be in enterprises where the business is chiefly executive and financial , we doubt the expediency of introducing the " division of labor " principle to advance the cause of education , by providing for one particular class of schools so exclusively* as to create a strong public impression which shall also be exclusive , and thus become prejudicial to another great interest . The members of the Boards of Education established in New England , are men high in the respect and confidence of the respective states to which they belong . They have devoted themselves to their patriotic work with great zeal and success . But their duty is limited to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented to the legislatures of their respective commonwealths , no information is given respecting the condition of academies or colleges . The state of New York furnishes an exception , the Regents of the University having under their supervision all the public literary institutions , which have received the patronage of the state . We think the tendency of the arrangement generally in use , is to lead the people to think that common schools alone can properly claim the sympathy and support of the commonwealth , and that the higher institutions must be sustained by individual munificence , though they confer on the whole population incalculable benefits . We believe our colleges will be sustained , and continue to pour forth blessings , though left to the support of the friends of liberal education . Still it is very obvious , that a large part of our population are indifferent to their prosperity , while by not a few they are regarded with jealousy and open hostility . The existence of these adverse popular prejudices , tends greatly to circumscribe the influence of those who receive the advantages of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great work they aim to do , and are doing . Most of the commonwealths of New England have long since withdrawn all patronage from colleges and academies . And where it is not altogether withheld , it is given as it were grudgingly , with extreme hesitancy , more from motives of partisan policy , than from any real interest felt in behalf *f those institutions , in the legislatures of the people . That state who rejoices in the appellation of " Mother of States , " makes her boast of her School Fund , which is indeed managed by a most prudent and discreet financier , and thus affords ample means to produce most meager results ; while Yale College , her richest , proudest ornament , has long // since ceased to look for legislative endowments , though resorted to as a National University by students from every state in the Union . Even Massachusetts has lost her ancient renown , gained by her early liberality to Harvard University . While we write , we are pained to learn that a most useful project designed to benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the legislature . It is said we must educate the children of the people in the schools of the people , as though the children of the people , and those too from whom the people have most to hope , do not find as ready admission to the higher as the lower seminaries , if they wish to enter ; as though the children of the people do not constitute the whole body of students in all our colleges and high schools . It is a most injurious aspersion , let who will utter it , that the advantages of our higher institutions are specially designed to favor particular classes or particular professions , or that the sons of the rich and honored in the world , in this way derive exclusive benefits and privileges , as is the case in some of the European universities . This assertion , which we often hear in some quarters , is the offspring of unpardonable ignorance , or else it is born of sheer malignity . So far is it from the truth , that our high schools and colleges tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion of the students in our most thriving institutions , are the sons not of the affluent , but of the honest poor : many of them indeed boasting of a parentage belonging to nature 's nobility , though unknown to fame . And if there can be found on earth a realization of that dream of politicians , a republic where there is a perfect equality of rights and privileges , and a perfect reciprocity of social sympathy and good fellowship , absolutely independent of the facti VOL VI . 41 tious distinctions which prevail else . where , that realization is a community of students in an American college . The patriotic motive is appealed to with the greatest success in the cause of common schools ; for the benefits of the primary schools are brought in a direct and tangible form to every man 's door . But because the advantages received by the community from the higher seminaries , are less easy to be apprehended by the popular mind , it does not follow on that account , that they are less real or less essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public safety requires that all the youth of the land shall he instructed in the rudiments of knowledge , is received as an axiom . Indeed it is strongly recommended by high public functionaries in the state of Massachusetts , to employ compulsory measures to force by fines and penalties the attendance of the children at the public schools . Whatever may be said of the expediency of such measures , the end aimed at is most important . But it is equally essential to the well being of the entire community of the very same persons benefitted by the primary school , that the seminaries shall be most efficiently sustained , which are to train up the public servants and teachers of the people . The impression is quite too common , that the advantages of a liberal education are rather individual than general , personal rather than popular . It is to be feared that even those who have enjoyed the advantages of the higher institutions , think too little of their universal relations , and too frequently embrace the popular error , that when young men resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatsoever is thus contributed to the glory of the state ) is to be regarded as an incidental good , and not as a leading aim of the higher seminaries . What is the ultimate design of // the higher institutions of learning , and what are their relations to the state ? The student may properly look at objects to be gained , which to him are purely personal . The parent and guardian will also be deeply interested in the same individual ends . But the teacher , the philanthropist , the statesman , will take their observations from a different stand-point . And both pupil and teacher , the natural guardians of the young and the public guardians of the state , will when the end of the college course of study and discipline has been reached , find that the greatest good of the individual coincides with that of the commonwealth . It is right that the student should regard as an end , whatever tends to fit him fur future service in the active professions . Let him explore the rich treasures of science . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style , in eloquence and in composition . Let him so far as possible be imbued with the true spirit of classic art , and learn to appreciate the inimitable conceptions and the immortal forms of classic beauty . And that he may be urged as much as possible to intellectual effort , let him be affected by the incentives of a generous ambition , which operate so powerfully and incessantly on college ground . These motives and methods of discipline , the ratio con. - formatioque doctrince of Cicero , must result in personal advantages to the student of the greatest value . The power of e*cient thought , the facility of appropriate expression is acquired . The mind is liberalized , in the sense of refining the taste by subjecting it to that high standard of criticism which is formed , not from the fancies of the passing times , nor from the bold and striking conceits of some wayward though leading mind , but from a standard of criticism , which is the resultant of the studies and mental training of successive generations of the best teachers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , in this way , becomes liberalized , in the sense of being set free from the dominion of wrong biases , from unfounded prejudices , from all the unreal phantoms , the idols , as Lord Bacon calls them , which forever beset uneducated or partially educated minds , and hold so many in hopeless bondage . There is also a benefit of incalculable advantage to the general interesis of society , arising from the cultivation of the liberal arts , whereby the boundaries of knowledge are enlarged , and discoveries are made of the greatest utility . But important as these benefits are to the student , when regarded as personal ends , yet by the university itself , and the state in which it exists , these ends become the means to an object greater than all , viz. , the true glory of the state and the progress of the immortal kingdom of God in the hearts of men . There is a higher interest connected with the universities of Oxford and Cambridge , than the tuition in the various departments of useful learning , received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college . England has a motive greater than that of conferring upon mankind those general benefits , which we and all who speak the English tongue enjoy , from having in enduring literature the works of her master minds , educated in those time-honored institutions . That great end to which we refer , is vital to the very existence of the British empire- It pertains to that which perpetuates the national life . It is that which tends to reproduce in the successive generations of the British race , those high characteristics and sentiments , that have made illustrious the British name . It is not in the halls of Westminster , nor at Windsor Castle , nor in the royal cabinets and armories of Tower Hill , but in the ancient universities , that the great heart of England beats . There in those // seats of learning , where are gathered the memories of her long line of illustrious scholars and statesmen-there where the proudest associations of national honor , are deepest felt by susceptible and generous minds-there where are kept the records of the national renown from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobility and gentlemen of England come to be educated . And because of the influences thus formed and the sentiments there inspired , there are produced elements of national strength and vitality of such importance , that Great Britain could better afford to lose all her military defenses , and every ship of that navy which has given her the dominion of the sea . We hardly need here remark , what " forces of strength " would accrue to these resources of national energy , if the tests were abolished which exclude dissenters from the English universities . In return for the privileges , which such men as Archbishop XVhateley , the late Dr. Arnold and others , have wished to be extended by the government to the non-Episcopal population , the state would receive a tribute of increased patriotic regard , richer far than the income derived from all foreign dependencies . Now have we the same element of strength , in the constitution of American society , which has been and will continue to be productive of general advantages , similar in kind to those received by England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system far better adapted to our need  --  a system equally efficient for good , and vitally connected with all the great interests entrusted to the guardianship of the state . Our higher seminaries were not founded to educate the sons of a legally recognized nobility , for none such have ever inhabited our soil ; nor even to educate the sons of gentlemen , in the old English sense of the word gentleman , for of that class few ever emigrated to New England ; since a gentleman , according to the old English notion , was " one whose rank made it unbecoming and degrading for him to labor , and whose estate rendered labor unnecessary . " But it was that the great body of the people might be ennobled by the possession , or by the influence of enlightened minds , that they might thus be raised to the dignity of gentlemen , in the better and modern sense of the term , " which embraces all the admirable and high moral traits of manhood . " It was that labor might be redeemed from degradation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destiny of labor as one of happiness and honor . From the earliest times , these great objects have been appreciated no where with more clearness , than in our higher seminaries of learning , and no instrumentality has been more efficient in promoting them . It was the training of the young men in the colleges of New England , and their influence in the community , that kept alive and caused to take deep root the germs of popular liberty , planted by the fathers , and which slowly and surely developing , were one day to ripen into fixed sentiments and written constitutions . The early teachers of New England did much to form a style of manners and modes of thought that should be American and not European . They did much to weaken the sentiment of foreign vassalage , and kindle a national spirit . They did much to imbue the popular mind , not so much with a feeling of loyalty for the king , as with a feeling of reverence for the authority of their own commonwealths ; and especially did they exert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not under Gothic arches , in temples consecrated after the manner of the Jewish or Papal ritual , but deep in the hearts of an intelligent and Christian people . // While we claim so much for the higher seminaries , as having exerted so important an influence in giving form and character to the institutions under which we now live , we do not forget that these most happy results could not have been accomplished without the constant codperation of the primary schools . We believe that the agency of the higher schools on the leading minds of the community was gi'eater in former days than at present , but at no period has any department of the system worked independently or otherwise than in entire harmony with the others . And in this respect there is a striking contrast between the workings of the Amensystem of education and that of any foreign land . For there is no intimate relation between the ancient public schools of England and the comparatively recent measures to educate in some degree the peasantry and operatives of the larger towns . The British empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by other means than by promoting popular education . It was enough that the sons of the nobility and gentry were educated in the best possible manner . The same will hold true in other countries where still more has been done and excellent schools exist for the benefit of the lower classes . But these model primary schools , as some are disposed to reg rd them , have no necessary connection with the gymnasium or the university . The normal system of state schools in Prussia , which has been conducted with such consummate ability and success , has specific piirp*se* to accomplish which would meet with no sympathy with the public sentiment in this country . We know not what may be the result of the great popular revolutions now in progress . One effect may be to modify essentially the ends of popular instruction which have hitherto prevailed . Some idea may be formed of the system from the recent work of Chevalier Bunsen on the " Constitution of the Church of the Future . " T'his author , lately one of the ministers of William Frederick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the seventeen thousand schoolmasters of Protestant Prussia are trained in the following manner for their profession. - After having been thoroughly educated until their fifteenth or sixteenth year in the higher schools where Latin and Greek are taught , they are then trained from two to three years in one of the twentyfour Protestant seminaries for the education of schoolmasters . They are then considered as connected with the ecclesiastical establishment of the kingdom , and hold their place of teacher as a national office each teacher , to use the exact language of Chevalier Bunsen , " holding a genuine churchmanly and national profession , being connected with the pastor of the parish in religious instruction , and sometimes in cases of necessity acting as his deputy in the performance of divine service , as far as this consists in preaching ; the schoolmaster in Prussia being in fact the minister 's deacon for the instruction of the rising generation . Here , then , we have , as it appears , a very substantial living branch of the real Diaconate in the apostolic sense , that is , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Such is the design of the normal school system of Prussia as developed by one of the court ministry , who speaks of it in terms of the highest praise . H calls it " an admirable system , having grown up in the church under the dictatorship of the state , and that in heavy and sorrowful times both for government and l ) eople , that is , from 1807 to 1815 . " Much has of late been said in favor of normal schools , and in several of the New England states // such institutions have been established . They are named after the Prussian model , and their general design is to train teachers for the primary schools . We conceive they can hardly resemble the Prussian normal schools in any other particulars , inasmuch as in order to be successful they must coincide in the main with the general features of the grammar school or academy , one great design of which has ever been to furnish teachers for the primary schools . If indeed the whole system of American popular education is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated from its ancient and natural alliance with the grammar school and college , and henceforth to claim popular sympathy as having popular aims , while the higher seminaries are to be left to the sympathies of their alumni as having other than popular aims , then indeed must there be a great deficiency in the proper means of common school instruction . But if there is to be , as formerly , a common aim and sympathy , then let it be regarded in time to come , as it ever has been , one of the legitimate purposes of the higher seminaries , of every grade , to provide suitable teachers for every grade of the lower . And if the business of teaching is to rank in usefulness with the so-called learned professions , let the present normal schools of New England be supplied with the most accomplished teachers , and let them be the resort not of those only who have completed the studies of the common school and the academy , but let the graduate of college also resort there , so that in this profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true philosophy of education , as well as the best methods of imparting instruction , may be examined by mature and disciplined minds . But when all is done that can be done for the elevation of the common school , ( and the work of improvement is yet in its early stages of progress , ) still we most earnestly protest against the assumption , that the common school in its most perfect state , will render the higher schools less important . There will then be a greater demand than ever for their controlling conservative influences . On this condition only is it possible that what is claimed for the common school , as a means of social elevation , as a safeguard of freedom , as the hope of coming ages , can be true . This sine qua non condition of their utility , we do not often hear mentioned in the projects of radical reformers and in the speeches of political demagogues , who seek for popular favor by promoting popular delusions . There is a light shining from the more abundant sources of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and time serving politicians find it agreeable for themselves to retire , and gladly would they keep others also from the light . This absolute condition of the highest success of primary schools , is sometimes lost sight of by those whose zeal in their defense is worthy of all commendation . Some appear to forget all other agencies of doing good , in their exclusive regard for one class of instrumentalities , to advance the cause of virtue and human happiness . Hence in teachers ' conventions , invidious comparisons are sometimes introduced as to the relative importance of the business of teaching and that of other professions . For our part , we would do honor to the faithful teacher in every grade and department of instruction . In New England the faithful , successful teacher has never failed to secure respect . And our belief is , that the commune yinculum which unites the aims and sympathies of all the learned professions with that of teaching , will be kept bright and burnished . We // have always admired the liberal spirit of Sir Thomas Browne , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " all the liberal profes. sions have their origin in a common design to remedy the woes occasioned to the human race by Adam 's fall . " Some appear to have a different opinion , and we have witnessed amusing devices to raise what is called the " dignity of the teacher 's profession , " from what is thought to be a position much too low in the public mind . If such a state of things exists proper remedies should be sought . We have no great objection if teachers ' conventions and associations pass resolutions of selfcommendation , though this process of acquiring " due dignity , " reminds us of the experiment sometimes made by boys , untaught in the natural laws of action and reaction , who try to elevate themselves to a more conspicuous position by means of their boot straps . Still we are inclined to think this method to win popular consideration , will not generally diminish the amount or the utility of the services of teachers , nor lessen the public appreciation of them . When however unfavorable comparisons are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are specially devoted to the cause of common school education , resort to the very old method of self-exaltation , that of pulling others down , they will do a greater injury to the higher institutions and eventually to themselves , from the fact , that their great services to the public being known and felt by all men , must give them an advantage in such a strife over those who are endeavoring to defend popular interests no less vital , though not so readily seen and estimated by the people according to their worth . And therefore it is that the friends of the higher institutions should earnestly protest against all such unwarrantable assumptions , and resist all popular tendencies calculated to diminish their popular influence . Let them speak freely not arrogantly , but without fear , not as those " having authority , " nor yet by dictation or permission " as the scribes . " But give us self-made men , it is said - Washington and Franklin never studied Greek or Latin , and some of the greatest men of this free country graduated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real foundation for the designation we often hear of a self-made class in the community , as though any man in such a country as ours could possibly arrive at an eminence truly respectable and honorable by any means in college or out , in an honest calling , except by efforts purely and personally his own-as though all young men who do not study what Washington and Franklin did not study , will therefore become Washingtons and Franklins . If there is one popular error more detrimental to the progress of learning in this country than any other , it is that which consists in not apprehending the true uses of classi* cal studies as a means of education . We think the impression is quite general , that there is no particular relation existing between the means of mental discipline furnished in the higher schools and those in the lower-that , therefore , the college studies do not directly prepare a teacher the better for service in an English school  --  and of course , progress in improvement in the lower schools does not consist in an approximation towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seminaries , at least so far as respects the study of the classics . It is not many years since it was a matter of serious discussion in some of the colleges , whether the classics should not be dispensed with as a part of a course of liberal education , and something more practical be substituted . The Faculty of Yale College thought it necessary to publish an // able defense of the ancient system . The question was soon decided , and it will not again be raised in any of the higher institutions , and we trust that in the exercise of their proper vocation they will , ere long , entirely correct the popular errors that prevail on this subject . The time is not distant , we trust , when that which is deemed essential , as a means of mental cultivation in college , will be regarded as equally useful , for all young persons who are desirous , as far as they can , to improve their minds by the best methods and the best studies . If the word practical means whatever is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school studies , means whatever affords discipline , information , refinement and pleasure to the mind , then is the study of the classics a proper means of education most practical and useful , for boys engaging in all sorts of professions and occupations , demanding mental discipline and cultivation . Classical studies are adapted to be elemental as well as complemental in a course of intellectual training . They are the best means to educate boys rapidly and thoroughly , while they are most admirable to instruct , refine and delight men . The study of language , ' ' says Dr. Arnold , " seems to me as if it was given for the very purpose of forming the human mind in youth ; and the Greek and Latin languages , in themselves so perfect , and at the same time freed from the insuperable difficulty which must attend any attempt to teach boys philology through the medium of their mother tongue , seem the very instruments by which this is to be effected . " " The study of Latin and Greek is important , as a school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well that language in which we commonly think and speak and write . It does this because Greek and Latin are specimens at once highly perfect and incapable of being understood without long and minute attention . The study of them , therefore , naturally involves that of the general principles of grammar ; while their peculiar excellences illustrate the points which render language clear and forcible and beautiful . But our application of this general jmnowledge must naturally be to our Iangnage ; to show us what are its peculiarities , what its beauties , what its defects  --  to teach us by the patterns or analogies offered by other languages , how the effect which we admire in them may be produced with a somewhat different instrument . Every lesson in Latin or Greek may and ought to be made a lesson in English . The translation of every sentence is properly an exercise in extemporaneous English composition , a problem how to express , with equal brevity , clearness and force in our own langunge , the thought which the original author has so admirably expressed in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rugby , showing the connection there is between the study of the classics and that branch of study which forms so important a part of common school education . We mean English grammar , including composition , which is too generally neg. lected in the primary schools in thin country . We do not think it would be wise for the pupils generally to study Latin in our common schools . The course of study in the primary schools should , in the main , be confined to the rudiments of an English education . Still the advantages of instruction in the classics should be enjoyed by as many of the youth of the land as possible . Such a course would be far preferable to that which is becoming fashionable , to devote very much of the time for the education of young men for agricultural and mercantile pursuits , to the study of elementary treatises on the natural sciencesmost of which , as means of mental // discipline , are no better than a newspaper . It is deemed of the greatest importance that teachers of common schools shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but how long will it be before the work of improvement will have advanced so far as that every teacher of a New England common school shall be required , not to teach , but to be himself taught in Latin and Greek , as an essential preliminary to engage in his profession , according to that excellent feature of the normal school system in Prussia , which has been so highly extolled , and which requires of every candidate for admission to the teachers ' seminaries that he be instructed in Latin and Greek . And yet the comparatively few classical teachers in this country are deprived of that popular sympathy which the masters of the English schools enjoy in full measure , because the mutual relations of the two departments of instruction are not seen , or because the utility of the classics is feebly or not at all apprehended . They are called upon to answer the questions , who are benefitted by your teachings , save as they may be useful as school drillings ? and how can the writings of a remote age , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world in the living , active present ? Let the teacher of iRughy reply , than whom no man of our times has lived with aims more intensely practical . " The mind of the Greek and the iRoman is , in all the essential points of its constitution , our own-and not only so , but it is our own mind developed to an extraordinary degree of perfection . Wide as is the difference between us with respect to those physical instruments which minister to our uses or our pleasures , though the Greeks and the Romans had no steam engines , no printing presses , no mariner 's compass , no telescopes , no microscopes , no gunpowder , yet in our moral and political views , in those matters which must determine human character , there is a perfect resemblance in these respects-Aristotle and Plato and Cicero and Tacitus are most untruly called ancient writers-they are virtually our own coutrymen and contemporaries , their conclusions bear on our own circumstances , their information has all the charm of novelty , and all the value of a mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science of the nature of civilized man-they l ) elong really to a modern civilization like our own ; with a perfect abstraction from particular party names , which so much bias our judgment in modern and domestic instances , they discuss and illustrate the principles of all political questions , both civil and ecclesiastical , with entire freedom , with the most attractive eloquence , and with the profbundest wisdom . " There is one more mutual relation of the higher and lower seminaries of learning , to which we will but briefly allude , though in importance , it may exceed all others mentioned . We refer to the common interest they have in relation to correct principles of moral discipline . The modes of moral discipline may , by reason of circu*stances , vary in different grades of schools , and even in different schools of the same grade . But there can be but one correct system of moral discipline , the same in all the circumstances of childhood or manhood . The authority of law must be respected , there must be a willing obedience to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must suffer , so that , at all events , the law shall be honored , and , if possible , that he may be led to reformation . As childhood is the proper season to implant the principle of obedience and a relish for it to continue through the whole period of parental // authority , so is the moral discipline of the common school related intimately to that of the academy and the college , the general duty of obedience and sentiments of respect which pupils owe to their instructors being the same in all schools . Therefore it is a point of infinite concern to the prosperity of the higher seminaries and the safety of the students connected with them , that the right principles of discipline be taught and practiced in all the primary schools . And the relation of schools of learning of every grade , to the security and happiness of the state , is in respect to no one point , more momentous than in this . In all our colleges and in most of the higher institutions , it is believed that moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still requires the maintenance of strict discipline , and the enforcement of extreme penalties , to secure the success and safety of students surrounded by the dangers and temptations of college life . But for the common school , we have heard of new and improved systems of discipline , and in these new systems , though such terms as moral discipline , " " moral influences , " and " moral suasion " are introduced , yet the word " moral " has such a meaning as gives it no right to be associated in any way with the idea of discipline . It is said we must govern by the authority of love . The phrase authority of law sounds harsh and ungentle , and affects the nerves of those who are meekly perverse and good naturedly obstinate , and amiably criminal . The teacher must rule by the law of love and all will be well ; he will ever find a ready response to all his wishes . Now that teacher fulfils to his pupils the law of love , who teaches them to love the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implant in them , if possible , an ever abiding regard for the rule of right conduct , a regard fortified by the motive of fear , yea , of exceeding dread of the consequences of wrong doing . And to ensure the habit of moral obedience , the teacher of right may , and in duty must , employ adequate means . What is there in the idea of an unbending law of right that should be repulsive to young minds , that should be withheld , that should be softened down by smooth names ? What child is too young to learn the most important lesson of sympathy , with the spirit of what is described in the celebrated words of Hooker , that " of law , no less can be said , than that her seat is the bosom of God , her voice the harmony of the world . " We can not but think the discussions that have prevailed , in reference to the use of corporal punishment , have been uncalled for , and have been demoralizing in their tendency . There may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are means of redress and remedy , other than calling in question principles on which all authority rests . The exercise of the master 's right in the primary school to inflict pain as the extreme penalty of school discipline , must , under judicious and sensible management , but very seldom occur , and then indeed , however painful it may be to the master , the moral uses of it are such as to render it his imperative duty to employ it . The calling in question his right to use this mode of discipline , must tend greatly to increase rather than lessen the occasions of administering it . That theory of school government which is not safe to announce from the teacher 's desk , is not safe to announce any where . That system which would naturally find sympathy with boys , inclined to be idle and vicious , should never be heard of by them . That good time , dreamed of by radical reformers , is never coming , when juvenile de // 330 Common Schools and their relations to lli*her Seminaries. linquents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the advocacy of such a theory of moral discipline . That good time is never coming when indolence will be quickened and passion checked , or the power of temptation be weakened by such a. notion . That good time is never coming until human nature shall no more need moral discipline , being " fixed in virtue , though free to fall . " The cause of the discussion is not , we are persuaded , that there has been any general abuse of power by the schoolmasters , but the principle is unpalatable on which the ancient theory of school discipline rests . The controversy is analogous in its causes and general bearings , to that which has arisen on the capital punishment question and some other topics of a political character . Retiring from places of public notoriety , such as the hall of legislation and the pulpit , and avoiding controversy with the leading minds who are busily engaged in the engrossing duties of professional life , the advocates of error have entered the school room , and under the covert of a most zealous regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public sentirnent by infusing false notions into the minds of the young , as to the principles of obedience to the authority of law , and thus will the safety of the state ere long be greatly endangered by a generation of active citizens who will have been in the habit of regarding , not the law of conscience , but mere inclination as the right principle of action . If these wrong notions of school discipline shall prevail in the common schools , their influence will soon extend to the higher institutions and increase a thousand fold the difficulties of maintaining sound discipline in our colleges and universities . And no conservative power of any or all of our seminaries of learning , will be able to prevent the destruction of public morality and the introduction of the worst principles of civil government . Therefore this heresy in the matter of school discipline should be watched with a most wakeful solicitude by the patriot and the Christian . It is the offspring of a false philosophy of social life , though loud in its pretensions of reform . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and retributive justice it calls revenge . It is the offspring of a false philanthropy , though loud in its professions of benevolence . It is a philanthropy which sheds crocodile 's tears over the merited sufferings of the guilty criminal , but has no sympathy for outraged justice ; and thus have the forms of law been made to shield the greatest crimes , and penitentiaries have become retreats for the insane or cities of refuge from the avenger of blood . We shall not endeavor here to refute these monstrous errors farther than to say , that if the principle of punishment be not legitimate which makes the criminal a sufferer , and those ends of punishment can not be justified which are retributive , then we know not what to think of the universal sentiment of mankind , which has awarded the highest honors to such names as that of Aristides the Just ; of the elder Cato , the stern old Roman Censor , " who had rather ' his good actions should go unrewarded than his bad ones unpunished ; " of Sir Thomas More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity ; and of our own Marshall , whose love of truth and justice was a burning passion . How shall teachers in our schools commend , as they do , these examples to the admiration of their pupils , and yet exercise over them a system of discipline which tends to the subversion of that idea of truth and justice , the love and the practice of which made these great names immortal ? // PRINCIPLES IN THE ART OF LANDSCAPE . THE art of landscape* is wholly a modern art . It is but recently , indeed , that it could with any plausibility prefer a claim to a place among the arts ; as it is but recently that any serious attempt has been made to reduce it to any artistic principles . It is more than any other of the fine arts , perhaps , an art of peace . Only where civil quietness and security , and consequent domestic enjoyment , reign in a high degree , can it well be cultivated . The warlike Greek , while he carried other arts of design to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and divine ideas " in landscape ; for the sentiments and ideas most appropriate to such expression , were in a great measure by his social habits and condition driven from his bosom . He could chisel sentiments of courage and heroic endurance in forms of matchless beauty , for they were sentiments which his condition was every way fitted to develope and strengthen ; and such products of his constructive genius were not so liable to perish in an age of incessant strife and war . The sculptor found in the solid and enduring marble , the fittest material in which both to embody the commanding ideas of his age-an age of martial heroism , and also safely to enshrine the workings of that anticipating genius which can find in nothing short of immortality its end and satisfaction . The reigning ideas of such an age naturally delighted , too , for * We think it time to drop a part of the cumbersome expression , landscapegardening , and designate the art henceforth directly from the material on which it is employed . Justified as the designation is , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of harshness or strangeness may appear at first in the expression . the same reason , in the massive stateliness , the solidity and firmness of architectural forms . Hence in the two departments of sculpture and architecture , Grecian art particularly developed and perfected itself . How uncongenial both with the material and the sentiments proper to the art of landscape , was such an age and such ideas . This art is the expression more of domestic seclusion and tranquillity ,  --  of the mild , the gentle , the yielding graces . It implies a state of civil and social security and confidence . Strong.walled towns thronged with a population seeking protection and defense on the one hand , and waste , deserted fields on the other ; states condensed into cities , and cities the common and fit designations of states ; aggressive warfare for its own sake , the prime element and characteristic feature of all state-polity and all state-policy ; society in its inmost structure clannish , if not Ishmaelitish , and in its actual outworkings marauding , pillaging , wasting , even the humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere necessary wants , and a welltilled , well-stocked field was regarded as a rare and admirable achievmeat of energy and skill . The kitchen-garden of Alcinous , Homer paints with a poet 's enthusiasm , as if a prodigy of art ; and in later times , Plutarch gives us but a sorry view of the development of taste in this direction , when he tells us the common practice in ornamental gardens was , to set ofF the beauties of roses and violets by intermingled leeks and onions . Roman life , at certain periods of its history , admitted more readily the culture of the art . But those periods were periods of luxury and prodigality ; and Roman gardens // were rather exhibitions of lavish profusion in proprietors , than of true taste in artists . Mechanical skill was not undervalued ; but it rose no higher than bare imitation . The highest name that the Romans could give an artist in landscape , was one that designated mere skill in training and paring vegetable growths into curious shapes . The topiarius was first and chief in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheared out in the spray of shrubbery and trees . Elevated and pure as was their taste for natural scenery , and rich and glowing as are the descriptions given of it by their poets , yet the iRomans seem never to have conceived of the possibility of true garden and field decoration . Among the ancients , the art of landscape rose hardly to the first stage of development . It did not gain admittance even into their conceptions as an art by itself . During the barbarous ages that succeeded the decline of Roman civilization , when every existing art perished , it was not to be expected that a new art , much less an art emphatically of peace , should arise . While the soil was tilled , and lords and bishops decorated to some extent their palaces and their courts , still no proper art of landscape had existence . Indeed the very name of the art has a significant historic import . XVhile other arts have derived their names as their origin from classic times , this art proclaims its recent nativity in the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to date the birth of the art , in its proper sense , down as late as the sixteenth century . Since that time it has been cultivated at periods with great ardor and success . In its progress , like other arts , it has had its schools-its specific phases and characteristics , determined to it by the character of the age or people by which it has been cultivated . It will not be irrelevant to our ob ject to enumerate and describe in brief terms , the several prominent stages by which the progress of the art has been characterized . It will be seen at once from the description , that these stages naturally succeed each other ; - that not only was the order in which they successively appeared such as was to have been anticipated beforehand , but that each subsequent phase of the art was induced and determined by the preceding . These several stages areThe French or Geometric ; The Chinese or Pseudo-natural ; The modern English or Picturesque ; to which we may add as the last and highest , but yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Geometric is the first in order of nature , as it was first to appear in time . Even the IRomans , here and there , seem almost to have attained this stageRegularity , straight lines , plane angles , proportion , are the first , most unequivocal deviations from irregular nature . Nothing so decisively indicates that reason , more or less perfect , has been at work , than a straight line . It tells us at once that rude nature has been met and overcome ; and as art pleases us ever , even rude art , as compared only with wild , unreduced nature , rectilinear streets and walks give naturally a pleasing effect . If a higher culture of the taste experiences no such pleasure , but even disgust at the square and compass landscape , it is only because it compares it with a higher , more truly artistic method . The less cultivated taste is satisfied ; for it has no conception of a higher form of the art . And the first awakenings of the aesthetic spirit should not be frowned upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Egypt is despicable by the side of the free Grecian art , it is not so by the side of utter barbarism . If it was much to rise from the stiff // Egyptian to the graceful Grecian , it was more to wake up art from the dead sleep of barbarism , and give it real although immature life . Illustrations of the geometric style of landscape , are found every where in the first awakenings of taste . The traveler in France meets it at every turn . In city and in country alike , in garden and park , orchard and forest , we find nothing but straight lines . The magnificent entrance into the city of Paris , and its copy , the entrance into Milan in Lombardy  --  the bold conception and work of Napoleon-fill every mind with admiration . Here true artistic propriety demands the rectilinear style ; and hence the highest and truest taste is satisfied . In Great Britain , also , are to be found not unfrequent specimens of this style ; - the remains , perhaps , of French inIluence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been well if it had reached , also , some of the high roads whose serpentine course now awakens in the hasting traveler other emotions than those of aesthetic pleasure . In our own country we find it every where in place and out of place . It is not seldom in place ; for , as already intimated , the geometric style of landscape is sometimes required by true principles of taste . Order , regularity , system , are the first principles of city life ; and these are expressed properly and naturally in rectilinear forms . Many of our towns are thus appropriately and beautifully laid out and decorated . But we find this style , also , in places altogether unmeet . An infantile taste , dissatisfied with the absence of all art , and yet incapable of rising to the true and perfect , reaches the first stage only , and is content . It has no conception of any higher , and of course does not seek it nor miss it . Hence every where , we find alike , yard and gar. den @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chain . Fences , trees , shrubs , walks , all range ; and poor , passive nature , who had done her best to mold her features into smiles of ease and grace , is scraped and shorn and sliced under the hard rule of level and plummet , till she literally gives up the ghost -- is reduced to mere unexpressive matter . Art has triumphed over nature , indeed ; but in so doing has destroyed itself . Instead of living , expressive art , it has become spiritless artifice . Free invention , the true soul of art , has given place to mere mathematical formulas ; and ingenious execution has become mere mechanical skill , the drudge of models and numbers . It was not to be expected that the free spirit of man would rest satisfied with this utter annihilation of natural expressiveness and beauty , in an endeavor only to make it more perfect . It is not , perhaps , surprising that in its effort to correct itself , so obviously in the wrong , it should fall back on the opposite extreme . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected as the second stage in the progress and development of the art . The mechanical stiffness of the rectilinear style , so utterly opposed both to the character of the material of the art-living nature ,  --  and also to the character of the sentiments for the most part to be expressed by it , naturally drove men in their dissatisfaction with it , to the closest imitation possible of irregular nature . The compass and the chain were now rejected . Every thing was to be done as it should happen , just as it was supposed to take place in nature . At least , nature was to be imitated as exactly as possible ; and the standard of perfection in the art was the utter concealment of all art . The Chinese carried out the principles of this style to the farthest extent and most consistently . The landscape , under the hands of the artist , was to be a perfect miniature of the natural world . There were to be rivers // 334 Principles in the Art of Landscape . and lakes and grottoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every thing that is found in nature . As in nature , there are contrasts , so in the park and garden , there must he jagged cliffs hanging over luxuriant flower gardens ; gentle rivulets suddenly changing into mountain torrents ; retired groves permeated by navigable canals ; broad rivers disappearing in the earth ; the wildest desolation succeeded by the highest cultivation . While nothing was to be introduced that might not be found in the natural world , nothing that was to be found there was out of place in the landscape . Hence old , dilapidated mills were put upon the streams ; lightning-struck and half consumed buildings were thrown in here and there ; dead trees were transplanted , and decayed logs dragged in , and all to be more true to nature . There was much that was plausible in this view of the art of landscape . It shunned the repugnant features of the mechanical or geometrical school . It admitted of a show of art in the lower sense-of the indication of human ingenuity and skill . Indeed , the landscape created by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of execution . It was , however , only the geometrical eye of the practical engineer that measures accurately distances and angles , and the skill of the mere mechanic that works by models . The principles of this style , moreover , were easily applied . There was no need of plan or study of effect . The whole work was to pro . ceed hap-hazard-precisely after the supposed course of nature . Seeds of future shrubs and trees were to be dropped just where it was most convenient at the time to dispose of them . Enclosures could he made any where and in any shape . Groves , orchards , streams , every thing , were to be disposed as the merest chance should dictate . In fact , the extremest stupidity and indolence were pretty sure to succeed as well as the utmost study and labor . The theory itself , too , sounded well . What better than to imitate nature  --  the great product of divine skill ? How better can nature speak than in the way the God of nature has bidden her speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnatural , and therefore irrational and absurd ? Is it not the very design and end of landscape to express the loveliness and harmony which the natural world expresses ; and how can this be done but by exactly imitating nature ? The reasoning , at least , has proved conclusive with many minds . In Great Britain , not merely among the unthinking and unpracticed , but both among the theorists and the practical artists , this style has found extensive advocacy and patronage . Even Kent , the parent of the modern English landscape , with all his high training as an artist , adopted it , with some modifications which his taste as a professional painter forced him unconsciously to introduce , in all his landscapes , and carried it out to the last of its principles . Even Kent was Chinese enough to set out dead trees to imitate nature . And Lord Kames dwells on the description of the style with unconcealed satisfaction . Some modern writers regard it as the true art of landscape , and seem to imagine that the only alternative of rejecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method . The reasoning by which the theory is supported need not be severely investigated in order that its sophistry and fallaciousness should be discovered . It has precisely the plausibility and conclusiveness , and no more , of that of the musical dreamer who , setting out with the position that all harmony of sweet sounds is in nature , should hence conclude at once that the only true // way of producing it by man is to congregate all sound-uttering things in the natural world , and by force or persuasion put all together on one grand musical effort : and the effect of this Chinese art of landscape on a truly refined taste , is much the same that we might imagine the effect to be on a well-harmonized ear of such a burst and swell of utterance from all that is noise-making in the living and material universe . The transition from this method to the picturesque or modern English was easy and natural . Jt* was readily seen and felt that not all of nature was beautiful ; at least that the grand and lovely of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden . The idea of expression was now fully developed ; and there was no danger of falling back upon the unexpressiveness of the rectilinear style . Nature was not to be utterly destroyed in landscape , nor yet servilely copied in her mere outward dress , and that by fragments and rents . The study of nature had discovered that she had a voice by which she could reach the heart , and that the way to feel the true force of her varied tones , was not to crowd all her utterances together , and thus turn what was sweet and harmonious by itself into an element of harsh discord ; but to search out her most perfect individual harmonies , and transfer them where their effect could be freely experienced . Claude Lorraine and the two Possinos had shown how the harmonies of the natural world could be displayed on canvas ; - not by exact , servile imitation of any one natural scene , but by combination of what was perfect and lovely as found feature by feature , in diverse scenes ; and the art of landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field of true art , taking its measure and its rule from the canvas , demanded congruous combination , and required all to be subservient to harmonious effect . In the geometric school , the landscape was conceived and planned from its outlines on paper as laid off by scale and dividers ; in the Chinese , plans were all laid aside , and the landscape grew up in all the freedom and unconstraint of unconscious nature , or what amounted to the same , nature was the copy and the landscape was the miniature ; now the landscape was conceived and planned , not from maps nor from the actual world , but from the imagined representation in color and in crayon . At first straight lines alone were to rule , then no lines at all , at least none imaginary or artificial , and now the lines of perspective , light and shade , and harmonious coloring . The guide and rule was simply harmonious effect . While the map-like precision , the stiffness and leanness of the rectilinear school , gave place to a picturesque richness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese delighted also gave way to that harmonious composition , which is a first and indispensable characteristic of true art . This style may be denominated the modern English , to distinguish it from that which prevailed in Great Britain before the times of Knight and Price ; or the Picturesque , as indicating the point from which the view of the art is taken , and from which it is judged . It is the style now generally recognized by the numerous writers on the art , and by most of the professed artists in landscape . One of the latest and best writers of this school , is Mr. Downing ; whose works , every where characterized by a refined taste and sound judgment , have greatly contributed to the improvement of landscape in this country , and are every where justly esteemed of the highest authority . The following extracts from his leading work on this subject , exhibit in brief the conception of the art as now for the most part entertained here and // Principles in the Art of Landscape . in Great Britain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the grounds of a country residence , of the general forms of nature , but an expressive , harmonious and refined imitation. ** " Expression being the master-key to the heart in all landscapes , it follows that the highest imitative sphere of the art of landscape gardening , consists in arranging the materials so as to awaken emotions of grace , elegance or picturesqueness , joined with unity , harmony and variety , more distinct and forcible than are suggested by natural sce nery. *** It will he remarked , that while Mr. Downing speaks of expression , and even of " expression of sentiment , " as necessarily entering into his idea of landscape , yet the expression is only of aesthetic sentiment generally ,  --  not of sentiments which as expressed become resthetic ; - in other words , it is the expression of the graceful , elegant , or picturesque This stage of the art is , obviously , far in advance of the precedingIt brings it into the field of true art in the highest sense-of resthetic art- But it is much to be questioned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of landscape , like the preceding , exhibits rather a style of the art , than the art itself- It does not teach what the art is in its essential character ,  --  what consequently it must ever be . It seems to admit in itself of different styles , of different schools . It in fact recognizes two different schools , the graceful and the picturesque , which are distinguished from each other , not from any principle given in the conception of the art , and of itself determining the number of schools , so to speak , but by the accidental circumstance that there is a graceful and also a picturesque harmony , as if these were the only forms of harmonious expression-It but lays the ground * Landscape Gardening , pp* 52 , 54. and excites the hope of the erection of still another school of the art . It is but the proper forerunner and earnest of a higher phase ,  --  that which we have called the expressive or true artistic ;  --  a phase of which we find abundant evidence that the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preconceptions . The exact advance made in this last stage , consists in this ; - that while the picturesque school regard the art as an art , in a certain sense , of expression , they regard it as expressive only in the sense of awakening certain emotions of beauty ; the expressive or true artistic regard it as expressive of certain ideas or sentiments , which when thus expressed , are by the contemplating mind apprehended with those emotions of beauty , as natural and necessary accompaniments and consequents . The picturesque school fixes the eye on the aesthetic feelings awakened by landscape ; the artistic , on the sentiments or ideas which , as expressed in landscape , naturally awaken those feelings . The one constitutes the art from its effect ; the other , from its power to produce it . The one inquires , consequently , whether such and such arrangements and embellishments consist with such and such emotions of taste ; the other , what precisely are those sentiments which expressed will necessarily produce those emotions . The guiding principles of the one are tentative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rationally predeterminative and sure . The artist under the one proceeds gropingly , questioning at every step whether the effect is realized ; under the other he proceeds intelligently , knowing that if the materials and the arrangement which he has selected as suitable to the sentiment to be expressed , are actually adopted , the aesthetic effect ,  - -  the perfect satisfaction of a refined taste ,  --  iS certain . 336 // The distinction between the two conceptions of the art , may be illustrated from the art of sculpture . The merely picturesque sculptor takes his block of marble , and chips off here and there , till a form is at last reached which is aesthetic or tasteful . It may be a Jupiter or a Venus , an Apollo or a Pan . That with him is a merely incidental thing . What he has aimed at , is to develop a form of grace or a form of majesty ; and he has chipped away till he has found it . The truly artistic sculptor first selects the sentiment or character which he is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaste sensibility ,  - -  and then with this sentiment or character as the modeling image in his mind directing every blow , proceeds to chisel out a Jupiter or a Venus , an Apollo or a Diana , knowing that if the execution answer to the design , the product will be one of perfect taste , and satisfy every resthetic sense . This general sketch of the stages of the art of landscape , indicates at once the guiding principles in the practical application of it ; - answers , in other words , the question , How am I , in my desire to arrange and invest my grounds in true taste , to proceed ? I am not , obviously , to send for scale and dividers , and map out my grounds by mathematical lines , along which I am to place my fences , my walks , my shrubs and trees . I am not to send for a Chinese , and bid him go and survey the face of nature everywhere , and then come and stamp an exact image of it in daguerreotype miniature on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strange , the incongruous , the grotesque , the monstrous . I am not to go to the painter , and bid him spread out for me on canvas a scene soft , quiet , graceful , or wild , bold and grand , although expressive of no particular sentiment , that I may copy it in landscape . I am not to grope my way along in the dark , trying this experiment and that , and all in search of some general , indescribable effect of beauty . My work is all an intelligent , rational work ,  - -  a work of study and forecast , as is work in every art , but a work definite , simple , sure . I am to ascertain what sentiments or ideas are susceptible of being expressed in landscape , and under the limitations of my own individual resources and command of materials . I am , out of these sentiments and ideas , to select what particularly I will express . With the same block of marble , susceptible of being chiseled into the form of a Jupiter or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect neither ; - with the same grounds , endeavor to express the ideas and sentiments appropriate to a town-common and a retired villa , a nobleman 's park and a peasants * door-yard . I will determine upon the specific character of sentiments and ideas which I will express ; and will then from the study of my materials , the character , the extent , the shape and surface of my ground , the peculiarities of the shrubbery , trees , and other material of groundInvestiture at my disposal , select and dispose so as to express precisely this character of ideas and sentiments . Proceeding thus , if that good Providence which has arranged all nature in forms of taste , and radimentally disposed its various elements to assume shapes of beauty and loveliness , smile benignant on my work , I may rationally expect success ; and in each revolving season , my own sense meanwhile excited , trained , and made more quick to beautiful impressions , may witness some new grace expanding , some new feature of loveliness unfolding , and all the diverse expressions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beauteous life , which shall perfectly satisfy my a ? sthetic sense . But there are certain assumptions // in this general answer , which it may be necessary , in order to illustrate and establish its truth , to examine more particularly and distinctly . It is assumed , in the first place , that it is possible to express certain ideas and rational sentiments in landscape ;  --  to embody them in forms of vegetable life . This truth is , perhaps , sufficiently demonstrated by the analogies of all expressive art . The sculptor and the painter , certainly , have tested the capabilities of even inanimate matter to embrace ideas and to speak them forth in most moving utterances . The architect , also , who fills one department of the more comprehensive art of landscape , counts confidently on the susceptibility of rude matter to incorporat2 into itself , under the control of art , sentiments that thus expressed , shall be seen and felt ; and in many a majestic temple , many a solemn cathedral , many a rustic cottage , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has formed them forth , not by gropingly , tentatively aiming at a general pleasing effect , but by possessing himself firmly of the rational sentiments he is to express and then proceeding to express them under the laws of artistic invention and execution . Art can embody ideas then in the most rude and unimpressible matter . But such sentiments are every where , in fact , expressed in living nature . There are scattered every where over the face of the earth , scenes of loveliness and grandeur . There is beauty in the still green vale ; there is grandeur in the tall wide-branched oak ; there is grace in the easy sweep of the bending willow : and it is lawful to go back of the effect and inquire why such objects and scenes are grand or lovely or graceful . We may feel the beauty and forget in our rapture to explain to ourselves the causes . We may feel it and be unable to follow up the emotion to its source , as we believe much where we neither see nor can see evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to penetrate the cause or ground . But we are , notwithstanding , authorized to attempt an answer to the question , and may , on a sufficiently large induction , justify its correctness . The rainbow is beautiful , because it utters , in its easy arch and its bright and delicately blended hues , sentiments of peace and purity . It is not poetry but the truest philosophy , that through it hears him who bent and painted it , speak thus to those of his creatures whom he has formed in his own image and has so formed precisely that he might thus speak* to them holy , rapturous thoughts . It is , in like manner , the peace and security , sentiments most dear to the human heart , uttered in the secluded valley , the force and endurance expressed in the majestic oak , the freedom and exemption from all foreign constraint imaged in the sweeping willow , that awaken in us the emotions of beauty , grandeur and grace , which we feel when we contemplate these several objects . All beauty is thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so far from questioning whether rational sentiments can be expressed in material forms , we may rather question whether the divine architect of this whole physical universe , so constituted and ordained it for any other purpose than this-that it might be a fit medium of communicating thought and sentiment ; - whether the highest , best , altogether the most rational view we can take of it , is not to regard it but as the book of God , in which , on every page , are recorded for man 's inspection and study in intelligible , moving language , his Master 's teachings . It is implied further in the answer that has been given , that the creator of landscape may and must grasp the particular sentiment or senti // ments to be expressed . Both the possibility and the necessity of this are implied , and may need vindication . It is not meant that scenes or objects really beautiful may not , by some rare possibility , be the effect of what we call mere accident . A man may shut his eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful grove may spring up or a lovely bed of flowers . For nature does not work blindfold in carrying out blindfolded man 's beginnings . But to proceed with rational hope of success , the sentiments to be cxpressed must be known beforehand . This is possible to a sufficient extent at least . The individual sentiments and ideas , suitable to be expressed at all in aesthetic material forms , have not been fully enumerated and classed ; nor have they been so distributed , in reference to the different departments of art , as to enable us at once to say what are the particular sentiments suitable for expression in landscape . But the classes of sentiments may be so described as to leave this part of his work open and plain to the artist . The elements of beauty , or , in other words , our nesthetic ideas and sentiments , may be arranged into three classes . The first embraces those of a purely rational character , implying an aim and some kind of relaiionship . They are such specific ideas as those of unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every aesthetic product , every landscape must have unity . This our rational nature requires ; and all taste has its seat in the rational part of our being . It must have one end , and to this one end every thing must be subservient . If the architecture in a landscape furnish the leading and controlling element , then the selection and disposition of the trees and shrubbery must correspond . A cheerful cottage can not be at one with gloomy pines or huugi*y oaks ; nor a majestic temple or stately halls with flower-beds and light shrubbery . If the ground is to furnish the prevailing element , then the architecture must yield ; and sculptured columns and carved vases must not be forced into the same scene with rugged cliffs and wild waterfalls ; nor mossy arbors or thatched bowers be stuck in parterres of roses . Such combinations are but irrational jargon and confusion . They utter nothing ; certainly nothing beautiful . So fitness , in the large comprehension of the term , embracing adaptedness to the design , the materials , the resources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and harmony between the parts , all enter into every just conception of a piece of art . These several relations which may be embraced under the general term of propriety , the artist in landscape must , at the outset , have firmly apprehended . As ideas actually enthroned in his designing mind , they must preside over his entire work from beginning to end , and everywhere be expressed . They are the primary controlling elements or conditions of all beauty . As , lyin in our rational nature generally , and so existing , in a sense , prior to all proper testhetic sentiments , they must ever control the latter and give law to them . They can never be violated or overleaped . The second class of . sthetic elements embraces those which address themselves more directly to the emotive or affective part of our nature . They are designated in language by the sentiments themselves , as cheerfulness , tranquillity , dignity , and the like , or by the states or conditions which awaken them , as retirement , seclusion , authority , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first . The first are rather negative conditions of all beauty ; these are l ) ositive elements and constituents of beauty . The former enter into every product of true art , preside over its production , appear everywhere in it , can not be // set aside or disregarded ; the latter are not always necessary . There may be true beauty where only the rational elements , unity , fitness , pro . portion , combine with the elements that remain to be named , as constituting the third of our divisions . XVhere the rational elements alone appear , we have only useful arts , not elegant , according to the distinction that has been more commonly received . The introduction of one of the elements of this second class immediately elevates the product to the rank of the fine arts . But these sentiments can not , like the ideas of the first class , all combine in the same object . They are exclusive of each other . The sentiments of secluded cheerfulness and of tranquil security , the sentiments which domestic landscape should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity with which church-yard scenery should be invested . In the selection of the sentiments of this class , accordingly , begins the proper exercise of the discriminating taste of the creator of landscape . lie is , from among them , to determine what shall consist with the great object of his work . As his art consists essentially in expression , he must , as a rational artist , determine what , specifically , he will express . Otherwise he must proceed , without intelligence , by hap-hazard guesswork , and his success must turn on the caprice of mere chance . Public grounds should certainly express the sentiments appropriate to public life ; and these must vary speciffeally with the specific aspects of public life which present themselves in different scenes . The church has its associations ; and the sentiments of grandeur , dignity , authority , order , common to all the scenes of socially organized life , must here be specifically modified and characterized by the expression of the sentiments of solemnity , awe , reverence , purity and seclusion . The market , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimehts peculiar to itself ; while the halls of justice and of legislation demand in all the scenery which surrounds them , as well as in their own architectural plan and execution , the expression of those sentiments which such scenes of social life are fitted to inspire . Private life , too , has its class of sentiments which true taste will ever aim to impress on all the objects with which it is locally associated . This diversity of sentiments , proper to appear in the various departments of landscape , no rational artist , no man of refined taste will overlook . And it need not be shown by more detailed illustration , with how much more intelligence and satisfaction and confidence , the work of disposing and embellishing grounds in whatever circumstances , in public or in private , will proceed , when the artist has , beforehand , determined the exact sentiment which lie is to express , and has that firmly apprehended sentiment to guide him in every step of his progress . The third department of elemental beauty is denominated by the comprehensive term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our nature . This teri4i , as applied to matters of taste , can not be more philosophically and accurately defined , than as " the expression of freedom . " Whatever is properly denominated graceful , will ever be found to arise from free action , directly or remotely ; and every genuine expression of freedom is properly characterized as graceful . Even in the physical world , every manifestation of grace images to the mind the idea of freedom Unconstrained . The meandering rivulet is graceful while it seems to choose its own course and winds " by its own s*veet will . " It ceases to be graceful , when becoming the pitching , foaming torrent , its free // course is constrained and checked by foreign violence or obstruction . The bending willow sweeps gracefully because it seems to move unconstrained and in perfect freedom . The gambols of the frisking lamb , the curvetings of a frolicsome steed , are graceful because they betoken suppleness of joint , flexile muscle , in short , freedom from all donstraint arising from outer force or inner weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other department of gracethe grace of repose . The grace of repose differs from the grace of motion only in this-that it fixes the eye on the effect of free motion , while the latter turns the attention on the motion itself . It ever , consequently , implies motion , and , accordingly , ever suggests freedom . We awaken the sentiment of grace in repose , when we contemplate , for instance , the delicately turned features of supple infancy ; and if we suffer our gaze to penetrate beyond the mere picturing surface to the actual substance imaged upon it , we shall find that it is the free motions of innocence , unperverted and undistorted , put forth in the yielding muscle of infancy . All expressions of grace , thus , even in the physical world , are but images of freedom ; and to the soul that has been trained in a true aesthetic culture , ever speak forth this high element of a rational nature . To such a soul the great artist reveals himself in all the forms of grace that the visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the elevated spirit sees peace and purity imaged in the still , deep azure of the sky , or majesty in the shore-clasping ocean , such a soul discerns in all these forms of grace , " Tue unambiguous footsteps of the God Who gives its luster to an insect 's wing , And wheels his throne upon the rolling worlds . " All aesthetic grace reveals thus at once , a deity in nature , as it images a moral element there which can only belong to a moral creator and disposer ; and furnishes an incomparably higher evidence to every cultivated spirit of his being and his nature , than any arguments of fitness or of adaptation . Grace , as thus the expression of the highest element of our nature , the peculiarly and strictly moral element , is the highest form of beauty . And the artist who would rise in his landscape to the most pleasing , most impressive exhibitions of beauty , must apprehend firmly this element and give it expression wherever it may find a place . It can not everywhere appear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace must submit to the principles of propriety and fitness that rule with absolute sway all things rational - Architecture must have straight lines and angles . Streets and roads must minister to their proper end and design-convenience , and must be often direct ; while grace rejects straight lines and angles , inasmuch as they imply constraint . Yet grace can find admission , at least to some extent ; - particularly in private , domestic landscape , is it capable of entering in perfect conformity with all the rational elements to be expressed , of unity , fitness and proportion ; and there , above all , should the great lesson of man 's moral nature everywhere be inscribed , that the image may be stamped by ever continued repetition on the forming spirit of unconscious childhood , and so ever in maturing life recall and foster the substantial truth itself . The answer that has been given to the question , What are the guiding principles in the art of landscape , implies thus , that there are sentirnents to be expressed which the artist may and must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prosecute his work . This answer implies , moreover , that he , with equal firmness and intellectual // clearness , apprehend the materials and the mode of arrangement , by means of which , and through which he is to express these sentiments . The assumption , therefore , of the possibility and the necessity of this firm apprehension remains to he vindicated . Of the possibility , generally , of expressing aesthetic sentiments and ideas in the forms of vegetable life , enough has already been said . And to him who has schooled himself in nature , who has been wont to throw himself under the influence of the outer world , and to mark the diverse character of those influences as determined by diverse scenes and objects , little in addition need he said to show the possibility of expressing , in appropriate forms of vegetable life , the specific elements of landscape expression that have been enumerated . It is hardly poetry , or if poetry , it is poetic truth to say , that every vegetable structure and form , from the low creeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression ; while the unlimited permutation of groups and combinations , both in kind and in place , shows a range and scope of diversified expression as unlimited . It would almost be a reflection on the divine artificer of the universe , to suppose for a moment that the objects of the vegetable world do not , in some sufficient degree , correspond in variety of character with the variety of sentiments , that in his constitution and investiture of nature , he has shown , may , and for man 's benefit should be imaged in landscape . The testhetic student of nature has without difficulty learned the character of each form of vegetable life , and to him it has become an easy task to translate the peculiar expression of each into its proper testhetic sentiment . The reverse act , to image forth the sentiment in tree and vine and shrub and flower , if more uncommon , or even more difficult , is the more pleasing effort of a creative mind . The expression of resthetic elements by arrangement , requires a higher skill . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , the most essential and most characteristic element of artistic genius  --  the power to construct proposed forms of beauty from materials , various , multiform , and rude . Out of the countless possible forms which diverse arrangemnents of given materials may furnish , he is to keep in his mind steadily his own ideal expression , and then pass before his view the successive possible groups and combinations till the desired antitype appear . Yet this is the common labor of every artistTo arrest the fleeting images that fill The mirror of the mind and hold them fast , And force them sit , till he has penciled oft A faithful likeness of the forms he views ; Then to dispose his copies with such art That each may find its most propitious light , And shine by situation hardly less Than by the labor and the skill it cost . It is to be borne in mind , moreover , that degrees in the richness of the expression are admissible , even when the same sentiment is imaged in the landscape . P he coloring , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or in the manner of Guido Reni , little more than bare light and shade . The composition may vary from the extremest simplicity to the most crowded denseness in almost every kind of landscape expression ; and the artist may consult his own skill in the degree of richness he will impart to his work . This department of his labor implies and requires testhetie culture . He who knows nothing of the capability of expressing senttmeut residing in the vegetable world , who has never felt the power of scenery grave or gay , on his own heart , or when impressed has never followed out the effect to its producing cause , may well decline the work of adapting // grounds to resthetic expression . But he who would labor intelligently and with confidence must certainly know beforehand , what materials and what arrangement will best express the character of beauty he desires . The exposition that has been given of the guiding principles of practical landscape , will , it is hoped , suffice to show that this is a true art in the highest sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadest import , " To spirit , can only spirit speak ; only where an idea shines forth do we recognize true art , " ' * landscape is yet not excluded . The very soul of landscape is the expression of a rational sentiment or idea . It is an art that may he cultivated by all . The rudest peasant , as he may feel the power of beautiful and graceful form in landscape , is so far endowed with the power of creating it ; while , from the very nature of the art , its power may be exerted in beautifying the scanty gardenplot as well as in embellishing and enriching the most extended park or field . It is an art , like every other , requiring study and labor . A half hour 's effort with rule and measure will not suffice to create expressive landscape . Nor will the want of all care or thought , save o nlyto shun the stiffness of geometrical lines , of course secure the expression of real beauty , such even as is sometimes found in nature unadorned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There may be beauty in the individual tree or shrub , while there is no beauty of arrangement or combination-the essential thing in landscape expression . " Elegance , " to quote still again the garden-poet of our liter-ature , " Elegance , chief grace the garden shows And most attractive , is the fair result Of thought  --  the creature of a polished mind . " * Ficker . It is an art , moreover , that loves the light . The groping , tentative , it scorns . Its work is in intelligence throughout . From beginning to end the true artist proceeds in distinct apprehension of his object arid his way . He errs not , therefore , and his result is sure . It is an art , still further , self-sufficing and independent . Architect . are it indeed embraces as a part of its own province . But the recourse , so often made , to eke out its imagined poverty and leanness , to the products of the chisel and the pencil , wrongs the art ; and the wrong is generally resented . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this beautiful art beautifies a land , no statues are needed on the way . In full life there meet us with their gifts , Pomona , Ceres , Pales , Vertumnus , Sylvanus , Flora . " Where we have the living original , inanimate copies are out of place . In the manifold forms and products of vegetable life , is supplied to the ingenious artist all the materials which the fullest and richest expression can require . Under the mild sun of Italy , arches and vases and statues may possibly be introduced into the villa , as in harmony with the general landscape effect . But even there the admiring traveler , after passing out of the rich galleries of proper in-door art-of statuary and painting , feels no disposition to stop and study the sculptured forms which line his path to the true and pure landscape . And when he gives up his spirit to the full power of majestic forest and flower-enameled lawn , or winding stream , and sloping hill-side , various yet harmonious , natural , yet breathing rational sentiment , he gladly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a prodigal , not a refined , art has scattered here and there . In ruder climes , the bolder , sterner forms of architecture alone can be admitted ; and these only as propri // ety , fitness to end , shall evidently require . It is an art , moreover , of the highest moral value . All true art , indeed , embodies a moral sentiment or idea . The inner life and spirit in every true aesthetic work , in every true aesthetic object or scene , is this moral idea which inhabits and animates it . But landscape is of all arts the most expressive of moral truth . Even the unthinking child feels its elevating , grace.inspirmg influence . The unfolding spirit under the constant power of expressive landscape , will mould itself into the forms of beauty and grace which are ever impressed upon it . Abstract rule , cold precept , arbitrary authority , necessary as they are , will yet yield , in power to form to virtuous sentiment , to the force of winning , subduing landscape , ever teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not driving to the love and practice of what is pure and graceful and lovely . That " Heaven be near us in our infancy , " need not be a poet 's dream . It should he a common reality . In the sense of whatever is pure and lovely , it may be planted around every dwelling ; may smile around every rustic cottage as on every wide-spread park and lawn . No more effective moral teacher can be conceived . Happy for our land if all over its wide extent , fast as its swelling population clot it over with dwelling and shop , with hall and temple , and mark it off in yard and orchard and cultivated field and pasture , the spirit of taste might breathe , and , as in the nature of the case is possible , shape each architectural and rural labor into bright forms of loveliness and grace that everywhere should woo to virtue . In crowded city and in sequestered country life , in the scant yard of the humble peasant and on the wide domains of wealth and fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere , the art of landscape may work with all its pleasing , elevating power . Happy , indeed , for our country , if what kind heaven has placed within our power , if what kind heaven has seemed to devolve upon us as our great mission-work and destiny , neglecting and suffering to die the rude arts of violence and war , our hands and hearts were turned to the great art of peacethe tasteful culture and investiture of our wide extended soil , seeking ever not merely to derive from fruitful nature bare satisfaction of animal wants-mere shelter and food for the body , the low aim to which necessity seems to have bound down the people of other lands , but also , with this , to convert nature into a minister to the spirit 's wants , spread over its expanded face images of what is true and sacred , and make earth itself thus an ever present picture of heaven.
