txt GEORGIA was the last of the Old Thirteen Colonies , which were founded under the auspices of the British government in North America . The origin and early progress of this colony are mainly to be ascribed to the philanthropy , enterprise , and generous efforts of Oglethorpe . Hitherto the incidents of his long life have been found only in detached portions of the history of his time , in the almost forgotten tracts relating to the first settlement of Georgia , and in the biographical accounts of some of the eminent men with whom he associated . Dr. Harris , with a lively interest in his subject , and much patience of research , has gathered up these fragments , and in the volume before us has presented them in the form of a connected narrative . Considering the nature of his materials , the author 's task was neither inviting nor easy ; but it has been well executed , and he has rendered a just tribute to the memory of a distinguished benefactor of mankind , and a valuable service to the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Theophilus Oglethorpe , of Godalming , in the county of Surrey . There has been much uncertainty respecting the precise date of his birth . Afier a full investigation of this point , Dr. Harris // 449 decides , upon what he believes to be good authority , that it happened on the 21st of December , 1688 . At the age of sixteen he was admitted a member of Corpus Christi College , Oxford . We are not told how long be remained at the University , but probably till he had completed the usual academical course . In 1710 be entered the army with the commission of ensign , and he continued in the service till the war was closed by the treaty of Utrecht . Immediately after the peace , we find him in the suite of the Earl of Peterborough , ambassador to the court of Turin . Here he enjoyed the company of Berkeley , afterwards the celebrated Bishop of Cloyne , who was chaplain and secretary to the embassy . Oglethorpe 's personal and military accomplishments had attracted the notice and secured the patronage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced to the Duke of Argyle . He was promoted to the rank of Captain-Lieutenant of the Queen 's guards . At this time all the world resounded with the fame of Prince Eugene , who had won so many laurels in the wars with the Turks and other powers of Europe , in the en ) ployrnent of the Emperor of Austria . He had recently made a visit to England , where he was received and caressed by the Queen and other great personages , with every mark of distinction , which was due to the first general of his age . His renown , and the urbanity of his manners , were peculiarly fitted to captivate a mind like Oglethorpe 's . Through the influence of the Duke of Argyle he was recommended to Prince Eugene , by whom he was employed , first in the capacity of his secretary , and afterwards of his aid - de- camp , and whom he joined just in time to take part in the new war , which the Emperor was about to wage against the Sultan . He was present at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Temeswaer ; and was in active command at the siege and battle of Belgrade , " where he acquired a high and deserved reputation . " These events were soon followed by a peace between the Emperor and the Sultan , and , there being no longer a prospect of active employment , Oglethorpe withdrew from the staff of his friend and patron Prince Eugene . He likewise declined an offer of preferment in the German service , and returned to England . Having succeeded his elder brother in the inheritance of the family estate at Godalming , Oglethorpe obtained , in the // year 1722 , a seat in Parliament for Haselmere . He was the representative of that borough , by successive elections , for thirty-two years . Dr. Harris gives a brief sketch of his parliamentary career during that time . Within the same period he was engaged abroad nearly ten years in carrying forward his great and benevolent scheme of founding a colony in America . Many of his speeches have been preserved in the Parliamentary History . In these he is proved to have been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken a conspicuous part in important measures , showing on all occasions an independent spirit , intelligence , and a steady consistency of character . A circumstance , which appealed strongly to his feelings of humanity , led him to turn his attention to the condition of the prisons . He brought the subject before Parliament , and was appointed chairman of a committee of the House of Commons to make an inquiry into the state of the jails in the metropolis . This duty he faithfully performed , and laid open in his report to the House such scenes of wretchedness and oppressive treatment , such instances of cruel abuse , mismanagement , and neglect , especially towards those confined for debt , that measures were immediately adopted not only for punishing some of the inhuman jailers , but for preventing a recurrence of needless seventies . " Oglethorpe thus became , " says Dr. Harris , " the precursor of Howard in the cause of humanity , as it regards the amelioration of prison discipline in general , especially the rigors of close confinement for debt or petty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression then made on his mind and heart led him afterwards to other and more extensive and efficacious measures for the relief of poor debtors from the extortions and oppressions to which they were subjected by jailers , and from the humiliation and distress in which they were often involved without any fault of their own , or by some conduct which deserved pity rather than punishment . " His sympathies were keenly touched by another class of sufferers . The subject of the impressment of seamen for the public service came before Parliament . He spoke against the practice as arbitrary , unjust , and unhuman . He moreover argued the point in a pamphlet , which he published , entitled " The Sailor 's Advocate . " Why should a seap*an be compelled , against his will and against his interests , // to endure the hardships of military discipline , and hazard his life , for the benefit of others ; and this , too , upon such terms as his oppressors shall prescribe ? War is a calamity that concerns every individual of a nation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's services are valuable or necessary to his country , let them be rewarded in proportion to their value , and they will be voluntarily rendered . If his valor and skill are requisite to defend the lives and property of his fellow countrymen , a wise and just government will pay him such wages as will draw him from other employments . This small boon he has a right to claim , as much as an artificer , a soldier , or even the officers under whom he serves . Let this equitable course be adopted , and the odious and wicked system of impressment , which is only another name for kidnapping , would no longer disgrace the annals of maritime warfare . When colonial questions were discussed in Parliament , we find Oglethorpe opposed to a narrow policy and unequal discriminations . He regarded the colonists as possessing all the rights of British subjects , and as being entitled to a legislation which should put them , as far as circumstances would permit , on an equal footing in their relation to each other and to the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biased by prejudice nor cramped by local preferences . He exhibited the same expansive sentiments in matters of toleration . On two occasions he supported petitions in behalf of the Moravians and other foreign Protestants in the colonies , who asked for privileges and modifications of the laws adapted to their religious scruples . In both cases their application was successful . For some time Oglethorpe was a director and deputy-governor of the Royal African Company . In this situation he was made acquainted with the circumstances of an African slave , who was then in Maryland , and whose story is fraught with a lively and romantic interest . Ayoub Ibn Soliman Ibrahim , ( Job , the son of Solomon the son of Abraham , ) for such was the slave 's name , was a native of Bunda in central Africa . His father was governor of Bunda . While on a journey to the river Gambia , Job had been captured by a party of Mandingoes , and sold to the Captain of a British slave vessel . Thence he was transported to Annapolis , in Maryland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of a kind master . // Job was a Mahometan , and strict in observing the forms of his religion . Slips of paper were found in his possession , on which he had written strange characters . His master furnished him with paper , and indulged him in writing whatever he pleased . He took advantage of this favor , and wrote a letter to his father . It was forwarded to England , and was ascertained by the learned men at Oxford to be written in the Arabic character and language . A translation was procured , which came to the knowledge of Oglethorpe as a Director of the African Company . His compassion was so much awakened by the contents of the letter , that he immediately took measures to have Job redeemed and brought to England at his own charge . This was effected , and Job remained in England , known by the name of " the African Prince , " till he had acquired * competent knowledge of the language , and then he returned to his native country . Letters were afterwards received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England , filled with grateful acknowledgments for the kindnesses they had rendered , and containing some valuable information respecting the African trade . One of these letters was communicated by Sir Hans Sloane to the Royal Society . Many of the particulars of the story of Job are brought together by Dr. Harris , which , at the same time they illustrate the benevolent character of Oglethorpe , make a curious and entertaining digression in his narrative . We come now to that portion of Oglethorpe 's life , which has mainly contributed to give celebrity to his name . For several years a project had been suggested of founding a new colony on the frontier of South Carolina . The Spaniards had settlements in Florida , and a fortified town at St. Augustine . The political relations between England and Spain were such , as to excite frequent border troubles in these remote provinces , and as almost to throw them into a state of mutual hostility . The negroes were tempted away from Carolina , and protected in Florida , even against the claims of their owners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The l ) owerful tribes of Creek and Choctaw Indians , and their tributaries , under the influence of the Spaniards , made frequent incursions , committing outrages and murders . The boundaries were neither established nor defined , and the Spaniards pretended that even // Carolina was within their limits . Weary of these encroachments , the Carolinians themselves favored the scheme of a barrier colony , which should serve as a defence against their troublesome neighbours in Florida , and a check upon the savages . Oglethorpe , if not the first mover of this enterprise , was one of the most ardent and resolute of its promoters . Twenty-one associates , gentlemen of rank , wealth , and influence , petitioned the throne for an act of incorporation . This was granted , and a charter for a new colony was obtained , dated June 9th , 1732 , which , in compliment to the king , was called Georgia . Among the objects of the petitioners , recited in the preamble , are the following . " Many of his Majesty 's poor subjects are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity , insomuch as by their labor they are not able to provide a maintenance for themselves and families ; and if they had means to defray their charges of passage , and other expenses incident to new settlenients , they would he glad to settle in any of his provinces in America ; and by cultivating the lands , at present waste and desolate , they might not only gain a comfortable subsistence for themselves and families , but also strengthen the colonies , and increase the trade , navigation , and wealth of his Majesty 's realms . " The names of twenty-one trustees , among whom was Oglethorpe , were inserted in the Charter . At thjeir own request , they and their successors were restrained from receiving any salary , fee , perquisite , or profit , either as managers of the general affairs of the colony , or for any seryices they might bestow . All the powers of government were entrusted to them , including legislation , judicial regulations , and military defence , for the period of twenty-one years , after which the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no example of a colony having been founded on principles more honorable to its projectors. - It being the first design of the trustees to afford an asylum for indigent persons , who could not themselves pay the charges of emigration , or furnish the means of support on their arrival in the colony , a fund was raised for these purposes by subscription . Individuals in various parts of the kingdom contributed liberally . Parliament made a grant of ten thousand pounds . The money was deposited in the Bank of England . Public notice was then given by the trustees , that // they were ready to receive applications from such destitute persons as were disposed to emigrate to Georgia . Their passage was to be paid ; they were to receive lands when they arrived , and provisions till they should have time to cultivate their lands ; and they were to be provided with farming tools and other utensils suited to their wants in a new country . The prisons were searched for insolvent debtors , who could procure a relief from their creditors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character and circumstances of the applicants , that none might be admitted except such as gave a fair promise of becoming sober , honest , and industrious citizens . By the charter Georgia was included between the Savannah and Altamaha rivers , and between two direct lines running from the heads of these rivers westwardly to the " south seas . " At so late a date , when the geography of this part of the continent was well known , it is remarkable that such a boundary should have been assigned , especially as it carried the limits of Georgia beyond the recognized possessions of the French on the Mississippi and of the Spaniards still further west . The tenure by which the settlers held their lands was peculiar . Fifty acres only were granted to any one person , a certain portion of which was to be cultivated within a given time under the penalty of forfeiture . No person could sell or otherwise alienate his lands without a special licence from the trustees . Male issue only could inherit , and , in default of such , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was designed to be a military barrier , it was deemed requisite that every settler , who held lands , should be a soldier . This was the reason for the last provision . To encourage industry and thrift , it was thought equally necessary that each individual should he confined to a particular portion of land , and be compelled to cultivate it . Men of substance , who chose to emigrate to Georgia , might purchase lands , but in no larger quantity than five hundred acres for any individual ; and this the purchaser was obliged to cultivate within a specified time . Some of these conditions were looked upon as hardships by the settlers , and they were afZ terwards modified . At length thirty-five families embarked from England , with Oglethorpe at their head , to seek their fortunes in the new colony . " In pursuance of the benevolent designs of // the trustees , Oglethorpe engaged in this expedition entirely at his own expense , furnished his own cabin-fare on board , and was constantly attentive , during the whole voyage , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed by the trustees to be the governor of the colony . They arrived in Charleston on the 13th of January , 1733 , where they were received with every mark of respect and kindness by the civil authorities and the inhabitants . The ship was conducted into the harbour of Port Royal , where the emigralits disembarked . Oglethorpe proceeded forward* accompanied by Colonel Bull of South Carolina , and selected a spot for a town on a bluff near Yamacraw , which he called Savannah , from the Indian name of the river which flowed along its margin . He then returned for his people , and landed them all safely at their place of destination on the 1st of February . Here they pitched their tents . A town was marked out , and they immediately commenced the work of erecting houses , and making such preparations for protection and comfort as their circumstances required . They received prompt and valuable assistance from their neighbours . Colonel Bull brought with him four laborers . Others were sent from Carolina , skilled in felling trees , and preparing plantations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . in a letter dated at Charleston , seven weeks after the first landing of the settlers , the writer speaks as follows . " Mr. Oglethorpe is indefatigable , and takes a great deal of pains . His fare is indifferent , having little else at present but salt provisions . He is extremely well beloved by all the people . The general title they give him is Father . If any of them are sick , he immediately visits them , and takes a great deal of care of them . If any difference arises , he is the person that decides it . Two happened while I was there , and in my presence ; and all the parties went away , to outward appearance , satisfied and contented with his determination . He keeps a strict discipline . I never saw one of his people drunk , nor heard one of them swear , all the time I was there . He does not allow them rum ; but in lieu gives them English beer.i It is surprising to see how cheerful the men go to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are no idlers here . Even the boys and girls . do their part . " Already land had been ploughed , and wheat // sown . Ewo or three gardens had also been planted with divers seeds of vegetables , shrubs , and trees , for the common benefit of the settlers . A palisade to enclose the town was begun . Oglethorpe wisely regarded it as a matter of the first importance to be on good terms with the aborigines . A small tribe dwelt near Savannah , at the head of whom was Tomo Chichi , a venerable personage , past the age of fourscore . Years had added wisdom to a mind naturally strong , and experience had softened in his character the rough features of the savage warrior . He was disposed to be the friend of the white man , and he met Oglethorpe 's advances in a temper of peace and amity . Following the example of Penn , the founder of Georgia sought to secure a title to his lands from those , who held it by the best of all titles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interpreter he accordingly made a treaty with Tomo Chichi . But the old man had the sincerity to tell him , that his dominions were small , and that there were others , more powerful than himself to whom the territory chiefly belonged . Tomo Chichi undertook to be a mediator between Oglethorpe and the chiefs of the Creek Nation , and sent messengers to invite them to a conference at Savannah . In a few weeks a deputation from the Lower Creeks appeared there , chiefs and warriors to the number of about fifty . They represented eight tribes into which the confederacy of the Lower Creeks was divided . After the usual forms , Oglethorpe explained to them the motives that had brought him to America , and expressed his desire to obtain a cession of a part of their territory , to live in peace with them , and to enter into a treaty of friendship and trade . Ouechachumpa , " a very tall old man , " replied in the name of the deputies . He yielded to the white men the palm of superiority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Spirit , who dwelt above and all around , had sent the English thither for the good of the natives , " and finally concluded with the generous offer of all the lands , which the Creeks did not want for themselves . Eight buck-skins , one for each tribe , laid at Oglethorpe 's feet , served to confirm his words . The other chiefs signified their assent in short speeches . Nor was Tomo Chichi an idle spectator . His speech on the occasion may be taken as a fair specimen of Indian elo // quence . " When these white men came , " said he , " I feared that they would drive us away , for we were weak ; but they promised not to molest us . We wanted corn and other things , and they have given us supplies ; and now , of our small means , we make them presents in return . Here is a buffalo skin , adorned with the head and feathers of an eagle . The eagle signifies speed , and the buffalo strength . The English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffalo . Like the eagle they flew hither over great waters ; and like the buffalo nothing can withstand them . But the feathers of the eagle are soft , and signify kindness ; and the skin of the buffalo is covering , and signifies protection . Let these , then , remind them to be kind , and to protect us . " The treaty ended by a most liberal grant of lands , on the north between Savannah and Ogechee rivers , and along the seacoast to the head of tide-water as far as the Altamaha ; with all the islands except three , which the Indians reserved for hunting and fishing . They also retained a little tract near Yamacraw bluW " as an encampment , when they should come to visit their beloved friends in that vicinity . " Oglethorpe took care not to be outdone by his guests in the value and variety of his presents . The treaty was sent to England , and confirmed by the trustees . Meantime the emigrants advanced prosperously in their labors at Savannah . They worked in common , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been furnished by the trustees . At the end of five months they had erected twenty-one houses , and made other improvements . The town was then divided into wards , and a house-lot was assigned to each freeholder . Municipal regulations were established , and the town assumed the aspect of a thriving and well-ordered community . Oglethorpe 's thoughts were turned to the protection , as well as to the internal prosperity of his colony . Forty miles from Savannah , on the banks of the Ogechee , he constructed a fort , which he put under the command of Captain McPherson , with a small detachment of rangers . This he called Fort */1rgyle , in compliment to his friend the Duke of that name . He made an excursion among the islands in a row-boat to the mouth of the Altamaha , and on his way back ascended the Ogechee as far as the fort ; thus acquiring a knowledge of the geography and resources of the country // from personal observation . He visited Charleston , where he met with an honorable and flattering reception from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure than the arrival of a company of Saltzburgers , who designed to settle in his colofly . These pilgrims had been banished from their native land in Bavaria , on account of their religious opinions . Oglethorpe had taken a lively interest in their cause before he left England , and had requested the trustees to extend to them the hand of friendship and protection , and offer them an asylum in Georgia . This advice had been followed ; and the vessel , which brought the wanderers to America , under the auspices of the trustees , arrived at Charleston on the 7th of March , 1734 , whilst Oglethorpe was then preparing to depart for Europe . He delayed his voyage , that he might assist them in selecting a suitable place for a settlement . In company with their leader , the Baron Von Reck , and their two clergymen , Bolzius and Gronau , he returned to Georgia . They chose for their residence a tract of land on the banks of a small stream between the Savannah and the Ogechee rivers . Here the Saltzburgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Savannah , by the orders of Oglethorpe , aided them in building their houses . The affairs of the colony now requiring his presence in England , he embarked in the . Jlldborough man-of-war , and arrived at the Isle of Wight on the 16th of June , after an absence of a year and seven months . He prevailed on Tomo Chichi , his wife , nephew , and six other Indians , mostly chiefs , to cross the ocean with him , thinking it might be useful to the future interests of the colony for these people to be impressed , from personal observation , with the power and resources of England . Tomo Chichi had views of his own in making the voyage . He seemed to possess an enlargement of mind , which few Indians , in their wild state , have ever shown . When he was introduced to the King , he said , " I am come in my old days , so I can not expect to obtain any advantage for myself ; but I am come for the good of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and be instructed in your language and religion . " The Indians were much caressed . They stayed four months in England , and then embarked for Georgia , apparently delighted with their visit , and leaving a favorable impression behind // them . The Muses were excited by their presence . Tomo Chichi was honored with an Ode . Oglethorpe applied himself assiduously to his great work , and procured many salutary regulations to be adopted by the trustees , for the good government and prosperity of his colony . Parliament made a new grant in aid of the funds . The importation of ruin , and of every other kind of ardent spirits , was prohibited . The same prohibition was extended to negro slaves . Since slavery was admitted in all the other colonies , and since , at this time , there were by estimation in South Carolina alone forty thousand blacks , and only five thousand white inhabitants , this latter prohibition may seem remarkable . It was not without due reflection and good reasons , however , that the trustees came to this resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide an asylum for the poor , to whom lands were given , the charges of whose emigration were paid , and whom it was miportant , for their own success and happiness , to train to habits of industry . This end would be defeated , if the labor of slaves were allowed . Moreover , the cost of slaves would be more than the funds of the trustees could bear . Again , in a situation so near the Spanish frontiers , the slaves would be enticed away as they had been from South Carolina ; and in no case could they be relied on for military defence . The danger of insurrection had already been felt in Carolina . It is fair to presume , likewise , that motives of humanity may have operated to some extent upon the trustees , although the reasons assigned were those of policy . Other reasons , publicly urged , might have raised up an opposition to their scheme , since the slave-trade was largely carried on in England , and the merchants engaged in that trade had always possessed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their traffic . Laws were passed in the colonies , on more occasions than one , prohibiting the introduction of slaves , which laws were annulled by the British government , because they encroached upon the privileges of the African merchants . Whilst Oglethorpe was in England , a valuable accession was made to his colony . One hundred and thirty Highlanders , from the neighbourhood of Inverness , in Scotland , with fifty women and children , emigrated to Georgia . The larger portion of these emigrants were aided by the trustees , but // several among them went out on their own account , and took with them laborers and servants . These hardy Highlanders were destined to settle on the frontier of the colony , and to form a barrier of defence . After touching at Savannah , they proceeded to the Altamaha River , ascended it about sixteen miles , and established themselves at a place which they called Darien . Here they began to build a town , named by them JV'ew Inverness . Twenty families of Jews had also arrived in Georgia , who formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baron Von Reck , who accompanied the Saltzburgers to Georgia , had returned to Germany , and persuaded another party of his persecuted countrymen to follow the fortunes of their brethren in the new world . The charge of transporting them from their homes to London was paid by the Soi*iety for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts . They were then taken under the protection of the trustees . At length a new body of emigrants was collected , sufficient in number , including the Saltzburgers , to require two ships . In one of these ships Oglethorpe embarked . They arrived in Georgia on the 5th of February , 1736 . Religious instruction for the new settlers , and the conversion of the Indians to Christianity , were among the primary objects of the benevolent persons in England , who were the patrons of this enterprise . Pains had been taken , therefore , to enlist the services of able and zealous clergymen . The celebrated John Wesley , and his brother , Charles Wesley , who had then begun to be shining lights in the church , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came over with the emigrants . Their arrival , and the condition of the colony , are well described by Dr. Harris . " They had experienced a tempestuous voyage , and had a very rough passage , but now the weather was fine ; the land breezes refreshed them as the ships lay quietly moored , and they hailed with delight the land of promise , the borders of which stretched before them ; where , says Wesley , the groves of pines along the shores made an agreeable prospect , showing , as it were , the verdure and bloom of spring in the depth of winter . A night of peaceful slumber passed ; and , about eight o'clock on Friday morning , they went ashore on a small uninhabited island , where Oglethorpe led them to a rising ground* and they all knelt and returned thanks to God for // their safe arrival . Leaving the people , as there was a fine spring , and a pond of pure water , to wash their clothes and refresh themselves , he went himself , attended by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was received , under the discharge of all their cannon , by the freeholders in arms , with the constables and tithing men at their head . He introduced to them the clergymen and gentlemen by whom he was accompanied , and congratulated the colonists on the religious advantages which they were about to derive from these pious missionaries ; and here they passed the Sunday . Just three years had elapsed since the settlement commenced , and the celebration of the anniversary on the opening week was rendered more observable and gladdening by the return of the founder to share and grace the festivities of the occasion . But , anidst all the greetings and inquiries of the throng around him , he was not unmindful of the new comers . He made it his earliest care , as soon as the articles could be got ready , to send a boat with provisions and refreshments for the people on board the ships and at the island ; and soon after made them a visit himself , and carried with him , a still further supply of beef , pork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread , beer , turnips , and garden greens . This was not only peculiarly relishing , after the salted sea-fare rations , but gratifying and encouraging , from the evidence it gave that a settlement , begun only three years ago , by a people in circumstances like theirs , could produce such plenty . And , while these attentions evinced the thoughtful regard of their conductor to their comfort and welfare , they increased their sense of obligation , awakened their gratitude , and strengthened their reliance . " As Oglethorpe went round , and visited the families in their dwellings , he was gratified with perceiving what improvements had been made in the town and its vicinity ; that about two hundred houses had been built , trees set out on the sides of the streets and public squares , and a large garden laid out , and now under cultivation . This had engaged his early attention , and was a favorite project , as of general interest and utility . It was situated at the east of the town , on the sloping bank , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with regularity and taste ; and intended , primarily , to supply the settlers with legumes , culinary roots , radishes , and salads , till they could prepare homestead-plats for raising them . The principal purpose , however , was for a nursery of white-mulberry trees for the raising of silkworms and from which the people could be supplied with young trees , that all the families might be more or less engaged in this ref // erence to the filature . There was , also , a nursery Coming on , of apple , pear , peach , and plum trees , for transplantation . On the borders of the walks were orange , olive , and fig-trees , pomegranates , and vines . In the more sunny part there was a collection of tropical plants , by way of experiment , such as coffee , cacon , cotton , &amp;c. , together with some medicinal plants , procured by Dr. William Houston in the West Indies , whither he had been sent by Sir Hans Sloane to collect them for Georgia . The expenses of this mission had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which his Grace , the Duke of Richmond , the Earl of Derby , the Lord Peters , and the Apothecaries ' Company , liberally contributed . The Doctor having died at Jamaica , the celebrated botanist Philip Miller was now his successor . " All hands were now set to work ; some to prepare houses , barracks , and lodgments for the new comers ; some to unlade the vessels , and store the cargo , and some to extend the wharf . The General , also , made a contract with persons for laying out and clearing the roads , and for making fortifications at the south . " - pp. 1*25- . Ji29 . After this time Oglethorpe is frequently called the General , from which it would appear that this military title had recently been conferred upon him . It was his first care to provide a place of settlement for the Saltzburgers . They finally joined their brethren at Ebenezer . A deputation from that settlement waited on Oglethorpe , and requested that they might remove to another place . They complained that their lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that they had constructed a bridge across the river , erected several houses , and made considerable progress in cultivating the lands , and he recommended to them not to abandon a place , which already exhibited such fruits of their industry and toil . Not being able to change their minds , however , he consented to their removal , and they commenced another town ten miles further east , at the Red Bluff on the bank of the Savannah River . The town of Augusta had already been laid out , and a garrison was stationed there by order of the trustees . It became the principal place of rendezvous for the Indian traders . The English emigrants required his next attention . The destination of a large portion of these was the southern border of the colony , where it was proposed to build another town . A sloop was despatched with pioneers , and the Gen // eral went forward himself in a small boat for the purpose of selecting a suitable spot and making preparations . He passed along the coast among the islands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , and then went up the Altamaha River to visit the Highlanders at Darien . They complimented him with a military reception . " He found them under arms , in their uniform of plaid , equipped with broadswords , targets , and muskets . " They received him with every demonstration of respect and joy . When he returned to St. Simon 's , he was met there by the old chief Tomo Chichi , his nephew Toonahowi , and about forty other Indian warriors and hunters . They came to make a formal cession of the islands , which they had given up to him in the treaty . Two boats were fitted out for an excursion among the islands , accompanied hy another containing an escort of armed Highlanders . They were in the vicinity of the Spaniards , who it was known looked with a jealous eye upon all their movements . The first island at which they touched was by the Indians called Wissoe . The Spaniards called it &amp;rn Pedro . But it was now to have a new name . " Toonahowi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland , desired that it should bear his name , saying , He gave me this watch , that we might know how time went ; and we will remember him while time goes ; and this place must have his name , that others may be reminded of him . " A fort was built there , and called St. . dndrew 's , at the request of the Highianders . Here they came to the island Santa Maria , which Spanish name was changed to .1/melia , in honor of her Royal Highness . After thus visiting and naming the islands , the party returned to St. Simon 's , where they found the works well advanced , a fort completed , and thirty-seven palmetto houses erected . A town was laid out , called Frederica , with broad streets , which were afterwards fringed with orange trees . The settlers came from Savannah , lots were assigned to them , and the elements of a new community began to assume a proper consistency and order . A strong battery was built at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the space of three years , about six hundred emigrants arrived in Georgia ; of whom nearly two hundred and fifty were from Germany . The labors of Oglethorpe were unceasing . In all cases // he submitted to the privations and hard fare of those around him , encouraging them by his example as well as guiding them by his counsels . He watched over the interests of every part of the colony , attending equally to the wants of destitute individuals , and the public welfare of the whole . iDiscontents had arisen in South Carolina respecting the Indian trade . The Carolinians conceived that their traders met with an undue interference from the mode of granting licenses prescribed by the trustees of Georgia . A committee of the Assembly of South Carolina held a conference with Oglethorpe on the subject at Savannah , in which the business was amicably discussed and adjusted . But his greatest anxiety arose from the aspect of affairs in Florida . The political relations between England and Spain portended an approaching rupture . The symptoms of feeling , which had been shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing but good will or a neighbourly disposition . In the weak and exposed condition of his colony , Oglethorpe was fully aware of the necessity of cautious and conciliatory steps on his part . Communications had passed between him and the governor of St. Augustine , but without any satisfactory results . A treaty was concluded , which afforded a glimmering of hope , but this was speedily dissipated by a message from the governor , who stated that a commissioner had arrived from Cuba , who desired a personal interview with him . This commissioner denied the validity of the treaty , and demanded a relinquishment of a part of the territory claimed as within the limits of Georgia . His demand not being complied with , he assumed a tone of menace , and went off without the usual forms of ceremony . Foreseeing the probable consequences , Oglethorpe sailed for England with the view of laying the case before the ministry . At this point of his narrative , Dr. Harris takes occasion to speak of the labors of the Wesleys in Georgia , and of Whitefield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow him through this digression , but we recommend it to our readers as an entertaining and instructive chapter . Whitefield 's charitable scheme of an Orphan-House in Georgia is well known . Few men have labored so much for the good of others . If his zeal sometimes misled his judgment , his aims were always high and pure . Franklin , who knew him // intimately , said of him , while he was preaching in America , " He is a good man , and I love him . " His enemies charged him with an improper use of the money , which he collected for his Orphan House . Long after his death , Franklin vindicated him from this charge with a warmth of kind recollection and a force of remark , which attest alike the sincerity of his conviction and the grounds of his judgment . On hearing the representations of Oglethorpe , the trustees l ) etitioned the King for a military force to protect the colony . This request was the more readily granted , as there were evidences that the Spanish government was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of six hundred men and also a company of grenadiers were authorized to he raised , and Oglethorpe was appointed Commander-in-chief of the King 's forces in Carolina and Georgia . He took care to select officers of known character and worth , granting them commissions without pay , and affording them other privileges , which would stimulate their ardor and their attachment to the service . He engaged " forty supernumeraries at his own expense . " The regiment was raised in a short time , and a part of them emharked for Georgia . Oglethorpe followed with the remainder , , and an additional number of emigrants , men , women , and children , in the Hector and Blandford men-ofwar , attended by five transports . They came to anchor at St. Simon 's , on the 9th of September , 1738 . They were received with the greatest joy by the inhabitants , who had been alarmed by rumors of reinforcements having been sent to St. Augustine , and of formidable preparations at Havana for an invasion . The commander-in-chief lost no time . He inspected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attending to their execution . While he was thus employed , a treacherous plot was detected in the camp . Three soldiers had enlisted under Spanish influence as spies . They endeavoured to excite a mutiny and persuade others to desert . Their treachery was discovered in time to prevent its mischiefs . This incident was followed by another , which placed the life of the commander in imminent danger . " Some of the soldiers , who came from Gibraltar , " says Dr. Harris , " hacf been granted six months ' provisions from the King 's stores , in addition to their pay . When these rations were expended , about the middle of November , one of the // Oct. murmurers had the presumption to go up to the General , who was standing at the door with Captain Mackay , and demanded of him a continuance of the supply . To this unceremonious and disrespectful requisition the General replied , that the terms of their enlistment had been complied with ; that their pay was going on ; that they had no special favor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain any by such a rude manner of application . As the fellow became outrageously insolent , the Captain drew his sword , which the desperado snatched out of his hand , broke in two pieces , threw the hilt at him , and made off for the barrack , where , taking his gun , which was loaded , and crying out One and all ! five others , with their guns , rushed out , and , at the distance of about ten yards , the ringleader shot at the General . The ball whizzed above his shoulder , and the powder burnt his , face and scorched his clothes . Another flashed his piece twice , but the gun did not go off . The General and Captain were immediately surrounded by protectors ; and the culprits were apprehended , tried at a court-martial , and , on the first week in October , received sentence of death . The letter which gives a circumstantial account of this affair , written from Frederica , and dated December 26th , adds , Some of the officers are not very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are punished , in terrorem ; which has been delayed by the General 's forbearance . ' I quote , with pleasure , this testimony to his lenity , given by one who must have intimately known all the aggravating circumstances , because some accounts state that he took summary vengeance . " - pp. 194- 196 . Oglethorpe now hastened to Savannah , having heard unfavorable rumors of the condition of affairs in that place . The number of inhabitants within the limits of the colony was at this time more than eleven hundred . The trustees had counted much upon the culture of mulberry trees and grapes . They looked for large and profitable returns in silk and wine . It was calculated that great savings would be gained to the nation by lessening the importation of raw silk from Italy . By the conditions of settlement , every one who took up a lot of land was enjoined to plant annually a certain number of mulberry trees . A nursery was provided for the purpose in the trustees ' garden . A Piedmontese and his family , skilled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruct the settlers . But hitherto both these kinds of culture had signally failed . Samples of silk were sent to England , it is true , in sufficient quantity to make a dress for the Queen , which she condescended to wear on her birthday ; // but the enemies of the colony affirmed , that a part of these samples was procured in South Carolina ; and indeed the scheme of growing silk proved entirely unsuccessful . It was sagely argued , however , that " if twenty pounds of it can be raised there , any greater quantity may likewise with a proper number of people ; " and reasons were assigned why the climate of Georgia ought to produce better silk than that brought from Italy . Experience may yet prove these reasons to be sound , although it has made little progress towards such proof in a hundred years . Grape vines were found to flourish in the greatest luxuriance . A Portuguese Jew caused a shoot to grow as big as a walking-stick , and to the length of fourteen feet , in one season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planter contrived to manufacture a kind of wine , which Oglethorpe tasted , and pronounced it to be " something in the nature of a small French white wine , with an agreeable flavor . " This was thought a good beginning , and a fair promise , for it was said that " all young vines produce small wines at first , and the strength and goodness of it increase as the vines grow older . " Unluckily we hear nothing of the product of the vines in their more advanced age ; and the prediction of the poet was never fulfilled ; " Ev'n jarring factions shall their feuds resign , And loyal healths go round in Georgian wine . " These failures , and discourngements from other sources , had kindled a spirit of discontent at Savannah , which was nurtured and inflamed by a fe*v factious individuals , men of some importance in the colony , whose ambition or sanguine temper had inspired them with hopes , which ended in disappointment . They drew up a list of their grievances , in the form of a petition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they brought over many of the well affected to add their signatures . They complained that they were not allowed to hold their lands in fee simple . This was a reasonable complaint . The tenure prescribed by the trustees was undoubtedly a grave error in their original plan . They sighed for negroes , and deemed it a hardship that they should be deprived of the labor of slaves , which they said was absolutely necessary to a profitable cultivation of their lands . They clamored for ruin , although they did not introduce this grievance into their petition . Three of their leaders , who published a pamphlet in which they could give a more audible utterance to their com // plaints , declared the importation of rum essential to the prosperity of the colony , as affording a lucrative return for the export of timber to the West Indies . The fountains , of this trade were dried up ; rum would open them , and draW forth their fertilizing treasures . They had compassion also for the hard fate of the settlers , who were doomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted and even supplied in liberal quantities by the trustees . They say , " the experience of all the inhabitants of America will prove the necessity of qualifying water with some spirit . " Rum was the sovereign antidote to the seeds of disease ireacherously lurking in the waters of Georgia . They did not stop here ; their moral sympathies were aroused ; they would fain put a stop to the cryingsin of smuggling this potent panacea , which by their account had already run to a fearful height ; and the worst of all was , that the smugglers would take nothing but " ready money , " whereas , if the trade were laid open , the rum might be paid for in pine plank and timber . The colonists at Darien and Ebenezer protested against this petition . They particularly disapproved the introduction of slaves . In a communication to Oglethorpe , the Highlanders represented , that , being on the frontier , the slaves would run away to the Spaniards , who would offer them freedom and protection ; that the labor of white men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the slave dealers ; and be obliged to guard themselves against the negroes as well as against an invasion of the enemy . They added , " It is shocking to human nature , that any race of mankind and their posterity should be sentenced to perpetual slavery ; nor in justice can we think otherwise of it , than that they are thrown among us to be a scourge one day or other for our sins ; and , as freedom to them must be as dear as to us , what a scene of horror must it bring about ! " The Saltzburgers objected to the petition on similar grounds . They denied that the labor of blacks was necessary . Heaven had been bountiful , and their crops were abundant by the labor of their own hands . They had been told , that the soil could not be cultivated by white men ; but , say they , " we laugh at such talking . " And further , " we humbly beseech the honorable trustees not to allow that any negroes may be brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience that our fields and gardens will be always robbed // by them , and white persons be put in danger of life because of them , besides other great inconveniences . " The petition and the protests or counter petitions were laid before the trustees . They refused peremptorily to listen to the requests of the petitioners , or to change in any respect the regulations they had adopted . Several persons among the malecontents left the province , and retired to South Carolina . Leaving the matter of slavery out of the question , it can not be denied that the colonists had cause for dissatisfaction . The lands assigned to them by lot were in many cases pine barrens or swamps unfit for cultivation . The idea of planting mulberry trees on such a soil was absurd , and the requisition to clear up and subdue a certain portion of it annually was oppressive . Again , the possession of a fi*ll title to the lands , in which the owner had incorporated his labor , and the privilege of selling and transferring his estate as he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British freedom , and protected hy British laws , had a right to expect and demand . That the land was the gift of charity in the first instance , afforded no just reason for imposing burdensome restrictions . It was worth nothing till it was cultivated , and all the value it acquired was the fruit of the laborer 's toil . By the laws of nature such a property was his own . Why deny him the power of using it according to his pleasure , or as his wants might dictate ? Especially as he had only to look across the Savannah river and see his neighbours in South Carolina , placed in precisely the same circumstances , reaping all the advantages allowed by the laws of England . It would be wrong to censure the motives of the trustees ; they had no pecuniary interests to be consulted either in their private or corporate capacity ; they could not have any by the charter ; they held the land in trust for the benefit of others ; yet the elements of their plan , and their piactice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty of settling a wild country , and how superficially they reflected upon the condition , and the rights and claims , of men associated to build up a new community in the heart of a wilderness . These discontents , and the irregularities that grew out of them , could not but fill the mind of Oglethorpe with anxlety . They were now added to the cares of preparing for an expected invasion . His disinterestedness and self-sacrifice , his prudent counsels , moderation , and steadiness of pur // pose , contributed to soften asperities and restrain thoughtless excess , which , under a guidance less firm and less persuasive , might have led to fatal consequences . It was his painful duty also to correct abuses , which had crept into the administration of affairs at Savannah , and to censure the conduct of some of the public officers . Having restored order and harmony , as far as it could be done , he repaired to Charleston for the purpose of making known formally his commission as Commander-in-chief of the military forces of South Carolina and Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began a long journey of more than three hundred miles through the wilderness to the interior . His object was to hold a council with the chiefs of the Creek Indians at Coweta , one of their principal towns . The meeting was amicable , the calumet was smoked , the league of friendship was renewed ; and additional territory was granted on the seacoast extending south to the river St. John 's . Returning by the way of Fort Augusta , he there met some of the chiefs of the Chickasaws and Cherokees . While at this place he beard the intelligence , that orders had been issued by the British government for fitting out privateers against the Spaniards , and he hastened back to Savannah . It was now evident that the colony must soon become the scene of war . He took his measures accordingly ; he raised a company of rangers , summoned his Indian allies to his aid , examined into the condition of the militia and of the magazines , and called on the governor of South Carolina to contribute his proportion of troops and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little army on the southern frontier , and established his head-quarters at Frederica . A party of Spaniards landed on Amelia Island , and killed two Highlanders . Oglethorpe followed the invaders in person , made a descent on the Florida side of the St. John 's river , and drove in the Spanish guards . At the same time he sent a reconnoitring party eighty miles up the St. John 's to a fort at Picolata . On their return he ascended the river in boats with a detachment of troops and artillery , and captured the fort at Picolata and another called St. Francis , making prisoners of all the soldiers in the garrisons . From reports , which he considered worthy of credit , he learned that St. Augustine was in a comparatively defenceless // state , and contained but a small stock of provisions . He formed the design of taking the place by surprise . He despatched an express to the governor of South Carolina for assistance ; and soon afterwards went himself to Charleston in order to explain his intentions and arrange a plan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at length an act of the Assembly was passed for raising four hundred men and a company of rangers , with a supply of provisions for three months . In a nanifesto relating to the expedition , which he published at Charleston , he said , that whatever prizes or other booty might be captured from the enemy should be divided between the officers and soldiers according to the usage in his Majesty 's service , but added at the same time , that his own share should be applied for the relief of wounded soldiers , or to assist the widows and children of such as should be killed , or as a reward for brave actions . Commodore Price , who commanded a small naval armament on the coast , consisting of four ships carrying twenty guns each , and two sloops , agreed to unite with him in the expedition . These arrangements being completed , the commander-inchief employed the next three months in collecting indian auxiliaries , and in the necessary preparations . The place of rendezvous was at the mouth of the St. John 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 10th of May . Oglethorpe had passed over into Florida the day befor* , at the head of four hundred men chosen from his own regiment , with whom he invested Fort Diego and another small fort within seventeen miles of St. Augustine , both of which surrendered without opposition . The remainder of the Carolina militia , and a company of Highlanders under Captain McIntosh , joined him on his return to the mouth of the St .. John 's . His whole force , regulars , provincials , and Indians , now amounted to about two thousand men . It was ascertained that reinforcements , with supplies of provisions and ammunition , had recently entered the harbour of St. Augustine , so that the number of effective men within the town was nearly equal to Oglethorpe 's army . In naval strength , however , he was superior to the enemy , and a plan was concerted between him and the commander of the vessels for a combined attack on the town , and an attempt to carry it by storm . // They agreed upon the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three miles of St. Augustine he took possession of Fort Moosa , which had been abandoned by the garrison , and no obstacles were encountered till he found himself under the walls of the town . The signals were given for the fleet , but they were not answered . Shoal water had prevented the large ships from approaching , and the armed boats were kept at bay by the Spanish galleys . The scheme of an assault was thus defeated , and it only remained to prosecute the undertaking in the best manner that circumstances would admit . It was hoped that the town might be reduced to the necessity of surrendering by a blockade and siege . This attempt was unsuccessful . it was pursued for several days with spirit , by bombarding the castle , and skirmishes between the boats and galleys , but a reinforcement of seven hundred men from Havana , with military stores and provisions , contrived to enter the harbour undiscovered , and so far increased the strength and resources of the garrison as to discourage any further operations . The siege was raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Georgia . The most unfortunate incident of this expedition occurred at Fort Moosa . During the siege , Colonel Palmer was stationed there with a body of one hundred and fifty volunteers , brave men from the Scotch settlement at Darien . These were surprised by three hundred Spaniards , and nearly all cut to pieces . Want of success is usually a ground for censuring the conduct of a commander . Oglethorpe could not hope to escape the penalty common to so many able generals that had gone before him . The Carolinians and Georgians had looked for victory and glory , instead of disaster and defeat ; the downfall , and not the triumph , of their enemies . Expressions of bitter disappointment and murmurs of dissatisfaction were loudly uttered . They must lay the blame somewhere , and it was easy to place it on the head of their military chief . On his part he complained , that the Carolinians feebly supported him in the first instance , that they did not fulfil their engagements to the extent he had expected , that their militia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home in the time of greatest need ; and also , that the fleet did not render the service that had been confidently anticipated . Moreover , difficulties had intervened , which no sagacity could have foreseen , // and which no wisdom or skill could remove . When public opinion settled down into a more quiescent state , the voice of censure gradually died away , and the conviction prevailed , that the causes of the failure ought not all to be thrown upon the General . His main error seems to have been , that he did not obtain a more accurate knowledge of the shoals and depth of water in the harbour of St. Augustine , and of the actual strength and condition of the garrison ; yet this may have been impracticable . The question still remains , whether it was prudent to undertake the expedition while this uncertainty existed . These events took place in the year 1740 . During the year following there was comparative tranquillity , and Oglethorpe was principally occupied with the civil government of the colony , and in guarding the frontiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On one occasion , with an armed sloop and schooner , he went in chase of a large Spanish ship , which had anchored near the mouth of the Savannah river . Losing sight of this ship in a storm , he sailed for the harbour of St. Augustine , passed over the bar , and engaged two armed vessels for an hour and a quarter , with the Intention to hoard them ; but they pushed towards the town and were rescued by six galleys , which came out and joined in the action . It was at length ascertained , that the Spaniards were preparing a formidable armament at Havana for an invasion of Georgia and South Carolina . In May , 1743 , a squadron sailed from that port for St. Augustine , with a large body of troops under the command of the Spanish general Rodondo . The expedition was to be commanded by Monteano , the governor of East Florida . The approach of the Havana fleet was discovered by the captain of an English cruiser , and the intelligence was immediately conveyed to Oglethorpe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governor of South Carolina , requesting the aid of that province . This application was coldly received , and the inhabitants of Charleston , by a strange want of foresight , mistaken policy , or distrust of the military abilities of Oglethorpe after his recent failure in Florida , resolved to prepare for their own defence and leave Georgia to its fate . A small naval force was finally fitted out , but it did not reach the scene of action in time to render any service towards repelling the invaders . // Oglethorpe repaired to Frederica , and engaged in the most active preparations for meeting the enemy . He collected his forces at that place , consisting of his own regiment , Highlanders , provincial rangers , and Creek and Cherokee warriors , who had cheerfully obeyed his summons . His whole number of men , however , amounted to but little more than seven hundred . On the 28th of June , the Spanish fleet , consisting of thirty-six sail , large and sinaI I , appeared off the bar at the mouth of the Altamaha river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the river , exchanging shots as they passed along with Fort St. Simon 's and the batteries . They landed on the island , within a short distance of Frederica , and erected a battery , upon which they mounted twenty cannon . Finding his works at the south end of the island no longer available , Oglethorpe spiked the cannon and retired with the troops to Frederica . It was now the principal effort of the Spaniards to force a passage through the woods to that town . Oglethorpe employed the main body of his troops in strengthening the fortifications , and sent out scouting parties to watch the motions of the enemy and obstruct their advance . Dense forests and deep morasses were to be passed by the Spaniards , and these offered the Highlanders and Indians good opportunities for ambuscades and for harassing and annoying them at every step . The invaders were repulsed in two skirmishes , in which Oglethorpe 's men fought with signal bravery , spurred on by the ardor and courage of their commander . Many of the enemy were killed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were followed by others , till at length the Spaniards retreated to the place of their first encampment , and began to entrench themselves more strongly tinder the protection of the guns in their ships . In this state of things , Oglethorpe was informed by two English prisoners , who had effected their escape , that there were great dissensions in the Spanish camp , on account of a want of provisions , sickness , and their recent discomfitures , insomuch that the troops from Havana had withdrawn from those of St. Augustine , and encamped by themselves at a distance . Oglethorpe instantly resolved to take advantage of this posture of affairs , and to attack one of these camps by surprise . He marched in the night with a select body of men , till he came within a mile and a half of the enemy 's // camp . He then halted his troops , and went forward in person with a small party to reconnoitre . While he was near the Spanish lines , one of his attendants , a Frenchman , fired his musket to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy . It was now necessary to make a hasty retreat to Frederica . Chagrined at this disappointment , Oglethorpe hit upon a stratagem , which accomplished his purpose more effectually than he could have hoped to do it by a battle . This transaction has been variously related by historians , but Dr. Harris has published an account of it for the first time , in Oglethorpe 's own words , written a few days after it happened , in a letter to the Duke of Newcastle , as follows : A Frenchman who , without my knowledge , was come down among the volunteers , fired his gun and deserted . Our Indians in vain pursued , but could not take him . Upon this , concluding that we should be discovered , I divided the drums into different parts , and they heat the Grenadier 's march for about half an hour ; then ceased , and we marched back in silence . The next day I prevailed with a prisoner , and gave him a sum of money , to carry a letter privately and deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was written in French , as if from a friend of his , telling him he had received the money ; that he should try to make the Spaniards believe the English were weak ; that he should undertake to pilot up their boats and galleys , and then bring them under th' woods , where he knew the hidden batteries were ; that if he could bring that about he should have double the reward he had already received ; and that the French deserters should have all that had been promised to them . The Spanish prisoner got into their camp , and was immediately carried before the General , Don Manuel de Monteano . He was asked how he escaped , and whether he had any letters ; but denying he had any , was strictly searched , arid the letter found , and he , upon being pardoned , confessed that he had received money to deliver it to the Frenchman , ( for the letter was not directed . ) The Frenchman denied his knowing any thing of the contents of the letter , or having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a council of war was held , and they decreed the Frenchman to be a double spy ; but General Monteano would not suffer him to be executed , having been employed by him . However , they embarked all their troops with such precipitation , that they left behind their cannon , &amp;c. , and those dead of their wounds , unburied. " - pp. 264 , 265. // Thus ended this formidable Spanish invasion , which in the outset seemed so threatening , that it filled all the southern colonies with alarm . After burning and destroying the works and houses on the south end of St. Simon 's island , the Spaniards sailed out of the river with their whole fleet , a part of which , containing the Havana troops , put to sea , and the remainder returned to St. Augustine . An army consisting of more than three thousand disciplined soldiers ( some say nearly five thousand ) , supported by a strong naval armament , had been repulsed and driven off , in less than two weeks ' time , by a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , and without any maritime succours . Neither the armed ships from Charleston , nor any of the British men-of-war stationed on the coast , arrived in the river till after the Spaniards had embarked . No one pretended to question the wisdom or military skill of the commander in this defence . The clamors of his enemies ceased , and they were compelled to join the general voice in assigning to him the chief merit of saving the southern provinces from the ravages of war , if not from defeat and conquest . In the early part of the next year another invasion was threatened . Oglethorpe determined to anticipate the movements of the enemy , and , with a party of grenadiers , rangers , and Highianders , he crossed the St. John 's and marched into Florida . A sharp action ensued at Fort Diego , in which forty Spaniards were killed , and the rest of the garrison fled to St. Augustine . He pursued them almost to the walls of the town , hoping to draw the enemy out , having prepared an ambuscade at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stratagem was discovered by the Spaniards , who did not choose to hazard a conflict . He then retreated slowly to the St. John 's , whence he returned to Frederica . The designs of the enemy for the present season were abandoned . The province being now in a state of tranquillity , and there being no immediate danger of further hostilities , Oglethorpe set sail for England , where his affairs required his attention . He arrived in London on the 25th of September , 1743 . Here he found that Colonel Cook , who h*ad been an officer of engineers in the Georgia service , had lodged a series of charges against him in the war office , tending to impeach his character , and to reflect on his honor and fidelity in regard to his conduct as governor of the colony . Oglethorpe insisted , that the charges should be ex // amined by a court-martial . Under pretence that some of the most important witnesses were in America , whose testimony must be procured , Cook contrived to delay the investigation for nearly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were nineteen in number , the board of officers decided , that " the whole , and every article thereof , was groundless , false , and malicious . " This report was approved by the king , and Cook was dismissed from the army . Oglethorpe returned no more to Georgia . Early in the year 1745 he was promoted to the rank of Major General . He commanded four companies of cavalry , which , as a compliment to their leader , were called the " Georgia Rangers . " He served in the northern campaign against the rebels under Marshal Wade . From this time he continued for several years to sit in Parliament , hut he chiefly sought his employments and his pleasures in private life , spending the summers on his estate at Godalming , and the winters in London . Possessing a lively imagination , a refined taste , and a fondness for letters , he was the companion of Johnson , Goldsmith , Burke , Reynolds , and the rest of that illustrious circle , whose genius adorned the British metropolis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they lived . We have a pleasing reminiscence of him in Hannah More 's letters . Speaking of an interview with him when he had passed the age of ninety , she says , " He perfectly realizes all my ideas of Nestor ; his literature is great ; his knowledge of the world extensive ; and his faculties as bright as ever . " On another occasion she says ; " Burke talked a great deal of politics with General Oglethorpe ; he told him , with great truth , that he looked upon him as a more extraordinary person than any he had ever read of , for he had founded the province of Georgia , had absolutely called it into existence , and had lived to see it severed from the empire which created it , and become an independent State . " His heart and his hands were always open to the calls of suffering humanity ; his days were filled up with benevolent actions ; and if it may be said of any man , that his life was a benefit to his race , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 30th of June , 1785 , at the advanced age of ninety-six , retaining the vigor and elasticity of his mind to the last . We are unwilling to close our remarks without one word more in commendation of Dr. Harris 's work . In going carefully through it , we have been struck with the extent of his // Oct. research , th' fidelity with which he has selected his facts , arid the judgment with which he has combined them . His references also are valuable , not only as verifying his statements , but as guiding others who may desire to pursue the subject further , and consult original sources . The illustrative matter in the Appendix is not the least interesting part of the volume . Among these is a well-digested and instructive tract on the history of the silk culture in Georgia , by Dr. Stevens , a gentleman well known for his zeal in prosecuting researches relating to the early history of the country . Georgia still wants an historian . McCall 's History has its merits , but the author labored under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the State has set a noble example by being the first to procure from the public offices in England a copy of all its colonial papers . As materials of history they are invaluable . New York has recently followed this example , and we trust the other States will not be long in rendering such a token of gratitude to their founders , and to those worthy progenitors , who struggled to guard their infancy and watch over their growing years . Congress could hardly bestow a greater benefit upon the country , than by procuring a copy of all these papers and depositing it in Washington . Our colonial history can never be fully , fairly , and accurately written without them . The principal governments of Europe have been for many years employed , at much expense , in gathering up and publishing their early records . Shall we , who love to laud the deeds of our ancestors , and who live by the results of their toil , be contented with less intelligence or less patriotism ? A nation exists in its history . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A name , and only a name . Take away the examples and the recorded wisdom of the past , and what ray of light would be left for our guidance ? What could we do , but grope in the darkness of inexperience , and wander in the mazes of perpetual childhood ? If we are bound to respect the claims of posterity , we likewise owe a debt to our ancestors . Let us pay it as an act of justice to them , and of wholesome instruction to ourselves . Let us read their history , study their example , imitate their virtues , and cherish with a religious reverence and patriotic zeal the institutions they have founded.
