txt CHINA , although it has been long known in its general features , has recently , from the concurrence of circumstances , attracted to itself the special , attention of foreign nations . Occupying , with Tartary , a territorial domain more extensive than the whole of Europe , and embracing within its jurisdiction a population , which , notwithstanding the conflicting statistical calculations that we derive from various sources , may he estimated at about four hundred millions ; its actual condition involves the fortunes of one-third of the human race . So great an interest has , in fact , heen manifested regarding this extraordinary nation , that collections have been brought into our own country which were made at a great expense in various parts of the empire , exhibiting the costumes of various ranks , the mansions , vessels , temples , tombs , hridges , shops , paintings , utensils , and manufactures of the country , and indeed of everything which shows the real character of the people . A museum of this kind was opened in Philadelphia , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short time , was removed to the city of London . But the magnificent cabinet of this sort which is now in Boston , is probably the most extensive in the world , and contains everything of importance relating to that singular nation . There is another consideration which makes the condition of China an interesting topic to us at the present time , and this is the negotiation of a commercial treaty between our own government and that empire , placing the commerce of the Union , that has been heretofore subjected to capricious and oppressive exactions in the Chinese ports , upon an equal footing with that of the most favored nations . It is our design , in the present article , aided by numerous works which have been published upon the subject , to enter into a somewhat extended consideration of this nation , the condition of the people , and the character of the institutions . The territory of China is divided into eighteen provinces , extending from north to south a distance of about twelve hundred geographical miles , and hut a little short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of climate , it is to this circumstance that we may attribute the fact , that the people are admitted to be the most industrious , wellordered and intelligent , of any of the Asiatic nations . It is watered by two principal rivers  --  the Yang-tse Keang , and the Yellow River -- which flow through the central part of the territory and its most salubrious climates , and being iiiferior in size only to the Amazon and the Mississippi , they are peculiarly favorable to navigation by steamboats . Besides the position of the eastern part of the empire upon the sea-coast , which affords to that l ) ortion a foreign commerce to an almost unlimited extent , it possesses a vast inland trade , which is prosecuted upon the Imperial Canal , extending from a point near Pekin through the interior for a distance of six hundred geographical miles , and the various waters by which the country is intersected . Its soil although unequal in fertility is sufficiently productive , with industry , to maintain its teeming population , and it is understood that ahout twothirds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is the chief support of the populationthe soil , by artificial forcing , being made to produce two or three crops during the year . The common garden vegetables in use with us , may also be produced , hut little attention is expended upon their cultivation ; it yields also , to some extent , the species of cotton for which the country has been long celebrated . Silk , another principal staple of the empire-although of course not an agricultural product , yet deriving its existence in a great measure from the soil-has long been produced , as is well known , to a considerable amount , the provinces of Che-keang , Keang-nan , Hoope and Sze-chuen , being peculiarly favorable for the production of line silk . The actual condition of China appears to have been but partially known to the people of ancient times . The Arabs first gave us a distinct account of the country , but it is to Marco Polo , a Venetian , who visited the court of Cublai-Khcn , the Sovereign of the Tartars and Emperor of China , about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the empire-this traveler being re // garded as the most authentic writer of his age respecting that region . The Catholic missionaries , who-whatever may have been their motives , and we do not design to discuss them hereappear to have been the advance-guard of civilization in our north-western wilderness , early penetrated to the interior of the empire , even to Pekin ; and from their urbanity and practical acquisitions , were received into imperial favor , and some of them resided within the circle of the court . It is from the journals of these missionaries that we obtain our most satisfactory knowledge concerning the early condition of the government ; and we are designing to draw some important light from that source , during the progress of the present paper . During the year 1546 , the Portuguese made their first appearance in Canton , for the purpose of trade ; and about the middle of the sixteenth century they established themselves at Macau , with the privilege of self-government , for the consideration of five hundred taels per annum , by the way of ground-rent  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the reign of Queen Elizabeth in 1546 , the English also first made an attempt to establish a permanent trade with China , but the vessels which they dispatched were wrecked on their way out , and in consequence of the intrigues of the Portuguese , their commercial projects , as well as those of the East India Company , were unsuccessful , until somewhere about the beginning of the last century . The gradual increase of the trade of China with Great Britain , until it finally exceeded that of any other nation , at length induced the Embassy of Lord Macartney , which was dispatched from England during the year 1792 , in the Lion , a sixty-four gun ship . It was the design of this expedition , to extend if possible the commerce of Great Britain with China to other ports besides Canton , to rescue it from the exactions which it had endured from the caprice of the local officers of the sea-ports , and to place the interests of British trade upon a more liberal , certain , and solid footing , in reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same oppressive and capricious policy that has marked their course down to the last invasion of their territory by a British fleet . This Embassy , which succeeded in advancing to Pekin , and in conciliating the local government , was upon the whole attended with favorable results . It was followed up soon after by a letter from the King of Great Britain to the Emperor , with presents ; and with letters and presents also from the Ministers and from the Chairman of the East India Company to the Viceroy . Notwithstanding that Embassy , however , interruptions to British commerce were resumed , in consequence of the caprice or corruption of the local government . The continuance of the obstacles which were presented in the port of Canton to fair trade , induced the Embassy of Lord Amherst , which was dispatched in 1816 , but having proceeded to the interior , it appears to have beea suddenly checked in consequence of the refusal on the part of the British Ambassador to perform the prostrations which were required  --  a point either of etiquette or of homage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Envoys of foreign nations . Meanwhile our own commerce with China was commenced in 1784 , and it has been gradually increasing , so that at the present time the number of American vessels employed in the trade is second to that of Great Britain only . The mode in which China was first colonized is unknown . According to the opinion of Sir William Jones , the Empire was originally peopled in part from India ; but that opinion appears to be entirely conjectural . The Tartars , who now comprise a considerable part of the population , have recently become more especially mingled with the original Chinese inhabitants since the accession of the Mantchou Tartar dynasty to the imperial throne . In forming a judgment respecting the character of the people , it must be remembered that they are not to be estimated by those tests which we apply to the civilized nations of the West . They are distinct in their principles , character and institutions . They are in their essential traits , Orientials  --  the loyal arid self-satisfied subjects of an Asiatic despotismidolators in religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation-docile , quiet , pacific , and effeminate , with habits of industry and even ingenuity in material enterprise , not common among more civilized states-vain of their empire as the most ancient and pol ) ulous upon the globe , and from long habit regarding all other nations as subordinate to them in dignity and power . In the first place , the social divisions of the population are peculiar , and indicate // a political system entirely different from that of any other nation of modern times . The learned are held in the highest estimation-husbandmen , or rather agriculture , follows , for it would seem that the respect is paid to the importance of the art rather than to those who are employed in its exercise-manufactures rank next , and merchants come last-an estimate , which , however just in the primitive state , could hardly prove so , in an advanced stage of civilization . The political structure of the empire exhibits the features of a full and complete despotism . So far as the powers which are conferred upon him are concerned , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despot . He is deemed by his subjects the Son of Heaven-he is the sole fountain of honor and office , and he is worshiped with divine honors and with a homage which would seem to belong only to the Deity . His edicts are law , and the persons of his subjects , if not their property , are at his disposal . Those edicts , when addressed to the proper tribunal or other authority , are promulgated in the Pekin Gazette-a sort of Court Journal , containing reports to the Emperor , or mandates from him . Enthroned in that vast city , Pekin , the most populous metropolis in the world , he preserves around him all the pageantry and magnificence of a Court , and he alone , of all the people of the empire , sacrifices to Heaven with incense and victims , which are heaped around the temples there erected for this purpose . His interior Council Chamber consists of four chief counselors , two of them Tartars and two Chinese . Subordinate to these is a number of assessors , who with the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being derived from the Imperial College or National Institute of the FIan-lin . There is also provided for occasions when great secrecy or unusual dispatch is required , a body of Privy Counselors , who act upon such occasions as an extraordinary tribunal . The only rank , beside the Emperor , hereditary in the state , are the descendants of the Mantchou Tartar family , of the race of the imperial line , who have small revenues allowed them for subsistence , but who possess no effective political power , and whose principal province it is to swell the pageantry of state . There are two lines of this imperial kindred , the first being descended from the Emperor , and the second in the collateral line  --  the former of whom are invested with the right of wearing the yellow , and the second the red girdle . Their dress and equipage , their establishments and retinue , are each regulated by minute rules-some possessing the privilege of the decoration of the peacock 's feather , and others that of the green sedan . These constitute the only hereditary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the grand founder of the present etherial system of the empire , ame entitled to hereditary honors . But the Emperor is , after all , in point of fact , the sole director of the nation ; and from his office all the streams of political honor flow ; he wields an irresponsible power , and has the right of appointing his successor , even out of the circle of the imperial family . Besides the Emperor and suite , the official aristocracy of China is composed of those individuals who are selected from the body of the empire for their literary talent , and they consist of the viceroys who are the governors of the several provinces , and the civil and military mandarins , besides numerous other subordinate officers . The administration of the government is chiefly confined to these official persons , while the great bulk of the people not in official positions , are employed in the different departments of pursuit connected with agriculture , internal , coastwise and foreign commerce , manufactures , and the various arts and trades . From a view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much further advanced in those material improvements which are connected with the mechanic arts , and in the ordinary refinements of civilized life , than in those principles of liberal science and pure morals which constitute the essential glory of modern civilized nations . The women are distinguished for many amiable traits , suffering without complaining , although down-trodden by a base system of oriental tyranny , in a country where the infamous practice of concubinage prevails . They are accomplished in a certain degree , receive instructions in embroidery and in painting on silk , and music is with them a favorite accomplishment . The dress of the female part of the community is also peculiarly modest and becoming , and among the higher classes is distinguished for its costly richness , being frequently adorned with a profusion of gold and jewels . // The costume of the Chinese is probably familiar to most of our readers . The shaven head , from the top of whichaccording to the custom that has been introduced since the Tartar ascendancy  --  the tails depend ; the long , loose gown of silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the middle by a girdle of wrought silk , and which is fastened in front hy a clasp of agate or jade stone ; the worked silk fan-case suspended from the girdle ; the small leather or silken bag containing the flint and steel for the purpose of lighting the pipe ; the embroidered tobacco pouch ; the large trowsers and high-soled shoes ; the summer cap , composed of the woven lilaments of the bamboo or of chip , surmounted at the apex by a red , blue , white , or gilded hutton , indicating the rank of the wearer , from which descends a fringe of crimson silk or red horse hair , and in front of which is sometimes worn a single laige pearl ; constitute an ordinary costume , which is daily becoming more common to our sight , in the shop-windows of our principal commercial towns . The dress worn in winter is somewhat different from that of summer . It consists of a larger gown of silk or cape , reaching nearly to the andes , and over this is worn a loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or silk , or of broadcloth which is lined with skins . The neck is in winter protected by a narrow collar of silk or fur , the loose dresses folding over to the right breast , and fastened with gilt or crystal buttons . The winter cap fits close to the head , and the brim heing turned up all around , consists of black velvet or fur , while the top is surmounted by a button from which is suspended a bunch of crimson silk . Woven cotton or silk stockings are also common among those who can afford them , and hoots of cloth , velvet , or satin , with the wellknown thick white sole , are worn by.fhe more opulent class . The Chinese dresses of ceremony , although they appear somewhat gaudy and meretricious to a cultivated taste , are in some respects exceedingly splendid ; and indeed the relative degrees of rank are sometimes designated by the various costumes . The color of the ball upon the cap , whether red , light blue , dark blue , crystal , white stone , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and military . Each of those balls is accompanied by a corresponding badge , consisting of a piece of silk embroidery abotit a foot square , with the representation of a bird , or other device , wrought upon the breast or back . To this is added a necklace of large court heads , which descends to the waist . In the ceremonial dresses , the color of the spencer is of dark blue or purple , and the long gown is usually of a lighter hue , which , on state occasions , is wrought with dragons and other devices embroidered in silk and gold . We are informed , that when the crowd of mandarins with their embroidered robes , crimson caps , and various colored balls , are in full court dress , they present a very imposing appearance , which is often contrasted with that of the Emperor , who , during the Embassy of Lord Macartney , appeared in a plain brown silk robe , and a black velvet cap adorned with a single pearl . Yet he occasionally presents himself among the mandarins of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imperial color , upon which the five-clawed dragon is embroidered in gold . The ordinary costume of the females consists of a robe of silk or cotton with large sleeves , which is worn over a longer garment . Under these are loose trowsers fastened around the ancle above the deformed and cramped foot , the sleeve of the robe covering the hand , the whole being modest and becoming . it is not our purpose , however , to enter into the minute trifles of the toilet , but to exhibit the more general , political and moral features of the empire . ft is the machinery of the government , which , after all , more directly indicates the actual condition of the country , as well as the character of the people over whom it is exercised . The government itself being a despotism , the Emperor with the interior Council Chamber and the great Council of State , constitute the grand source whence its administration in all its branches flows . The eighteen provinces into which the empire is divided , are placed singly under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to a general governor , who has the power of appointing governors under him for each province . Such is the political organization of the provinces of Canton and Kuang-sy , adjoining , which are made subject to a general governor who is entitled the Viceroy of Canton . For each government a chief criminal judge , as well as a treasurer , are appointed ; the latter haying // cognizance of civil suits , and the charge of the territorial revenue , and the former , of course , a criminal jurisdiction . The central government at Pekin having reserved for itself the monopoly of the necessary article of salt , that department is placed under the management of an officer who is denominated the Salt Mandarin . Each district and city of the provinces of a certain grade , is placed under the charge of its respective magistrate , whose rank is determined by the city which he governs , and the total number of officers in the empire is about fourteen thousand . From the importance of the trade at Canton , a General Commissioner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " who was probably a special favorite of the Emperor , and who was accordingly selected by him for the purpose of permitting the Commissioner to make his fortune by the foreign trade . While the Hong monopoly lasted , it appears that the " Hoppo " exercised a rather despotic jurisdiction over the Hong merchants . There are some searching exactions in the administrative policy of the empire , for the purpose of preventin* corruptions in office . No individual can hold a magistracy in his native province ; and in order , as is alleged , to prevent corrupt connections , the public officers are changed periodically . Nor can any individual hold an office under his near relative . Once in every three years , the viceroy of each province forwards the name of every officer within his jurisdiction down to a hien ' deputy to the Board of civil appointments , with remarks upon his conduct and character , and each officer is advanced or degraded according to the tenor of this report . Each magistrate is likewise obliged to state in the catalogue of his titles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degraded or advanced , which may serve to constitute a pretty accurate test of merit . lmperial commissioners are specially appointed to try the offences of prominent officers , and the viceroy of each province is made responsible for every disturbance or rebellion which may occur within his jurisdiction . But the more active and energetic officers of the empire , consist of the Mandarins , who appear to constitute the grand imperial police . It is they who may be found presiding over the judicial administration of the government , or as a police , guarding the public order in the various parts of the empire . A red book , or Court Calendar , which is named from the color of its cover , and whose design is similar to the blue book of our owi country , in six volumes , is printed quarterly , by authority , and it contains the name , birth.place , and every circumstance important to be known respecting each official person in the empire . The system of political policy which is there adopted , is planned by six grand boards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which takes cognizance of the conduct of all civil officers ; the board of revenue , which regulates all fiscal matters ; a board of rites and ceremonies , whose business it is to prescribe the court ceremonial , and the forms upon all occasions of l ) ublic ceremony or worship , and the costume of all orders and both sexes , around the imperial palace ; the military board which possesses juris ( liction of all the military operations of the empire ; the supreme court of criminal jurisdiction , and the board of public works . Attached to each of those boards are subordinate officers , the astronomical board being connected with that of rites and ceremonies , since the calendar regulates the ritual . The office for foreign affairs denominated the Lyfan- Yuen , has charge of the external relations of the empire , and its members generally consist of Mantchou or Mongol Tartars . Besides these is an office of censors , of which there are two presidents , a Tartar and a Chinese , and the members consist of about forty or fifty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empire , as inspectors of the actual condition of things . These inspectors , from the nature of their office , are privileged to present advice , or even remonstrances , to the Emperor with impunity . Such are the prominent features of the extensive machinery of the Chinese government , and it is obviously a system of centralization , which , actin , from the despot who is the fountain-head , down to the most subordinate magistrate in the realm , has continued the government together in its essential features , through a period of more than four thousand years . There are , doubtless , minute springs of state policy , which it is not easy for foreigners fully to understand ; but , notwithstanding the gross defects in the political organization of the country , the affairs of the empire seem to have been managed , at least so far as the conduct of the Emperor // is concerned , in a beneficent spirit in many respects , and with remarkable judgment and discretion , when we consider the Asiatic character of the people . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , and this is the fact , that the military is subordinate to the civil power . The system of police is conducted upon the same plan throughout the various cities and towns of the empire , and its searching influence springs , in a great measure , from the principle of responsibility , each town being divided into tithings of ten houses , which are themselves combined in wards of one hundred . The viceroy is thus made to answer for the order of his own district , the hundred and tithing man each for their respective charge , and the householder for the conduct of his own family . Another feature of the Chinese government is the patriarchal character upon which it is based . The subordination which is preserved by a father over the members of his family , and the aged over the young , is extended to the relations of the Emperor over his subjects , he being deemed the father of the empire . This spirit is inculcated in their ancient books . Submission to parental authority is in fact , the type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably the discipline which this state of things inculcates that produces general mildness of manners , a pacific spirit , as well as docility and subordination . The jurisprudence which prevails throughout the realm also exhibits a system of policy , marked by some of the benefits of the common law , and at the same time with objectionable features , yet upon the whole , much superior to that of other Asiatic nations . The penal code is extremely simple and clear , the first head being composed of definitions and explanations in reference to the whole code , and the six following relating to those subjects , which correspond with the six supreme boards of Pekin . In this code are considered , the system of government , the conduct of officers , the enrollment of the people , lands and tenements , marriage in its statistical relations , public property , duties and customs , private property , sales and markets , and ritual laws , under which are included , sacred rites and miscellaneous observances . That portion of the code which treats of military laws involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation of the army , the guard of the frontier , military horses and cattle , expresses and public posts . The next embraces criminal laws , and comprises eleven books , the principal heads of which are treason , robbery , theft , murder , homicide , criminal intercourse , disturbing graves , quarreling and fighting , and incendiarism ; while the last division treats of public works , and contains two books relating to public buildings and public ways . The character of the Chinese laws is as equitable as might be supposed , from the circumstances which have marked the progress of the empire Jkl the case of treason , not only does the traitor undergo the punishment of death , but all the members of his family . The capital punishments are strangulation , decollation , and for treason , parricides , sacrilege , amid other crimes of such character , a lingering death is required ;  --  the heads of murderers and robbers being publicly exposed in a cage which is suspended upon a pole . The Chinese prisons are likewise very severe ; although women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed in the custody of their nearest relatives . There are also sometimes exercised certain modes of torture in forcing evidence , and these consist in squeezing the ankles or fingers between three sticks , tied triangularly . Oaths are never required in judicial proceedings , but severe punishments are attached to false evidence . A species of king 's evidence is permitted in some cases , and there are ten privileged classes who can not be tried and punished , without a special reference to the Emperor  --  the exemption being based upon public station , or upon relationship to the imperial line . All persons under fifteen years of age , and over seventy , are permitted to redeem themselves from punishment by a fine , in those cases which are less than capital , and relatives and servants who live under the same roof , are usually held innocent , although they conceal the offences of their fellow inm ' *tes , or even assist in effecting their escape . In order to spread a knowledge of the laws throughout the empire , it is enacted that those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to comprehend them , shall receive pardon for all offences which result from accident , or that are imputable to them in consequence of the guilt of others , provided it // Oct. , be the first offence , and is not implicated with any act of treason or rebellion . A part of the code is also devoted to providing for justice in the administration of legal punishments , and in establishing what are considered proper safeguards of the subject . Ther*e are severe punishments denounced against officers of government for unjust imprisonments , delays of justice , cruelty , and such misdemeanors . In cases of sickness , a species of bail is allowed to minor offenders , and they are exempted or released from imprisonment on sufficient security being given for their return . Torture is prohibited to be exercised upon all persons who are under fifteen and over seventy , as well as upon those laboring under permanent disease . Women can never be imprisoned excepting for capital offences or for adultery , nor can torture or death be inflicted upon a pregnaiit woman , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China to a considerable extent . For a slave to kill his master is punishable with a lingering death , while the converse is not capital . Yet for some offences servitude is visited upon a whole family , and personal service is frequently levied by the government upon the lowest class , or that which has only its labor to contribute . Robbery with offensive weapons is punishable with death , and if a burglar is killed by one whose house he invades , it is deemed an act of homicide which is justifiable . Stealing is punished with the bamboo or with exile , which is proportioned to the magnitude of the offence , while theft among near relations is visited with a less punishment than ordinary theft . The Chinese law of homicide is somewhat extraordinary . Aifrays are treated with great severity* killino* in killino. with * , an affray , and a regular weapon without intent , are punished with strangling , and kmllin0 by pure accident is redeemable by a fine of about four pounds sterling to the relatives of the deceased . When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty days constitute the term of responsibility , after which the death of the sufferer does not make the offence capital . With a sharp instrument , fire or scalding water , the term is extended to thirty days ; gun-shot wounds , forty days ; broken bones or violent wounds , fifty days . Parents have virtually the power of death over their children ; for even if they kill them intentionally , they are subject only to the punishment of the hamboo and a banishment of one year , and if struck by them , to no punishment at all . The penalty for striking parents , or for cursing them , is also death . The law of China is , it appears , very tenacious of social order-so much so , indeed , that a punishment is inflicted upon the act of striking another with the hand or foot , that being made a public offence in order to prevent the chances of death by quarrels . The law also provides a punishment for opprobrious language , on the ground of its having a tendency to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt , a period is allowed by law , on the expiration of which the debtor becomes liable to the bamboo , if his obligations are not discharged ; and a creditor sometimes quarters himself and his family upon his debtor , and provided this is done without violence and tumult no relief is granted for such act by the civil authority . In the light of the Chinese law it is deemed a much greater offence to owe money to a foreigner than to a native , and a banishment to Tartary was formerly inflicted upon insolvent Hong merchants . The scrupulous jealousy with which the government regards indebtedness to foreigners is based upon the fact that there were frequent embarrassing claims and demands made by strangers for debts which were thus incurred . The civil code of the present imperial dynasty of China is composed of not less than two hundred and sixty-one volumes ! and it contains an account of the changes and modifications which have been made in the laws by successive emperors since the conquest in 1644 , frequently the reasons assigned for the repeal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as the entire body of the existing laws . It is divided into nine parts , the first containing all the regulations concerning the imperial house now reigning , with the privileges of the descendants of the Tartar conquerors in the direct and collateral lines . The second part relates to the palace and its regulations . The next six parts refer to the six boards to which we have before referred , among which the duty of regulating the details of the government is distributed ; and under the ninth division are included all those laws relating to public education , the examination of candidates for public offices , as well as those peculiar laws which concern the Tartar dependencies // and the courts which take cognizance of their affairs . In the part which relates to the first of the six executive boards-that of civil officers-is an accurate list of all the appointments in the empire , the relative rank of each officer , and the regulations which govern them . In the arrangement of public officers , there is kept in view a comparison of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this merit is preserved and consulted , with a view either of degrading or of promoting the incumbent . In a country so densely populated as China , where the pursuit of agriculture must from the nature of things supply the essential means of subsistence , it holds the first rank among the useful arts . It is in itself deemed second only to ljterature ; and we can scarcely wonder at the homage which it receives from the Emperor himself , who , with the princes and officers of the court , repairs every year to the temple which is dedicated to the inventor of agriculture , to plough the land as well as to offer sacrifices . Without equaling the most advanced European nations in husbandry , it must be admitted that the Chinese exceed all the Asiatic nations in the excellence to which they have carried this useful pursuit . The principal object of culture is the rice , which supplies a great proportion of the food to the inhabitants ; and two crops as well as one of vegetables are produced upon the caine spot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without fences , but are usually guarded with ditches , and the low wet lands , where the rice is cultivated , are divided by narrow embankments which are used as walks . Most of their agricultural implements are simple ; and it is alleged that we are indebted to them for the winnowing machine which is now used in our own country . From the over-crowded population of the empire , space is greatly economized , and the terrace cultivation has been long an object of admiration to travelers . Garden vegetables , such as cabbages , pease and potatoes , grow abundantly at Macao ; but these were formerly , and we presume are now cultivated only for the supply of the European and native Portuguese population at that place . There is however one ornate branch of agriculture in which the Chinese peculiarly excel , and this is the department of landscape gardening . The construction of artificial ponds , streams , and rustic work , and the disposition of grounds , woods , and lawns , are calculated to heighten the beauty of nature by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste is concerned . The landscape gardening of the Chinese , although conspicuous in most of the more elegant country houses within and around the principal cities , is most conspicuously displayed in the grounds around the imperial palace of Pekin , and in those extensive parks called Yuen-ming-yuen , which are decorated with all the elegant embellishments that are calculated to gratify imperial pride . In the manufacture of certain articles , it is well known that China formerly excelled all other nations , especially in their porcelain and silk , lackered ware , carved work in wood , ivory , and other materials . They were the first who manufactured porcelain , for which they have been long celebrated , and other nations who have borrowed the art from them , although they excel them in the painting and gilding of the surface , have not attained the art of making it so hard , in the resistance which it offers to the heat without cracking , or in composing so well the substance of the material . They can also boast of the silk manufacture as an original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in various parts of the empire as well as a principal staple of export , and its culture has received the principal care of the court , the empress according to authoritative tradition , having originally planted the mulberry tree . With looms of simple construction they imitate the choicest patterns of the silk both of England and France , and they produce elegant specimens of damask and flowered satins . The crape manufactured by them is also of a very fine quality , and they make also a species of silk called in Canton ponge , which washes and is highly prized . The agricultural staple which now forms the principal article of export from China to foreign ports , will be but briefly considered . It would be unnecessary to describe the various kinds of tea which are produced in the different parts of the empire , or their mode of preparation ; but as is known to most of our readers , it is yielded in vast quantity in the interior provinces , atid is transported by water in the boats which crowd the rivers and canals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Great Britain and the United States , and more recently to other parts // of Europe . Innumerable smaller articles of curiosity or use , are also produced to a considerable amount in various l ) arts of the empire , and are either sold for domestic consumption , or they are exported abroad . The foreign commerce of China is , however , inconsiderable in amount , when compared with the vast internal trade of the empire . Their trading junks are extensively employed in the coasting trade , although it is the policy of the government to lay restrictions upon the commerce which is prosecuted by their own people from their own shores . Those junks are , however , notwithstanding these restrictions , found sailing to the north as far as Japan , to the Liiconian Islands upon the east , to Batavia at the south , and to the west they advance to the Straits of Malacca with silk , piece goods , china-ware , su*ar , rhubarb , ginseng , sandal wood , and products of this sort , returning with areca nuts , rattans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productions . The internal trade of the empire by means of the imperial canal and iieighboring waters , is immense . These watery arteries of inland cominonication are almost ever crowded with boats , which it is said contain a l ) OPulation nearly as large as that of the land . The diversity in fact , which exists between the productions of the different provinces of the empire , and the markets which are provided in each for those of the other , render a vast inland transportation absolutely necessary . Rice and sugar are yielded in the provinces of the south , silk , cotton , and tea , are produced in the east , the west furnishes metals and minerals , and furs and drugs are produced by the north . It is obvious that the dense population of the interior , with wants to be supplied as connected with the iroducts of the various parts , must originate a vast inland trade . The foreign trade in leading articles of Chinese production , which until the last treaty , it is well known , has been confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of the Hong merchants . This body of men , as is well knuwn , were formely appointed to conduct 4e commerce of the port of Canton , and to guaranty the good conduct of the crews of the vessels with which they traded , as well as the payment of their duties to the government , themselves being liable for the debts incurred by one or all of the body . In turn they were subject to such exactions from the imperial officers as to make the office anything hut desirable . This monopoly has now become abolished , and so has the Consoo fund , from which the creditors of many of them drew their payment , the fund being raised by a levy of about three per cent . upon foreign exports and imports , through the agency of the Hong merchants . Several port officers such as the " Hoppo " or Commissioner of Customs , the " Cumprador " or purveyor of provisions , and the " linguist , " were also connected with the ports before the late treaty , whose duty it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subordinates in office . It will hardly be denied that the Chinese eminently excel in the useful arts . To them we may justly credit the e.urly discovery of the art of printing upon moveable types , which was there in use in the tenth century . And there is satisfactory evidence to convince us that they also discovered the art of manufacturing paper as early as the year 95 . They also used gunpowder in fire-works at a very ancient period ; and if they did not invent the mariner 's compass , it was at least in early use by them . Their ingenuity in manufacturing numerous articles of light work , such as vases , dishes , cups , Onmestic utensils , and parlor ornaments , various species of embroidery , metallic mirrors , and carved and lackered ware , will hardly be doubted . Yet they do not appear to excel in the fine arts . They are somewhat deficient in drawing and painting , although the buds , insects , and flowers , which adorn their articles of taste are accurately portrayed , yet they fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kindred art of sculpture , or the cutting upon stone ; but they are somewhat apt in the modeling of clay . Nor have they made great progress in music . Their instruments of music , although quite numerotis , consisting of several species of lutes and guitars , flutes , fiddles , and harmonions of wires , touched by two slips of bamboo , as well as the various sorts of gongs which are familiar to us , are comparatively rude , and would seem to belong to a people who have not advanced to a very high state of civilization . Another peculiar feature of Chinese institutions , is the general diffusion of education . Extraordinary as it may appear , it is not the less true , that a system of general education exists throughout // the empire of China , where almost every town possesses its public place of instruction , and each wealthy family possesses its private tutor . It appears to be the object of the government to endeavor , by diffusing the means of education , to seek out the genuine ability which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . As we have before remarked , the distribution of state offices is granted to approved talent and learning , and the proportion of the community which is devoted to letters is very great . Under such circumstances it is obvious that literature , or the number of printed hooks , is extensive , embracing voluminous works upon jurisprudence and ethics , statistics , the drama , poetry , and indeed everything which goes to form the body of literature among civilized states . Extensive libraries are common , and include volumes connected with the various branches of knowledge relating to the above departments . The statistical works which they possess concerning the country , are indeed very voluminous . The principal of these , containing a complete account of the empire , embraces two hundred and forty volumes , describing the population , geography , revenues , magistracy , and other details , of every province of China , and also the actual condition of Chinese Tartary . Besides this general volume , each province has its own history , including an account of its productions , manufactures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon its actual condition . The state religion of China is derived from the system of Confucius , whose works are a mingled body of ethics and politics . The state worship is ( livided into three classes : the great sacrifices , the medium sacrifices , and the lesser sacrifices . Under the first are worshiped the heaven and the earth ; the adherents of Confucius appearing to believe that there is an animating intelligence presiding over the world which rewards virtue and punishes vice . There are also other objects of worship , as the gods of the land and grain , and in almost every street altars are seen , upon which is a rude stone with matches of incense burning before it ; the sun and moon , gods , genii , sages , fabled inventors of lette is , agriculture , manufactures , and the useful arts , spirits of deceased statesmen , eminent scholars , martyrs , the clouds , rain , wind and thunder , military banners , and other objects , also receive divine homage . The sovereign , who is deemed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the priests of the state religion , subordinate to the emperor , are the ( listiliguished personages who are connected with the court . Besides the system of Confucius , which may properly be denominated the state religion , is that of Budhism , the five principal precepts of which are a l ) rohibition from putting living creatures to death , stealing , marrying , falsehood , and the drinking of wine . The priests of this religion are associated in monasteries , which are attached to the Temple of Fo , and to the nine and seven-storied pagodas which are scattered through the empire , and are connected with this worship . But this religion appears to he declining and its temples are going to decay . The Taou sect , another species of worship which has become established in China , so far as can be learned from its doctrines , inculcates a contempt of riches , honors , and all worldly distinctions , and aims at that epicurean philosophy which seeks to subdue every passion that is calculated to interfere with perfect tranquillity . This sect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profess to deal in magic . From this brief view of the religion of China it is perceived that the great body of the people are idolators , without possessing any solid and clearly defined system of Christian faith . Notwithstanding the former opposition to the Catholic Church by the Emperor , we perceive that by our late treaty with the government , we are permitted to build houses of Christian worship within the boundaries of China , and by a recent decree of the imperial court , the worship of Christianity is tolerated throughout the empire . The amusements of the Chinese are varied-gambling is frequent , conjuring and sleight of hand , shuttle-cock , kite flying , in which they peculiarly excel , - these msrial implements being sometimes constructed with great eleganceand even old men participate in the amusement ; fireworks of unusual splendor , and theatrical entertainments are quite common . The dinners are also attended with much ceremony , and with a scrupulous adherence to those forms which constitute the etiquette of such entertainments in polished life . The courses are frequent , consisting , among other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs , rats , earthworms , and other dishes , at which an European would shrink , yet those are sometimes served in fine porce // Oct. , lain , with , occasionally , silver covers and wine cups of silver gilt . The new year is the period in which presents are usually exchanged among friends , and they commonly consist of delicacies , such as rare fruit , fine tea , silk stuffs for dresses , and ornaments of various kinds , which are accompanied by a list inscribed upon a red ticket . But one of the most distinguished festivals of China is the feast of lanterns . It is noticed that among the principal ornaments of the Chinese are the lanterns of various colors , which adorn their public buildings and private mansions , and also decorate their festivals and processions . Some of these are constructed in curious figures of animals , and being composed of silk , varnish , horn , paper , and glass , they are made effectually to represent different objects . Moving men , galloping on horseback , fighting orperforming various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals , in full motion , the circular movement being communicated by file threads attached to the figures , are quite common , the whole indicating an effeminacy of taste which is peculiar to Asiatic nations . The public works of the Chinese , their imperial canal , running a distance of six hundred miles through the centre of the empire , the walls of their cities , and their bridges , exhibit the evidences of extraordinary thrift and forecast , as well as effective industry . The imperial canal constitutes a safe avenue for a vast amount of inland transportation between the renlote points of the empire , and serves also as a drain to an immense extent of swampy country . The bridges , many of them , consist of solid masonry , evincing considerable skill in this species of architecture , and the great wall , stretching a distance of more than fifteen hundred miles upon the northern frontier of China proper , and which was originally constructed as a bulwark against the Tartars , is probably the most stupendous monument of human labor to be found upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the country is very uniform ; it is light , the houses are low , the tent-like roof is supported by slender wooden columns , and the ornamental gateways which adorn the streets , together with the pavilions in the gardens of their country houses , sometimes surrounded by sheets of water running by rock work and crossed by wooden bridges , with their painting and abundant gilding , produce upon the whole a very pleasing effect ; although from the mode of construction , and the materials of which they are built , they all evince a want of solidity and permanence in their general aspect . The cities of China , from their size , constitute objects of great interest , and as is probably known , the largest in the empire is Pekin , the place of the imperial court . With a population which is estimated at about three millions , it is the centre of all that is most magnificent in the nation , being connected with the residence of the royal sovereign . Surrounded by walls , and embracing so large a population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly be expected that it could be described within a very brief space . That part of the city which is more immediately connected with the imperial residence is , of course , the most imposing . The walls of the imperial grounds inclose extensive parks , which seem to have been made into artificial hills and valleys , containing sheets of water . These are studded with small islands , themselves adorned with fanciful edifices , interspersed with trees . From these ornamented grounds arise heights upon which are erected imperial palaces , that seem like the work of enchantment . Eight miles north-west of Pekin is the park of Yuen-ming-yuen , which contains , according to popular belief , thirty distinct places of residence for the emperor and his numerous suite , each of which constitute a village . The landscape of this garden appears to be diversified with woodlands and lawns , rivulets , lakes , and canals , a part of which is artificially adorned , while a portion is left in its original wildness . Nankin was formerly the seat of the imperial court , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparative dilapidation . Its proximity to the Keang , as well as its favorable climate , render it a populous place , with a considerable trade , although it has of late years somewhat declined . Even now it is distinguished for its silk man ufactures , for the Nankeen cotton which bears its name , as well as for the production of that singular substance which is called rice paper , and composed from the pith of a plant . We are informed that the present dilapidation of the city is owing , in a great measure , to the Tartar conquerors of China , who demolished the imperial palace and the most sacred monuments during the rage of war . The city , however , to which , as is generally known , the European and Amer // ican trade is principally confined , is Canton , and it is here that most of the foreign vessels are anchored . The streets are narrow , being only calculated for footpassengers , and the passage of sedanchairs , and are paved with flag-stones , while the houses , like those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are occasionally ornamented with gate-ways , which are decorated in memory of distinguished individuals . That part of Canton which contains the European factories , is not unlike the other portion . In those shops which are devoted to Chinese customers , the fronts are opened to the streets , while those which are employed in the European trade are closed . The various streets are occupied by the different trades , with names according to the kinds of merchandise which are sold . Upon the side of each shop is suspended from on high , a huge ornamental label of varnished and gilded wood , upon which the particular occupation of the tenant , and the name of the merchandise in which he traffics , are inscribed . These labels being hung with the edges toward the street , and highly gilded and varnished , exhibit a vista which is very gay in its appearance . It would also seem that the principal shops connected with European and American trade , were formerly occupied by dealers in silks , lackered and carved ware , and other lighter articles , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; these being , at that time , restricted to the Hong merchants , whose monopoly , as we before intimated , has been abolished . In this view which we have taken of the Empire of China , we perceive that the Chinese have already attained a considerable advance in the useful arts , and in their crude form of literature , but science is there still in its infancy . They may indeed be considered in some respects a refined people , if refinement consists in a scrupulous adherence to the minute forms of etiquette and the ceremonials of civilized life ; yet in much of their moral system they have not progressed much beyond mere barbarians . To suppose that they are destitute of political shrewdness and discretion in the management of the government , we think indicates an ignorance of the nature of their institutions ; for they pursue , in their jealousy of strangers , such a policy as is calculated to prevent the interference of foreigners with their institutions , and which has continued the most populous empire upon the earth under one government for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the color of justice , although it is in many respects objectionable . The influence of wealth is there less regarded than in European states , while the Emperor is invested with the power of a despot , having the right of appointing his successor even out of the circle of the imperial family . The Chinese portion of the population are a quiet and tractable race , although false and distrustful , especially upon the sea-board , where a large body of Ladrones or pirates , together with the lowest class of the population , are accumulated . Yet , with all these faults , they possess , as a nation , some very estimable qualities , and are , perhaps , as conscientious as we might suppose Asiatic idolators would be , from the character of their education . In some points of civil polity , it must be admitted , however , that they are extremely deficient , and this deficiency is especially obvious in their military establishment , which was most strikingly exhibited in the recent contest with Great Britain , in reference to the opium trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring a nation of four hundred millions of people to terms , and to compel them to the execution of a favorable treaty , granting all which the invaders required . We do not propose , however , to discuss the merits of this controversy . " Non nostri inter vos tantas componere lites . " The Chinese army is large , consisting of a regular Tartar military force , composed of about one hundred and sixteen thousand men , numbering Mantchou* , Mongols , and a few Chinese , who joined the Mantchou army during the close of the Chinese dynasty . To these may be added a force of six hundred and twentyfive thousand regular Chinese troops , and five hundred thousand Mongol cavalry who do service upon the frontiers like the Russian Cossacks . Indeed , the pacific character of the Chinese is strongly contrasted with the more active and warlike Tartars , who constitute the principal military officers , and maintain a predominant influence at the imperial court . Besides , their weapons of war are extremely rude and ineffective , even were there an abundance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The commerce of the United Slates // with China has already attained considerable importance . We now have about seventy vessels engaged in the China trade from our own ports , employing a capital of about seven millions of dollars . China exports to foreign countries , annually , about fifteen millions of dollars worth of different kinds of teas , treasure to the amount of fourteen millions , raw silks , silk thread , and silk goods , to the value of nearly six millions , and a considerable amount of cassia , sugar , sugar-candy , lackered ware , carved work , matting , fans and porcelain , the whole amounting to about forty-six millions of dollars . A considerable proportion of these products finds its way to this country . The imports are about equal in value to the exports , and are composed , besides other articles , of opium , rice , treasure , pearls , raw cotton , ginseng , cotton manufactures and cotton yarn , woolen manufactures of various sorts , various kinds of metals , betel nut , becho de mer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that country are paid for in cotton goods , ginseng and lead , and by bills of credit which are drawn on London bankers . Besides the payment by the English for their teas , silks , and other exports from China , by their cotton goods , they also draw a large amount of the precious metals from the empire for the opium which is now cultivated to a considerable extent in their East India possessions , and they now have about two hundred vessels which are employed in the China trade . But the foreign trade , as we before remarked , hears but a small proportion to that which crowds the inland waters of the empire . The canal-boats , junks , and flower-boats , the Hong and mandarin boats , which abound in the harbor of Canton , and indeed in almost every place of trade , contain a very large and active portion of the Chinese population . The late treaty which has been negotiated with China by our own government , if it does not extend our privileges to a greater extent than those which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least defines the relations which our commerce will hereafter sustain toward that empire . The commerce of the Union , like that of the Europeen nations , has long been subjected to arbitrary and capricious exactions , springing perhaps as much from the corrupt administration of the underlings of office in the Chinese pods , as from the absence of an uniform and enlightened system of trade by the Chinese government , which , in its commercial intercourse with other nations , has heretofore been regardless of the principles of international law . By the late treaty , the commerce that was formerly limited to Canton , is now extended to five other ports , and it places on a clearly defined basis , the commercial relations which we sustain toward the government , regarding all which appertains to the spirit of fair trade . There are , doubtless , substantial evils connected with  --  the system of the Chinese government , which is a vast contraband despotism , acting through the agency of constituted boards and carefully collected statistical knowledge , with inspectors , spies and executive officers , distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation , they are vain and exacting , has been often demonstrated , hut this spirit has been the result of their isolated position-superior to the surrounding nations , and with little opportunity to compare their real acquisitions with the more civilized countries of the world . Their religion is the spirit of a false and mystical philosophy , whose worship is in mythological idolatry , and not the spirit of genuine Christianity  --  a fiery exhalation from a pestilential and stagnant bog , and not the effulgent beams of the sun of heaven . We perceive the influence o* their system in a loose and fluctuating , if not a corrupt administration of the government , not on the part of the Emperor , for L* appears to be honest , but through the inferior officers , whose acts are obliged to travel a long distance before they meet the royal ear , and at last reach it , colored and distorted . We perceive the same influence in the concubinage which prevails throughout the empire , and in that foulest of crimes , infanticide , which is tacitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is probable that the more intimate connettion of the empire in trade with modern civilized nations , will eventually work out a reform upon those subjects . We are not prepared to say that the soil of China will be soon intersected by railroads , or that the Kiang and other navigable rivers will be traversed by steamboats , within our own age : because the policy of the government is opposed to innovation of all sorts , and to the introduction of any agency that will diminish the necessity of individual labor in that over-populated country.
