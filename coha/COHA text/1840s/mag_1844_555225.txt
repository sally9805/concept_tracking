txt WE know not whether we should apply the abused name of Novel to a work like this ; for its object is to give just views of life , which the novel has too seldom done . Vivid // pictures of certain forms of life it has undoubtedly given ; but , to the misfortune of our race , the liveliest have frequently been pictures of its least elevated forms , and they have been drawn by those to whom pure and lofty sentiment was an unfathomable mystery . It would be unreasonable to expect that salutary streams should flow from bitter fountains ; Jack Sheppard is naturally such a work as Jack Sheppard would have written , had the gibbet failed to claim its due ; and the novelists , who would induce us to take the murderer and pirate to our hearts , show very plainly where their own affections lie . Fortunately , mankind are sure in the end to take vengeance on those who would thus mislead them . Every one knows full well what is intended for his benefit , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain retribution of neglect , if not of deep aversion , is in store for those who do the appropriate work of evil spirits , in laboring to make the worse appear the better reason , and , by some chemical process of their own , to convert depravity into virtue . It is not necessary to go many fathoms deep in literary history to feel assured of this . In our own country , happily , the highest talent has been generally found on virtue 's side ; the tales which will be remembered have been intended to show life as in reality it is , and thus to point out the way of preparation for its business and its duties . When we name Miss Sedgwick 's " Home , " the reader will be at no loss to ascertain the class of tales to which we here refer ; works full of just and true sentiment , whose writers are above the affectations of presenting heroes that never existed , and of describing modes of society they never saw . They do not consider labor to be inconsistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laziness for moral worth ; but they endeavour to reconcile men and women to the condition in which Providence has placed them , and teach them to accomplish that for which they were designed by Providence . They write for society as it exists in our own country , at this very day ; and they convey lessons which one would be as little likely to find in foreign novels , as to discover in a tropical climate the best modes of averting the severity of a northern winter . To this class belongs the writer of " Alida . " We have // no hesitation in pronouncing it the work of a lady , because , apart from the information of common rumor , this fact is proclaimed no less by her profound acquaintance with the mysteries of housekeeping , of which men generally know as little as a landsman does of navigation , than by the facility and grace with which she enters into the most delicate traits of female character . Her inventive power is not remarkable , though in this respect there is nothing overstrained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the writer of fictitious narrative , in the faculty of delineating character with a due regard to the modesty of nature , in purity and grace of style , and in the still more enviable power of enforcing truth of sentiment by unaffected eloquence and pathos , it would not be easy to say by whom she is excelled . Miss Sedgwick is the American writer whom she resembles most ; and we are aware that we are uttering no light commendation , when we say , that this work is scarcely in any respect inferior to Miss Sedgwick 's happiest efforts in the same attractive line . With a little more - experience , she will be inferior to none . In some traits , she reminds us more of Miss Austen , than of any other English writer . She may not be able to execute those daguerrotype likenesses of all manner of men and women , which Miss Austen makes with such marvellous truth and skill , though not without a little slyness , likely to render them as unpalatable to the sitter as are those unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirable writer , though the tendency of her works is always pure , had in view no very elevated moral purpose . She took down the personages around her , as a naturalist impales butterflies ; exalnining them with the most minute and consciejitious care , and describing them with great exactness for the edification of mankind . The author of " Alida " has not this microscopic keenness of perception , or this more than Chinese skill in execution ; but she sees character in its larger qualities clearly , and , what is better , sees it hutnanely ; with little sensibility to the ludicrous , she possesses that sympathy with other hearts , which teaches one to know them well , and , attracting as it does their sympathies , gives her power for the purposes of good . She will find her way to many hearts ; and , inspiring them with those sentiments which mature into sound principles , will be rewarded by the consciousness , // perhaps the best recompense that earth can give , that she has guided others in the way of virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Town and Country and its principal object is to show the favorable influences of the country on the character , as contrasted with those of fashionable life in cities . If we were disposed to take exception , we might , perhaps , find some occasion for it in the partiality of a representation which leads directly to the inference , that those who would excel in virtue must fly from the sidewalk to the field . Most surely , uninterrupted converse with nature is not without its influence in inspiring elevated feelings ; and certain it is , that fashionahle life does not directly foster such emotions ; hut we fear that Cowper , when he declared , that " God made the country , and man made the town , " expressed rather the sentiment of a heart which shrank from contact with his fellowmen , than that of an unprejudiced one , regarding all things as they really are . A city life is uot of necessity a life of self-indulgent pleasure ; we apprehend , that many who hear the name of fashionable are exceeded by none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of their duty . External influences , and that is all the author means to say , are less favorable to their moral elevation than to that of many others ; hut if the disposition he not wanting , there is enough to kindle it , and an ample sphere to fill . For those in whom the disposition is yet to he inspired , the country life may he the best ; but we apprehend , that Providence has placed in every form of life inducements enough to virtue , for all who are inclined to find them . In order to present a few extracts from the work , we must resort to one of those imperfect sketches of the incidents in the story , of a part of them at least , for which those who have not read it , as well as those who have , are not apt to he very grateful . Alida Frazier , the daughter of a prosperous and sensible merchant of New York , is beautiful and full of admirable qualities , but is distinguished from most heroines by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is undisciplined , too obedient to impulse , and very much inclined to have her own will and way . The scene opens with a party at the house of Mr. Hastings , Mr. Frazier s mercantile partner , where Miss Frazier overhears the comments of her friends on the probability that Arthur Dor // sey will be the successful candidate for her reluctant hand ; and with the usual dignity of young ladies upon such occasions , she resolves that any presumptuous hopes which he may form shall be nipped in the very bud . Miss Weston , an independent single lady , is one of the offenders from whom the unhappy comments came ; she is the intimate friend of Mr. Dorsey , and Miss Frazier is greatly exercised by the apprehension , that her father , who is a widower , may be ensnared by the lady 's machinations into matrimony . When these clouds have fairly gathered , Mr. IDorsey in an evil hour makes a tender of his hand and heart , both of which are rejected with little ceremony , and he immediately sails for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastily in the transaction , begins to find , that blessings brighten as they take their flight . The next personage who appears upon the stage is Mr. William Richards , who comes to New York to establish himself in business . He has letters to Mr. Frazier , and becomes intimate in his family . After a little time , he is attacked by the epidemic of bankruptcy , conducts himself honorably , and procures , by the aid of his friends , a clerkship in a mercantile house in Canton . A letter to Ahida , received after his departure , leads her to suppose that she was the object of his secret love ; and she reflects , not without remorse , that her conduct may have fed a passion which she is not able to return . Mr. Frazier has now determined to carry into effect a long cherished project of retiring to a country residence . When announcing this determination to his daughter , he also relieves her mind from all apprehension of Miss Weston 's dangerous wiles , by declaring that he would not marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have him were he to ask her . Contrary to his expectations , his daughter readily accedes to the proposed change of life ; and Brookside , a village in Massachusetts , is the place selected for their future home ; a J ) lace which , or the like of which , may be easily seen , though the name has not yet found its way into the gazetteer . The following is the account given of their first entering the village . " It was at the close of a delicious day in June , that Mr. Frazier and his family entered the village selected for their residence . The arch of heaven was without a cloud . The soft blue of the mid.sky , the roseate hue as the concave declined to meet the // mountain line which bounded it , and the golden tints which encircled the broad sun as he was sinking down in his tranquill ty , ' were so blended , that the eye could not detect where one was lost in the succeeding . The earth beneath , exhibiting the usual inequalities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verdure , and through the magnificent elms that lined the principal street of the village , peeped out the simple , and often rudely constructed , houses . But summer had thrown her mantle so gracefully round every object , that even these were not unsightly . it was Saturday evening . A rigorous interpretation of Scripture still prevailed in Brookside ; and according to their primitive division of time , the Sabbath had begun ,  --  in beautiful accordance with the harmonious coloring , and the few and tranquillizing sounds that fell upon the ear . " The holy time was quiet as a nun Breathless with adoiatiun ! ' Alida was at once touched and delighted . It seemed to her a realizing of the prophetic vision ,  --  ' A new heaven and a new earth . ' She had known nothing of the country except by short excursions in the vicinity of the city ; and though the emotions of taste , to which by nature she was disposed , had not been neglected in her education , they had been cultivated chiefly in those artificial modes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Frazier 's thoughts , though he responded to Alida 's frequent bursts of admiration , were directed principally to different objects . Yes , very beautiful indeed , ' replied he , very beautiful . Nature has done her part-her works are always perfect . But see how short man falls of her standard ! - see the broken fences  --  the falling outhouses  --  the trees unpruned - the houses out of repair- the glazing of the windows replaced by hats and rags ! ' " But that , papa , only adds to the picturesque ; only conceive of a white house , green blinds , and a picket fence , in a landscape ! - the coloring of Claude could not save it from burlesque . ' The picturesque ! - nonsense ! - for a girl of your sense , Alida , I am surprised at such a sentiment . Give me the picturesque in morals , in human happiness ! I can see no beauty in poverty and neglect . ' No , not in themselves , certainly ; but they may excite the emotion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , I tell you , ' replied Mr. Frazier , impatiently , little disposed to substitute the ideal for the real , they excite nothing but disgust , in whole or in part ; and for this reason I never see a poor neglected hovel but I connect it with ideas of idleness , // improvidence , wickedness . We talk of the equal distribution of wealth in our country ; and look here , in this paradise , into which you would think nothing evil could enter , even here you see want and discomfort . ' " But not necessarily folly or vice . How can we tell but that it may be owing to unavoidable misfortune ? ' Yes , that is true ,  --  some of it . ' " And to ignorance , papa ? ' " Still more . But ignorance , though the misfortune of the individual , is often the fault of the community . Woe to those who know and will not teach ! Let us , my daughter , escape this condemnation . ' " I must learn first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can teach others . ' " So you must , and so must I - we have all need of instruction ; the best that can be said of most of us is , that we are willing to learn . ' " - pp. 33 , 34 . The inconveniences arising from disappointment and delays in the arrangement of their new residence give occasion to several entertaining scenes . Not the least of Miss Alida 's perplexities arise from help , a word , the meaning of which is feelingly known to most ladies , at least in New England . These circumstances afford an opportunity to the author of displaying a practical good sense , as well as knowledge , upon the subject of the character and manners of the people , which render this portion of the work as instructive as it is amusing . Here follows the trouble with the mason . " To the joiner again succeeded the mason . " I guess I 11 come to-morrow , and do off that chamber ceiling , ma*am. ** To-morrow ! Why not to-day ? ' " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha' n't got no float , and besides , I ye broke my hawk ; and then , again , I calculate to go to town-meetin ' this a'ternoon . ' " Alida would have urged , but it was in vain to strive against the want of tools , and the obligations of a good citizen . " The man returned as he promised , a rare instance of punctuality ! - and the cry of ' mort ! ' mort ! ' again resounded through the house . " But Alida trembled for the completion of her work , when she heard the tender ' say at night , 1 ca n't come to-morrow , for I ye promised Mr. Thaxton to help him do some ditching-p he s waited a week for me now , and he feels wonderfully . // " What feeling wonderfully ' meant , Alida did not exactly know ; but if it signified disappointment , vexation , and perplexity , she was sure that she could entirely sympathize with Mr. Thaxton . A substitute , however , was found ; but , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less grace . Ma'am , ' said the mason , Squire Tucker wants you to give way. * Give way ! ' said Alida , repeating , and then , as she supposed , correcting the expression , give away what ? ' " For me to do some white-washing for him , ' replied the mason . " What was unintelligible before was now plain enough ; and , surprised and displeased at a request which seemed nothing less than impertinent , she exclaimed , Why , you are engaged to me ! and my work must then stand still , of course ! ' " Sartin , ma'am ; but if you ye a mind to give way , you know . ' " But I have not , ' replied she , angrily ; and appealed to her father , who , to increase her vexation , evidently hesitated . Why , papa ! how can you have any doubt ? I never heard any thing so unreasonable !  --  to expect us to suspend all our business ! - the man is absolutely engaged to us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very true , ' replied Mr. Frazier , but you can no more monopolize the only mason in the town , than you can the highway . You must , I believe , let him go , and take your reward , or your revenge , whichever you please to consider it , by requiring , in your turn , something quite as unreasonable , as I dare say that , before very long , you will be compelled to do . ' " After nearly innumerable similar delays , they were pronounced ready for the painter . ' But so was not he for them , though he had been engaged for weeks . After waiting for him in confusion worse confounded ' a whole fortnight , he drove up in his one-horse wagon . " What in the world has kept you so long , Mr. Clark ? ' asked Alida , impatiently . Why , ' replied he , very coolly , and leisurely taking out his kegs , . colors , oil.jugs , brushes , a stone on which to grind his paints , his whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to town , - why , ma'am , knowing you could n't be in no hurry , as yours is all inside work , I took this opportunity to paint Mr. Smith 's house , in Cartersville . ' " Opportunity ! ' - it was too bad ! - but what could be done ? - he was the only painter in the country , and his finishing touch was indispensable . // " But this touch completely finished Mr. Frazier 's patience , already sufficiently tried by delays and discomforts , inasmuch as he could not for a month come in contact with doors , windows , or wainscoting , without carrying off a portion of the paint . " - pp. 36 , 37 . The only other character which we have space to introduce to the reader 's notice is Lizzy Fay , a beautiful picture of unaffected gentleness and grace . During the severe illness of Alida , she watches over her with untiring kindness , and , on her recovery , remains in the family as a friend . Her unpretending good sense and true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less retiring graces of the city belle . Dorsey returns to visit Brookside ; and , from certain circumstances , is believed by Alida to be the lover of Lizzy , or at least to be the object of her love . Lizzy , meantime , who had been engaged to Richards , but had renounced him , from an impression that he had transferred his affections to another , though loving him still , is tormented with a persuasion , that he is now the lover of Alida , and that she is not insensible to his regard . Dorsey has been for years the friend of Richards ; but the complicated error is at last unravelled , and it appears that all has proceeded as it should . Mr. Richards is faithful to his earliest love , and Alida , improved and elevated by her country life , reconsiders her former resolution , and cheerfully bestows her hand on Dorsey . There are several episodes , which afford the author an opportunity of describing character with truth and power ; we have space only for the death-scene of Clarissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unworthy object . Lyman , whose name appears in the passage , is a deserving farmer , who has labored with manly generosity to obtain the heart , too deeply wounded by the disgrace and degradation of him to whom it had been early given . " For some time all was still , - the quiet only broken by the cricket 's cry , and the low breathing of the invalid ; and Alida , shading the light with her book , endeavoured to exchange her own sad thoughts for brighter ones . By and by a slight movement called her to the bed.side ; Clary opened her eyes , knew her , and feebly extended her hand ; then , drawing Alida towards her , expressed a wish to speak to her ; but requested , first , to be raised . Having been assisted to do so , her emaciation and helplessness were but too apparent ; her breathing became oppressed and quick , and Alida feared to see her expire in her arms . The exhaustion , however , was temporary ; and , when somewhat re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeble voice , and many interruptions , expressed her conviction that her end was fast approaching ; commended her mother to her friendship ; alluded , falteringly , to the poor lost one at Lemmington ' ; requested that he might he told he had her dying prayers ; said that she had no fear of death , but , to the surprise of Alida , expressed a desire to live . " To live ! ' she involuntarily repeated . Yes , ' replied Clary , with more firmness. " 0 , you know not what a teacher Death is ! In these few days that I have lain here , just as it were on the edge of life , I have learned more of myself and my duty than ever I knew before . I see myself a selfish , wilful creature , bringing sorrow on all that love me , and why ? Just because I could not submit to be crossed . ' " Alida tenderly reminded her of the renunciation and efforts she had made ; and that it was not her fault , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clary mournfully shook her head . " No , * said she ; so , indeed , I reasoned , but the clouds are clearing away . Though the mists of death cover my eyes , my mind can see plainer than it did . I ye acted like a petted child . I gave up what I dared not keep ; but I only wanted it the more . I was moved as much by fear and resentment as by conscience ; and having done what I thought a great thing , I gave myself up to my foolish heart . I hated the light ; I loathe d my food . Like the rebellious prophet , I said , " It is better for me to die than to live , " and I rejoiced to see my flesh waste and my strength fail . But that awful morning , when I was made to see what I had set my affections upon ! for whom I had disregarded father , mother , friends ! for whom I had kept back my love from Lyman , though I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise ! 0 , what a sight it gave me of myself ! - showing me a l ) oor , blinded , wilful creature , throwing away health , and life , and happiness , just because I had been mercifully restrained from destroying myself . 0 Miss Alida , if you should ever know any one who sets up her will against the leadings of Providence , and because she ca n't have every thing just to her mind , will have nothing , tell her of me . Now , when I would live , to be a comfort to my friends , and to atone for my folly , it is too late . The decree is gone forth ; and I , who thought I did well to grieve unto death , have got my desire. * " Exhausted by the effort of speaking , Clary closed her eyes and remained silent , - Alida entreating her to make no further exertion ; but , after a short pause , she resumed . " It is a relief to me to speak . I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make them feel so badly , and that would kill me at once ; but when I am gone you can tell them all . But do not let them think that because I have brought de // struction on myself ' , I have no peace in death . 0 , no ! The hope which was early given me has not deserted me . Although a rebellious child , I have not utterly fallen away . I know in whom I have trusted , and that He is able to deliver me . He never yet deserted a poor , repentant , confiding soul , whose hope , though in much infirmity , was yet stayed on Him ! ' " Here , with a momentary exultation , Clary raised her face to heaven . Emaciation had given prominence and strength to her formerly delicate features ; her eyes were lighted up with a brighter intelligence , and her countenance was irradiated with hope and joy . But the poor diseased body still obstructed the aspiring spirit . A faintness and oppression succeeded , and it was some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She then sunk again to sleep ; but not , as before , undisturbed : low moanings broke from her , and her breathing became quick and laborious . Alida , after vainly waiting , in hope of her obtaining more quiet sleep , became alarmed , and was about to summon Mrs. Hawkins , when she entered ; her watchful ear having caught the sounds of suffering . Her distress confirmed Alida 's worst fears . it soon became apparent that Clary was fast approaching the final conflict . She was , herself , conscious of it . Fixing her eyes tenderly on her mother , and then laying her hand on her heart , she said distinctly , though with difficulty , It is coming ; but this is warm yet , mother , - for you , - for all . ' She begged for air , and to be raised ; and , while adjusting her pillows , her father , brother , and Lyman , who of late scarcely left the house , entered . " We are accustomed to see women weep ; tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behold men - men , too , of hardy , apparently unmelting , natures - subdued to the softness of a weaned child , stirs our very hearts . Alida , as she turned from one manly , weather.beaten face to the other , and saw the different shades of feeling , - the bowed-down grief of the father , the turbulent sorrow of the brother , and the deep , speechless woe of the lover , already " Heavy with the life-long pang A widowed spirit bears , ' felt how false and pernicious are the sentiments that would separate us from our fellows ; and how good it was to be taught , that we have all of us one human heart . ' " Clary , though speech and strength fast failed her , endeavoured to express her yet unfailing love . Directing her eye to each , it finally rested on Lyman , and she extended her hand at the same time ; with which , as he eagerly took it , she endeavoured to draw him towards her . He knelt down by her side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it between his own , as if // to restore the warmth it was beginning to lose , and then , resting his cheek upon it , turned his fond , despairing eyes to Clary , that he might catch every look . Her mother , seated on the bed , supported her ; her apron thrown over her face , as if , in the spirit of the mother of Ishmael , she had said , Let me not see the death of the child . ' Her brother , trying , but vainly , to check his emotion , leaned against the bed , blinded by tears ; or , starting impetuously away , paced with impatient steps the little room , then returned to look and weep again . Her father , grief adding to the respect due to his gray hairs , stood erect at the foot of the bed , with arms crossed behind him ; and with eyes occasionally turned from his dying child to heaven , seemed to implore grace to bear the infliction . Clary understood it , and intimated her desire that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a broken voice , interrupted by his own emotion , and by the sobs of the rest . His words were few and simple . He thanked God for having given them such a pleasant child ' ; for the years that he had lent her to them ; for the early dews of grace that had been distilled upon her . He confessed that they had sinned in their idolatry of her ; and acknowledged , that , though , like the patriarch , they had said , This same shall comfort us concerning our work and the toil of our hands , ' it was just and right that they were afflicted . He implored pardon and peace for her , grace and submission for themselves ; that He , who had trod the dark valley for her , would be her light and guide through it ; and that they , her bereaved friends , left in a sinful world , might be prepared to follow her . " The debilitated frame of Clary opposed but feeble resistance . All that love could do , to detain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mandate was mercifully enforced , it was imperative . Her consciousness remained to the last ; and , as if anxious to atone to all , by signs and looks of love , she manifested that she thought more of them than of herself . Her respiration became more and more impeded , but attended neither by convulsion nor struggle ; and she sunk to rest on the bosom of her mother , with only the faint gasp which often attends the disturbed sleep of an infant . A profound silence succeeded the Inst sigh , which told that the spirit had fled . Mrs. Hawkins , still supporting the lifeless form , turned her eye to the window and then to Alida . A pale light announced the dawn , and she meant to say , My Clary 's night is also past ; but of her coming day there shall be no end ' ; and in the same assured faith , her father said aloud , Clary is now wiser than any of us ! The Lord 's will be done.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
