But in these days use is the incitement to invention , and science deems it her proudest trophy to facilitate labor and to make common as the stones comforts which once wealth alone could enjoy . Once books were ponderous folios ; now they are penny-magazines and facts for the million . Once learning was walled up in cloisters and universi ties ; now we have academies , and common schools , and colleges , almost as common , and regnrd it as nothing incongruous that a governor leaves his chair of state to go on an agency for common schools . Once the selfish seekers of preferment purchased place by being tools of lords and ladies , " crooking the supple hinges of the knee , that thrift may follow fawning ; " now the very same are the fawning , yet boisterous demagogues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the noisy sycophants of the mob . Political parties vie with each other which shall vocife. // rate loudest , " the people , " " the rights of the people , " " the equality of man ; " and these phrases , embodying sentiments the most lofty and sacred , have become nauseating cant , the very utterance of which suggests only the meanness and trickery of partizan selfishness . Has the patriot or the philanthropist a plan of beneficence ? Once each would have sought the influence of courts and nobles ; now the first condition of success is to gain favor with the people . And if there is any scheme of selfish aggrandizementto be accomplished , any scheme however injurious to national prosperity or morals , it is baptized with the name of the people , and wins success by bearing the name of those interests which , in effect , it undermines . All these are significant indications of the people 's progress . They show that a new dispenser of gifts and honors has arisen on the earth , a new monarch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose all-pervading influence the good and the bad have to acknowledge , that tosses thrones as playthings , that tears in pieces institutions consolidated by the strength of ages , and approaches nearer than any earthly power to almightiness . Every year we see this movement of the people gathering strength , and swiftness , and a wider sweep . We are beginning in this country to elect our judges ; we are removing restrictions from the ballot-box , and throwing power more and more directly into the hands of the people . Democracy has made strides since the administration of Washington . Great Britain reforms her Parliament , repeals her corn-laws , and discusses the separation of church and state . The King of Prussia declares that progress is too strong for him , and after years of promising , gives his subjects a constitution . Prince Metternich , who for fifty years has figured in the history of Europe as the Corypht*us of oppo sition to popular privileges , and thus has well earned the nickname which some punster has given him , of Prince Mitternacht ( midnight ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and-first taking care to shape them on his own model-fills all Austria with schools . Even the Autocrat of Russia is doing the same , and nearly all Europe is provided with a system of public education . Austria has abolished prospectively the corv*e  --  the old feudal right of the landholder to compel the labor of his tenantry . The Pope slackens his opposition to gas-lights and railroads , and releases from prison convicts for political offenses . Turkey abolishes the slave mart , and proclaims religious toleration . Every where we see the rising irnportance of the people ; courts , whose very names have been synonyms for tyranny , are compelled to yield immunities to their subjects ; and voluntary associations of individuals , that peculiar and significant phenomenon of modern times , are accomplishing what monarchs might attempt in vain . It is not the advancement of civilization merely , which we see ; literature and the fine arts have flourished ; there have been great cities , commerce , wealth , and forms of civil liberty , where the masses of mankind were degr*-ded . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the advancement of MAN . Like the father of waters with its mud , its weeds , and its drift-wood , as well as its richly freighted boats , the current of popular progress sweeps all things good and bad into itself , and flows on , sometimes spreading desolation over all its banks , yet ever flowing on wider and deeper to its issue . This movement commenced , not with the American Revolution , not with the sailing of the Mayflower , not with the rise of English Puritanism , not with the Protestant Reformation . Already must the peo // pie have arisen from the lowest depths , before any of these movements could have been possible . Far back in the dnrk ages , when the people were serfs , bought and sold sometimes with the soil to which they were attached , " having no connection with persons , things , or government , beyond the estate on which they dwelt , " when no central national government maintained its authority , when the barons in their castles exercised the power of life and death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chaos , originated the long conflict for popular rights . It has been maintained ever since , with every possible variety of fortune , with results differing in different countries , but on the whole with the constant advance of the people . Compare New England now with the nations then , and we shall see that we have gained , not only the right to choose our own rulers and make our own laws , which is but one among the latest of the triumphs in this conflict , but freedom from personal slavery , the right to property in the soil , freedom from hereditary nobility , the separation of church and state , liberty of conscience , liberty of speech and of the press , trial by jury , besides an incalculable advance in the general diffusion of the comforts of life , of intelligence , virtue , and the fear of God . Nor is there a nation in Christendom , which has not felt the throes of this struggling upward of the masses , nor one in which the people have made no advance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of Christendom . As Dr. Arnold has intimated in one of his letters , strip off all adjuncts and outward circumstances , and all the struggles of Europe , since the overthrow of the Roman empire , resolve themselves into the struggle between the party of pro . gress and its antagonist . Thus have the people been rising , gathering strength with the progress of ages ; sometimes crushed for long ages ; again bursting barriers strong as the ribs of earth , and heaving off burdens heavy as the Andes . Thus have the people been rising , like a huge continent lifting its black mass from the ocean 's bottom , at first , it may be , with upheaved , broken strata , and yawning fissures , and sweeping currents , but preparing for coming life and fruitfulness and beauty . Such is the movement in the midst of which we live , and which is heaving with it , us and all our institutions . Yet undeniable and really splendid as the progress of the people has been , we are apt to overrate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some new ones have taken the place of the old . If wars are less frequent , the lust of gain is more violent , and the spirit of chivalry has given place to the spirit of covetousness . If the press was never so prolific , neither was it ever so polluted . if the aristocracy of birth has ceased , the aristocracy of wealth is strengthened . If temperance prevails , yet crime increases . If men have ceased to be serfs , they have become the masters of negro slaves . If the schoolmaster is abroad , so , in another sense , are half the children . If readers were never so numerous , tl ) e demand for deep thought was never less . If knowledge , no longer hoarded , like golden ingots , by the few , is extended to the many , its superficiality is proportioncd to its extent . In attempting to simplify all learning , writers seem to have found out that , in intellectual effort , the grass . hopper is a burden , and accommodate the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the people have gained the right to exercise civil govern ment , faction strides by the side of liberty ; dernagogues flatter errors which they should rebuke , and aid in measures which they should resist , till by abject servility to popular caprice , they // gain at last the ascendency they desire ; and the deluded people , like the fools in Scripture who burned incense to their own net and sought counsel of their own staff , bow down to their own tools and worship the creatures of their own making . With old corruptions festering with the soreness of ages , and new ones breaking out , like the boils and blains which followed the murrain in Egypt , it becomes us rather to be toiling for the present than boasting of the past . Especially are Americans in dan*er of overlooking the work remaining to be done . The achievement of civil liberty was the work assigned by Providence to our fathers . Gloriously they performed it . And the impression seems to be , that popular progress began when they settled New England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the adoption of the federal constitution ; that the securing of civil liberty is the panacea for human misery , the beginning , middle and end of the people 's advancement ; and that , if republicanism can be universally established , it will be all the millenium the world can ever need . Considering the real greatness of this work , and the fact that it was accomplished in the infancy of the nation and identified with its whole history from the outset , we do not wonder at this result . As one who has been gazing on the sun , can see nothing any where but mock suns , it is natural enough that our eyes should have been blinded by the glory of our fathers ' deeds , so that , for a season , we should see nothing connected with the welfare of the people but the endlessly repeated and dazzling image of liberty and independence . But natural as it is , it is a dangerous delusion . It makes us boasters on our fathers ' account , while surrounded with evils which disgrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangers ; conceited trumpeters of liberty when we ought to be deploring and removing the ignorance and vice which are swelling among us . Under the idea that participating in civil government is the ultimatum of popular progress , it is leading us to push on in this direction to an extreme that threatens anarchy . As if discussing politics and exercising the right to vote were the great work which a freeman must do for the public good , it lays a foundation for the excesses of party spirit , and makes every election , as if the nation 's destiny turned upon it , stir from their smothered depths all the fires of the soul . Thus instead of advancing the people , like a river ever swelling in majesty and beauty , the whole tendency of this delusion is to keep them ever wasting their noisy energies on this one thing , like the roaring waves vainly dashing themselves forever on the same rocky shore . It is time Americans awaked from this dream ; time we felt that the conflict of our fathers was but one action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one acquisition ; acquisitions as important remain for us to make . God gave them their work and they did it . He is giving us another work , as ennobling , if we perform it , as that wrought by the heroes of the Mayflower and of 76 . How preposterous , when a man half drunk , it may be , deposits a vote which he can not read for a man of whom he is as ignorant as of his letters , to tell him he is exercising the dearest right of freemen , the highest prerogative of humanity ; or to imagine it more essential to freedom that every man vote , than that every man be intelligent , virtuous and happy . What is the privilege of voting to him-voting it may be under the dictation of a demagogue , who has bought his vote for liquorwhat is its value to him , compared with an education in knowledge and goodness , which would have made // him a man , an independent , thinking man ? What is it to the corn . community , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can never use except either in grinding for his masters , or in pulling down destruction on himself and them together . The right to be educated , the right to be trained to intelligence and goodness , and thus to be put in the way of gaining the respect of men and the favor of God , is as sacred and as real as the right to vote . It is more valuable to the man , more necessary to the public . It is the glory of Massachusetts that first of all the states of Christendom , and only twenty-seven years after the first settlement of Plymouth , she recognized this right , and provided by law for the education of all her children in knowledge and piety . The glory of that act outshines the glory of bearing on her soil Faneuil Hall and Bunker Hill . It is time we understood that the end of popular progress is not the improvement of man 's external social and political condition . The destiny of the individual is grander than the destiny of states . The ultimate end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The acquisition of civil freedom is only a means to this end . So are all inventions in the arts , and all improvements in the outward social condition . The work of our fathers in establishing civil liberty , instead of completing the advancement of man , was rather the removing obstacles , and putting us in a way of carrying on the work to advantage . They felled the forests which op. pressed the land , and dug out the very roots of the tyranny which had overshadowed it . This was their work . It is ours , not to stand and shout over the mighty oaks their axes felled , but to cultivate the clearing , till every part of it shall be like the garden of the Lord . In a country where , for the first time since the sun shone , the restraints which states and hierarchies have put on the improvement of men are torn off , and a clear way opened for man to go onwards-i-in a country into which*-according to the prophecy , " the Gentiles shall come to thy light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feed their bodies and to stretch and exercise their hitherto cramped and crooked souls , here is our work ,  --  to enlighten and purify the people ; to put them in the way of gaining , each , the comforts of a well provided and happy home ; to raise each to the elevation of knowledge , to the privileges belonging to immortals , to the dignity of sons of God ; to qualify each to make earth more heavenly by dwelling in it , and heaven more glorious by going to it . Such is the work that comes on us  --  the work of advancing in these its higher stages , that popular progress through which the people have for ages been struggling-the responsibility of occupying the most favorable situation ever occupied for advancing the interests of man  --  a work , so far from being complete , that the like in the extent of its influence and the momentousness of its results , in its greatness if accomplished , its horrors if left undone , never came on a generation of men before . Having thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still needs to be , we propose to show its dependence on Christianity . It needs only a glance at history to see that the progress of man has been directly proportioned to the influence of Christianity . We have only to contrast oriental stagnation of mind with western activity-oriental despotism with western constitutions . We have only to ask , Why has Mohammedanism , with the mighty vigor of its youth , developed a civilization so miserable and retrogressive ; while around Christianity* although weakened by corruption and plunged in the midst of barba ' rians , has been wrought a civiliza. // tion so elastic , vigorous , and pro . gressive ? We have only to point to the indisputable , fact , that the world over , the line which divides the progressive from the stationary and the retrograde , is the same which divides Christianity from Mo . hammedanism and heathenism ; and that in Christendom , those nations stand highest , into which true Chris . tianity has most thoroughly penetrated . Were there nought else to declare it , Christianity would show its path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brook , which " by the livelier green , Betrays the secret of its hidden course . " Nor is the history of ancient Greece and Rome an exception . Theirs was a civilization in which vice rotted under the gauze of refinement , and corruption steamed beneath the silks of luxury . Theirs were forms of liberty under which the populace were ignorant , turbulent , and factious , and , with the exception of limited municipal privileges in a few cities , oppressed beneath a tyrannical aristocracy . But we may look more at particulars ; and , though sweeping assertions are sometimes made on this subject too indiscriminating to be valuable or true , though in a maze of events so extensive , complicated , and obscure , it is not easy to assign the precise influence of particular causes , yet there are points of connection between Christianity and popular progress which historical facts indicate with a near approach to certainty . Guizot , the statesman of France , who can not have been drawn to such a conclusion by theological predilections , gives us his authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link-the principle of civilization between the Roman and the barbarian world . Her influence on modern civilization has been more powerful than its most violent adversaries or its most zealous defenders have supposed . " When the barbarians were establishing themselves in the south of Europe , the old civilization was broken up , society was ground to chaos , and every thing had to be begun anew . Here , then , must have been the starting point of our modern popular progress . It was then the church addressed herself to the work of conquering her conquerors , and bringing them , by measures not always as scriptural as vigorous , to her faith . Thenceforward history is full of proofs of her influence and the influence of Christianity in advancing the interests of man . We say  --  the influence of the church and of Christianity-because these must be distinguished . Through the middle ages , it is the church as an outward institution , which assumes prominence , rather than Christianity as a renewing and sanctifying principle ; it is the indirect , yet real and powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more frequently than its converting efficacy . From the fifth century onward for nearly one thousand years , the church was the only depositary of intelligence and moral influence , the two principal elements of progress . It is common to regard the church , during the most of this period , as one mass of ignorance and corruption . But it was not so . During the later and earlier parts of this period there were men of learning and talents-during all of it , all the learning there was , was in the church . The church during much of this period was full of intellectual action , energetic , if not always the most profitable , and awakened attention to some of the greatest questions affecting the welfare of man . In truth there was no science but theology ; the only school education of Europe was theological ; and so late as Galileo 's day , discoveries in science must be tested by theology . And yet , was not this the shadow of // a great truth ? Europe had not awakened to the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but theology . And we have not yet learned the truth which that shadowed forth , that all knowledge is theology , because all knowledge is to be sought as knowledge of God . Bacon showed that there was science other than the theology of the schools  --  and in what monstrosities of German illuminati and French philosophists it issued ; to what putting second causes in God 's place , to what an unsanctified literature , what atheistic science , it has led . When shall we return-not to cramp science with theological dialectics  --  but to study it reverentially , as making known , in all its departments , Him , who " lives in all life , extends through all extent , " in whom we " live , and move , and have our being ? " But we digress . We see that the church not only preserved learning from annihilation for the benefit of after ages , but wielded continually the entire influence of the learning of the day . Nor was the church utterly corrupt . The very fact that such men as Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wickliffe , Kempis , occasionally appear through this whole period  --  the very fact that " heresies " were perpetually breaking out during the progress of corruption , and that council after council met to discuss abuses  --  the very fact that Luther 's reformation burst from the bosom of the church , is each a proof that there were vigor and life within . Great as were the vices of the clergy , there were many exceptions . When corruption was the greatest and most extensive , *vhatever of loftier and purer influence there was , issued from the church . And when human laws were all crushed beneath the shock of barbarian invasion , and during the long ages after , in which the history of Europe was but a terrific realization of " might makes right , " the church alone proclaimed a law over human will , a power above human power ; she stood ever pointing to the divine and the eternal ; and savages who never knew fear before , trembled and quailed before an authority founded on the invisible . The very existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but brute force , it has well been said , saved society from sinking into utter barbarism . The church retained a regular government in the midst of confusion elsewhere universal . The secular government , after the conquest by the barbarians , was unsystematized , irresponsible brute force . The church alone had a regular govern ment ; she alone appealed to law and justice in the midst of arms . this will account in part for the rapid strides of the church in usurp. ing secular power at this time . Imperfect as her administration was , it was seen to be far preferable to the rule of the impetuous nobles . Men sought as a privilege the church 's adjudication of their quarrels , and rejoiced to bring secular affairs under the more benign and just control of ecclesiastical authorities . Thus power naturally fell into the hands of the church , because she was best qualified to exercise it ; because , by retaining something of justice and order , she was the only tribunal of appeal for redress of grievances . In usurping power , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced the will of mankind . The offices of the church were open equally to men of all ranks . After the Norman conquest , the Saxons were crushed with a most cruel oppression , and excluded from all office . But this was never entirely accomplished in the church , and in less than a century from the battle of Hastings , Becket , of Saxon birth , became Archbishop of Canterbury . Even slaves were not excluded . So many , how*ver , became // free by entering holy orders or taking monastic vows , that the practice was restrained by the civil power , and finally , in many countries , forbidden . The church was the leading instrument in many of the most important reforms which have been achieved . We may refer to the concurring testimony of historians , that to the church is in great part to be ascribed the reform of civil and criminal legislation ; the abolition of trial by ordeal , by duel , and the like ; the termination of private wars , and , to so great an extent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close of an elaborate investigation , from the original authorities , of slavery in the Christian era , gives the following as his conclusions : " Christianity did much to abolish slavery in the Roman empire . It effected a glorious triumph in almost every part of the imperial dominions . There was no royal edict which crushed slavery at once . But its contrariety to the New Testament was gradually seen . Clergymen vindicated the rights of the oppressed . The codes of slave law were ameliorated , till Justinian nearly completed the reform . " With the barbarians , slavery reappeared ; and in such a form that servitude seems to have been regarded the proper condition of the people , and though freemen other than the feudal proprietors existed , their condition was so miserable that it was not uncommon for them voluntarily to become slaves . " In the abolition of this , Christianity again performed her work of mercy . Wherever her voice could be heard , the poor viilein was not forgotten . The Bishop was the appointed protector of slaves in his diocese . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attribute the gradual abolition of the system to the effectual aid of Christianity . " We have the same authority for the following fact , which may be mentioned as a single example of the influence of the church . Bristol was the last city in England to abandon the importation and exportation of white slaves . Wuistan , Bishop of Worcester , visited Bristol several years in succession , resided months in the neighborhood , and preached every Sunday against the barbarity and irreligion of the slave dealers . The merchants were convinced by his reasonings , and in their guild solemnly hound themselves to renounce the traffic . The perfidy of one of their number afterwards was punished with the loss of his eyes . Christianity has given to the people liberty of conscience . Guizot , in his Lectures on Civilization , suggests that at the barbarian conquest , the church , in self-defense , set up successfully the claim that the secular power should have no control in spiritual matters , and that thus the distinction , so essential to all human interests , between the civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established . This is true ; although the same distinction had been , to a great extent , recognized under the empire . It is equally true that here was the element of liberty of conscience and the entire separation of church and state , had there been only a mind to develop and apply it . This grand idea is the offspring of the church above , for all the ancient governments controlled religion , and never might a god be worshiped till the state permitted . Unfortunately , however , the church , having separated the temporal and the spiritual powers , gradually reunited them in herself ; having wrested the control of conscience from the state , she took it into her own hands , till the little finger of the one became thicker than the other 's loins . And here we see the influence of Christianity , not only in distinction from , but in opposition to the church . The application of the principles // and the spirit of ' the Gospel has established liberty of ' conscience . Before these the Inquisition has fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persecution for religion become comparatively a strange thing . And this gift of Christianity to men has done much for civil freedom . Christianity brings with it principles which men value mord than life ; and wherever it has entered the domains of tyrannywhether in imperial Rome , or under a persecuting church , or in barbarous Madagascar  --  the tyrant finds at once men who will not do his will . He slays , but he can not bend them . Thus it sets up barriers against the will of tyrants , and lays the first stone in the foundation of liberty . " And Peter and John answered , Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God " - this answer , so familiar to us , so sublime as it first was announced to a world who knew nothing but to worship according to the traditions of the elders or the decrees of the government-embodies the elements of earth 's noblest deeds . It is as if its very words were not so much words , as martyrdoms , Bartholomew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human mind on its present career of independent inquiry , activity and progress . Teaching every man that to his own master he standeth or falleth , imposing on him a responsibility which eternity alone measures and which he can not divide with another , it necessarily throws him off from proscription to think and act for himself . Never has Christianity penetrated a country , nor a cottage , nor a cabin , without awaking the mind to earnest thought and drawing out its energies to earnest acnon . The Protestant Reformation is an instance on a large scale . It was then that Christianity stood over the grave of free inquiry , as Jesus at the grave of Lazarus , and cried , come forth . Forth came that spirit , and the grave-clothes of superstition were cast away . She has gone abroad no more to die : she has roused men to action ; she has ripped up old errors ; she has torn away abuses ; she has dug up buried truths ; she has multiplied inventions , increased wealth , diffused comforts ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has often forgotten and sometimes stabbed the benefactor that raised her from the grave , and allying herself with the selfish and the devilish , has committed excesses at which Christianity weeps , yet it was Christianity that started her career , and that ever is striving to restrain it , that it may be only a career of blessing . It is a singular fact , commented on by Guizot , that , at the very time when , in the church , the spirit of free inquiry was going forth , in the state , power was rapidly concentering in the monarch , and from the confusion of feudalism , the governments were changing into the likeness of oriental despotisms . But the freedom of inquiry awakened by Christianity , could not long exist without being brought to act on the state . And history shows , in quick succession , English Puritanism , the settlement of New England , the English revolution , the American revolution ,  --  all results of the collision of mind freed by Christianity , with the growing despoti*m of the state . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancing liberty even Hume testifies , but in all the history of Christendom , the church has been ahead of the state , and taken the lead in its progress ; it has occasioned the opposition to tyranny which has specially marked the last two hundred years ; it has originated and in some respects to a degree guided the career of activity to which , with such almost fearful energy , the human mind is now roused . // Christianity alone infused into popular progress the sublime element of ' the rights of man-rights belonging to man not by grant of rulers , nor by accident of birth , or wealth , or nature ; but belonging to him as man . Tory journalists of the old world still deny that there are any such things as inalienable rights ; that there is any equalily of man . But these are realities . Their foundation and their only foundation is the teaching of the Gospel , Honor all men , the grand gospel doctrine of the brotherhood of man . They have no meaning except as derived from the Gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Father , subjects of one law , fallen under one condemnation , redeemed by the same Savior , equally bound to love all as ourselves , and destined alike to the same judgment . Our declaration of independence , so far as it teaches the equal rights of man , , is but an application to civil affairs of that principle of universal love *vhich* . Christ taught . The idea in question and kindred sentiments have become popular of late . Demagogues and infidels love to harp on them . The fact shows how powerful is the hold which they at last have gained on the human mind . But let them who use them know that these sentiments are the creatures of eternity , the gift of Christianity to man . We proceed to show that the connection between Christianity and popular progress must be maintained and made more intimate and complete . The people will go onwards with accumulating power . But there is a fearful uncertainty whether their progress will be beneficent or destructive . Here , then , we see the necessity of Christian influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the principles and imbued with the spirit of Christ 's religion . This leviathan , which is " making the deep to boil like a pot and his path to shine after him , " must be tamed and guided . But there is no hook that can be put in his nose ; he laugheth at the shaking of the spear . Nothing can tame and guide him but " the sweet influences " of heaven , the word of God . The influence of Christianity is essential to prevent popular progress from being purely selfish , and consequently cruel and tyrannical . The love of liberty is natural to man . It is the province of Christ- ' ianity , not to originate , b utvindicate , develop , and guide it . When the spirit of liberty had decayed in the Roman empire , the barbarians brought with them that natural love of independence , always so conspicuous in savages . They first infused this element into our modern progress of man ; and , as we shall see , it has given and still gives tokens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though perhaps the noblest sentiment of the natural heart , yet always shows itself there as a spirit of selfishness , with a constant tendency to oppression and cruelty . History is perpetually demonstrating this . The barbarians themselves afford a striking instance . rpheir intense love of independence did not prevent their holding slaves in their native lands ; and after they had settled in their new conquests , it soon issued in the tyranny of the strong over the weak ; for a season the middle class disappeared ; to all practical purposes , society was made up of a multitude of serfs and a few barons  --  the clergy and the monks are an important exception-and the people existed only in the capacity of beasts of burden or bloodhounds , as their owners had occasion to use them . Hence the phenomenon which developed itself in the middle ages  --  the most chivalrous zeal for rights with the most cruel oppression . A similar phenomenon is still to be seen , negro slavery finding its last strong-hold // in the American republic . These are instances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty to oppression ; they show in the child the lineaments of its selfish and barbarian origin ; they prove something more than an accidental connection between the chivalrous in feeling and the tyrannical in practice . The French Revolution exhibits , under a different aspect , the same tendency of the natural spirit of liberty to tyranny . It actually wrought out a tyranny in the name of freedom , compared with which the tyranny of Bourbons and Stuarts was a blessing-tyranny which pierced into the recesses of privacy , and regulated the minutiw of dress and language , so that at the peril of his life a man wore a decent coat , or called his neighbor , Mr. Other instances of the same tendency are the cruelties , the horrible excesses committed so often by the people in seeking to regain their rights . History is full of proofs that the spirit of liberty natural to man tends constantly to tyranny and cruelty-a tendency whose results have sometimes made the very name of liberty a stench in all the earth , and and do still , through their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing but Christianity is sufficient to oppose this evil . It alone can extract the poison which the liberty tree sucks up from its root of sin , and carries to its remotest branch , and pours into all its fruit . The Bible teaches the theory of human rights in a manner peculiar to itself . It says but little of our own rights , much of the rights of others , which it teaches us to respect as sacredly as our own . It is not my rights , my rights , it is their rights , their rights , which it teaches us perpetually to reiterate . Every right of mine implies a duty of others to me . Every right of others implies a duty of mine to them . The Bible teaches liberty by insisting on our duties and their rights ; selfishness teaches liberty by insisting on their duties and our rights . It is another aspect of scriptural teachings on human rights , that it teaches by practical precepts rather than by abstract principles . Its pages are not stuffed with high-flown theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it lays down practical directions , which can not be obeyed without producing as nearly an equality in the universal enjoyment of rights and privilges , as diversity of capacity and other unalterable circumstances will permit . This it does in requiring us to love others as ourselves , to do good as we have opportunity , to deny self , in imitation of Christ , in order to bless mankind , to do good even to those who hate and injure us . Be other men what they may , the injunction of God , never abated , never suspended , is , do them good , do them good . These are principles which it is impossible to unfold and apply without elevating the whole body of the people . Patriotism claims to seek the welfare of a nation . Public spirit claims to seek the welfare of a community ; and the sacrifices to which they have led are transmitted to undying fame . But what are they ? Open your Bible . Listen ; you will hear it call ; not for here and there a hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but for every inhabitant of earth , whether rewarded with fame , or obloquy , or persecution , or laboring utterly unknown , to devote all to the welfare of mankind ; you will hear it uttering principles , obedience to which will make every person more heroic in toil , and self-sacrifice , and greatness of heart , than any that patriotism ever produced . It is thus that Christ appears as the people 's friend . It was prophesied that he should " stand for an ensign to the people ; " that he should " vindicate the popr of the // people and break in pieces the op. pressor2 ' When he came , he excited the rage of the Pharisees for mingling with the people . But he was with them , not as a demagogue or a declaimer , as the Pharisees maintained , but as a teacher and philanthropist. rrhus the inspired writers , with a skill which inspiration alone could give , so present their teachings that they can not he obeyed without at once securing all the blessings of liberty and preventing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of liberty to the full , and at the same time rescue it from all the evil consequences to which it naturally tends . Popular progress must be guided by Christianity to prevent the prevalence of a time-serving spirit , and the consequent decay of integrity . There is a tendency insepara. ble from popular governments-we speak of an inevitable tendency , not a necessary result  --  to dispose of office by a sort of auction , to him who will most thoroughly truckle to the caprice of the people , and thus to put a premium on time-serving . XVhoever dares resist a popular claim , however extravagant , is likely to be branded as an aristocrat ; whoever OPl ) O5*5 a measure , however iniquitous , which a triumphant majority are bent on carrying , may expect to be crushed like a fly beneath the foot of a giant . Every politician knows that his advancement , nay , his political existence depends on pleasing the people . To an ambitious man here is a temptation *vell-nigh irresistible , to put the will of the people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity instead of right . All the motives of avarice , ambition , l ) ride , and selfishness , unite with the circumstances in which he is thrown , to urge to this result . There can not be a combination of influences contrived tending more strongly to dethrone law , to trample on unchange able truth and justice , to blot out the very idea that there is an eternal difference between right and wrong , and to set up the weathercock of popular favor as the guide of all conduct and the criterion of all character . Here is a tremendous strain on public virtue , felt by every civil officer , from the President and Congress to the juryman and constable ; and it will crack , if there be naught to strengthen it but creeping policy and earth-born morality . Already we see evidences how far this tendency has prevailed among us , since , whatever measure is proposed , the question of questions is , What shall we do with this in order to advance our party ? and peace and war are voted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political capital . We see the reflex influence of this tendency on the People . If they are rushing into error or wickedness , or interested in evil institutions or practices , their leaders are afraid to rebuke them , are more likely to cheer them on . The people , therefore , are likely to be confirmed in ignorance and vice . Whatever evil is to be removed , whether slavery , or intemperance , or anti-rent riots , or Popery , the fear of losing votes becomes a grand hindrance of our efforts . Besides in a country where so large a proportion of the citizens sometimes hold office , the existence of this tendency in public life must spread it far among private citizens . Example spreads it farther . And , where the public are so much the arbiters of all prosperity , every man has a direct interest in pleasing the people . The lawyer loses business , the editor his subscribers , the clergyman endangers his salary , the merchant his custom-if he is not popular . Hence an all-pervading tendency to make public sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so // much popular influence , it seems almost to be  --  a tendency to make a a community void of manly regard to rectitude , and consequently of true nobleness of character , and to substitute instead of fixed principles , a crooked and changeling policy . In this way the path is opened wide for the demagogue and the way prepared for tyranny at last . The flinty elements of liberty , which in a religious and intelligent community resist all encroachment , are fretted to dust , and the people degenerate by degrees into a despicable and yet terrific populace , who substitute the gratification of caprice for a well ordered liberty , who by continued flattery are made conceited and turbulent , and yet are satisfied with adulation without liberty , who are bigoted in their ignorance and yet the easy dupes of knaves . Such a populace are ripening like a peach , to fall at last into the mouth of him that plucks it ; fattening like swine , to be but up at last by the butcher that has stuffed them . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gospel . This is the only adamantine barrier against which all the power of tyrants , the arts of demagogues , and the fury of mobs spend themselves in vain . It brings eternal truths , based upon God 's authority and sanctioned by eternal retributions-it brings them to every man as his guide , and teaches him that it is at the peril of all that is most valuable , that he dares neglect them . Let the people clamor for what they may , the ruler imbued with these principles will do right . Let the demagogue entice as he may , the people imbued with these principles will do right . And if the people be thus imbued , the tendency to seek popular favor will be less dangerous , for popular favor can be gained only by doing right . In a country like ours , where the people must decide every question on every subject , where every hungry fox knows how to flatter to get his cheese , where in mechanics and trade , in politics and education , in reformation and religion , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people  --  and where progress for good or ill is so rapid that , in passing from youth to manhood , one sees more changes than once in passing from infancy to old age , the eternal and unchanging truths of Christianity must be established ; the foot of every child must be planted on this adamantine basis . When popular progress is moulded by Christianity , when the sun of of righteousness shall shine it every heart , men will cease to run after every will-o ' - the- wisp , " which leads to bewilder and dazzles to blind . " Then will the days of the demagogue , then will the days of political shuffling and chicanery be numbered . Popular progress must be guided by Christianity to prevent its issuing in anarchy . Here we must allude to that unchristian and pernicious theory of government  --  the common theory that government is founded in a social compact ; that all the rights of government are the rights surrendered by the individual when he entered the society , in consideration of the protection government affords . This theory is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alledged facts which every body knows never existed . It leads by its logical consequences , were they consistently carried out , to the dissolution of all government ; since it precludes gov. eminent from the right to take life , to imprison , or to inflict any other punishment which the individual had no right to inflict on himself . Thus the common theory of government embodies within itself the elements of anarchy . In opposition to this dangerous and shallow theory , we n*ust estab-* // lish Christian principles , as to the foundation of human government . The Bible declares , " There is no power but of God . " This teaches that no man , no body of men , may exercise a particle of authority over a single man , woman , or child , except God has delegated that authority . The right to govern a human being vests in God alone , and the man who undertakes to govern without authority delegated to him by God , usurps the prerogatives of Jehovah . God has given this authority to parents in their families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government he determines not ; he leaves this to the people , under the direction of his own law . But the authority to govern comes , not from the people , but from God . Men are equal in rights . if one is to exercise authority over others , he must have something to stand on higher than his equals , men , can give . That foundation God has laid . Men may say which of all their fellows may mount that divine foundation , and for how long , and under what limitations he or they may govern . But when once they have placed a ruler over them , he is the minister of God ; his authority is derived , not from the people , but from God . The Most High has not left men to act their own pleasure with impunity ; to set up a government which shall be nothing but the reflection of their pleasure and bound to gratify them in all their wickedness . He has based government on his own authority , not to gratify the corrupt wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execute wrath upon him that doeth evil . " This Christian theory of government had been perverted to teach the divine right of kings , to teach not only that the right to govern rests on God 's appointment , but that kings were divinely appointed to govern . Revolting from this error , men , as is common , have gone to the opposite extreme , have ceased altogether to recognize God as the foundation of governmental authority , and put the people as the source of all authority in God 's stead . Hence the theory of the social compact . This theory the French infidels of the last century , in consistency with their designs of shutting the idea of God out of every thing , were zealous in propagating ; to their efforts its present prevalence and popularity are not a little owing . It may be supposed that it can not have much practical influence which of these two abstract theories of government is believed . But we are in the habit of thinking that abstract general principles , seemingly so powerless when brought out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nakedness by the theologian , are the elements of influence that move the world . What mean our anti-rent outrages and our Mormon wars ? our riots and our lynching ? our sworn juries setting aside the law ? What tnean the trifling with the constitution , the general loosening of authority and relaxing of restraint ? What mean the sympathy for criminals , the multiplication and the impunity of crime ? These things mean that the principle we are opposing has gone abroad into the community ; it has spoken to men 's minds ; it has twined around the depraved heart ; it has loosened the foundations of government ; it has told men that law is but their own breath ; that the foundation of government is their own wills ; that the right to ptinish is only what themselves have given ; that they have the right to do all their pleasure . Now let the sacred truth of Christianity go abroad again ; let it be regarded in families and taught in schools ; let it be proclaimed in pulpits and legislative halls ; let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the heart of the greyheaded sire , and of the strong man , and the laughing child  --  the great // truth that the authority of government rests on the authority of God ; that the voice of law is the voice of God ; that the sword of the ruler which smites the criminal , is a sword that God has given him , that he that resisteth that authority , resisteth the ordinance of God  --  and it needs no prophet 's tongue to foretell that subordination will bless our firesides , and violence cease to blight our land , that law will again walk forth in her simple and awful majesty with power , that the attacks of those who would break her sceptre and silence her heavenly voice , will fail , and all men bow before her and own that " her seat is the bosom of God . " But we may see the tendency of popular progress to anarchy aside from any specific theory of government . While the people are accustomed to feel that all interests are subordinate to them , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion , exist for their benefit , they come , by a natural mistake , to imagine that their will is the source of all authority , the origin , expression and execution of all law ; that all power originates , all accountability terminates in them . These principles lead straight to mobs and anarchy . They lead straight to agrarianism . " Vote yourselves property . " " Vote yourselves not only the wild lands of government , but the property of rich men . " And why not , if the will of the majority is the origin and arbiter of right ? Why not , if the will of the people is the source of all authority ? And what mob , but could justify itself by saying , " We are the people ; the people 's will is the rightful source of power ? " These are the natural results of the principles of liberty and the rights *f man taught in the infidel school , and growing up in a selfish regard to our own rights . It is only carrying out to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul of unsanctified liberty , " The voice of the people is the voice of God . " We have seen that the element of personal independence was introduced into modern European progress by the barbarians . Extremes meet ; and here we see the most advanced state of society , attained after ages of progress , tending by excess , to the uibinding of all law , to the ancient state of barbarian independence . There are principles working in the community , which could not be fully carried out without bringing us back to the state of the Goths and Vandals . One is tempted to ask , " Are we completing the circuit ? Are we coming to the end and therefore to the beginning of the ordo &amp;eclorum ? " And after all , is man 's progress , as the scoffers would have it , nothing but progress in a circle ? If we would answer these questions in the negative , if we would not have popular progress " overleap itself and fall " in anarchy , we must found it on and guide it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our rights , but the rights of others ; and both our rights and theirs we must recognize as springing from , and controlled by Him who has made both us and them ; who is the source of all authority and law ; who speaks , and not the agreeing voice of men and angels can make that right which lie declares wrong ; who is the ruler of all republics and democracies , not less than King of kings , and Lord of lords . Christianity is essential to popular progress , because it renovates individual hearts . The great problem respecting government is , How shall man enjoy the largest personal independence in connection with social subordination and order ? In the attempt to realize the two , nations have swung from extreme to extreme . The struggle for subordination and social order has perpetually verged towards tyranny ; the struggle Tor personal independence has perpetually verged towards anarchy . We have seen with what // divine simplicity the inspired writers solve this problem . Christianity works out in practice the solution which they have written . Religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect union of these seeming incompatibles . It alone can realize the personal independence of savage life in connection with the order of well-organized government . It does it by writing the law on the heart , by making the desires of the individual coincident with the requirements of justice and the general welfare . In our remarks on this head , we have limited ourselves chiefly to the progress of civil liberty and popular power  --  a single aspect of the subject , otherwise too vast for a single essay . It remiUns only that we learn some of the lessons which the subject teaches . We may gain more enlarged views of the subject of reforms . When men devote their lives to a specific work of reform , which some seem raised up in Providence to do , the tendency is to a certain narrowness of mind , a certain self-conceit , a certain spirit of overbearing and denunciation . They feel as if the progress of man commenced in their efforts , and is comprehended in their specific cause . The specific evil which they oppose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none but they ever saw , which is devouring the sun , and threatening universal ruin ; and nothing will answer , but all men must abandon every thing to crush the monster , as the last hope of escaping immediate destruction . Let them learn modesty and wisdom by enlarging their views of human progress . Let them know that it is an old enterprise , in which earth 's true nobles have long been toiling , that in many cases , the very ref*rm they urge was advanced far in ages past , by workers whose names are lost in the distance . Let them see that human progress , is , in truth , the progress of Christianity , which , like the tide raised by heavenly influences in the ocean , is filling every separate creek and stream , and recording inch by inch on the shores of a thousand inlets , that uprising of the deep which no eye but God 's can measure . Let it be known that the schemes of the Fourierite , the Garrisonian , the Millerite , and the like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always bubbled upon the surface of the flowing tide . Let the practical man of business , who can not conceive of any human progress except invention of steam-engines and power-looms , nor of . any valuable activity but the activity of manufactures and commerce , know that Magna Charta was signed while the floors of nobles were carpeted with straw , that slavery was extensively passing away while commerce scarcely crept beyond the shores of the Mediterranean , that Puritanism was in England before the " Nuremberg eggs , " ( as they called pocket watches , ) that the great revolutions of 1649 and 1688 , were accomplished before Watt or Arkwright was born , and that Luther had nailed his ninety-five thescs to the church door in Wittemberg before there was a post office system , or a coach in England , or a carriage on springs in Paris . And when the man of speculative habits sighs in his study that Plato and Aristotle are buried beneath ledgers , and that the exchange , the stationhouse , and the manufactory , have left scarcely a place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know , that the activity he deplores is the offspring of the truth he loves ; that his abstract principles are not dead , hut have gone abroad embodied in life . His nest is emptied by the hatching of its eggs . The theorems of pure geometry are to be found in the structures of the engineer , the principles of physical science in innumerable inventions ; // philosophy has taken the shape of practical school systems , and forms of government , and modes of prisoa discipline ; and the truths of Christianity are working in the forms of missionary enterprises and West Indian ernancipations . Let the thinker recognize the fondlings on which he brooded in solitude , now that , with every variety of wing , they flit over all the earth and fill the heavens with their noise . Thus may we all avoid the error of regarding reforms otherwise than as parts of the great scheme of Christianity , that divine enterprise , of which the Importaoce can he measured only by the interests of mankind , and the completion secured only by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . " The church with all her energies must sympathize with popumi-progsess , and control it by the power of the gospel . The current of Christian influence has become powerful , and sweeps every thing into itself . Men will not tolerate what does not , in pretense or in truth , fall in with that great aim of Christianity , the improvement of mankind . Therefore every man is constrained to turn philanthropist , and the very Sauls do prophesy . Infidels generally have known how to adapt themselves to the condition of society . When the nations were awakening to think for themselves , infidels approached mankind under the name of free inquirers . In these more advanced stages of popular progress , they come to us as philanthropists and reformers . We hear comparatively little of their sophistical arguments against the Bible . But if there is a movement against war , against intemperance , against slavery , they throw themselves into and try to control it . They are zealous for common schools , provided they are schools without Christianity . They even take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible , aver that Christianity is nothing but doing good . Here is the necessity that the church sympathize with the spirit of the times , and employ all her energies in elevating the people , rushing to the front rank of every benevolent enterprize , and taking its guidance into her own hands . It is necessary , not only because it is her appropriate work , to neglect which is to neglect the sacred trust which Christ has given her , but in defense of her own existence . There is , indeed , much that is wild , dangerotis and devilish , attending the onward movement of the people . But to attempt to stop the movement , that we may check its irregularities , would be shutting up the womb to prevent the pangs of travail . It might be pleasant to withdraw from the maddening scene , and wrap ourselves in the shadows of the past . But if we do thus , false Anthony will steal the people 's hearts , while Brutus , their true friend , is hidden . If the church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes themselves , , look on them coldly , assu roe continually the appearance of opposition , . spend her strength , not in doing , but in finding fault with what is done , she is driven to a false position , a position which must cripple her , and impair her hold on men . Woe to us , if the pulpit fail to sympathize with the spirit of the times , and sets beside the boasting philanthropy of infidels nothing but a tame conservatism . Woe to us , if the church law behind the times , and by her inaction , permit infidelity and irreligion to be associated in men 's minds with reform and progress , and the church and the ministry onl ywith indifference or opposition to reform and progress . And it is a question to be pondered , whether the church and the ministry have not , within fifteen years , suffered themselves to he pushed into this false position , and thus brought on themselves un // necessary reproach , and given to her enemies a position of influence with the irreligious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles , they never could have gained . The church must throw herself with all her energies ir*to every good work - not to outclamor the clamorous , not to show sympathy with the fanatical , but to do the work in the spirit of Christ . This we deem certain ; if the church do not throw herself into the onward movement of men , its tremendous energies will be turned against her . If the church do not make Christianity control this movement , it will sweep her to destruction . An instance of the truth of this is found in the French Revolution . The church , through its corruptions , found itself in a false position , standing the antagonist of progress , the advocate of abuses , the enemy of inquiry . Terribly she was swept away . Different had been her fate , had she participated in the spirit of reformation which had pervaded the people , and , as the church did in the English and the Americah Revolution , had stood and proclaimed the gospel as the charter of human rights . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movement , as in fact it was controlled in England and America-if not into an entire conformity with Christianity , yet to such a degree as to make the movement a blessing . In proportion as the church in any age pursues an analogous course , she will experience analogous results . For the church has no walls and battlements but her own active benevolence ; she is defended by no army with banners , but her sons and her daughters toiling to do good . But how is the church to exert her influence on the progress of the people ? how guide and mould it ? Not surely , as some mistake , by putting some reform in the place of Christianity ; but by taking the prin ciples of the Gospel and applying them to all the institutions and af*-fairs of men . It is interesting t notice how , in the middle ages , the church was in every thing . From the most important act of government to the minutest act of the family , in all , the church stood by and directed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the occasion of the most terrible and unavoidable tyranny . Yet this was only one of those shadows of great truths , of which we have already alluded to one , several of which lay in those dark times on the minds of all men ,  --  destined to he , we trust , shadows of good things to come . Christianity is designed to have this all-pervading influence , this universal connection with human affairs . " HOLINESS TO THE LORD shall be on the bells of the horses , and every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall he holiness to the Lord . " In breaking a way from the tyranny of that old connection between the church and all the affairs of life , men have gone to the other extreme , and refused to allow a connectioa between Christianity and all the affairs of life . They look on politics as one department of life , the himily as one , the school as one , business as one , religion as one , and in respect to some of these there is not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has nothing to do with them . Now it is the great work of God 's children in reference to popular progress , to terminate this fatal separation . It has been said that , except in this country , man never had the oportunity to try his whole strength . the same is true of Christianity . Never since primitive times , nor even then unopposed by civil government , has Christianity appeared , unfettered by a hierarchy , not depending on forms and organizations , but as a pure sentiment , a burning truth to be pressed on the bare hearts of men , and to act thus in its // rative simplicity on a great and * rowing nation . This then is our work ,  --  to carry round the principles of the Gospel in their full meaning , and apply them to all the institutions , the government , the business , the pleasures , and the intercourse of men , to make them the life and soul of every reformation , of every movement of man . To sympathize with the popular movement , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquence , and as many seem to imagine , that the first , second and third requisite , is action . Action there must be , intense , antiring ; but also steadfastness ; for it is action in using the same old doctrines which have always been in the word of God , and in which , except as we better understand and more faithfully apply them , there can be no progress . Some have said , that the days of the dry old doctrines have gone by , and one editor gravely pronounces it progress backward , for Sabbath school children to learn the Assembly 's Catechism . But we think to forsake the doctrines for action , would be much like a mower 's forsaking his scythe in order to mow ; for the doctrines of the cross are all that we have to work with . We sometimes hear the complaint that there is less doctrinal preaching than there was . If so , it is a ruinous error in p reachers . We are willing there should be less of metaphysical preachingthat which is properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dry , cold , unfeeling dissection of doctrine . But doctrine there must be-doctrine alive and on the wing , instead of motionless in the nestdoctrine blooming in the fields and filling the air with fragrance , instead of doctrine dry and pressed and labeled in the herbarium-doctrine abroad with speaking face and sinewy limb , instead of a dead skeleton in the dissecting room . It may be-we hope it is-that the complaint that there is less doctrinal preaching , is owing to the fact that the pulpit sympathizes , as it ought , with the times , and presents doctrine in the latter form rather than in the former . What but doctrine has ever been the instrument in elevating man ? What is the history of every great reform but the history of doctrine ? Some truth has fallen like fire from heaven into some man's mind . lie studies it ; he believes ; he utters it ; and presently what was the thought of that thinker in his closet , becomes the watchword of millions ; martyrs die for it ; churches , nations spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gospel , justification by faith , gave life to the Protestant Reformation . Whoever will cause a principle of the Gospel to be realized in any heart , in any community , does the most effective work which it is given man to do . This , then , is our business  --  to spend all our energies in catising the truths of Christianity to go down into men 's hearts , to control all the institutions , the movements , and the destiny of man . So shall every reform be a part of the upbuilding of God 's kingdom , and popular progress a fulfillment of the prophecy , " Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end . "
