txt THE spirit of infidelity is as malignant as ever , but it has lost the boldness and openness which formerly characterized its attacks upon revelation , flume , Voltaire , Volney , and Paine , never disguised the object of their hostility . It was the Bible , professedly , and by name , which they assailed , and they fearlessly avowed their purpose to rid the world of what they styled a superstitious reverence for its authority . The sneers of Gibbon were not intended to deceive , and his ironical sarcasms never passed , and were never designed to pass , even for the appearance of friendship . If it was most odious and malignant even with this redeeming trait of comparative fairness and frankness ra its mode of attack , in what strong terms are we justified in expressing our deepest indignation and abhorrence at its present method of warfare . None but the lowest class of vulgar infidels now assail the Bible openly . Its enemies have changed their tactics wholly . The Scriptures are to he treated with a bland respect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the ground of the most insidious attempts to undermine their authority . The Bible was not given to teach us moral truth ; it is not its province to meddle with natural science . ' This is the present cry , and then under this latter term is brought any theory which the assailant chooses to exempt from the jurisdiction of revelation , until the natural becomes everything ; the moral , the spiritual , and the religious , are either wholly overlooked , or crowded within whatever narrow limits the claims of physical science may seek to confine them . The Scriptural account of the Creation is first attacked , as something with which revelation has nothing to do ; so that if science , or whatever chooses to call itself by that name , sees fit to pronounce the world eternal , he who suggests that this subject has moral bearings , and is most intimately connected with certain elementary theological truths , or should refer to the Bible in proof that the " worlds were made by the word of God , " is immediately denounced as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one be so unscientific as to feel a moral dislike at speculations which utterly deny a particular providence , and , of consequence , a moral government , or that resolve all things into a vast system of machinery , of which the power , which this naturalist chooses to style God , forms but the dynamic element , he is told that with all this the Bible has nothing to do ; that such speculations are perfectly consistent with a rational scheme of interpretation , * Wiley &amp; Putnam : New York . // and then comes on again that most profound and convenient declaration-the Scriptures u'ere not given to teach us natural , but moral science . If complaint is made that theories denying the unity of of the race , the immediate creation of man by the special act of God , and the impartation to him of a principle of life direct from the Deity himself , do really conflict with high spiritual truths , or what the Bible declares to be suchtruths most intimately connected with the great doctrines of a fall and of the redemption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can he taken , still the same old stereotyped reply  --  the Bible was not given to teach us natural , but moral science-only varied occasionally by those equally profound and original petitiones principii , that all truths must be consistent with each other , and that revelation must contain nothing contrary to true 8cience and right reason . Those who would thus confine the Bible to its appropriate jurisdiction , are declared to be its truest friends . Its mistaken advocates are told to read the Sermon on the Mount , to " do justly , love mercy , and walk humbly with their God ; " they are reminded of the story of Galileo , and advised to be more modest in setting up the uncertain dogmas of theology against the decisions of the exact sciences . Now against all this there should he , and there can be , but one feeling of righteous , irrepressible indignation , on the part of all serious minded men , who , without the least intention or wish to derogate from the just claims of natural science , are firmly convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moral and religious truth , which gives to natural knowledge all its value ; and without which , geology , and cosmology , and even astronomy , are but a science of shadows , destitute ot any true interest for the rational soul , and of no more real comparative importance , than the speculations of the Ephemeron , who may be supposed to flame a science of the leaf on which he spends his brief existence of a day . Our language is not too strong when we bear in mind how , at the present day , every sciolist , every itinerant lecturer , adopts this mode of treating themes so sacred , because so important to the highest good and highest hopes of the race both here and hereafter . Especially must this feeling be awakened in all its strength , when it is understood , how utterly ignorant many of these men of science are of the first principles of that great domain of moral and religious truth , into which they propose to make such fearful incursions , and with what arrogance , ignorance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who can not digest all their unproved assumptions , or surrender the most precious truths , even the very science of sciences , at the demand of every smatterer whose knowledge , perhaps , does not extend beyond Lyell 's , or Lardner 's lectures , or Nichol 's Architecture of the Heavens . Almost every one must be familiar with cases which would furnish perfect illustrations of these remarks . An itinerant lecturer , for example , undertakes to prove that mankind are from separate and distinct origins . He goes on without seeming to know or care whether he is in conflict with the Scriptures or not ; and , in reply to a suggestion to that effect , makes the very original answer , that the Bible u'as not given to teach us natural science ; all this time , too , in his great simplicity , as ignorant as an infant , of any propositions of a moral or religious kind having any connection with the positions assailed . This man , however , would most strenuously disclaim the name of infidel . Not he : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he honors the Scriptures , and bows to them with the most reverent condescension , provided always they are keptwithin their own proper province , the teaching of moral truth . He does not assail the Ten Commandments , or the Sermon on the Mount , or the Book of Proverbs , or any of those purely moral precepts for which " our holy religion " is so distinguished above all heathen systems , and , why then should he be required to confine his speculations within the narrow dogmas of such as persecuted Galileo , and have ever shown themselves the enemies of the progress of science . It is time for us to take up the work which has occasioned these remarks . It stands in the front rank of the class we have described , holding this station , not by its superior science , but by its possessing , in a supereminent degree , all those traits of impudence , arrogance , and profound ignorance of Revelation , that characterize the whole genus . We mean to deal plainly with it , and without further introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special attention to its theological and philosophical bear- // 527 ings , without dwelling much on what claims to be purely scientific , and in which it has made no advance at all beyond several late popular works belonging to the same class . To style this book infidel , would be pronouncing upon it too mild a condemnation . No man could become thoroughly imbued with the spirit which dwells in every page , and retain any higher reverence for the Bible than he might feel for any other venerable monument of an ancient , unscientific age . But we go farther than this , and assert what may be sustained by the most conclusive proofs . The doctrine of the book is atheism ,  --  blank atheism , cold , cheerless , heartless , atheism . The author , it is true , does not deny the existence of n God in express terms . He seems to acknowledge such a power in every chapter , and sometimes even to glow with a sort of sentimental piety in the indulgence of those views of the Divine Greatness , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vulgar religionists ; but yet , we ngain repeat it , the doctrine of the book is atheism , and the author is an atheist . His God , if he insist upon the name , is the hearer of no prayer ; he is the administrator of no particular providence ; he has no love for right , and no burning indignation against wrong ; he has no positive or penal statutes aside from physical laws , no retributive justice , no moral government in any sense of these terms , as they have ever been sanctioned in the universal language of mankind . This deity never wrought a miracle , never created a world in time by any special act aside from necessarily eternal influences , never was the author of any new state of things , or ever brought to a special end any old dispensation ; he never originated a new and distinct species of animals ; he was not " the former of our bodies , or the father of our spirits ; " he has , in fact , no existence except as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very necessity of his being he is eternally identified . We ( lefy any admirer of the author to point out a single fundamental difference between his God and the *otctc , or nature of the ancient atheists , who were far more honest , and who also reasoned more consecutively , although without any of that great parade of science for which their modern imitator seeks to he distinguished . We can not , after the most careful examination , discover wherein his system differs from that of Democritus , Epicurus , and Lucretius ; we mean , in its fundamental principles . The scientific details of course vary , although even here , it may well be doubted whether there is not as much real science in the atoms of the old atheist as in the nebular star-dust of the modern . There is in both schemesthe same utter denial of any thing like a particular Providence , the same exclusion of all rational grounds on which could be placed the propriety of prayer , the belief in any moral government , in any law except the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and punishment of sin , except under the misnomer of physical evil and physical consequences . The eternally moving atoms of the one , dispersed through all space , condensing and combining into worlds and systems , strongly call to mind the nebular star-dust of the other . We have been accustomed , when speaking of these old systems , to talk of the fortuitous concurrence of atoms , but the fact is , that Lucretius holds as strongly , and as consistently as the author of this book , to an eternal law , nature , or principle of adaptation , which , after a sufficient time  --  and eternity is a most convenient season for all such speculations-brought all things into their present state , and will carry them on to higher and still higher developments . The ancient Epicurean sets out with his two primordia , something and nothing , or matter and inanityOmnis , ut est , igitur , per Se , natura duabus Constitit in rebus , narn corpora sunt et inanePrieterea nihil est . Our modern philosopher , it is true , etherealizes matter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other end of Eternity , only an inconceivable shade above inanity , but he equally with his ancient masters ascribes to its inherent properties , and to its eternal cooling and condensation , all the phenomena of organic , vegetable , animal , and finally , rational life . Democritus and Leucippus did not trouble themselves about any deity ; they clearly enough saw that in theirsystem of eternal progression from the lower to the higher , ifa God , or some superhuman being , ever existed at all , it must be as the last work in the ascending scale of *iot* , They had acuteness and // philosophy enough to discover that a system of consistent theism must be directly the reverse of this , and commence with the idea of the perfect , from which all imperfection must be regarded as a departure in the scale of being . Epicurus and Lucretius , on the other band , bowed , like our author , to the religion of the day , and by a slight concession recognized the existence of gods , whilst at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebus nostris longeque sejuncti , entirely released from the onerous administration of a world perfectly capable of taking care of itself-by the aid alone of its own laws and developments . Now we would ask , on a review both of the ancient and the modern system , what is such a belief in such a Deity worth ? Wherein , as to all moral and religious purposes , does it differ from atheism ? Is not , in fact , such a deceptive scientific theism by far the worst and most pernicious of th' two ? Blank and awowed atheism may leave behind it a painful void which the soul can not well endure . The very horror at the thought of the last plunge may frighten it back to firmer ground and a more tenacious grasp of the great truth which it fears to quit forever . Even some who have the deepestmoral interest in banishing the belief in a God , can not bear the desolation of the thought , and unconsciously endeavor to recall the idea in their unmeaning personifications of Fortune , Fate , or Destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it styles God whilst it denies him any moral attributes , puts the soul at rest , and at the same time takes away all the interest and all the fears to be derived from any moral sanctions . In these respects the characteristics of the work before us may be best tested by a direct appeal to the moral and religious sense of its readers . No man , we believe , can read it and feel for a moment that the writer has the least faith in prayer and Providence , the only grounds on which any religious belief worthy of the name can ever repose . We say worthy of the name , because we are aware that there is a species of Spinozism which is in perfect harmony with the theology of this book , and which in its " awe of the infinite , " and its " adoration of the Eternal " affects a piety far above the commonplace religion of the vulgar . We can not give a better view of the work in question than by stating , first the common belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the farthest removed from all fanatical extravagance , and then contrasting it with the theory against which we are contending . The very lowest elements of a religious Christian creed must he regarded as embracing these positions , namely : that the Deity originally created from nothing , or rather called from a state of previous non-existence , the matter of which our earth and all the worlds is composed ,  --  that this although it may have been at a period most remote , was yet when certain bounds of time , capable , if revealed to us , of being computed and assigned by the power of numbers-that at some subsequentperiod , and that not many thousand years ago , there was a fashioning , a construction , or if some choose thus to call it , a reconstruction or refitting up of our own globe and the other members of the solar system , which construction is generally regarded as being that described by Moses in the first chapter of Genesis . With the length of its previous existence this belief does not meddle , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformations , but leaves to geology as wide an extent as it may choose , within which to amuse itself by blowing up and exploding as many theoretical bubbles as it pleases . In respect also to the time supposed to be occupied in this construction or reconstruction , it allows a liberal and charitable latitude of interpretation , permitting those , who are thus inclined , to believe that it was the work of longer periods than the present natural day of twenty-four hours , provided that such interpretation is fairly made on pure philological grounds , unwarped by any belief in any inherent necessities aside from the moral designs of God which may have required such long periods , or by any deference to the arrogant assumptions of the geologist , any farther than as they may clearly coincide with such unforced interpretation . The next article in this common belief of all who would claim to be regarded as having any religious creed at all , would be that God , who created all things , subsequently exercises a moral and physical government ( the latter , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the main , by general and uniform modes of proceeding , commonly styled laws ; // which laws , however , are as much the direct creation of the Deity as the world itself , and made , not for his aid and in order to relieve himself hy machinery from so burdensome a charge , hut for the sake of his rational creatures , that in the study of nature , or , in other words , the Divine operations , they might have certain indicia or signs hy which to regulate their present conduct , and to some extent , and as far as for their good , to vaticinate the future ; thus making nature the ordinary language through which God speaks to man , and true natural science synonymous with faith in the regularity and uniformity of the Divine proceedings in the physical world , it also maintains that these laws instead of being immutable may at any time be suspended by the same power that made , or rather appointed them , and that on occasions worthy of such a procedure they have been thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It likewise holds , fhatin perfect consistency with these methods of a general providence , there is also a special or particular providence , conducted by a supernatural power which ever sits behind this law of nature to direct them to this or that special result , which , without such invisible interventions they would not have effected ; thus giving rise to what are called special interpositions , yet in a sense short of the miracle or open suspension , and furnishing the ground for the belief in the rationality of special prayer for special blessings . Now without specifying any other truths of revelation , we venture to affirm that no one can believe the Scriptures in any , even the lowest sense , and on the lowest scheme of interpretation , without admitting that , to this extent at least , these doctrines of creation , providence and prayer , are found therein , and that without these elements no scheme of moral government , in any consistent sense of the word moral , could be maintained . The book we are examining , is at war with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to he regarded as a theist , and we will therefore , in the first place , endeavor to state with all fairness the extent of his right to such an appellation . He acknowledges , then , it is admitted , a power , or principle which he styles , sometimes , The First Cause , sometimes , The Eternal , and sometimes , A God . The most rigorous analysis , however , of his idea must fail to discover anything more than a vital power , which , an eternity ago , developed itself into a law ; this law being the expression of all the phenomena which have ever taken place , which are yet taking place , and in all time to come will lake place in the visible universe . The writer , when inclined to ascribe a little more personality to this First Cause , or principle , sometimes speaks of this single development which requires an eternity within which to unfold itself , as the expression of the Divine will ; but this is clearly a misnomer , since , in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonging to the very necessities of things ; the first origination being in fact as necessary ( hy which we mean , and he means , physically necessary , ) as any subsequent phenomena . Indeed , so strongly does he set forth his views on these points , that his occasional theistical language can no more countervail them than the mere fact that he has commenced the names to which we allude in capital letters . If we should grant that he allows matter , at some immensely remote period , to have proceeded from a state of non-existence at the command of Cod , still the position is at war with all his subsequent reasoning , which is grounded upon its possessing necessary , inherent properties of motion , attraction , &amp;c. ; and which reasoning , therefore , if consistently carried out , would make matter itself a necessary substance , and consequently eternal . From this point , however , there is no room for mistaking the writer 's meaning . Subsequently to the origination of matter , at a period as nearly coeval with eternity as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avowal of atheism , and which a consistent regard to his own principles would have made absolutely eternal-from this period , we say , according to this theory , God has had noth4mg more to do with the universe than the extra-mundane deities of Epicurus and Lucretius : he has created no new worlds , he has originated no new forms of life , he has never stepped from his hiding place to suspend any law of nature . All has been carried on by a machinery which has entirely superseded and will for ever supersede any intervention of his own ; for this apparatus , he it remembered , is a necessary part of the nature of things ,  --  necessary , not for our convenience and knowledge , but for the Deity himself . We would remark here , that this feeling which prompts some // writers to carry all the Divine agency so far back into the most remote ages of Eternity , is easily understood by any one who has studied human nature in the light of the Bible . To suppose that any supernatural event has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is bringing the Deity quite too near . To some minds there is something terrible in the very thought that God 's presence has actually been manifested within fifty or sixty centuries of our own day . But why , then , does this irrational and most anthropomorphic prejudice hesitate on this side of an absolute eternity ? To whatever period short of that they may assign the commencement of things , the universe must at some one time have been just five thousand years old , and every objection of this kind that applies to any one date , applies with equal force to every other . Before proceeding to examine the absurdities and inconsistencies of this scheme , we appeal again to the moral sense . In what possible way could such a theism , if it must have the name , operate in checking a wicked action , or in changing a depraved disposition ? If it be said that we have in this scheme the " awe of the Inflnite , ' * and the adoration of the Eternal , when , we would ask , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt in turning the sinner from the error of his ways ? Has not atheism , too , its awe and its dreadful , desolating gloom ? May there not be minds so fond of dark imagini1*gs , that , like Shelley , they might find a fearful and gloomy sublimity in the thought of a universe without God ? producing a feeling which such souls might easily mistake for a moral emotion as pure as any that was ever felt by the most mystic transcendentalist ? We ask again , what is there in this creed , as we have fairly stated it-and for its correctness we appeal to all the readers of the book  --  to which Abner Kneeland would not have assented , provided he had been allowed to give his own name to this primordial development thus continued in unchanging physical laws , and to have *alled it nature , gravitation , galvanism , or anything else which might be found most in accordance with his own poor smattering of science and philosophy ? The author occasionally indulges in admiration of the divine Intelligence , as manifested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workings of this eter nal nature . But here again , what great advantage has he over the avowed atheist . The latter certainly must admit , and does admit , that there is reason , intelligence , science , call it what you will , in the heaveiis . Scientific atheists certainly know that the exact or even proximate determination of the celestial motions , requires the highest powers of their highest calculus . They well know that there is intelligence there , but they can as readily and consistently believe it a result or property of matter , as that their own intelligence is the mere effect of the position of the particles of the brain ; for materialism in respect to man , is identical with atheism in regard to the universe . They well know , too , that there is the highest degree of mathematical science in the cell of the bee , but in neither case do they feel themselves compelled to acknowledge anything more than what arises from the adaptations of a nature , which , during an eternity , has been wending its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever approaching that truth of things which exists , as they would maintain in itself , and has no relation to a personal eternal Mind . Things , said the ancient atheists , must have been older than knowledge of things , and therefore matter and its laws must have been older than mind . If the foundation laid by our author be sound , they reasoned correctly . Their eternal plastic *1iatc , with its infinite , yet unconscious and impersonal skill in working , was only another name for the Deity of this book . In fact , the mind never forms the right notion of a personal God , while it rests in the inferior attributes of power and intelligence . It is only when to these , as subordinates , are superadded those moral attributes which are associated with thoughts of moral law and moral government , that we rise to the true idea . All below this , is of no moral value , and produces no moral interest , whether it take the form of a scientific theism , a vulgar atheism , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike , and there is no reason why the more odious name should be applied to one more than to the other . We would remark here , in passing , that there are two words , which , in their varied use , may be said to constitute the very soul of this work ; if such a production can , with any propriety of language , be said to have a soul . They are the terms law and development . Remove them from the book , and its philosophy , its profund // ity , and its science are all gone . The author . however , takes good care to define neither . The very awkward phrase law-creation , is frequently employed , to denote the opposite of that common view which acknowledges the direct act of God ; but all that we can ascertain in reference to its meaning is this-Law is the order in which events take place , and whatever that order may be , that is law . Again , whatever is , is , and whatever is , is necessary , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law is the expression of this eternal development . After great show of statement and argument , as is often the case with those unskillful mathematicians who are ignorant how many identical propositions are contained in their hypothesis , the algebraic process returns to the original formula , or finally comes out , x = x . The whole scheme may he represented something after the following manner Law and development , which are the substitutes for providence and creation , may be compared to an immense machine , which was originally constructed by , or rather developed out of the First Cause . This machine contains in itself all subsequent developments . Nothing is external to it ; nothing has happened , nothing is happening , and nothing can happen , which is not now provided for in it , and which has not made a part of its complicated structure from the beginning . It has great wheels for great events , and small wheels for small events . The bursting of a planet , the eruption of a volcano , the rustle of a leaf , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floats in the air , have each had , from all eternity , some part assigned for their future production . Some little spring or cog , which for ages has revolved in some great wheel , invisible and without effect , has been so adjusted as to strike in its appointed place and time , thus producing a new development , having the appearance , indeed , of a new creation , and yet , in fact , from all eternity contained in the infinitely numerous wheels of this most complex apparatus of law and development . It may be seen from this , that the author is prepared for anything . However puzzling , when viewed in connection with its immediate antecedents and consequents , any event may he , there is no need of bringing in the idea of any creating power , or of any special Divine intervention . All that is required , is to suppose some secret wheel or spring be-531 longing to the machine , and so adjusted , in its original construction , as to act at the proper time and place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this idea , " says the author in a note , page 154 , " was not aware of one which seems faintly to foreshadow it - namely , Socrates ' doctrine , afterwards dilated on by Plato , that previous to the existence of the world there existed certain archetypes , the embodiment ( if we may use such a word , ) of general ideas , and that these archetypes were models in imitation of which all particular things were created . " It must have been exceedingly painful and mortifying to the writer to find that his brilliant scheme had been anticipated so many ages before , but he may certainly set his mind at ease on that point . The glory is all his own . Socrates , were he now upon the earth , would never attempt to deprive him of the credit of this discovery , nor ever dream that there was the least resemblance between his own glorious doctrine of eternal truths which have no relation to matter , time or space , and the dynamical machine of the work before us . Nothing but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have led any one to think , for a moment , that there was the slightest coincidence between the two systems . With far more propriety may it be compared to the apparatus of the Plolemaic astronomers . In its most profouiid and original method of explaining every event by supposing it to have happened in obedience to some hidden law or development , it is strikingly similar to the course pursued by these most rigid and consistent Baconians , who , although they lived before Bacon 's time , furnished far better illustrations of some of his favorite positions , than the world has ever witnessed since . When these most strict experimentalists and accurate observers of Nature discovered a new celestial motion , they immediately , in perfect consistency with their philosophy , and with the most scientific induction from observed facts , applied a new cycle , or epicycle , and the harmony of the system remained unimpaired-it could account for anything . In a sin*ilar manner , this machine of our author 's is evidently capable of most immense expansion to suit any purpose , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being reconciled with any system of religion , even with the most rigid orthodoxy , if there should he any special occasion for such a proceeding . // It is true , he most expressly denies the Mosaic account of the Creation , and thinks it altogether out of place " to adduce it in support , or in objection to any natural hypothesis . " It is true , that he has gone a step or two beyond any other naturalist , at least of modern times , in asserting that man himself has been developed out of some inferior species of animal , and remotely from the lowest forms of matter , instead of having been created by a special act of God ; yet still the machine affords a prompt mode of reconciling and explaining all this . Homines , simm , mammalia , icthyosauri , polypi and fungi , were all contained in this original development of the primal vital power and the primal Intelligence , and are therefore as much the work of the First Cause on this hypothesis , as on that of Moses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for special prayer . Even the latter may be regarded as adjusted by a predstablished harmony to a connection with the event which is the object of the petition . Miracles likewise , may thus have place in the scheme ; only they are no longer miracles , hut hidden developments of higher laws ; and all our old theology , although in rather a questionable shape , comes back again . But then , wherein will the system differ from the vulgar belief ? where will he its profundity , its philosophy , its science ? All gone , notwithstanding the labor and ingenuity bestowed on the apparatus . After all the eliminations and equations the algebraic process , instead of discovering the unknown quantity , comes out again , x=x . A few years ago the whole scientific world was astonished by the announcement , that a new species of animal life had been produced by the action of a voltaic battery . Our author takes sides with the experimenter , and undertakes to explain the phenomenon , although almost all scientific.men have regarded the processes in that case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means sustaining the hypotheses they were brought to support . This mode of reasoning furnishes one of the best illustrations that can be brought , of the remarks we have just made . The production of a new species of life has ever been regarded as so peculiar a prerogative of the Divine power , and all arguments for the existence of a Deity are so utterly destroyed by supposing it to be , in any way , an inherent property of matter , that the writer had some reason to fear the charge of impiety , even for defending the hypothesis , and he therefore labors with great earnestness to protect himself , and his friend , Mr Cross , the insect maker , against it . " The supposition of impiety , " says he , " arises from an entire misconception of what is implied by the aboriginal creation of insects . The experimentalist could never be considered as the author of the existence of these creatures , except by the most unreasoning ignorance . " We would simply remark on this , that no one ever condemned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real or seeming author of the animals-that was a matter of perfect indilference . The startling impiety was the assumption that life could be an inherent property of matter in itself- and under any circumstances . But we proceed with the quotation . " The utmost , " says our author , " that can be claimed for Mr. Cross , is , that he arranged the natural conditions under which the true creative energy was pleased to work in that instance . On the hypothesis here brought forward , the acarus Crossii was a type of being arranged from the beginning , and destined to be realized under certain physical conditions . The production of the insect , therefore , was as clearly an act of the Almighty himself , as if he had fashioned it with hands . " There is a little of the Jews ' language here mixed up with the dialect of Ashdod , but translate it into the proper phraseology of the system , and it would mean , that in this eternal development of law which he sometimes is inclined to deify , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided for as the solar system . In the great machine of the universe , some secret spring , representing Mr. Cross and his voltaic battery , had been contained from all eternity , until the working of the other parts brought them in such a position as " to produce the natural conditions under which the true creative energy was pleased to work in that instance . " ( See page 143 . ) There would be but little in this worth noticing , were it not for the more important consideration , that according to this theory , man also was , in a similar way , a type of being developed by the fortunate combination of those " conditions under which the vital power could act , " mtnd the sublime account which Moses gives us of the origin of our race , is to be set aside as a mythical legend , only adapted to the // infancy of the human intellect , before it was capable of understanding this most profound scheme of law and developments . Another favorite term of which this writer makes great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , is anthropomorphism . He can not bear the thought of anything derogatory to the Divine honor , and has no patience with those narrow souls that can believe that God is personally engaged in the minute operatioiis of nature . " To a reasonable mind , " he says , " the Divine attributes must appear not diminished by supposing a creation by law , It is the narrowest of all views of the Deity , and characteristic of a humble class of intellects to suppose him acting in particular ways for particular occasions . It lowers him to the level of our own minds . Much more worthy of him , surely , is it , to suppose that all things have been commissioned by him from the first ; though neither is he absent from the current of affairs , seeing the whole system is continually supported by his providence . " We are strongly tempted to examine the force of these last words , which we have italicised in the above extract , and ascertain what they can possibly mean in such a system , hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the main and more prominent positions of the scheme . A similar specimen of the writer 's abhorrence of anthropomorphism , may be found on page 116 . " It may now , " says he , " be inquired-Jn what way was the creation of animated beings effected ? The ordinary notion may , I think , be not unjustly described as this : - that the Almighty Author produced the progenitors of all existing species by some sort of personal or immediate exertion . But how can we suppose an immediate exertion of this creative power at one time to produce zoophytes , another time to add a few marine mollusks , another to bring in one or two conchifers , again to produce crustaceans fishes , again perfect fishes , and so on to the end . This would surely be to take a very mean view of the Creative power-to , in short , anthrapamorphize it , or reduce it to some such character as that borne by the ordinary proceedings of mankind . " Again , he says : " How can we suppose that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simple establishment of a natural principle , was to interfere , personally , on every occasion , when a new fish or reptile was to be ushered into existence on one of these worlds . Surely , this idea is too ridiculous to be entertained for a moment . " Again , in a subsequent passage , but on the same subject , he says : " Keeping this in view , the words , ' Godformed man in his own image , ' can not well be understood as implying any more than what was implied before , namely , that man was produced in consequence of an expression of the Divine Will to that effect . Thus the Scriptural objection quickly vanishes , and the prevalent ideas about the organic creation appear only a mistaken inference from the text , formed at a time when man 's ignorance prevented him from drawing therefrom a just conclusion . " The author , however , can not stand h*is own exegesis . He is evidently ashamed of the miserable distortion he has been compelled to put upon the Scripture record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time Ifreely own , " - it seems he is conscious that he had been doing something which can only he purged by a confession- " at the same time I freely own that I do not think it right to adduce the Mosaic record , either in objection to , or in support of any natural hypothesis . - Again-for we wish to bring in here all the most important quotations which have reference to this head-we are told , page 122 , that " the commencements of species would have been an inconceivably paltry exercise for an immediately creative power . " Now , in respect to all this , we charge upon the author himself , the grossest anthropomorphism . His arguments , if they deserve the name at all , are not addressed to the reason , but to the imagination , or the feelings . They are directly liable to the very charge he makes against that humble class of intellects who believe that the Deity is daily providing for their least wants , and displeased with their least sins . He contends that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the more minute operations of the universe , or even in those more important agencies that are concerned in the origination of new species of life . Now here , we repeat it , is the grossest anthropomorphism , to use the writer 's own phrase , although anthropopathy would have been more correct . it is emphatically judging the Almighty by our own low standards . " Ye thought that I was altogether such a one as yourselves . " Human care and human provi // deuce towards particular objects , are necessarily diminished in proportion to the enlargement of the field on which they are to be exercised . The one must always he in an inverse ratio to the other . This results from that most distinguishing difference which exists between the Divine and the human , the Infinite and the finite . Thought , knowlege , and ideas , are present to our minds by succession . With him " who filleth all things " it is directly the reverse . His care for any one object , and his personal agency in the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his attention at the same moment to millions of similar objects , and similar agencies . It is therefore one of the most rigid conclusions of reason , flowing directly and irresistibly from the c* priori idea of infinite perfection , that the most special Divine care of any , even the smallest , part of his works , is not in the least at ' - fected , diminished , or rendered incredible hy the extent of the whole . In other words , if a certain exercise of a minute and particular providence , or moral legislation , toward our world would he perfectly credible , on the supposition that that one world was the whole of God 's dominions ; or to present the case in a still stronger light ,  --  if a very high degree of the special care of the Deity towards one individual man , and of intense interest in his moral state and conduct , would he perfectly credible , on the supposition that that individual was alone with his Maker , the only subject of his natural and moral kingdom -- then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particle diminished , and that care , and that special providence , and that moral superintendence would be none the less , when millions of other beings , and millions of other worlds and systems , with all their inhabitants , ale discovered to be under the same government . What would be worthy of belief in the one case remains eqally worthy of belief in the other , and is not in an infinitesimal degree varied by the new and more enlarged aspect of the Divine Providence . This is as rigid and as irresistible a conclusion of right reason as any to be found in the mathematical sciences , and as long as reason alone is consulted the mind is steady , and no difficulty is felt . Far different , however , is it when the matter is transferred from the reason to the imagination . It is then truly that we anthropomorphize . We turn our telescopes to the heavens and our microscopes to the earth . And as , in either extreme , worlds of life crowd into our dilated angle of vision , this weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and faints and staggers under the boundless prospect . In fts feebleness , however , it assumes the airs of philosophy , arrays itself in the robes of its strong brother , Reason , and wonders at the narrow views of ' those who can believe that the Deity is personally engaged in such " paltry exercises " as the direct origination of the lower forms of animal life . Now , notwithstanding all his parade of reason and science , it is to this weak and lower faculty of the soul that the author actually , although perhaps unconsciously , addresses himself . " How can we suppose , " says this man of enlarged and elevated views , " an immediate exertion of this creative power to pro duce zoophytes , &amp;c . ? " In another place , he has a like difficulty in respect to the hydatid ( which , for the sake of our unscientific readers , may be explained as meaning the small animated vesicle that produces the measles in swine ) , and he asks with all earnestness , and as though the inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whence came this hydatid ? He is in the same distress about the tinen and the pymelodes Cyclopum . To regard the original production of any of these inf*rior beings as proceeding from any immediate act , would be " taking a very mean view of creative power . " But why ? Let us examine the author 's own hypothesis , and see if he is consistent even with himself These zoophytes and hydatids and tinen must each have had something representing them in this vast and complicated system of media , some little cog or spring in some little wheel concealed for ages in some greater wheel ,  --  some hidden apparatus , which , although actually existing , remains outwardly inert , until the time comes and the conditions are brought about for the production of these new species of life . All this time , we say , the zoophytes and hydatid must have been in the machine as much as the earth or the sun . If this is simply the result of the inherent , necessary , and eternal laws of matter , without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be consistent . But if there is this higher // or Divine agency , then it follows that provision must have been made by it for these cases in the orginating act or development . Besides all this , there is required an additional agency in preserving these hidden and inoperative parts until the conditions are fulfilled for their outward action ; for the author says that " the Divine power is never absent from a particle of the current of affairs , but that the whole system is continually supported by his providence ; " and we must be so charitahle as to suppose that he means something by this , however much we may be puzzled to understand what possible place this presence , or this providence , can have in his theory of eternal developments . Now , where is the economy of means produced by this labor-saving machine ? If God did not directly make the hydatid he made the media which were to produce that result , and that , too , in such a way , that for every effect , and every part of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause . Away back , then , at the very commencement of eternity , there must have been made , in the originating development , the same provision for the zoophyte and tinea , as though the Deity , according to " the conception of those humble intellects " worked in particular ways for particular occasions . Surely it is no more " a paltry exercise of creative power " to make hydatids directly than to create archetypes of hydatids ; to make use of the term employed by our author in his absurd misconception of the philosophy of Plato . Surely those who thus reason must imagine the Deity " altogether such an one as themselves . " This whole doctrine of machinery comes from the grossest anthropomorphism . We mean , when it is regarded as a necessary medium and essential in itse*f to the Divine operations . We all admit  --  the most humble Sabbath scholar knows as well as our author , that God does use general methods styled laws or media ; hut , as we have stated before , the view which regards them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational beings , as indicia of the Divine operations , for the regulation of human conduct , for the purpose of furnishing to us the grounds of practical science , and as having a moral end in view even when suspended-in short , as something wholly subordinate to a moral system , and which the Deity has at timeslaid aside and VOL. 1. - NO. v. can lay aside whenever he pleases ,  --  this view , we say , presents a very different doctrine from the one with which we are contending . The hypothesis of our author regards them as necessary to God himself and as required for the preservation of his dignity . Now this we charge as being the very lowest form of anthropomorphism . We ourselves , it is true , perform many operations much more easily by machinery than by direct personal exertion : but in such cases nothing can be more evident than that we employ means external to ourselves and prepared to our hands . When we make use of wind , or water , or steam , or gravitation , or mechanical power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divine agencies , and thus , to us , Nature becomes a labor-saving machine ; but how low that view , and " how unreasoning that mind " which is led to conclude that such a process of external media is necessary for the Divine ease or essential to the Divine dignity . Most truly and forcibly does the declaration of Scripture continually come to mind in the contemplation of all such speculations- " Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself . " In respect to the Deity , too , machinery can not , as with us , be external to himself . Whether a material or an immaterial agency it must be created , or rather , on this system , developed out of his own nature . It must be , likewise , a machinery containing the most minute provisions for every event which is to form a part of the great series of developments , and for every part of that event , and for all its collaterals , and for all things leading to it , and for all their aol-. laterals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed just at the very time when it was required to be brought into being . If , instead of employing the natural media furnished to our hand , we had to create and keep in existence the force of water , air , and steam , it would soon be found that the direct exertion of our own muscular strength would be the simplest , easiest , and most labor-saving process we could employ . We can not help adverting , in this connection , to a very singular statement which the author makes , page 150 . " After what we have seen , " he says , " the idea of a separate exertion for each ( form of life ) must appear totally inadmissible . The single fact of abortive or rudimentary organs condemns it ; for these , on such a // supposition , could be regarded in no other light than as blemishes or blunders-the thing , of all others , most irreconcilable with the idea of Almighty perfection . On the other band , when the organic creation is admitted to have been effected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortive parts , but harmless peculiarities of development , and interesting evidences of the manner in which the divine author has been pleased to work . " Now can any thing be more absurd than this ? What must we think of the commendations which have every where been bestowed upon the logic of one who reasons in this manner ? Can anything be more intuitively certain than that every physical effect , and every part of every physical effect , must find an exact correspondent in its immediate cause , and that cause , in like manner , in its own antecedent , and so on , as long as the chain of agency continues ? Without , therefore , stopping to discuss the question whether there are any physical blemishes in the universe , or any apparent physical disorders which God did not design for some higher moral end , and which are , therefore , not disorders , we ask whether a blemish in the effect does not necessarily imply a blemish somewhere in the cause , until we ascend to the first originating development ; and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any difference , in this case , whether the agency be mediate or immediate , since it must certainly be immediate in some stage of the process ? Has the architect of a machine any right to excuse himself by attributing a blemish or bungle in its work to an imperfect wheel , or to a defective spring , or a misplaced cog ? Can we justify the printer , by imputing the blame of a mistake to a wrong position of the types , or a defect in the press ? How much more justly , then , if there are physical blemishes in the creation-by which we mean real mistakes , and not apparent evils , actually designed in reference to moral ends-must they be charged upon the power which not simply employs , but has actually created , or , if you please , developed all the materials , energies and qualities of the very machinery through which the blemish is produced . But we would dwell no longer on this . All that we style the laws of nature must either be necessary and inherent properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet apart from a Deity who employs them , and can give them a sub*tantive existence separate from himselfor they must be invisible spiritual agencies-or they are only convenient names for the direct yet regular action of Divine power in every case . The first is unqualified atheism . The second is incomprehensible . The two last are both properly consistent with a moral government , and with the declarations of the Scripture . But the doctrine of machinery , as machinery , necessary for the Divine operations in themselves , and essential to the Divine dignity , is the sheerest anthropomorphism , into which a pretended philosophy , in its insane attempt to avoid the recognition of a personal God , has ever fallen . Let us lay the Scriptures entirely out of the question , and confine ourselves to the most rigid induction from present and known phenomena . Let this induction be carried on according to the strictest Baconian rules . We believe that on such a process , almost all sober scientific men , who are really such , would arrive at one and the same conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and account for all the phenomena , would be this-namely , that our earth had been the theatre of two distinct kinds of causes , and of two distinct agencies . The one would be a series of regular , gradual , long continued influences , between which an apparent mutual dependence and interdependence could be traced , like links in a chain . The other would present features , no less manifest , of sudden , violent , disconnected , and apparently irregular agencies , breaking up abruptly the continuity of the former , ending old epochs that had been marked by long periods of these slow , uniform progressions , and introducing other dispensations and other forms of life destined to fall again under that sameconnected chain of gradual workings , which , from the regularity of sequence , we call law , cause and effect . Now , if we style the first class of agencies natural , which is a very good name , the most appropriate title for the other would be supernatural-indicating a power above nature , breaking up , or changing , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old and the introduction of new dispensations ; one of which higher purposes may be to prevent rational beings from falling into an atheistical habit of thinking , and to startle them hack again into the almost vanished belief that there is a God behind the screen of nature . Now if any man will be so perverse as to call this class of phenomena by the // same name with the first , and to consider them all alike as the results of hidden laws ; if he will envelope everything in that unmeaning word development ; if he will use the terms First Cause , originating vital power , &amp;c. , for God , and employ the word law for all the Divine ol ) erations of every kind , be they ordinary or extraordinary ; if he will thus confound all language , the office of which is to distinguish things that differ ; if he will by such a course utterly annihilate true science , notwithstanding the exclusive claims he advances to its possession - all that we can say is , that such a one should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected to be an utter aversion to the recognition of a personal God , nor think himself unjustly treated when his system is declared to be atheism , sheer atheism , dark , chilly , soulless atheism . While on this part of the work , we can not help devoting a short space to another egregious fallacy for which the author brings the support of Mr. Babbage in one of the Bridgewater Treatises -- -a series of works , by the way , which we verily believe have made more infidels than they have ever cured . If we understand him aright , he would illustrate his doctrine of developments by the following supposition . An arithmetical machine is imagined , so constructed , that a wheel revolving round an axis presents successively to the eye a series of numbers engraved on its divided circumference . " Let the figures thus seen , " says Mr. Babbage , " be the series , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , &amp;c . " How long , ( he asks , ) would the operation be witnessed before the observer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by virtue of which each succeeding number exceeds the one preceding by unity ? This process is supposed to go on until we reach 100,000,000 . " True to this vast induction , " says the contriver of this machine , " the next number will be 100,000,001 ; but the next presented by the rim of the wheel , instead of being 100,000,002 , is 100,010,002 , at which point the law seems to change , and every succeeding number exceeds its predecessor by ten thousand . " " The principle which seems at firstto govern , " says the author , " fails at the one hundred million and second term , and a new order takes its place . " " If now , " he proceeds , " we continue to observe the numbers presented , we shall find that for a hundred or even a thousand terms , they continue to follow the new law ; but after watching them for 2761 terms , we find that it fails in the case of the two thousand seven hundred sixty-second . Then comes a new law continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c . " ( See page 157 , 158 . ) On first reading this , we were for some time puzzled to know what application could possibly be made of it . Any one can see , at a glance , that as far as the construction of the machine is concerned , the whole process is entirely arbitrary . After presenting numbers increasing by unity up to 100,000,001 , the next presented is suddenly 100,010,002 , simply because it was placed next on the rim of the machine . As far as the idea of law is concerned , ( we mean the law of the machine irrespective of any laws of numbers , which are in all cases necessary laws , ) it might as well have been kept in the hands of the maker , and dropped into its proper place at the very time it was wanted , and so of all the other changes , or developments , as the author would style them . We discover nothing here like law , which always implies some relations of antecedent and consequents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect must be seen in the cause to make the links continuous . But it can not be pretended that any of these sudden changes are in any way to be regarded as regular functions of any of the preceding terms , or combinations of terms . We are asked to take this as a good illustration of this theory of developments , or what are styled sudden transitions to higher states of being . For example , a certain species of vegetation , after having for one hundred million and one times produced its like , is by virtue of a hidden law contained in its organization , but all this time concealed and inert , suddenly developed mt0 a new species in the flrsL stage of animal life ;  - -  -  " a process by which , " says our author , " the whole train of animated beings , from the simplest and oldest up to the highest and most recent , are to be regarded as a series of advances of this principle of development . " In this way the plant becomes an animal , the reptile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , and terrestrial animals rise in the ascending scale , until the development reaches the Simia tribe . From this the machine goes on , age after age , apes begetting apes , each one in his own likeness and after his own kind , until at 1845. 537 // last some one revolution of the wheel brings everything into that state in which the " conditions are fulfilled ; "  --  the hidden spring is touched ; the monkey loses his tail , and man comes out No. 2762 . Oh , shade of Moses ! We can not help apostrophising thy meek spirit , thou ancient man of God ! Is it for this that we are calledupon , in the nineteenth century , to reject that sublime account , the superhuman grandeur and simplicity of which furnish evidence that thou couldst have derived it only from the voice of inspiration ?  --  and God created man in his own image ; in the image of God created he him ; male and female created he them ; and God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ask again , what is gained by all this ? The vegetable , reptile , fish , monkey , and man , must have been all in the primal development , and they must have each required a special provision corresponding to every variety and change of their being . The numbers must all have been placed on the circumference of the revolving wheel so as to come out in the actual order . Each subsequent form of life must have been particularly represented in each prior development ; and then again , what is saved on the score of economy of means ? Why not the man directly without the monkey ? The only answer is , that there is a spurious philosophy , whose chief element is a most hearty and yet , it may be , unconscious dislike of the idea of a personal Deity . If it can not bear the name of atheism , ii . at least wishes a God afar off ; - anything but an everpresent , ever-energizing , ever-watchful moral governor . What makes all this most odious to those acquainted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is one of the oldest of errors dressed up in the guise of modern science . The ancient atheists were full of it as far as its elementary principles are concerned , although differing in immaterial details . It forms the very substance of the philosophy of Epicurus , and the Latin atheist Lucretius abounds with it ad nauseam . Man oar author regards as but the initial of a grand crowning type . The present race is only performing the office of the simia or monkey tribe in the development of some nobler species . We must expect that there will be higher varieties of the being homo , as well as of the hydatid and tinea . This is what the writer calls a startling idea ,  --  a phrase which is a great favorite with this whole class of thaumaturgic , or wonder-making sciolists . The reader might indeed be startled by this , and regard it as springing from a desire to make atonement , by the hopes of future greatness , for the disparagement cast upon our origin . It looks something like the doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim of the Scriptures to teach spmething on this head , without violating the higher prerogatives of natural science . But no-he means no such thing . Be quiet , individual reader ! You are altogether too small and too insignificant to indulge in any such lofty aspirations . Let us read farther . " It is clear , " says our author , pnge 181- " it is clear , moreover , from the whole scope of the natural laws , that the individual , as far as the present sphere of being is concerned , is to the Author of nature a consideration of inferior moment . Everywhere we see the arrangements for the species perfect ; the individual is left , as it were , to take his chance amidst the mbl*e of the various laws affecting him . If ill befalls him , there was at least no partiality against him . " The system has the fairness of a lottery , in which every one has the like chance of drawing a prize . " In the above extract the author uses the qualifying words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , " but nothing can be clearer than that they are inconsistent with the entire argument . No reason can he assigned why this system of law and developments should not be carried throughout all existence . In such a scheme the individual must everywhere be comparatively of no importance . The parts are all for the whole , and the whole in no sense for the parts ; whereas in a true system of philosophy , this second position would be recognized as strongly as the first , and both maintained in haimonious consistency . We must give way simply because higher species need the space we occupy . We must die , not for the reason which the Scriptures assign , but that future geologists of a superior order may find in our decayed fossil remains the grounds of a higher science , and evidences of a farther progress in this infinite series of developments . What strange aversion to an individual future state , and to a personal God , must he at the bottom of a philosophy so utterly repulsive as this , and which sends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of the soul . The immortality of the race , and that , too , in ever-varying forms of life , is all that it presents as a consolation for the miseries which here the individual must suffer whilst nature is grinding out some higher development . Irrespective of its direct collision with the plainest teachings of the Scriptures , this doctrine is , in itself , utterly unphilosophical and inconsistent with every rational view of the true ends of being . It is a philosophy of means without ends . There is nothing final about it . The i*ecov , has no place in the scheme . It is all media-eternal cause and effect -- -eternal , never-resting development ,  - -  eternal physical progress , and , of course , eternal imperfe3tion . We say this , because each stage is relatively as unfinished as the one before , and is imperatively , ani in endless succession , require ( lto give way to something which , in comparison with succeeding developments , is itself equally imperfect , and must therefore share the same fate : thus forever leaving behind it zoophytes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the species homo , in undistinguished insignificance . And thus the law goes on , forever and forever , aiming only at that unmeaning abstraction , the whole , ( unmeaning , we say , in a scheme which makes so little or no account of a moral system ) whilst the individuals , without which these wholes have no reality , are regarded as of no importance , or , in our author 's language , " left to take their chance amidst the m*i*e of the various laws affecting them , with the fairness of a lottery in which every one has the like chance of drawing a prize . " - pa0e 281. 0 , how alien is all this , both to the language and the spirit of Jesus ,  --  - " For I say unto you that the very hairs of your head are all numbered . " How infinitely superior is the philosophy of the Bibl* . I'he Scriptures reveal a system of ends , of moral purposes , to which the physical in all its departments is the mere temporary scaffolding . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which perhaps it may he found that science and philosophy are secondary things , but small matters , compared with that moral perfection which awaits the soul , to which the whole machinery of the physical is intended to be subservient , and for the sake of which , perhaps , when it hath performed its office , it is to be removed forever . Let us hear one of the ancient hebrew school of philosophy . Aside from its exceeding sublimity , the passage has something which , we would fain hope , may not be unworthy the attention of even our author 's class of " lofty intellects "  --  " Lft up your eyes to the heavens , and look upon the earth beneath you for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke , and the earth shall wear old like a garment , but my salvation shall be forever , and my righteousness ( that is my moral government ) shall never fail . " This doctrine of eternal physical progress , which is so great a favorite with so many of our natural men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright visions which it presents respecting the destinies of the world we inhabit . It assumes that the course of things has been an eternal progression from the lower to the higher , from the more imperfect to the less imperfect . Matter , it tells us , has been for everlasting ages advancing from a state so rare as to be almost inanity , or infinite diffusion , to a more solid condition ; and in its course progressively giving rise to vegetable , animal , and rational life . Now take away the Bible , from which we derive all our knowledge of what is final in the scheme of the universe , and what security have we in science against the probability of any conjectures in regard to the destiny and rluration of our earth . We say , in science ,  --   - -  for whenever we find ourselves resorting to moral considerations , and reposing on certain moral attributes , we are at once building on a different foundation , and unconsciously resting on the Scriptures . If we will take induction as our only guide , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore may be again , retrograde periods in the history of our little earth . Yes ,  --  but says the progressionist , there has been , on the whole , an advance . Still , individual men and individual nations , and even races have suffered and perished in those backward cycles which the scheme admits to be necessary to the general progress ; and why should we stop here and not embrace worlds themselves in the same startling view ? Setting out from this very nebular hypothesis , it may be shown with almost mathematical certainty , that such retrogradations , and on a most immense scale , and for most immense periods , must be the inevitable result . In the progress of the visible celestial system to condensation , solidity , regular form , and life , the great means , // according to this theory , as most fully stated in the book itself , consists in the loss of heat , or a gradual cooling which goes on through a length of time , defying calculation . Now the heat that thus radiates must make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( for all space is supposed to be occupied ) and there perform the contrary work , and with a contrary effect . Of course other parts which come within this great reflux of the universal fluid , must have more than their due proportion of caloric , and , as a necessary consequence , there must he a process of rarefaction , expansion , disorganization , dissolution of parts , and loss of life , the very opposite of that which prevails in our , at present , more favored quarter of the universe ; until , in this immensly long and inverted progress from life to death , all things finally return again to that rudimentary state from which our own system is supposed to set out . Here , then , to say nothing of partial deteriorations , there must be retrograde cycles on a most immense scale , and during their continuance the most frightful and destructive changes may take place . This is a most rigid and sober conclusion from a wild hypothesis , and all it array of science , if it reject the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gloomy prospects which are legitimately to be deduced from it . But , without viewing the matter on so large a scale , we may say , that , if science alone be consulted , all this is more than possible of our individual world . Some backward cycle , which is a necessary link in the general advance , may require that we should all perish , zoophytes , homines , world and all . A vacuum may be wanted in the space which we now occupy . The Bible , although it does not fix the precise dates , yet , in the general details which it gives us of the plans and purposes of God 's moral system , furnishes satisfactory grounds on which faith can rest ; but in this philosophy of developments , what security have we that before the lapse of twenty-four hours , our continent , which , it is fondly imagined , is going to be the theatre of so many brilliant achievements in science and philosophy , may not be submerged by the upheaving of the ocean , or our world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence of some law , or some hidden wheel , which , for ages , has been nearin* the spring destined to produce the catastophe and thus subserve the evolution of some other development . Will any one , unless he clings to the Scriptures , dare to say that the supposition is incredible , or even extravagant ? What is our position , with infinite space all around us , and two infinite eternities before and behind us , and an infinite law embracing us whose infinitesimal link is infinitely beyond our means of determining its true relations ? - What , we would ask again , is there in our position , which can enable us to decide whether we are physically nearer our ascending or descending nodewhether we are marching on in the advance of the great whole , or destined , like other parts , to he crushed by the retrograding wheels of a relentless nature-whether we are in the ebb or flood of the universal tide of life-whether we are yet cooling and condensing , or have passed the minimum point and commenced the reverse period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death to life , or sinking down in the scale from life to death ,  - -  whether the floating nebular star-dust , which our telescopes bring to view , and of which so much is made in the present work , is really the rudimentary semem of future growing systems , or the rarefied remains of evanescent and worn out worlds , just ready to vanish away into their primitive inanity . As well might the fly on the dome of St. Peter 's speculate on the origin , history , an ( l final destiny of that magnificent structure , from the almost invisible strata which her microscopic eyes have traced in a few inches of the marble on which she sits . In defence of these views , how easy is it to turn against our author a supposition which he himself makes , for another purpose , on the 159th page of his work . " Suppose , " says he , " that an Ephemeron , hovering over a pool for Its one April day of life , were capable of observing the fry of the frog in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen no change upon it for such a length of time , it would be little qualified to conceive that the external branchin of these creatures were to decay , and to be replaced by lungs , that feet were to be developed , the tail erased , and the animal then to become a denizen of the land . " Now , to make a statement in the rule of proportion , just as that ephemeron would be to the frog-fry and the pool of water so is our author to the purpose and destiny // of that universe of whose progression he talks so flippantly . Since , however , he has furnished the comparison , we will imagine a parallel case , which may he introduced here , although a little out of the course of our present remarks . Suppose that an ephemeral philosopher , who knew nothing , and had heard nothing , of the production of the human fretus , and of the rapid infant growth , should closely observe the almost imperceptible enlargement of the teeth aud hones of one who was just attaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this natural phenomenon according to the strictest rules of experimental induction , proceeding solely by facts and appearances , and assuming that the laws of growth and change , as they now appear to him in the human body , have ever been the same , both in the manner and rapidity of theim action . Suppose that after having thus carefully observed all the maxims of the most rigid Baconianism , be should deduce the irrefutable conclusion , that the individual aforesaid must have occupied about 700,000 years in coming to his present condition and magnitude . 01n what respect , we ask , would the speculations of such an ephemeral philosopher differ from some of the hypotheses which have been put forth respecting the age of the present dispensation of our globe ? In no part of this work have we been more amused , if it is not too light a term , than with the author 's attempts , on his hypothesis , to reconcile men to the physical evils they are forced to suffer . He evidently feels , that to beings situated as we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being subservient to the Great Whole . Of a moral scheme , except as confounded with the physical after the style of Combe and Spurzheim , he seems to have no conception . Still , notwithstanding all progress and developments , he has to confess that men are afflicted with disease , and that the world is full of misery and death . in his great perplexity , he turns ever and anon to the consoling position , that the Deity must proceedby fixed laws , and that their operation IS generally useful . Gravitation was not intended to injure legs , but to keep things stable upon the eartb ,  --  still , those who will break it , ( just as though a man really could break the law of gravitation ) must suffer the consequences . " If the rash boy lose his hold of the branch , it will unrelentingly pull him down ; and yet it was not a primary object of this great law of gravitation to hurt boys  --  the evil is , therefore , only a casual exception from something in the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own easy examples , carefully avoiding all real difficulties , and sometimes , when he finds himself hard pushed , talking very piously , but in a style utterly inconsistent with the hoasting and confident tone of other parts , of " the little we know of the designs of Providence . " This method is pursued until he comes to the place where we would expect him to grapple with the difficult subjects of disease and death . Even in treating of the first , he exhibits evidence that he is entirely beyond his depth , and that , do what he will , the theme is ever bearing him nearer and nearer the confines of a true moral system which he ever wishes to avoid . But when we expect him to bring the light of his philosophy to bear upon the grave , when we are anxious to see how far its feeble beams can penetrate the dread gloom of the sepulchre , we find only a silent and unanswering void . He evidently shrinks from the comiflict . The awful theme brings him too near those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which no babble about physical laws , and physical consequences can keep off : He therefore preserves an ominous yet most significant silence in relation to the whole subject , and winds up this most feeble chapter " on the purpose of the animated creation , " with that sentimental drivel to which we have already alluded , respecting the subserviency of the individual to the interests of the whole . " If the indivldual be found inferiorly endowed , or ill befalls him , there was at least no partiality against him : the system has the fairness of a lottery in which every one has the like chance of drawing a prize ! " The difficulties encountered in this chapter seem to have had some effect , and to have brought about a faint recognition of something higher than the natural . in this concession , however , there is one declaration so remarkable , that we can not pass it by without special remark . " It may be , " he observes , " it may be , that whilst we are committed to take our chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of grace and mercy behind the screen . " And this is the language of one who would repel the name of infidel , and who professes respect for the Scriptures . A religious friend , who , in some strange // way , had become a great admirer of this book , pointed out this passage as conclusive evidence that the author was not an infidel , and did not deserve the censures with which religionists might be inclined to visit him . Now , of all the sentences in the book , this one furnishes the strongest evidence that the author is what we have called him , an infidel , a disingenuous , unmanly infidel . " There may , perhaps , be a system of grace and mercy behind the screen of nature ! " and all this said with as much simplicity , as though just such a system of grace and mercy was not the subject which occupies the whole Bible from its commencement to its close . We had intended to have said something more particularly respecting the scientific merits of this nebular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe the whole theory to be false , and that it has received but little countenance from any men of real science . Whatever may be its merits , it is absolutely incapable of verification . It is said , in page 18 , that M. Compte , of Paris , has made some approach to a mathematical demonstration . We , however , more than doubt its correctness . Although not inclined to speak dogmatically on a question of science , still we venture to affirm , that there are too many hypothetical data to be assumed and taken into the account , to allow us to attach any weight to calculations grounded upon them . Its hypothesis of condensation by the radiation of caloric to other parts of . the universe , and the consequent alternation of immense periods marked by the predominance respectively of heat and cold , is an old thing under the sun . It resembles very much some of the ancient systems of dualism , and does not differ in its principle from the poetical Epuic and *Eptc , or the contracting and separating powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were very common in the ancient world , even at a very early date , and their reappearance at the present day furnishes a most striking proof of the truth of Aristotle 's remark in his Meteorologica , bib. 1 , c. 3 " - " Thus must we say that not once , or twice , or a few times , but with almost infinite repetitions the same opinions come round in a circle among men . " A few words in regard to the style of this book , and we have done with it . We would venture to designate it by a name that is not to be found in Blair 's classification , it may be called the puffy or bladder style . There is a continual inflation , utterly inconsistent with the modesty of true science ,  --  a continual attempt at thaumaturgic display . The reader is everlastingly called upon to wonder at something , and sometimes statements seem made for no other purpose , and without much , if any , regard to scientific correctness . To combine two favorite expressions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is full of startling developments . It is very much in the manner of a certain lecturer , who has often enlightened the inhabitants of this city , and who , when he has occasion to state the sober fact of science that light moves at the rate of two hundred thousand miles a second , prefers to startle his hearers by telling them that a stream of rays two hundred thousand miles long enters the eye and passes up the optic nerve every time we wink . The author improves upon this statement , and attempts to render it still more startling , lie applies it to a calculation of the rapidity of mental action , and to the measurement of the time during which the electric fluid , which constitutes will , passes from the brain into the limb to be moved . " If mental action , " says he , " is electric , the proverbial quickness of thought-that is the quickness of the transmission of sensation and will-may be presumed to have been brought to an exact measurement . The speed of light has long been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experiments of Wheatstone have shown , that the electric agent travels ( if I may so speak , ) at the same rate ; thus showing a likelihood that one law rules the movement of all the imponderable bodies . Mental action may accordingly be presumed to have a rapidity equal to one hundred and ninety-two thousand miles in a second . " Tausend Millionen-says the philosophical king , in Tieck 's comedy of Puss in Boots-Millionen Trillionen-Ich mag auf der Welt nichts lieber hiiren , als so grose Nummern- " Millions , trillions , nothing in the world would J rather hear than these big numbers ; how the very mention of them makes the soul swell and grow . " Had we known physical science only from such works and such lectures as these , one might well suppose that the name was not derived from *Prtt* ( nature ) as is commonly supposed , but from * to puff , to inflate , to blow up like a bladdei , and that it was the very knowledge // 543 which Paul describes by this term , 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained in the work is very small ; just about as much as any man might have picked up from attending a course of Dr. Lardner 's lectures . Even a less quantity would have enabled any one to have written this book , so far as the scientific statements are concerned . The author 's name is not attached , but we are ceitain it is not the production of a Davy , a Draper , or a Herschell . True science ever loves a chaste and simple style . We venture to predict that the present l ) oPularity of the work we have reviewed will be as transient as its amount of real science is small , and that Moses will be revered long after it bas passed into its merited oblivion.
