Whittier , John Greenleaf , 1807-1892 : TO GOV . M'DUFFIE. from Voices of freedom ( 1846 ) " The patriarchal institution of slavery , "  --  " the corner-stone of our republican edifice. "  --  Gov . M'Duffie . King of Carolina  --  hail ! Last champion of Oppression 's battle ! Lord of rice-tierce and cotton-bale ! Of sugar-box and human cattle ! Around thy temples , green and dark , Thy own tobacco-wreath reposes ; Thyself , a brother Patriarch Of Isaac , Abraham , and Moses ! Why not ?  --  Their household rule is thine ; Like theirs , thy bondmen feel its rigor ; And thine , perchance , as concubine , Some swarthy counterpart of Hagar . Why not ?  --  Like patriarchs of old , The priesthood is thy chosen station ; Like them thou payest thy rites to gold  --  An Aaron 's calf of Nullification . All fair and softly !  --  Must we , then , From Ruin 's open jaws to save us , Upon our own free working men Confer a master 's special favors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Hooks for the nostrils of Democracy , Before it spurns as well as feels The riding of the Aristocracy ! Ho !  --  fishermen of Marblehead ! Ho !  --  Lynn cordwainers , leave your leather And wear the yoke in kindness made , And clank your needful chains together ! Let Lowell mills their thousands yield , Down let the rough Vermonter hasten , Down from the workshop and the field , And thank us for each chain we fasten . Slaves in the rugged Yankee land ! I tell thee , Carolinian , never ! Our rocky hills and iron strand Are free , and shall be free for ever . The surf shall wear that strand away , Our granite hills in dust shall moulder , Ere Slavery 's hateful yoke shall lay , Unbroken , on a Yankee 's shoulder ! No , George M'Duffie !  --  keep thy words For the mail plunderers of thy city , Whose robber-right is in their swords ; For recreant Priest and Lynch-Committee ! Go , point thee to thy cannon 's mouth , And swear its brazen lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South , " Than parchment scroll , or Charter 's letter . Footnote : 1Kb We fear not . Streams which brawl most loud Along their course , are oftenest shallow ; And loudest to a doubting crowd The coward publishes his valor . Thy courage has at least been shown In many a bloodless Southern quarrel , Facing , with hartshorn and cologne , The Georgian 's harmless pistol-barrel . Footnote : 1Kb No , Southron ! not in Yankee land Will threats , like thine , a fear awaken : The men , who on their charter stand For truth and right , may not be shaken . Still shall that truth assail thine ear ; Each breeze , from Northern mountains blowing . The tones of Liberty shall bear  --  God 's " free incendiaries " going ! We give thee joy !  --  thy name is heard With reverence on the Neva 's borders ; And " turban 'd Turk , " and Poland 's lord , And Metternich , are thy applauders . Go  --  if thou lov'st such fame , and share The mad Ephesian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And clap the torch to Freedom 's temple ! Do this  --  Heaven 's frown , thy country 's curse , Guilt 's fiery torture ever burning  --  The quenchless thirst of Tantalus , And Ixion 's wheel for ever turning  --  A name , for which " the pain'dest fiend Below , " his own would barter never ,  --  These shall be thine unto the end  --  Thy damning heritage for ever ! Whittier , John Greenleaf , 1807-1892 : STANZAS FOR THE TIMES . from Voices of freedom ( 1846 ) " To agitate the question ( Slavery ) anew , is not only impolitic , but it is a virtual breach of good faith to our brethren of the South ; an unwarrantable interference with their domestic relations and institutions . " " I can never , in the official station which I occupy , consent to countenance a course which may jeopard the peace and harmony of the Union . "  --  Gov . Porter 's Inaugural Message . No " countenance " of his , forsooth ! Who asked it at his vassal hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party 's vile and hateful bands ? Who dreamed that one by them caressed , Would lay for her his spear in rest ? His " countenance ! " Well , let it light The human robber to his spoil !  --  Let those who track the bondman 's flight , Like bloodhounds , o'er our once free soil , Bask in its sunshine while they may , And howl its praises on their way ; We ask no boon : our RIGHTS we claim  --  Free press and thought  --  free tongue and pen ,  --  The right to speak in Freedom 's name , As Pennsylvanians and as men ; To do , by Lynch law unforbid , What our own Rush and Franklin did . Of human skulls that shrine was made , Round which the priests of Mexico Before their loathsome idol pray 'd  --  Is Freedom 's altar fashion 'd so ? And must we yield to Freedom 's God , As offering meet , the negro 's blood ? Shall tongues be mute , when deeds are wrought Which well might shame extremest Hell ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bosom cease to swell ? Small Honor bleed ?  --  Shall Truth succumb ? Shall pen , and press , and soul be dumb ? No  --  by each spot of haunted ground , Where Freedom weeps her children 's fall  --  By Plymouth 's rock  --  and Bunker 's mound  --  By Griswold 's stain 'd and shatter 'd wall  --  By Warren 's ghost  --  by Langdon 's shade  --  By all the memories of our dead ! By their enlarging souls , which burst The bands and fetters round them set  --  By the FREE Pilgrim SPIRIT nursed Within our inmost bosoms , yet ,  --  By all above  --  around  --  below  --  Be ours th ' indignant answer  --  NO ! No  --  guided by our country 's laws , For truth , and right , and suffering man , Be ours to strive in Freedom 's cause , As Christians may  --  as freemen can ! Still pouring on unwilling ears That truth oppression only fears . What ! shall we guard our neighbor still , While woman shrieks beneath his rod , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common God ! Shall watch and ward be round him set , Of Northern nerve and bayonet ? And shall we know and share with him The danger and the open shame ? And see our Freedom 's light grow dim , Which should have fill 'd the world with flame ? And , writhing , feel where'er we turn , A world 's reproach around us burn ? Is't not enough that this is borne ? And asks our haughty neighbor more ? Must fetters which his slaves have worn , Clank round the Yankee farmer 's door ? Must he be told , beside his plough , What he must speak , and when , and how ? Must he be told his freedom stands On Slavery 's dark foundations strong  --  On breaking hearts and fetter 'd hands , On robbery , and crime , and wrong ? That all his fathers taught is vain  --  That Freedom 's emblem is the chain ? Its life  --  its soul , from slavery drawn ? False  --  foul  --  profane ! Go  --  teach as well Of holy Truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Hell ! Of Virtue in the arms of Vice ! Of Demons planting Paradise ! Rail on , then , " brethren of the South "  --  Ye shall not hear the truth the less  --  No seal is on the Yankee 's mouth , No fetter on the Yankee 's press ! From our Green Mountains to the Sea , One voice shall thunder  --  WE ARE FREE ! Whittier , John Greenleaf , 1807-1892 : TO JAMES G. BIRNEY , ON HIS VISIT TO NEW ENGLAND IN 1845. from Voices of freedom ( 1846 ) Friend of the Slave , whose trust in thee Is told in many a midnight prayer  --  To whom with tears of joy the free The blessing of the ransomed bear ! Our free winds blow , our free waves foam On Plymouth rock , round Faneuil Hall ; Thy welcome to our hearts and home , Oh ! Freedom 's friend , is heard from all . For well should honest Nature own , With all her tongues , the worshipper , Who bends at Freedom 's shrine , alone With poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once more the old heroic thought , And startling faithless Cant and Crime With miracles of goodness wrought . We hail thee on our Eastern strand , Brave tiller of the Western soil ! And clasp with pride the generous hand Grown hard and brown with honest toil . ' T is something in our selfish day , To feel that man once more can break From Mammon 's lure and Party 's sway , And dare be poor for conscience sake ! Then , in thy stainless honor , come , Mild pleader for the trampled slave ! We call thee from thy woodland home , By Huron 's dim and distant wave , In Freedom 's holy strife to share  --  For , never yet since Time began , Could coward Wrong and Falsehood bear The presence of an upright man !
