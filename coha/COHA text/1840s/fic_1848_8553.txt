To the official courtesy and kindness of our minister , the Hon. Edward Everett , and to the facilities afforded by that admirable institution , the Library of the British Museum , I am indebted for the historical details of this play . It would appear only an affectation of pedantry to name the works , ( at least twenty in number , ) which were consulted previous to the writing of this ephemeral production . London , 1844 . INTRODUCTION . The lack of intelligible chronicles has left the early history of the red men imperfect ; the prejudice and injustice of their dispossessors have too often falsified or obscured their traditions ; and the various dialects and rapid disappearance of many tribes render perishable the historic songs some rude Homer may have chanted . The life of Pocahontas is an exception to this rule : the great charm of all connected with her is its certainty and truth . All the particulars of her biography are confirmed by relatively distant and unimpeachable testimony , recorded by writers who , ( so far from adding to narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barren enumeration of events denude them of all beauty save their intrinsic worth . While the mere fact that some of the most worthy families in our land are the living descendants of Pocahontas , gives an almost prosaic reality to her existence . Considered in her individual career , Pocahontas stands forth from first to last the animated type of mercy and peace , unselfishness and truth . Her benevolence , ( of which the limits of this play can record but a small part , ) is neither a momentary impulse nor a cold system of utility : it is a warm , all-pervading and abiding principle . Her life was pure , active , and affectionate : her " beautiful , godly , and Christian death " was a theme of praise to all beholders . Considered in relation to the events which resulted from her instrumentality on earth , her character assumes still greater importance . The various historians and colonists concur in the assertion that but for the benefactions of Pocahontas , Virginia would have been lost to England . The Dutch and the Spaniards were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves there during the delay which must have inevitably occurred , had the British colonists starved to death or abandoned the spot ,  --  a result which Pocahontas alone prevented . How far the aspect of civilization , of national character and government , of literature and science , in America , would have been affected , had other lands given customs , laws , and language to so extensive and central a portion of our continent , is a question well worthy of consideration , and in justice to Pocahontas , should ever be associated with her name . The great difficulty in the construction of a drama from this subject ,  --  its unconquerable defect , rhetorically speaking , lies in the division of the interest . Were it a romance , it were easy to heighten the attraction tenfold by representing love as the result of Pocahontas ' compassion and Smith 's gratitude , and thus perfecting the unity of the plot . But this tale is no fiction ; and though precedents illustrious in literature exist where the acts of historical personages have been misrepresented to embellish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned , especially when , as in the present case , it would detract from the pure disinterestedness of a woman 's fame . However rude may be the shrine on which Vesta 's fire is kindled  --  however dim its blaze may seem , viewed through the misty atmosphere of centuries ,  --  even the laws of classic fable forbid us to employ the torch of Hymen , or Cupid 's " purple light " to replenish the celestial flame .

And by full consent Of this good council , we shall call the fort And dwellings , James Town , honouring the king By whose commission we explore these lands . All . All Long live King James ! Ratliffe . Master John Ratliffe Your counsel , friends , I seek .  --  Right worthy Captain Smith , as thou hast learned The languages of many native tribes , And all their customs and geography , To thee I first address myself . Smith . Captain John Smith The same Fair praise is merited by Master Rolfe , Who , all unused to labour , still hath toiled Without reward , hard as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , Learned e'en as much as I. Rolfe . Master John Rolfe You wrong me there . You are my elder and my better too : A soldier prudent , brave and tried , while I Wild for adventure , only hope to see The Indian countries noble Ralegh named , And with my sword to carve my way to fame And fortune  --  if I can . Smith . Captain John Smith What more wouldst have ? Who would at home drag out an aimless life , When honourable , bold ambition calls To lead through forests vast the arts and faith Of polished , civilized life  --  like pioneers , To hew a road to Glory 's farthest goal , And write on her imperishable page The op'ning chapter of a nation 's story . Hunt . Master Robert Hunt Thy words like fire warm each heart that hears . Ratliffe . Master John Ratliffe Now to our plans . This friendly Indian says Pointing to Mosco . You noble stream and lands of vast extent Are ruled o'er by Virginia 's mighty king  --  Great Powhatan : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leagues from this . We must with him a treaty make that may Secure supplies of corn and other food , When we 've exhausted all our vessel 's store . A deputation to this king must go . Hunt . Master Robert Hunt Might I advise , but two should bear the news . A number of strange faces would convey Semblance of hostile purpose . Ratliffe . Master John Ratliffe Well you speak ; And Captain Smith first named  --  the other  --  Reflecting Stay  --  Smith . Captain John Smith Most worthy president , I 'll go alone . Each arm and head are needed to preserve The safety of the colony . Rolfe . Master John Rolfe Let me Thy danger share . Smith . Captain John Smith Apart to him . Thou art more needed here .

Master John Rolfe So be it then . Smith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth at once . Ratliffe . Master John Ratliffe Are you accoutred for the task ? Smith . Captain John Smith I am . Looking at his pistols . A little harmless powder strikes with awe The savage tribes . This ( pointing to his sword ) proves my trusty friend Should danger threaten ; and an axe to cut My way through pathless tangled brakes . Rolfe goes into the fort . The sun Will be my guide to Orapaks ; his beams In setting gild its rude abodes  --  so tells The Indian here . Rolfe returns with an axe and gives it to Smith . Thanks , friend . I will not lag Upon the road . The wild grape and the stream Will feast me in my absence . Fare ye well Most worthy council , and my trusty friends . Ratliffe and Volday bow . Hunt and Rolfe advance to say farewell . Hunt . Master Robert Hunt Heav'n speed thee on thy errand . Smith . Captain John Smith Rev'rend sir , Amen . Exit . Ratliffe . Master John Ratliffe Now let us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after send him home Well pleased , laden with glitt'ring gifts to bear A good report of us among his tribe . They are conducting Mosco to the fort as the scene closes . SCENE SECOND . The adjacent forest . Enter Volday . Volday . William Volday ' T is ever thus  --  in Britain  --  on the seas  --  And now in forests , still this Captain Smith Is foremost in our council and our wars . No other name can gain a eulogy . Enter Rolfe , equipped for the chase . Rolfe . Master John Rolfe See  --  the sun shines bright on Smith 's adventure . Volday . William Volday On Smith ! Is there no other brave bold man That he must be the burthen of each song ? Rolfe . Master John Rolfe For shame ! Thou lik'st him not , because , of all The lawless spirits here , ( and they are many , ) Thou art the hardest to control . Why man ! We are among an untaught race whom we Would make our friends . Volday . William Volday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why thus  --  thou didst endeavour to defraud The Indians who first came to sell us ven'son . Thou would'st have robbed , not bartered . Captain Smith Made thee pay what with us values little , But is a treasure to the forest-bred . For this I grieve to see thou ow'st him grudge . Volday . William Volday What right has he to lord it o'er the rest ? Rolfe . Master John Rolfe The right of rank bestowed for service tried , The right of valour and integrity  --  Prudence , experience , generosity , Endurance and the pride of conscious worth . These give him right to rule o'er me , and thee . Volday . William Volday A man 's opinions are as free as air , And I have mine . Rolfe . Master John Rolfe But if they tend to ill Discard them , pray . We are a little band Amidst an unknown country , and should be United . Come , meet Smith on his return With friendship . I will try my sporting skill Till sunset . Fare you well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Your boyish dreams of honour and desert Will ever keep your purse filled scantily . You aided Smith in public to disgrace My name .  --  I will bear friendship  --  in my looks , And wait the hour to crush ye both . Noise without . But hark ! Todkill rushes on much frightened . How now ? what ails thee ? speak ! Todkill . Anas Todkill Speak ! I 've hardly breath , I 've run so fast . Volday . William Volday Run ! wherefore ! why Dost tremble so ? Are foes at hand ? Todkill . Anas Todkill I 'll tell you ,  --  only wait . Recovering himself . Master Ratliffe sent me into the forest for Master Rolfe  --  when two great glaring eyes looked out upon me from the thicket ; then I heard an angry growl . It was a wolf , or a bear , or one of those more hideous beasts you wise heads call a panther . Volday . William Volday Of course You shot him dead . Todkill . Anas Todkill Oh no ! I ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anas Todkill No ! no ! I do n't deserve that name . I 've no objection to fair fight with men , but wild beasts are my particular aversion . Volday . William Volday Weak fool ! to let The brute escape , surrounded as we are By dangers . Todkill . Anas Todkill If you are so anxious , seek him out yourself ; and if he makes a meal of you , I do n't think many will shed tears . Volday . William Volday Cease your senseless gossip ! Todkill . Anas Todkill Senseless ! umph ! If it was a bear , he 'll have a fellow-feeling , and make friends with you . Volday . William Volday Psha ! Exit angrily . Todkill laughs . Todkill . Anas Todkill Ha , ha ! I think that I was even with him there .  --  I wonder where young Master Rolfe is gone . Francis enters . Ha ! Francis ! Francis . Adam Francis So , Todkill , no more work , at least to-day . It is to be a holiday . Todkill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ! cutting down trees  --  chopping up trees  --  sawing  --  digging ! whew ! my arms ache at the recollection . Francis . Adam Francis Yes , the work is hard . Todkill . Anas Todkill Hard ! Ay ! I believe it is . And at night , before we can go comfortably to sleep , we must light fires to keep off  --  ugh ! the wild beasts . Francis . Adam Francis Yes , fires large enough to roast  --  Todkill . Anas Todkill Roast ! do n't talk of roasting ! Shall I ever see a joint of meat served up in a Christian way again , or go to sleep without the singing of those vile mosquitoes in my ears ! Francis . Adam Francis And then we can not have a jovial bout forsooth , because the wine is doled out daily to us ! Todkill . Anas Todkill These savages  --  poor , ignorant , unhappy creatures , have no wine  --  no anything except tobacco  --  that 's my only comfort here  --  to smoke a pipe  --  for then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how comfortable I should be seated at home with her by a nice coal fire  --  a cup of mulled wine and a pipe by my side . That 's comfort , Francis . Francis . Adam Francis Comfort ! yes ! Harkye , you 're a merry fellow , and if you will give your word to keep a secret  --  Todkill . Anas Todkill Close as the grave . What is it ? Francis . Adam Francis When poor Captain Smith gave out the wine yesterday , I stole a flagon , and here it is . Producing it . But mind , in confidence , I 'll share it with you , before we go back to the fort . Todkill . Anas Todkill Ah , Francis , you 're a worthy soul . Here 's the health of comely Mistress Alice . Drinks . Francis . Adam Francis Mistress Alice ! Drinks . Todkill . Anas Todkill Bless her pretty face , I think I see it now . Drinks again , then gives the flask to Francis . Francis . Adam Francis Here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anas Todkill Ah ! this forest life is very dreary . Francis . Adam Francis Well , you can return in the next ship . Todkill . Anas Todkill No , I must stay with Master Rolfe , Heaven bless him ! I 've known him since we were both little boys . He always stood up for me when I was in trouble ;  --  and in our merry game  --  Lord ! how he used to thump me  --  bless him ! I would n't leave him for the world . Francis . Adam Francis Well then , think of fame and money . Todkill . Anas Todkill Yes , money 's very well ; but as for fame , that 's charming enough for Master Rolfe , who wants to live in story : I 'd rather live in England , and die undistinguished.  --  Oh , Mistress Alice ! Takes the flask and drinks . Francis . Adam Francis Console yourself with the adventures you can relate on your return . They are going . Todkill . Anas Todkill Ah ! yes ! How Alice will stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , and more too . Travellers , you know , are not bound to tell the truth ; if they were , their books would n't be half so entertaining . Exeunt Todkill and Francis laughing . SCENE THIRD . Powhatan 's wigwam at Orapaks . A rude throne on one side . On the other a pile of huge stones . Powhatan enters from without . Powhatan . Powhatan The sun has set , yet Pocahontas Returns not with the forest 's blooming spoil . Why does she linger ? Hark ! it is her step . Pocahontas enters the wigwam , bearing a basket of wild fruit . My child is welcome . Pocahontas . Pocahontas Pocahontas brings A dainty for her father 's evening meal . Her task was shortened by surprising news . A weary wand'rer from that peaceful tribe The Paspaheghes , met her on the road . He says the pale-faced men whose homes are where The sun doth rise , are come unto our shores Once more , in their white-winged canoes . Powhatan . Powhatan The God Of ill rain curses  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seize The red man 's lands  --  to slay  --  Pocahontas . Pocahontas Though some were false , My father will not judge all harshly . Think ! Even amongst our own and other tribes There oft are wicked and deceitful men  --  So may it be with these . Remember too , ' Mongst those who landed here , and since went home O'er the big waters , years ere I was born , I 've heard my father praise  --  ay ! more than one  --  Many for bravery stood eminent . Powhatan . Powhatan Thy voice breathes kindness ever . Pocahontas Is her father 's dearest child . Pocahontas . Pocahontas And fondly She loves him . Were he meanest of the tribe She 'd share with joy his base inglorious lot ; But as he is a mighty chief and brave , She loves his glory dear as she loves him , And ever will entreat him not to cloud His fame by judgment harsh or cruelty . Enter Opachisco with the axe used by Smith in scene 1st , followed by two Indians . Opachisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wand'ring near this wigwam . Not of our race Is he , though speaks he our tongue . We would Have seized and brought him hither , when aside He cast this tomahawk he held  --  ( Pointing to the English axe. ) and raised A short black wand  --  a flash gleamed in the air  --  The Spirit he invoked , ' mid smoke denounced Our rashness , and we fled ; but soon returned When he , great wizard , beckoned and besought To see the mighty Powhatan . Powhatan . Powhatan Ye fools ! It was no Spirit , but a tool of war The pale-face fights with , as you arrows use . He is no wizard  --  Go , conduct him here . Exeunt Opachisco and the other Indians . See , e'en as Pocahontas said , ' t is one of those .  --  Smith is conducted in by Opachisco and other Indians . He comes . What brings the pale-face here ? Smith . Captain John Smith I am called Captain Smith . With other friends Just landed from a long and stormy voyage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Powhatan Where are the white man 's countrymen ? Smith . Captain John Smith Upon The banks of thy broad river , Powhatan . They wait my coming with assurance fair Of amity from thee . A bond of peace With presents rich I offer , and besides Bright beads and hatchets , tools of every kind , Arrow heads , glass , wrought iron , copper too , Your corn and ven'son taking in exchange . Powhatan . Powhatan Powhatan will no treaty make  --  no peace  --  The pale-faced brethren come to spy  --  to seize His lands  --  to make his tribes their slaves  --  to bow Him down with tribute . Smith . Captain John Smith Chief , you wrong me much , And wrong still more your father , England 's king . Ambition , avarice , may be the curse Of some who sought your friendship to betray . My word is sacred as my bond . In deeds , As well as speech , I proffer amity . Powhatan , Powhatan surprosed . Do young men speak in the pale-face 's councils ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and even now perhaps Their treach'rous band in ambush lurking near May spring upon us . One at least shall be Secure . He gives a signal and the Indians advance stealthily behind Smith , and prepare to seize him , directed by Opachisco . Pocahontas Pocahontas springing forward . What means my father ? Powhatan . Powhatan Seize the stranger ! Before Smith has time to draw his sword the Indians spring upon him and pinion his arms . After a struggle , Smith is overcome and held down by the savages . He shall die ! appeasing the Great Spirit Who then may drive all rash intruders hence . So  --  bind him hard  --  . Opachisco does so . Smith . Captain John Smith Yet hear me , savage chief ! Powhatan . Powhatan Plead not ! ' t is vain . Smith . Captain John Smith Plead ! ' t is for thyself I 'd speak . Beware the vengeance of my king . Plead ! never ! Death I fear not . I will meet Its stroke with firmness as a soldier should . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Risked for my country oft , is England 's still . Powhatan . Powhatan Prepare the instruments of death . ( Smith is led to the pile of stones and assisted to lie down with his head upon the stones . The Indians bring their clubs . ) Pocahontas . Pocahontas No ! No ! Will not my father spare him ? Powhatan . Powhatan Get thee hence ; Our chiefs admit not women 's counsels . Pocahontas . Pocahontas True . Poor Pocahontas is a woman ; but She 's child of a great warrior and king  --  Of Powhatan ,  --  and as she shares his blood , So may she share his counsels . Beseechingly . Let her stay ! Powhatan . Powhatan Thou art the dearest daughter of the King ; Provoke him not to wrath . Begone . Pocahontas . Pocahontas The voice Of mercy louder speaks than Powhatan . Powhatan . Powhatan Thy father hates these strangers .  --  Mark me well . They came in numbers ere thyself wast born . Their deeds , their history , their conduct , then , To our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come they 'll spread o'er all the land . Foul tyranny and rapine they 'll return For friendly welcome and sweet mercy shown , Defrauding or exterminating still Our ancient race , until the red man 's name Will live but in the mem'ry of the past , Or in some exile powerless , who sells For a few ears of corn his father 's land , Lord of that soil where then he 'll beg a grave . Pocahontas . Pocahontas And should our race thus pass from earth away , The shame will not be theirs , but their oppressors , Who then , amidst the chronicles they keep , This act of mercy by a forest-king Full surely must record . Oh ! spare him , father ! Powhatan . Powhatan Is Powhatan a woman , to be moved By tears ? The stranger dies . ( Turns from her . Now , warriors , Obey your King . When thus I raise my arm , Dash out his brains ! The Indians brandish their clubs . Pocahontas . Pocahontas Rushing to her father . No ! No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that far land  --  A babe just straying from its mother 's arms  --  Both watching for his coming  --  praying too The Good Great Spirit to protect him still ! Powhatan , Powhatan incensed . Let women snatch from wolves the prey their fangs Have torn , but thwart not Powhatan . Begone ! Pocahontas . Pocahontas Think were my father captive far o'er seas  --  Thus doomed to die alone  --  no hand to save  --  His daughter helpless here in agony  --  For her sake , spare him ! Powhatan , Powhatan with terrible anger . Dare not speak again ! He dies . Away ! Goes up to his throne and raises his arm . At the same moment Pocahontas rushes to Smith , and clasps his head in her arms , laying her own head upon his , as the Indians are in the act of striking the blow , while Pocahontas Pocahontas exclaims . Then slay him thus ! Powhatan . Powhatan Hold ! Hold ! The Indians pause . To Pocahontas , with surprise and admiration . Thou art a worthy daughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's form . Thou wilt not doubt the word of Powhatan . ' T is pledged . Pocahontas relinquishes her grasp of Smith and comes forward . To the Indians . Release the pale-face !  --  They raise and unbind him . He is free ! Pocahontas falls at the feet of Powhatan who stands upon his throne repelling Smith 's expressions of gratitude . The Indians group around in wonder , and Opachisco points to the entrance , directing Smith 's departure , as the curtain falls . End of Act I. Act 2 SECOND PERIOD 1609 . ACT SECOND . SCENE FIRST . James Town . The same scene as the first of the play . The colonists discovered in various groups , some reclining on the ground leaning against the trunk of a tree  --  some leaning on their usng  --  and all more or less feeble and haggard from the effects of famine . Ratliffe , Rolfe , Volday , Todkill and Francis , are most prominent in the group . Rolfe .

Grasps his hand . Hunt , Rolfe , Ratliffe and Smith confer together . Francis approaches timidly . Smith beckons , and in action , expostulates with , and forgives him . Volday , William Volday apart Were not these fools so tame , So swayed by Smith and Rolfe , I know that some Would back me in the strife . So let it be . The secret messages I 've sent unto The savage king , have prospered , and he knows The fitting time for ambush and surprise . These patient victims then will fall , and I , Rewarded , honoured by the savages , In time in lawless luxury may live And reign amid these forests .

Powhatan . Powhatan And why ? Across the waters are there not Broad plains where you may dwell ? The Great Spirit To his red children gave these hunting-grounds . There is not room for us and you .

No  --  there are hundreds skilled in graceful wiles To win a maiden 's heart . Couldst thou with them Compare my plain address , I fear thou wouldst Repent thy choice . Pocahontas . Pocahontas Such doubt wrongs Pocahontas . Whene'er a forest-maiden gives her heart , Around her the Great Spirit casts a spell ; Before her eyes , the husband of her soul , Even while absent , ever seems to stand , And from her sight shuts out all other men . Hunt . Master Robert Hunt That faith is worthy of a holier creed . Retires and confers with Powhatan and Dale . Pocahontas . Pocahontas ' T is Pocahontas who has most to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not learned Those small strange characters of wondrous power Pointing to the treaty in Powhatan 's hands . That speak without a voice . Thou'lt blush to shew The fair-faced dames an untaught bride . Rolfe . Master John Rolfe Had I A soul so mean I should deserve to blush At my own baseness . I have little lore , Save what my parents early made me con : To use plain honesty in speech and act  --  To share my purse with those who want it . Still To love my native land and fight for her When needed  --  ne'er to yield , or triumph o'er The fallen  --  to protect woman whene'er Oppressed  --  and love her too . If thou canst prize Such simple precepts and a faithful heart I give them princess , with my hand . Oh speak ! Pocahontas . Pocahontas Powhatan 's daughter will not hide her thought . No harm can surely dwell in that which gives Such happiness and joy . Stranger , thy wife Will Pocahontas be . Timidly laying her hand in his . Rolfe . Master John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . Hunt , Master Robert Hunt pointing to Pocahontas . To such a heart the Christian faith Must penetrate and spread conviction there . Virginia 's king , and you who represent to Dale . The majesty of England , go with me . Within the humble Chapel of this fort Our Church 's rites shall make these lovers one : The first of the two nations joined as yet In wedlock 's sacred bonds . Dale . Sir Thomas Dale This deed unites In peace and love the Old World and the New . Powhatan . Powhatan Young brave , I give thee here my daughter 's hand , Nor shalt thou take her dowerless . The king Of Powhatan 's twelve tribes can send his child Well portioned to the stranger 's wigwam . Thou Wilt love , protect her , when her father 's eyes Are closed , her kindred driven from the earth , As soon they will be , ' neath the crushing strides Of thy vast nation . And when Powhatan , Like a true brave , his death-song calmly sings , Amid his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richest trophy was his daughter 's love . Joins their hands . Rolfe and Pocahontas kneel .

William Volday Is this to be my doom ? Exhausted , faint , To die of want and poverty ! Abroad For months alone I lived amid the woods In suff'ring , till an artful tale obtained My passage in a Spanish ship . Since then Each pang of wretchedness I 've known !

Master John Rolfe Well old friend , how fare you ? Todkill . Anas Todkill Never better , master , never better . I 'm more expert at chalking down reckonings than cutting down trees  --  can draw a cup of wine more easily than a sword ,  --  and like loading my " Arquebus " here , better than trying to shoot a live stag for my dinner . You take , Master Rolfe . Rolfe , Master John Rolfe smiling . I do . Smith . Captain John Smith How 's this ? No hostess yet ? Todkill . Anas Todkill In good time , worthy Captain . Mistress Alice waits with all duty upon Lady Rolfe , and only delay our marriage till her departure . Smith . Captain John Smith Much joy To you , old friend . Todkill . Anas Todkill I thank you , Captain . During the previous dialogue , Volday has entered .

What else , good gentlemen ? Rolfe . Master John Rolfe Naught else , my friend . Todkill sees Volday and appears to reprove the drawer for having admitted him  --  then goes busily among the other guests , still noticing Volday . Rolfe fills glasses . The King And royal Charles . Smith . Captain John Smith No news from Raleigh yet ? Rolfe . Master John Rolfe A vessel from Guiana brought to-day Despatches to the king .

When wrecked on Gallia 's coast , a woman nursed And succored me . Enslaved in Tartary , A woman freed me . In America , The Lady Pocahontas twice preserved My life at peril of her own .

Are you not wedded to Virginia 's princess ? heir to crown and lands Of Powhatan ? Rolfe , Master John Rolfe smiling . James has no cause for fear . Smith . Captain John Smith Yet be more wary in thy praise of Raleigh . Rolfe . Master John Rolfe Fool-hardy is that man , ' t is true , who thrusts Unasked opinion in the ears of those Who wish him ill ; but ' t is a coward 's heart That praises not his friend as cordially In peril as in triumph . Smith . Captain John Smith Rolfe ! thy hand !  --  Now farewell for awhile . They approach The door together . But at thy house We meet again at noon . Rolfe and Smith exeunt .

Captain John Smith We left Each other , lady , not an hour since . He tells me that to-morrow you return . You like not Britain then ? Pocahontas . Pocahontas Not like it ! Yes ! For beautiful is England ! with her groves , Her castles , palaces , and abbeys old ; Like fairy homes her vales and streams appear : Each landscape glows with history , and wears The sober perfectness of ripened age . No classic lore adorns my native land ; But rich redundant nature reigns alone . Great rivers , giant lakes , in silence sleep , And rushing torrents by their solemn voice Call man to praise his Maker . Insects steal The summer lightning there , and tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autumn forests on their leaves reflect The gorgeous colours of the setting sun , Whose throne , scarce vacant , night usurps , nor waits Strange twilight 's mournful smile : my father 's grave Will be ere long ' mid those familiar haunts . It is my home ! It is my native land ! Enter Todkill hastily , not seeing Pocahontas . Todkill . Anas Todkill Oh Captain ! Such dreadful news ! Master Rolfe has just been arrested in the street yonder ! I saw a crowd , and asked what was the matter ; the constables told me they 'd an order from the Secretary of State to take him prisoner to the Tower on a charge of treason . Pocahontas . Pocahontas The Tower ! Treason ? did my husband speak ? Todkill , Anas Todkill confused on seeing Pocahontas . No , madam  --  that is  --  he had no time  --  but he beckoned to me , and said one word  --  " Pocahontas , " and threw this to me . Takes out the chain given by Pocahontas to Rolfe . I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as much as to say  --  " I understand ; " and then the dust flew in my eyes , I suppose , for I could'nt see any more . Gives her the chain . Smith . Captain John Smith Arrested ! On what grounds ? Todkill . Anas Todkill Conspiracy with Sir Walter Raleigh to establish an independent kingdom in Virginia . That was all I could learn amidst the confusion . Pocahontas , Pocahontas gazing on the chain . This chain he 's worn Since first I gave it him . It calls me now To save him . Counsel me , what first to do . ( Placing the chain around her neck , and pressing it to her lips . ) Smith . Captain John Smith Go , seek the king , while I trace out the source Whence flows this accusation , or they soon May plot thy peril too . Pocahontas . Pocahontas Mine ! With sudden thought . Ah ! My child ! To Doctor Hunt . Master Robert Hunt Good friend , to thee I give my boy . Depart For my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , and will guard my child . At court he 's high in favour . Wilt thou go ? Hunt . Master Robert Hunt I will , dear lady , and will send to thee News of his safety . Pocahontas . Pocahontas Thanks .  --  Wilt thou , good friend , To Todkill . Bid Alice deck him for his journey ! Go ! To Todkill goes off . I dare not clasp him to my heart once more ; ' T would shake my purpose ; for I feel , I know I never shall behold my boy again ! My blessed child ! My only one ! Hunt . Master Robert Hunt Yet hope ! The clouds will break  --  the sun will shine again , For Providence is with thee . Pocahontas . Pocahontas Best of friends ! Bear to my boy my blessing and farewell . Now go ! Exit Hunt . Todkill returns . ' T is done ! Smith . Captain John Smith Rebecca ! sure thy frame Will ill support this trial . Pocahontas .

Todkill Anas Todkill advancing to meet Smith . I tell you , Captain , I see through the whole : Anas Todkill is no fool , I promise you . I traced Volday to the palace , which is , you know , hard by my house . Volday spoke to a lacquey who spurned him  --  then he offered money , and the man listened . I saw Volday give the coin and the letter . I saw the lacquey present the letter to a nobleman who was dismounting from his horse . He read the paper  --  muttered  --  " It is as I suspected , " and beckoned to one of the king 's messengers who was standing near . They went into the palace together . I dared not approach any nearer . But in a few minutes , out came the messenger and several constables . As luck would have it neighbour Newton passed me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to warn Master Rolfe ; when as I came , I found the constables here before . Who would believe so much mischief could be done into a quarter of an hour . Smith . Captain John Smith To Volday lead me first , and on my way I 'll take two trusty friends in company As witnesses . How shall we thank thy zeal ? Todkill . Anas Todkill Do n't name it . It pleases me more to serve master Rolfe , than if the king and the whole court had sat down to supper in the best room of the Arquebus . Smith . Captain John Smith I do believe it worthy friend . Lead on . Exeunt Smith and Todkill . SCENE FOURTH . Gardens of the Palace at Whitehall . Enter Charles and Anne in conversation . Charles .

Your royal father will not hear my suit , To you I come for mercy . Charles . Charles Lady speak ! But calm your grief . What would you ask ? Pocahontas . Pocahontas My life ! For in my husband 's life is mine involved . Oh ! deign to sue unto the king for him . His safety  --  nay , his life 's unjustly perilled , For he hath done no wrong . Charles . Charles Be of good cheer ; Although thy husband is arrested , yet T is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' T is like that reptile of our wilds , whose sting Is fatal ,  --  and whose rattle shrill , the knell Of him who hears . But ' t is more merciless ; Suspicion gives no warning ere it stings . Anne Queen Anne advancing to her . Hope for the best , dear lady . Pocahontas . Pocahontas Hope alone Can not obtain the boon I seek . Oh then , Kind lady , hearken to my prayer ! Mercy , The brightest gem in royal crowns , will gild Thy brow with greater lustre than the hues Of loveliness and splendour . Plead for me . Anne . Queen Anne My husband 's will I scarcely hope to change , Yet his displeasure would I risk for thee . I 'll seek him ; but I dare not promise aught . My heart 's best wish , dear stranger , goes with thee Unto my husband 's throne . Exit Anne . Charles . Charles Rebecca , yet Droop not . A trial will exonerate Thy husband . Pocahontas . Pocahontas Not if Raleigh be condemned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thou wilt be king . Then think . ( For who can read The future ! ) Clouds may dim thy reign , and woes Arise , such as crowned heads but rarely know . Should troubles swarm , and death close up thy path , The thought that thou haste'er the wretched soothed , Redressed a wrong , protected virtue  --  cheered , Sustained the weak , will more avail thee then Than all the thousands who thy crowning hail With  --  " Long live Charles the First ! " Charles . Charles Cease , lady , cease ! Thy words prophetic seem and touch my soul . Should woes like these assail my dying hour , Thy pleading voice will echo in my ear , And bid my conscience answer the appeal . Farewell . Thou hast my royal word . I 'll seek The king . If just entreaty can avail , Enforced with strongest arguments of truth , And each appeal that filial love can make , Thy husband shall be free .  --  Thou faintest ! Pocahontas . Pocahontas He supports her . Yes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'ercharged A wife , a mother , and a stranger 's thanks Call blessings on thy head ! Charles . Charles Let me lead thee First to thy friends  --  then seek my father . Come , Look cheerily ! This way .  --  We 'll save him yet . Leads her out . SCENE LAST . Master Rolfe 's house at Gravesend . The back of the stage is nearly all occupied by a large casement , which being opened , discovers a view of the banks of the Thames at Gravesend , with the George lying at anchor . Sunset . Near the window a large antique chair with cushions . Enter Todkill . Todkill . Anas Todkill I begin to find out what a clever fellow I am : Opportunity is every thing . I took the captain and his friends to that villain 's den , and then came down here to meet Captain Smith on his return . Odso ! I should like to thrash Volday myself . Enter Alice . Alice . Mistress Alice Ah , Master Anas ! Todkill . Anas Todkill What , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice What were you thinking of when I came in , clenching your fists , and looking so valiant ? Todkill . Anas Todkill Valiant ! I believe I am valiant , Mistress Todkill that is to be . Alice . Mistress Alice How came you here on such a busy day ? Who will take care of the " Arquebus ? " Todkill , Anas Todkill pompously . The " Arquebus " must take care of itself . I have had important business . I 've been rescuing the innocent , and exposing the guilty . Alice . Mistress Alice You ! mercy on the man ! Todkill . Anas Todkill At least I 've helped to do it , which is the same thing . Alice . Mistress Alice What do you mean ? Todkill . Anas Todkill I 've been assisting Captain Smith to save Master Rolfe . Alice . Mistress Alice I rejoice to hear it . No man is better able to serve a friend than Captain Smith . Such a brave  --  Todkill . Anas Todkill Brave ! truly he is . Why years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Turkish champion . Alice . Mistress Alice Was he indeed ? Todkill . Anas Todkill Yes . Master Rolfe told me . The captain not only fought one but three ; and killed them all ! and ever since , he carries their heads on his shield . I 've seen them . Alice . Mistress Alice Shuddering . Oh ! how dreadful ! Todkill . Anas Todkill Foolish woman ! not the heathen Saracens themselves . Do n't you understand ! the heads are his arms , and he 'll hand them down to posterity . He is a brave man , and so is Master Rolfe , and so am I ! Alice . Mistress Alice What , Master Anas ! you , brave ? Todkill . Anas Todkill Yes , you should have seen me in America . Nobody would believe how valiant I was there , among the wolves , and the bears , and the panthers . Alice . Mistress Alice Heaven 's mercy ! And had you the courage to fight those terrible creatures ! Todkill . Anas Todkill Courage ! Why , Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alice . Mistress Alice What dangers there are abroad ! Todkill . Anas Todkill And at home too , of another sort . Look at this villany toward Master Rolfe . Alice , have they been here to search ? Alice . Mistress Alice Yes  --  and placed huge seals on all the doors and presses . They ransacked every drawer and paper they could find , and cross-questioned me  --  Todkill . Anas Todkill Indeed ? It 's well I was not here . Alice . Mistress Alice Then they went away muttering that their search had been unsatisfactory  --  Todkill . Anas Todkill To them , which means very satisfactory to us . They found nothing . Has Lady Rebecca returned from the palace yet ? Alice . Mistress Alice No , not yet , poor lady . I know not what I shall do when she is gone . Todkill , Anas Todkill pompously . You will then be Mistress Todkill , hostess of the " Arquebus , " and will have enough to do in looking after the guests , and attending to your husband . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes my lady . Todkill . Anas Todkill Then I 'll go down to the river 's bank , and wait for news from London . Alice . Mistress Alice Bless thee , thou hast a kind heart , Anas . Todkill . Anas Todkill To be sure I have : that 's why I 'm going away now . I 've no consolation to offer the poor lady , and I 'll not stay to stare at a sorrow I ca n't relieve . Good bye Alice . Exit Todkill . Alice . Mistress Alice She comes . Alas ! how slow she moves ! Sorrow has shattered her enfeebled frame . Runs to meet her . Pocahontas is led in by Alice and Maud . Pocahontas . Pocahontas No news from Captain Smith ? Maud brings down the chair , into which they place her . Alice . Mistress Alice No , madam , none . Pocahontas . Pocahontas Nor of my child ? Alice . Mistress Alice Not yet . Pocahontas . Pocahontas I gasp ! More air Throw wide the casement ! Let me see the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cushions and supports the head of Pocahontas . Its sinking beams will cheer my dying hour : And even now in splendour of noon-day It gilds my native land . Hark ! ' t is the tramp Of horses ' feet . Run , girl , and see ! Exit Maud . My heart , Hold yet awhile . Maud re-enters with a letter . Now speak ! Maud . Maud From Doctor Hunt , This letter , madam . Gives it . Pocahontas . Pocahontas opening it eagerly and Attempting to read . Ah ! my sight is failing ,  --  I can not read it . Alice  --  Gives it to her and sinks back exhausted . Alice . Mistress Alice Reads . " Dear lady , Sir Lewis bids me say , no harm shall reach Thy boy , beneath his roof , where now we rest In safety . "  --  Pocahontas , Pocahontas having listened eagerly . Heav'n accept my thanks ! My son ! Thou'lt not forget thy mother 's fond caress ! Father and brother ,  --  are ye living yet ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My journey home will be more quickly made : I faint with weariness ! She relapses into a slumber , her attendants watching her . In the performance of this drama , the stage thus illustrates the Vision of Pocahontas . A strain of invisible music is heard , and thin clouds obscure the view from the casement . The clouds gradually disperse and discover the open sea , across which the " George " is seen to sail . This view fades and gives place to the mouth of James River with its forest , its rude fort , and wigwams . On the bank stands Powhatan , awaiting his daughter 's arrival in the ship which is seen approaching the shore . Clouds again obscure the scene , and through them a figure of Time passes , beckoning Peace who follows . The clouds partially disperse , and disclose in the distance , the form of Washington  --  the Genius of Columbia stands near him . Time hovers near , and Peace encircles with her arms the Lion and the Eagle . A mist then conceals the allegorical group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at sunset , with the " George " at anchor , as it appeared previous to the vision . The music dies away . Pocahontas Pocahontas awakes suddenly , and exclaims  --  after gazing round her  --  No , ' t is no dream ! As if endowed with temporary strength she starts up clasping her hands in thankfulness . Souls of the prophet-fathers of my race , Light from the Land of Spirits have ye sent To paint the future on my mental sight . Like the Great River of far Wester wilds , Improvement 's course , unebbing , shall flow on . From that beloved soil where I drew breath Shall noble chiefs arise . But one o'er all , By heaven named to set a nation free , I hear the universal world declare , In shouts whose echo centuries prolong , " The Father of his Country ! " O'er the path Of Ages , I behold Time leading Peace . By ties of love and language bound , I see The Island-Mother and her Giant Child , Their arms extend across the narrowing seas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prophetic enthusiasm dies away , Pocahontas sinks exhausted in the arms of her wondering attendants . Smith enters hastily . Smith . Captain John Smith Lady , hope on ! Led by an humble friend I sought the dying Switzer . By revenge And famine tortured , nature found relief In madness . Volday 's ravings soon revealed His motives , and his slanders . Witnesses With me to royal Charles have borne the news , Which long ere this is laid before the king . Pocahontas falls on her knees . I stayed not to hear more , but hastened on To bring thee hope . The women raise Pocahontas and place her in the chair . Pocahontas . Pocahontas Oh ! take my servent thanks ! The thanks of one whose name and race will die Together ! Smith . Captain John Smith No ! thy country 's sons will task The sculptor 's and the limner 's art to pay Hereafter homage to thy memory . In Britain too , whole ages hence , the tale Of Pocahontas ' noble life and death Will love and admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Pocahontas , who has exhibited all the restlessness of approaching dissolution , now exclaims , Listen ! Hark ! A murmur heard without . Alice . Mistress Alice A murmur in the hall and rapid steps . Rolfe , Master John Rolfe speaks without . Where is she ? speak ? Pocahontas , Pocahontas starting up and tottering forward . It is my husband 's voice ! Rolfe Master John Rolfe rushes in exclaiming , My wife ! Pocahontas falls in his arms . Pocahontas . Pocahontas He 's safe ! He 's here ! Rolfe . Master John Rolfe Dearest ! see , Restored to thee ! Look up ! Smith . Captain John Smith Acquitted ? Free ? Rolfe . Master John Rolfe My innocence confirmed , Prince Charles himself Brought me my prompt acquittal from the king . But say , dearest , why sink you thus ? I 'm safe . Pocahontas raises her head and gazes at him . Great Heaven ! how changed thou art ! Pocahontas . Pocahontas Our child will be Thy stay in after years . My husband ! I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so ! my wife ! my love ! Pocahontas . Pocahontas I warned thee of this parting months ago . Our peaceful lives rob death of half its sting . Extends her hand which Smith presses reverentially to his lips . She then flings her arms around Rolfe , exclaiming , Bless thee ! Sinking back in the women 's arms . Rolfe , Master John Rolfe in anguish falling on his knees . Live , Pocahontas ! Live ! Pocahontas , Pocahontas with a faint smile of joy . That name ! My own ! the first by which thou knew'st me , love ! ' T is music to my soul . Her trembling hands vainly attempt to lift the little chain from her neck . Her women raise it for her , and Pocahontas with fading sight and uncertain action at length casts it round Rolfe 's neck . I lose thee now . My eyes behold Virginia 's grassy turf  --  I hear my father  --  Husband , fare thee well . We part  --  but we shall meet  --  above ! Her right hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she dies in the arms of her women . Rolfe still remains upon his knee , clasping her hand and gazing upon her in utter despair . Smith bends over him in silence . THE END . Back matter APPENDIX . The incidents of this play are historical in their most minute details : but the unities of the stage required the condensation of events into days instead of months , and rendered several anachronisms necessary ; the reader of history will at once perceive them .
