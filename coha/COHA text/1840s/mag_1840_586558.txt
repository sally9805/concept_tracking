txt ON the opposite page is a faithful representation of the strongly marked and intellectual countenance of one who has been styled by a contemporary " the venerable patriarch of the Ohio democracy . " It presents him to the eye as he now daily appears amid the exciting scenes of the American Senate-calm , collected , and attentive , with the apparent self-possession of one not unconscious of superior strength . In briefly sketching the incidents of Judge Tappan 's life , we may dwell with more particularity upon those of his boyhood , than may be interesting to persons of mature years , but our apology must be found in the desire to furnish something that may be interesting , and perhaps useful , to the young ; and to stimulate them by a fine example to form in early life correct habits of industry and sobriety  --  to establish for their own guidance just principles of thought and action . In this republic man is born free  --  and no one has a right to consider the advantages of another superior to his own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to all , and it is the privilege of each to seek that for which nature has designed him , or to which fortune or fancy directs his attention . Whatever pursuit he may choose to prosecute , the young American knows at the outset that it is eminently his prerogative to seek the qualifications necessary to success  --  to enable him to think and act independently-either in the acquisition of wealth and honors , science or fame . No other country offers equal encouragement to individuaL effort . None can show an equal proportion of her sons who have attained eminence by dint of their own unaided exertions . No prouder proof of the virtue and value of our republican government can be furnished than this fact . Youth , therefore , is the important time to select the true path to greatness and honor . If then adopted , and pursued with perseverance and industry , without departures from private and political integrity of character , ultimate triumph never fails to crown the efforts of the young aspirant . Benjamin Tappan was born of reputable parents , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Massachusetts . He was the eldest son of a numerous family , and gave early evidence of superior capacity . Having received the usual advantages of the school education common to his native State , he was at the age of ten years , with a // view to preparation for entering Harvard College , placed in an acaden-ilcal institution , where he remained four years , profiting industriously by such opportunities as were afforded by it . But one evening overhearing a conversation between his parents , in which his father expressed doubts whether he should be able to give him a collegiate education without doing injustice to his other children , and an unwillingness to disappoint him in a matter about which he appeared so anxious , he resolved to relieve his parent from an expense which he knew would be burthensome , and the next morning informed him , that he had been reflecting upon the propriety of his entering college , and had come to the conclusion that it would be better for him to learn a trade . At this his father remonstrated , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination , and being unable to persuade him to pursue his studies , he set him at work the next day in his own shop , where for many years he had carried on the trade of a goldsmith . The strong repugnance exhibited by this instance to be burthensome to his friends , or to receive preferment at the expense of injustice to others , and the decision and firmness of character adequate to making so great a personal sacrifice , rather than deviate from what in his reflecting moments he considered just , have marked his conduct through life . A singular coincidence also renders it remarkable . His father was one of the twelve children of the Rev. Benjamin Tappan of Manchester , Mass . At the age of fourteen , for a similar cause , he left his studies and learned the trade of a goldsmith , not , it is true , in his father 's shop , but with Mr. Win . Holmes of Boston , a nephew of Dr. Benjamin Franklin , and whose daughter subsequently became his wife , and the mother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to seek other means of livelihood , he worked faithfully with his father , and at different mechanic trades , until he reached the age of twenty-one , neglecting no means of acquiring as much skill as could well be attained in so short a period by one having a natural taste for such pursuits . In addition to the business carried on in his father 's shop , at which he became one of his best workmen , he learned copper-plate engraving and printing , and without the aid of an instructor polished his own plates , printed from his own engravings , and often engraved from his own drawings - an art in which previous to his leaving school he had received so much instruction and encouragement , as to have made himself a very exact copyist . He also worked some time in manufacturing military - arms , and musical instruments , and at clock and watch-making . For instruction in the last he paid , in addition to his labor , one hundred dollars . If he could not properly be termed at twenty-one a finished workman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn his livelihood at either of them , and in some of them exhibited far more than ordinary skill . Notwithstanding his apparent devotion to the mechanic trades , // literature and science were not forgotten . Every interval between the hours of labor and rest was husbanded with care , and improvt*d in strengthening and storing a memory naturally retentive . Every book , pamphlet , and newspaper , which he could procure , was read and its contents , when thought worthy , carefully treasured up . The struggle for American Independence , then recent , had already attracted the attention of our brethren of the Eastern Continent , giving rise to new and exciting questions on that side of the Atlantic , and keeping alive in the new world the agitating topics belonging to revolutionary times . Republican France , in its efforts to throw off the unnatural yoke of an imbecile hereditary monarchy , was reduced to a mere hot-bed of faction . Torn and distracted by the bitter conflicts of party strife , by the treachery of domestic demagogues , and on all sides threatened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate of their Kings-her own people yet unprepared for a state of republican Liberty-she was still making gigantic efforts to achieve the freedom so gallantly secured to us and our posterity by the blood , fortitude , and treasure of our patriot ancestors . He was too vigilant an observer to neglect to notice the signs of the times in a manner calculated to stamp on his mind abiding impressions , decisive of his future career . Notwithstanding the awkwardness of their efforts , and the want , but ill-concealed , of those requisites which were necessary to secure permanently the noble object of their aim , he saw that the prize for which Frenchmen were contending was LIBERTY , and he sympathized with them . In America Democracy was yet in its infancy . Federal arrogance treated the name as a reproach  --  a word to denote the " simple men " and " sans-culottes , " and distinguish them from " the rich and well born ; " and the virtuous yeomanry of the Union had not yet made it so honorable by long use , that it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its name by some of the factious and bad spirits of France . This did not deter him from joining the Democratic ranks and defending their principles . He contributed to their presses , and openly united with them by joining in the supper given at the rejoicing for the recapture of Toulon from the British and Spanish combined forces . At this time he boarded in the family of an intimate friend by the name of Wadsworth , who had been advised by his physicians to take a sea voyage as the only means of relief from a serious pulmonary complaint ; but who was too feeble to undertake the voyage unattended by a friend , and unable to procure one and defray his expenses . Mr. Tappan volunteered to accompany him at his own expense , and his services were thankfully accepted . They accordingly took passage on 6oard the brig Jason , Captain Moses Tryon , * master , bound for // Barbadoes ; and after a delay of three weeks by unfavorable winds , sailed from New London in June , 1794 . Soon after they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three quadrants on board all were so out of order that a correct observation could not be made with any , within five miles , and the captain and crew knew neither the cause nor how to remedy it . His mechanical skill came here into useful play , and enabled him to heal the difficulty . On the outward voyage , he mixed with the common sailors , and shared in their labors. they welcomed him as a useful volunteer , and cheerfully instructed him in every part of their duty . Long before his return , he had so well reduced to practice the science of navigation , which he had before learned theoretically , that on the homeward voyage to New York , in which the ship touched at St. Lucie , Martinique , Eustatia , St. Thomas and Turk 's Islands , Captain Tryon surrendered his quadrant and log-book to him , and took no observation , and kept no reckoning himself . After he reached New York , he engaged a passage to Bordeaux , with a design to join the republican party in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself for the small-pox , he was advised not to risk his life at sea , as there would be no one on board capable of rendering him proper assistance , in case of sickness from that disease ; hence the voyage was abandoned , but not the intention of visiting Europe The belief that portrait painting would be more serviceable than any other pursuit , if , in the subsequent travels which he designed to prosecute , he should find himself thrown on his own resources and destitute in a foreign count ? y , induce*t him to acquire that art ; he accordingly entered the studio of Gilbert Ste*vart , 103 Stone-street , New York , and painted several months under the instruction of that eminent artist , employing his leisure hours in reading , and in occasionally assisting an apothecary as a means of defraying a small portion of his frugal expenses . By Mr. Stewart 's advice he went into the country and painted for some time , giving general satisfaction to his employers , and acquiring considerable reputation . In this excursion he formed an intimacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church at Stratford , Connecticut . With him he united in opposing the project of appropriating the proceeds of the Western Reserve lands in Ohio to the support of the church , instead of common schools , then strongly advocated by Dr. Timothy Dwight . While Mr. Baldwin wrote in prose-somewhat stimulated , perhaps , by the consciousness that if these funds were devoted to the church , the Congregational society , being the most influential , would control the money to the exclusion of the smaller societies-Mr . Tappan employed his pen in satirical poetry , and labored to produce the same result , as tending most to secure the greatest good to the greatest number . It was this union of the Democratic party with the small sects , jealous of the power and numbers of the Congregationalists , that saved to Con* // necticut her invaluable school fund in spite of the Federalists , and the eloquent preaching of Dr. Dwight . The democracy of Connecticut appreciated this service , and time has developed the importance of the triumph in such a manner , that it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorial of the contest , and continues to keep open the portals of science for the entrance of the friendless child of poverty and the orphan . From Stratford he returned to Northampton , where he spent some time , occasionally painting portraits , attending to the store of his father , now a merchant , and studying books upon Anatomy and Medicine , preparatory to engaging in practice as a physician-which he at one time contemplated . In April , 1796 , however , he contracted with the late Gideon Granger of Sufileld , Connecticut , having deter-* mined to commence the study of the Law in his office . He remained there for three years , a most laborious student . The political opinions of Mr. Granger at this period of his life are a part of his country 's history , yet they were not of a more fixed and decided cast than were the opinions of most of his students . It was at this time that the Federalists first introduced the black cockade as a badge of distinction ; and although it may not be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection which it has now attained under federal auspices , or that their presses and orators were equally skilful at slander and falsehood , yet it can hardly be denied that their conduct exhibited as much if not more personal animosity and hatred . It was then quite common for the Black Cockade gentry , as they were called , to insult personally those who would not wear their badge , particularly the young men . To prevent this , Mr. Granger 's students each procured a stout hickory cane which they always carried with them , and their example was soon followed by nearly all the Democrats of Connecticut and Massachusetts , so that in a short time the Federalists were readily distinguished by their badge , and the Democrats as readily by their hick&amp;ry walking sticks . As nature had not bestowed upon him the negative qualities requisite to glide along among such scenes as an idler or unnoticed spectator , Mr. Tappan of course soon became conspicuous , and an object of peculiar dislike and hatred to the one party , as he was of friendship and favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their disposh tion towards him , the Federal lawyers determined , if possible , to pre .. vent his admission to the bar . They had already been successful in a similar attempt upon a worthy young man in the county ot Toland , and they made the trial with him . They dared not encounter the popular odium of a rejection upon political grounds solely . The probability of arousing the indignation of the sturdy farmers of New England by such a course was too great a hazard to be risked by even the impudence of the Federal lawyers of that day . Hence an accusation was to be made which would appear to furnish a plausible pretext . flut this // was not a matter free from difficulty . His private character , integrity , and professional attainments offered no feasible point of attack , nothing upon which to found an imputation . It furnishes proud evidence of the fair character which he bore , that political malignity , with its inventive powers and multifarious means of detraction and calumny , was finally driven to the sorry impeachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge , no proof was offered but a piece of poetry originally published in the Democratic paper at Suffield , from which it was reprinted in most of the Democratic papers of the United States . It was written on the occasion of the proclamation for a fast by John Adams , dated May 23d , 1798 , which was considered by the Democrats as designed to excite our countrymen to a war with the French nation , and not from any sincere desire to worship the Almighty . Although written evidently with reference to the sentiments of that party at the time , rather than for poetical celebrity , we give it below as connected with our remarks , and in some respects explanatory of the feelings of the parties of 1798. * PSALM .

" // vict its author of sedition , but it will puzzle the uninitiated to guess out the process by which it was made proof of blasphemy . They contended that the proposal to set it to a tune commonly sung in the churches of the Congregationalists , and the intimation contained in the sixth stanza , that on that fast day the prayers of the federal clergy would be pregnant with anathemas against the French , proved the crime , because , as they very naturally alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and prayer should invariably be employed in invocations for pardon and blessings upon both friends and foes . Hence , as they sagaciously inferred , whoever encouraged its exercise in railing and cursing , blasphemed . Unfortunately for the success of this argument , the satire was well designed to prevent what they alleged it would be most likely to produce . It was an effort to strip the cloak of piety from the sanctimonious hypocrites who , under the pretended guise of religion , were inflicting deeper injury on her cause than it has ever yet received at the hands of professed infidelity . Lamentable as the fact may be , it is nevertheless true , that in the early struggles of the democracy to resist federal consolidation , and to preserve the rights reserved by the Constitution to the States and the people , they had to encounter an influence , foreign to the nature of the contest , which was thus wantonly brought into the field against them . If it was blasphemy to ridicule the federal clergy who openly appealed to religious prejudices , , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unite , To break our Fed'ral band And mar our union quite ; Their empty sound Like wind shall cease , And joy and peace Will bless the ground .

On the contrary it failed , if it was praiseworthy to hold up to scorn and contempt their hypocritical departures from the Christian 's course of practice , as prescribed in the sacred writings , and thereby to deter them from pursuing that course of conduct whose only tendency has been to bring reproach upon religion by mixing or perhaps supplanting it with the phrenzied and corrupt errors originating in violent party strife . For the correctness of our views , we may cite the extreme care with which most pious clergymen of this day labor to keep religion free and disconnected from political controversies . It is no evidence against our position that there are exceptions to this general rule , and that we occasionally discover a political priest exerting himself to blend together , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his federalism . Society now places the proper estimate upon all such divines . The sin of blasphemy could no longer be incurred by denouncing them as " wolves in sheep clothing , " nor would it be a greater offence against real religion to ridicule their pretensions to sanctity , than to affirm that of the twelve chosen disciples of our Saviour , one was found wicked t*nough to betray him . Such were the general views of the Hartford bar , particularly of Mr. Jonathan Brace , one of its oldest and most reputable members . He took the part of young Tappan , on the occasion , and declared that many of their clergy had deserved all that had been said of them , and t1*at for himself he would be proud of the authorship of that Psalm . Accordingly , with the exception of rrheo .. dore Dwight , afterwards Secretary of the Hartford Convention , and one or two similar spirits , the charges were unanimously overruled , and he was admitted as a member of the legal profession . Having become interested in a purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ohio , and settled at Ravanna in the county of Portage . There was but one white person , a Mr. Honey , residing in the country at the time . A solitary log cabin in each place then marked the sites of the flourishing cities of Buffalo and Cleveland . When we look upon Ohio as the happy abode of a million and a half of contented industrious citizens , employed in all the varied occupations of trade , manufactures , and agriculture , it is difficult to reflect upon the past , and to realize that on the 10th day of June , 1799 , his little party found its most populous portion a dense uncultivated forest , peopled only by savage men and wild beasts . The boldness of undertaking a journey with oxen on land , and in open boats along the banks of the uninhabited rivers and the lakes , without roads or bridges , and without means of obtaining subsistence , aside from that which they carried with them , it is now scarcely possible to appreciate ; yet such was his undertaking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country at that period . At Gerondaquet , in // New York , he fell in with the late David Hudson , of Hudson , Ohio , who was also on his way for the purpose of forming a settlement , and he assisted him on the journey for the sake of his company . After some days of tedious navigation up the Cayahoga River , he landed at a prairie where is now the town of Boston , in the county of Summit . There he left all his goods under a tent with one K ***** and his family to take care of them , and with another hired man proceeded to make out a road to Ravanna . There they built a dray , and with a yoke of oxen which had been driven from Connecticut river , and were found on his arrival , he conveyed a load of farming uteusils to his settlement . Returning for a second load the tent was found abandoned and partly plundered by the Indians . He soon after learned that Hudson had enticed K ***** to his own new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Tappan had agreed to give him . In removing his second load of goods one of his oxen was over-heated and died , leaving him in a vast forest , distant from any habitation , without a team , and what was still worse , with but a single dollar in money . He was noI* depressed for an instant by these untoward circumstances . He sent one of his men through the woods with a compass to Erie , in Pennsylvania , a distance of about an hundred miles , requested from Captain Lyman , the commandant of the Fort , a loan of money . At the same time he followed himself the township lines to Youngstown , where he became acquainted with Colonel James Hillman , who did not hesitate to sell him an ox , on credit ; at a fair pricean act of generosity which proved of great value , as the want of a team must have broken up his settlement . The unexpected delays upon the journey and other hindrances , prevented them from raising a crop at this season , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to depend for meat upon their skill in hunting and purchases from the Indians , and for meal upon the scanty supplies procured from Western Pennsylvania . Having set out with the determination to spend the winter , he erected a log-cabin into which himself and one Bixby , whom he had agreed to give an hundred acres of land on condition of settlement , moved on the first day of January , 1800 , before which they had lived under a bark camp and their tent . Mr. Hudson , whom'we have noticed above , also passed the winter twelve miles distant . He was a very singular character , a man of impulses , very religious and a zealous federalist . In after life he became a man of wealth , and a liberal contributor to charitable objects , and bore an ex*ellent reputation for integrity . What exhibits him as well as anything else is the fact , that at about sixty years of age he joined a masonic society , and wrote and published in a religious paper a history of the first settlement of Portage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the undertaking , giviuig himself considerable credit , with scarce an allusion to Mr. Tappan , and none that is recollected to Mr. Honey , // who had lived with a family in the town of Mantua a year before his arrival . Lest our notice of the Indian " appropriation , " should do injustice to his memory , we will mention , that in 1799 he made the following atonement : " I did wrong , Squire Tappan , in inducing K****** to break his contract with you , and I now ask your forgiveness , arid I hope God will forgive me . " The reply was characteristic : " You did a very roguish trick in getting K****** to leave my goods to be plundered by the Indians , and to break his contract with me . God will undoubtedly do what is right as to pardoning you ; but if you mean by my pardoning you that I *vi1l take K****** back again , I shall do no such thing . You thought to get an advantage by getting him from me , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of a help . This is as it should be . You have punished yourself for your ungrateful and dishonest conduct , therefore let it rest , and let us think no more about it . " In 1800 several townships in Portage county were settled , and in June of that year two Indians and a child were shot by one Joseph McMahan and a Mr. Mann , the latter being deceived by the former , who was a drunken , bad fellow . To prevent the savages from wreaking their vengeance on the innocent settlers for this wanton act , it was necessary to do them justice . By means of the influence of Col. Hillman and others , the Indians agreed to be satisfied if McMahan was indicted for murder , and tried under our laws in the same manner as if he had taken the life of a white person . A supreme court was convened at Youngstown , for this purpose in August , and he was put on trial . The Governor attended , and with the chief of the Indian tribe sat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Temple , of Pittsburg , defended the prisoner , it was the first jury trial in northern Ohio , and his first effort before a jury . His associate thought McMahan ought to be hung , and Gov . St. Clair expressed the determination that he should be , while most of the settlers thought that , right or wrong , there would be no safety for the settlements without his execution . He differed with them on the first point , and the thought that the life of a fellow being depended mainly on the efforts of an inexperienced advocate , embarrassed him so much that he was unable , when he rose to address the jury , to pronounce the few sentences of the opening part of his argument , and which he had committed to memory . The prosecutor endeavored to aid him , and whispered , " Gentlemen , I will read you the law of the case , before commenting upon the fact . " He repeated the words unconsciously after him , when his kind prompter handed him the book , and he began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally proceeded with a very able defence , and succeeded in satisfying the jury , who returned a verdjct of Not Guilty . This effort gained him a high reputation with the court and bar , placing him in the formost rank of the profession west of the Alleghanies , which rank he // has ever since maintained unimpaired for a single moment . In December of this year he visited New England , and renewed an old intimacy with Miss Nancy Wright , of Berlin , Connecticut , whom he married , and returned to Ohio in the following spling . They made this journey in a light two-horse wagon , taking with them his wife 's sister , in forty-five days . This year the people began to be dissatisfied with the Territorial government , and the sentiment was universal except with the officers . The Governor had unfortunately acquired habits and appetites unsuited to his station and salary ; to remedy the inconveniencies arising from the smallness of the latter , he required fees not warranted by law for almost every act he did . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice 's commission , which he refused-telling him he would not accept an office under a Federal Government which he was determined to change . Gov . St. Clair thanked him for his frankness , and when about to organize the militia , requested him to attend the meeting of the persons who had assembled to make out nominations for the militia officers . He accordingly attended , and found present most of the Territorial civil officers , all of whom had been appointed on the nomination of the Connecticut Land Company , and but some half-dozen others . He proposed to leave the nominations to be made by the people , when they assembled to elect a representative to the Asseinbly . To this they said they had no objection , but that Gov . St. Clair would not agree to it . He urged them to try , whereupon they appointed him a committee to wait upon the Governor and request him to adopt that course . He called upon him accordingly , and after some conversation obtained his consent , which he immediately reported to to the meeting-much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after full notice had'been given , the people met at Warren in Ohio , to make their election of militia officers ; when the rrerritorial officers , finding themselves outnumbered , withdrew and made out nominations privately . The democrats , however , proceeded to hold a regular meeting , and forwarded a list of nominees to the Governor , with an address which Mr. Tappan had prepared , and which had been offered and approved by the meeting , and signed by himself as secrel ary , and by Mr. James Kingsbury as chairman . The Governor , however , appointed the nominees which the office-holders had agreed on in their own caucus . The address was then published , and produced great political effect , laying the foundation for an organization of the present great democratic party of the State . The address was a plain-spoken , argumentative , and powerful vindication of the doctrine that governments are made for the People , and that therefore , the People 's will ought not to be set at defiance , a doctrine which , it would seem from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partisans in the elections of Philadelphia and New Jersey , the Federalists are slow to appreciate now as they // were forty years ago . Neglect of it by St. Clair roused the spirits of the settlers , and induced them to make a determined effort to relieve themselves from his government . On the 4th of July , 1801 , the democrats invited Mr. Tappan to address a public meeting at Durfield , and " to point out the advantages of a State government over the arbitrary sway of St. Clair . " He complied , and this oration was also published and circulated throughout the Territory . Such was the effect that the Delegate was instructed in the fall by all the people , with the exception of the officers , to vote for the formation of a State government , and he engaged at the election to do as instructed ; but he forfeited his pledge , and voted with the minority against calling the convention which met December , 1802 , and framed the present constitution of Ohio . Mr. Tappan was a candidate for membership ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponent , and lost his own election by one vote . He was again run and returned to the Senate in 1803 . The part which he took in the legislature of 1803 -4 was a prominent one , and has had an important influence upon the affairs of the State . The bill for the partition of real estate , which still remains the Jaw of Ohio , with very few amendments ; the bill establishing boards of county commissioners , which transferred from a court of justices styled , " the court of quarter sessions , " the important duties discharged by the board ; the bill incorporating townships ; the bill organizing the militia ; and the bill levying a tax on non-resident lands , with many others of importance , were drawn by him . The subject of taxing the lands of non-residents , was one of interest to his immediate constituents ; and notwithstanding he drew the bill and advocated its passage until it became a law , his opponents and federal colleague after his return home secretly circulated the report that he had opposed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a time , prevented his being taken up as a candidate for re-election that fall . Eventually , however , when the truth became known , it destroyed the characters of its malicious authors , and did him no further harm . In the same year he accepted a commission as aid to Major General Elijah Wadsworth , who solicited his assistance in organizing the militia . General Wadsworth had served as a captain in Col. Sheldon 's regiment of light horse during the revolutionary war , but he knew little of infantry regulations or tactics , and felt the necessity of an adviser in whom he had confidence . He was also elected a Justice of the Peace ; but he served little more than a year , as he found that from charging no fees , and being obliged from necessity to entertain suitors and witnesses when attending trials before him , it was burthensome and broke in upon his practice . In 1806 he returned with his wife and spent the summer in New England . He returned himself to Camfield , Ohio , and was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burr , who labored to engage him in the expedi ' tion then fitting out at Beaver , on the Ohio . He had been under some obligation to Colonel Burr for the part he had taken in reference to his admission to the bar , but he now suspected something wrong in his operations . He endeavored to find out what it was , but he could only learn that many persons were engaged in a military expedition to the south , and that they had collected some materials and made considerable progress in enlisting men . These facts he communicated to the Secretary of War , in Washington , while on a journey which he had occasion to take to Petersburg , Virginia , in December following , and was informed by General Dearborn that Burr 's proceed* ings were closely watched , and strongly suspected , if not fully understood . In the spring of 1809 , he removed to Steubenville , whither he had been previously called on professional business , and shortly succeeded in obtaining a good practice . In the winter 1809-10 he was employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wooster* to set aside the decision of the commissioners appointed to fix the seat of justice o* that county , who had established it at about three miles distance from its present site , and he accomplished the object without difficulty . The engagement , hoWever , took him to Chilicothe during the session of the Legistature , before whom a very interesting question arose , in which he took part , and which has often been the subject of much comment and not a little misrepresentation . It grew out of this provision of the State Constitution : " The judges of the Supreme Court , the president , and the associatbs of the Common Pleas , shall he appointed by a joint ballot of both Houses of the General Assembly , and shall hold their offices for the term of seven years , if ed long they behave well . The judges of the Supreme Court , and the presidents of the Courts of Common Pleas , shall , at stated times , receive for their services an adequate compensation , to be flied by law , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The period was approaching when the first term of seveA years from the appoin*ments of judges in 1803 , was about to expire , and it was agitated whether the Constitution fixed a septennial term for the service of the judges , or whether each judge was entitled to serve seven years from the day of his appointment . In favor of the former construction , it was urged that the Constitution should be so construed as to give effect to every part of it , in accordance with the will and intent of its framers , provided it were possible , and that the will and intent could be fairly inferred from the language employed . It was urged that the natural import of the words supported this view , and that it was very evident that the makers of the Constitution intended to put it in the power of the Legislature to reduce the salaties of the judges at some time , should they consider it expedient . Was this power intended to operate on the whole of the judges , at the same time , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vIt . NO. xxx. - JUNE , 1840 . J* L // ferent periods , as they might come into office to fill vacancies caused by death , or resignations of preceding incumbents ? It was urged , that if the salaries were raised , the Constitution contemplated they should all be raised at once , whenever the necessity arose , and not periodically , and in future , as the jadges in office should go out , and new ones come in , and that in no other way could that part of the instrument be carried into effect , but by the Legislature exercising the power of reducing the salaries of all the judges at the same time . On the other hand , it was contended , that the difficulty of reducing the salaries was merely imaginary , for a law could be passed , providing that the salaries of each of the judges should be reduced from and after the expiration of the respective terms for which they had been severally elected . Pending the discussion , the Democratic members of the Legislature held a private meeting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judges of the Supreme Court , and Mr. Tappan , were present by invitation Edward Tiffin , speaker of the House of Representatives , took the chair . After some discussion , Mr. Tappan drew the form of a joint resolution of both Houses , declaring his opinion of the true meaning of the Constitution , and resolving to proceed on a given day to elect all the judges of the Supreme Court , which he handed to Judge Morris , who read it , and informed the meeting that it expressed what he believed to be the true meaning of the Constitution , and that any other construction would violate the instrument . On taking a vote , it was determined almost unanimously , that it should be offered in the Assembly . It was offered , and passed both Houses . New judges were accordingly elected , who quietly discharged their duties . It was , however , stigmatized as the sweeping resolution ' and an outrage upon the Constitution ; and such was the influence of the Federalists , that all subsequent elections have been held in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The summer of 1811 was spent in a visit to New England on account of the ill health of Mrs. Tappan . War having broken out with England in 1812 , he received by express , on the 20th of August , an order from Maj. Gen. Wadsworth giving an account of Hull 's surrender at Detroit , with intelligence that the British and Indians were advancing in force down the Lake , committing great depredations , and directing him to muster the drafts in the brigade composed of Harrison and Jefferson counties , and march them with all possible despatch to Cleveland . This order was received on Sabbath morning , and notice was given to all parts of the brigade to rendezvous forthwith at Steubenville , armed and equipped for service . The men assembled , but without arms , accoutrements , or camp equipage . He went to work to provide for them by collecting arms , and employing gunsmiths in repairing them ; purchasing sheet iron and setting tinners at mannfacturing camp kettles ; and collecting ammunition , tents , and provisions // for forty days ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on the Friday succeeding the day of receiving the order , the men were marched out of Steubenville completely armed and equipped for service . At Canton he met the militia under Gen. Beall , and immediately pu8hed on to Cleveland to join the Major General , leaving the troops under the command of Col. Andrews , who was ordered to move on to Mansfield  --  the General himself , with about 1000 men , intending to march to Sandusky by the way of the Portage , to avoid exposure on the Lake shore . The mode of supplying the troops was by contract . The contractors for furnishing subsistence were Mr. Porter , father of the present Senator of Michigan , and a Mr. Tupper , his partner and active agent . Gen. Wadsworth 's command was but ill supplied , and his first care was to obtain provisions . For this purpose requisitions were made under an agreement with Mr* Tupper so that there might be no failure . They were , however , delayed on this account , and as no movement could be made in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new system of tactics , as he was the only officer in camp who knew anything about it , the others adhering to the plan of Steuben . He was far from being capable of giving accurate instructions , having derived his knowledge entirely from books , which a few years previous he had studied in company with his friend and neighbor , COL . JOHN MILLER , at present a Representative in Congress from Missouri  --  the same officer who made the brilliant sortie from Fort Meigs , which will be recollected as the proudest incident in the defence of that Fort , and who , during the whole of the late war , was one of the best jleld officers , and most gallant leaders of a regiment , that the North Western army contained . In spite of the disadvantages under which Mr. Tappan labored , he went to work , and with the aid of diagrams eventually succeeded in very much improving the drill manwuvres of the troops . A deposite of provisions had been ordered to be made at the Portage , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the encampment ; and after making out the ground to return to Jefferson county , and muster and march into service a new draft of three hundred men . In obedience to this order he selected the ground for the encampment , in doing which he was taken sick ; but , notwithstanding , he returned to Steubenville , ordered out the militia , and provided them with arms and camp equipage from Pittsburg , in Pennsylvania , but he was confined to his bed with a fever and unable to march with them into camp . He had , in the capacity of aide-de-camp , prepared all the orders of the Major General , and drawn up all his despatches , so that the General found it extremely inconvenient to be deprived of his services , and sent three expresses in succession to hasten his return . As soon as he was able to sit on horseback , contrary to the advice of his physicians , who told him it would cost him his life , he was helped upon his horse , and rode sixteen miles the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to stand when he dismounted , but being in good quarters , he recruited so much as to be able the next day to renew the journey and increase the distance . On his arrival at Camp Avery , he found everything in confusion and excitement . Gen. Beall had been put on trial , by Court Martial , for disobedience of orders , and he was directed to assume immediately the duties of Judge Advocate and conduct the proceedings . The charges exhibited had been so imperfectly drawn up as not to present the offence which the facts would have best sustained , and he was acquitted . It was but a few days before this , that Gen. Harrison , who commanded the N. W. army , visited the camp , and having formed th' troops , consisting of about 1500 inexperienced militia , into a hollow square , made a speech , telling them , among other encouraging topics , that they should eat their next Christmas dinner in Maiden . A few days afterward , an express arrived with a letter from Gen. Harrison , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be 1500 or 2000 bushels , of corn standing in the field at Maume* . As it was extremely desirable that it should be saved for the use of the army , and there was reason to fear , if immediate measures were not taken to secure it , the British and Indians would appropriate the whole to their own use , he concluded with an order to detach five hundred men to gather and secure the corn . Maj. Gen. Wadsworth promptly convened his general and field officers , and laid the letter before them . They all advised sending the detachment forthwith , when Gen. Wadsworth called for the opinion of Mr. Tappan . He said , that as General Harrison had visited the camp recently , he presumed that he was well acquainted with the material in possession of that wing of the army ; and that while there he had called for , and taken with him , full returns of their arms , ammunition , and camp equipage and provisions . Gen. Wadsworth observed that such returns were made out in expectation that he would call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the returns were not offered to him , and that he went away from the right wing of the army with as little knowledge of its military means as he had before he came there . He expressed his surprise at this , produced the returns , and laid them before the council , They proved that the means of issuing one day 's rations to the 500 troops were not in camp . He stated that it was five days ' march for well provided troops to Maumee , and he thought with only one day 's provisions it would be impossible to march the 500 men there , and give them time to secure the corn and return , which wonld require at least fifteen days ; so that compliance with Gen. Harrison 's order was out of the question . Such was the unanimous opinion of the council , and an express was sent to Gen. Harrison , informing him of what , if he had paid any attention to his duty , he would have known before , the inability of the Major General *o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the army was at // this time strong enough to have taken Maiden , if the contractor had supplied it with provisions at the different depots . As it was , the greatest exertions were necessary to keep the army from disbanding . In December General Wadsworth gave up the command to his successor , and Mr. Tappari returned home with him , and resumed his very lucrative practice . While thus engaged , and unknown to him , he was taken up as the Democratic candidate , and on joint-ballot of the Legislature of 1815-16 , elected President-judge of the fifth circuit , in which office he served the constitutional term of seven years . When his judicial term of office was about to expire he was in Columbus , attending the duties of Canal Commissioner , to which office he had been appointed in January , 1821 . Jeremiah Hallack then represent*d Jefferson county , and was anxious to be elected President of the Common Pleas ; to secure this , he proposed Mr. Tappan , a few days before the election , for the Judge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Tappan opposed , assuring his Democratic friends , who were in a minority , that Hallack and his particular friends could not be depended on , and they would fail . A meeting was , however , held the evening before the election , at the instance of Hallack , in which he and his friends pledged themselves to vote for him , which would give him sixty . votes , fifty-five being sufficient to elect , and the Democrats agreed to support Hallack for his station . This was reported to him , when he told them to adhere to their agreement , for he had no objection to return to the bar , but they would find that he should get just thirty-six votes ( the number of Democrats ) and no morewhich proved true the next day . As a judge no man could have acted more impartially , or devoted himself to his duties more patiently , and he retired from the bench with the reputation of an excellent jurist and upright judge . When he went upon the bench he kept minutes of his decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not decide questions of practice different ways . His minutes were sometimes full reports of the cases . After a while the bar requested their pub lication , and raised by subscription nearly enough to defray the expense . They were published in a book entitled " Tappan 's Reports , " and were well received by the profession generally . This was the first book of Law Reports published in Ohio , and is a work which , under any circumstances , would do no discredit to * lawyer ; for it exhibits evidence of a mind well informed in the earning to be derived from study , and perfectly familiar with the fundamental principles of right and wrong , and the reasons upon which those principle are founded , and which alone give them any vitality . But it is not merely as an ordinary book of reports that his work should be viewed . Unlike most reports of decisions which are made up at leisure after the ablest talents of the bar have exhausted the subject by collecting all tbe settled decisions relating to it , arranging them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and // bearings in reference to the point at issue-this book records simply the decisions upon points of practice , and the various questions growing out of new and unexpounded legislative enactments , frequently determined without argument , or if argued , often done by men relying upon the industry and learning of the judge , without feeling the necessity of taking much trouble to investigate the origin of the statute , and to search out the former evils of the old law and explain their mischiefs , in aid of the jurist upon whom they called for a correct exposition and application of the remedy . It is simply a book of the decisions of a nisi prius court , composed of one judge , ( as to all legal questions , ) with a jurisdiction more onerous , in a professional sense , than that of any other court known to the Anglo-American system of law ; for it embraces not only the whole range of Common Law , Chancery , Criminal , and Probate jurisdiction , but also Writs of Error and appeals from Magistrates , County Commissioners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers in many cases , to which is superadded the duty of licensing Inn-keepers , Grocers , Auctioneers , &amp;c . It was under such disadvantages , in a new State , when , in 1819 , good libraries and leisure to examine them were very unusual occurrences , that this work was prepared . During his judicial term Congress chartered the Bank of the United States , and branches were established at Chilicothe and Cincinnati , which put in circulation great quantities of paper in the form of checks on the mother bank and branches . Being substantially endorsed by the Government of the United States , which was a stockholder , and compelled to receive its notes in payment of lands , revenue , and postages , this paper at once obtained , with the people of Ohio and the local banks , a credit equal to the Treasury notes of the present day . But being issued without an adequate specie basis , these checks operated as so many loans by which specie was collected from the western country to meet the emergencies growing out of the bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect this species of loans , by means of Bank notes and checks , was most pemicious . The legislation which controlled the amount to be put into circulation and the manner of doing it , instead of being open , and sanctioned with all the forms and publicity of an act of Congress , was the secret work of a board of directors , or possibly of one man , at Philadelphia ; and the only knowledge which the people could procure of its nature had to be derived from watching its disastrous consequences . Mr. Tappan had always denied the constitutionality of the law creating the institution ; had predicted in advance the mischiefs which it finally produced ; and though an uniform supporter of President Madison , pronounced him derelict in duty , and a deserter from the principles which brought him into power , for having approved the act of incorporation . The immense quan // tity of bills issued between 1816 and 1819 being thrown out at the most convenient points , irregularly , gave a new and wild impulse to all kinds of business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the latter of whom always considered themselves following a safe precedent when treading in its footsteps , although unarmed with the treasures of the nation , and unable to wield its power  --  and what was for them still worse , finding too late that both the nation 's wealth and power were in the control of their stronger , not more honest neighbor , and could at any moment be employed to crush them . The process was simple . When pay day came round , the bills of the local banks , which had accumulated at the branch banks in receipts " to the special credit of the United States , " were returned in large quantities and specie demanded to meet the wants of the mother bank ; and but three of the local banks of the State  --  and they only from fortuitous and lucky causes-were able to endure the unnatural and nefarious ordeal . It was a struggle for life between the greater and the lesser institutions , and the wealth and power of the Union was amply sufficient to turn the scale against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect was sudden , and more disastrous than sudden-for industry was robbed of its hard earnings  --  the local paper fell from a trifling depreciation to total worthlessness , in less than four years after it  --  and property of the most substantial value in many instances fell in proportion of from fifteen to one . For a time after this general suspension and breaking of the banks , and the universal ruin which flowed in its train , the great engine and main instrument , which led them on in their reckless career , and finally worked their destruction , was lauded in no measured terms by all its former friends , and by not a few of its natural enemies , the Democrats . But the disclosure of its management by committees of Congress awakened the attention of the State to the truth , and in 1819-20 a law was passed , with but a few dissenting votes , authorizing the levy of a heavy tax , withthe avowed object of driving the branches from the State . The tax was levied in obedience to it . The officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ultimately the law was pronounced unconstitutional . The people of Ohio were nearly unanimous in the opinion , and conscientiously believed in their right to enforce the tax ; yet , as the idea was encouraged that in a few years the charter would expire , when a peaceable remedy would be in their power , by resistance to its renewal , they acquiesced in the decision so far at least as to offer no direct indignity to the Court ; and contented themselves with ridiculing the notion put forth by one of its members , that if Congress considered it necessary for " the general welfare " to charter a bank , they had the constitutional power to do so , and that of this necessity they had sole jurisdiction to decide . The people of Ohio very naturally replied , that if this argument was sound , the instrument was at once divested of one of the essential requisites of a law ; that it could // not be an uniform , permanent , unvarying rule , at all times meaning one and the same thing ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of re* ceiving a new impression from each successive keeper ; that the Hamiltonian Federalists , if in power , would exercise their discretion , and find a bank a necessary means to carry into effect some expressly delegated power , when it would of course be constitutional , and that a Congress of opposite opinions might decide the other way , when , by the same process of reasoning , it would be unconstitutional ; and by thus reasoning , so far being alawp aramount to all others . The Constitution of the United States would be no better than th4 beau-ideal of ancient Federalism , the unwritten Constitution of England-enabling the Federalists by carrying out the same latitudinous mode of construction to accomplish their original object of establishing a central , consolidated government . The bill for taxing the bank was drawn by an eminent lawyer and Federalist  --  the late Charles Hammond , and submitted to Mr. Tappan before it was reported to the Assembly . He advised him to amend it in the Committee , and expressed the opinion that it contained features which were penal itt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a court could not sustain ; and for this once at least " the ultra radical " had for a time to bear , in the estimation of his Federal friends , the odium of being a little too conservative and impracticable , although he at all times strenuously maintained the right of the State to levy an uniform tax upon all property found or cmployed within her territorial limits  --  the stock of the bank not excepted ; and that the taxing power was a sovereign right , and never could be presumed to be , as in fact it never had been , surrendered . A change of pieces on the political chess-board subsequently placed him in opposition to all of these over-zealous protectors of State Rights , who accused him of timidity on this most exciting question , without his having in the least varied from his original position ; so that when he introduced , in the State convention which nominated the late President for the first ofilce in the nation , a resolution declaring that the Bank of the United States was inexpedient and unconstitutional , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require that that institution should not be rechartered , " which was passed almost by acclamation , and became the polar star of that subsequent contest in which the Democratic party rallied to the tescue under " the most remarkable man of the age , " it was denounced as dangerous , uncalled for , and tevolutionary in its character , and , above all , as capable of destroying the party to which he belonged by loading it with a weight under which it could never rise . He had anticipated the possibility of its bringing an unnatural weight* the weight of money , to bear in the balance , and took the proper precaution in time . As early as Decembcr* // of the party for the Presidency-alluding to the probable questions that the contest would present , and expressing the belief that there was no other around whom in that emergency the Democracy of the TJriion would rally with equal confidence , and that the motives which influenced them were founded in the purest patriotism and a deep sense of public duty , in view of the expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State Legislature , and transmitted in a letter by him on the 24th of January , 1831 . It was made to one who never proved recreant to the call of his country , and who replied on the 9th of February , 1831 , that notwithstanding his anxious wish to retire , and the recommendations he had made to amend the Constitution so as to give the people a direct vote in the choice of President , limiting his office to one term , he still felt it to be his duty to yield his personal wishes to what might be the voice of his countrymen . His support , however , was not the result of blind devotion to the man . Though personally friendly , and a supporter of General Jackson even before the nomination by the Legislature of Tennessee , which course he had suggested the summer previous to two of its members , Mr. Tappan had firmness enough to warn his friends who assembled at the Democratic State convention against too broad a sanction of the doctrines of the celebrated South Carolina Proclamation , telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probably of defeating for a time , his election to a high office for which he was then a candidate , that it would not do to be led by their enthusiasm for a man into a departure from their established principles , and to beware how they adopted doctrines which in the mouths of popular Democrats met the cordial responses of time-worn Federalists . It will be remembered that the late President explained , in September following , the remarks of the Proclamation which favored consolidation and made it acceptable to the Federal party . In the spring of 1821 , he accompanied his wife to Hartford , Connecticut , to obtain , medical assistance for her relief from a cancer ; which was removed , with some hopes of a permanent cure ; but in the summer of 1822 , it renewed its attack and in a few weeks carried her to the grave . He has since married a second time , and has again recently met with a similar loss , his late wife having died very suddenly on the 14th of June , 1840 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he went on an exploring tour with Judge Geddes , of New York , by way of the waters of Black River , Chippewa Lake , the Portage , and Congress ponds , to the Cuyahoga rapids , for the purpose of ascertaining the difference between the levels of the Black River summit and those east of it , and to determine whether a canal could be made through the valley of the Cuyahoga and little Beaver Rivers , connecting Lake Erie and the Ohio above the mouth of the Muskingum . His duties as Canal Commissioner compelled him from this Lt 2 // time to spend a part of every winter at Columbus , until 1836 ; when , on his own suggestion , the Canal Board was superseded by the establishment of the Board of Public Works , and he retired from the service of the State . The Ohio Canal , connecting the Ohio and Lake Erie with its feeders , and that part of the Miami Canal from Cincinnati to Dayton , making together over four hundred miles of internal water communication , were begun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of something more than five millions of dollars . There has scarcely been constructed , either in the United States or elsewhere , a work of similar extent and character that has added more to the credit and prosperity of the people engaged in the enterprise , and no where one that displayed equal energy and economy in those to whose capacity and faithfulness it wa* confided . It is not our object , however , to speak at length of these things . The beneficial result arising from the Ohio Canal can not be stated in a few lines , and , indeed , time has not yet fully developed them . His part in the transaction was conspicuous and important throughout . He was ever ready to advise and di*ide responsibility with his able associates . Amid his various occupations , he found leisure also to attend to the cause of science ; and drew up and procured the passage of the act incorporating the Historical and Philosophical Society of Ohio , and for several years held the highly honorable station of its presiding officer . H* inaugural address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of president , was a fine production , explaining in a luminous manner the objects of its formation , and , with the first circular addressed by him to the young men of the State , very much tended to enlist public attention , and advance the laudable objects of the institution . An admirer of nature as well as a lover of polite learning , he has found many leisure hours to devote to their study and encouragement . The western woods and the different western waters are peopled with countless varieties of the animal and vegetable creations , and the country is rich in mineral productions ; while the kingdoms of birds and plants , of fishes and insects , have been left to be explored by others , he has made himself familiar with the numerous specimens of shells and fossils . rrhe scientific periodicals of the country have received some able contributions from his pen , upon the geology and conchology of Ohio , which have added to the general science of the country , and attracted some attention from men of learning in foreign countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Journal of Science , " accompanied by drawings , are his productions.
