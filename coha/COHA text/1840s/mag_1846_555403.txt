txt A FEW year 's ago it seemed probable that the people of the United States would be supplied with news chiefly through the agency of newspapers published in the city of New York . We were threatened with a paper despotism similar to that formerly exercised in Great Britain by the London Times ; since , when one city furnishes a country with newspapers , one newspaper is sure , at length , to gain such a predominance over others // that its proprietor , if he is equal to his position , wields a power greater than ought to be intrusted to an individual . There have been periods when the director of the London Times am peared to be as truly the monarch of Great Britain as Henry VIII . once was , or as William Pitt during the Seven Years ' War . It was , we believe , the opinion of the late Mr. Cobden , which Mr. Kinglake confirms , that the editor of the London Times could have prevented the Crimean War . Certainly he conducted it . Demosthenes did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than did this invisible and anonymous being those of the British empire against Russia . The first John Walter , who was to journalism what James Watt was to the steam-engine , had given this man daily access to the ear of England ; and to that ear he addressed , not the effusions of his own mind , but the whole purchasable elo-. quence of his country . He had relays of Demosthenes . The man controlling such a press , and fit to control it , can bring the available and practised intellect of his country to bear upon the passions of his countrymen ; for it is a fact , that nearly the whole literary talent of a nation is at the command of any honorable man who has money enough , with tact enough . The editor who expends fifty guineas a day in the purchase of three short essays can have them written by the men who can do them best . What a power is this , to say these things every morning to a whole nation , - to say them with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give , - and to say them without audible contradiction ! Fortunate for England is it that this power is no longer concentrated in a single man , and that the mighty influence once wielded by an individual will henceforth be exerted by a profession . We in America have escaped all danger of ever falling under the dominion of a paper despot . There will never be a Times Jupiter in America . Twenty years ago the New York news and the New York newspaper reached distant cities at the same moment ; but since the introduction of the telegraph , the news outstrips the newspaper , and is given to the public by the local press . It is this fact which forever limits the circulation and national importance of the New York press . The New York // 1866 . The New York Herald . papers reach a village in Vermont late in the afternoon ,  --  six , eight , ten hours after a carrier has distributed the Springfield Republican ; and nine people in ten will be content with the brief telegrams of the local centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours behind the news ; and at San Francisco , thirty days . Before California had been reached by the telegraph , the New York newspapers , on the arrival of a steamer , were sought with an avidity of which the most ludicrous accounts have been given . If the news was important and the supply of papers inadequate , nothing was more common than for a lucky newsboy to dispose of his last sheets at five times their usual price . All this is changed . A spirited local press has anticipated the substance of the news , and most people wait tranquilly for the same local press to spread before them the particulars when the tardy mail arrives . Even the weekly and semi-weekly editions issued by the New York daily press have probably reached their maximum of importance ; since the local daily press also publishes weekly and semi-weekly papers , many of which are of high excellence and are always improving , and have the additional attraction of full local intelligence . If some bold Yankee should invent a method by which a bundle of newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour , it would certainly enhance the importance of the New York papers , and diminish that of the rapidly expanding and able press of Chicago . Such an invention is possible ; nay , we think it a probability . But even in that case , the local news , and , above all , the local advertising , would still remain as the basis of a great , lucrative , honorable , and very attractive business . We believe , however , that if the local press were annihilated , and this whole nation lived dependent upon the press of a single city , still we should be safe from a paper despotism ; because the power of the editorial lessens as the intelligence of the people increases . The prestige of the editorial is gone . Just as there is a party in England who propose the omission of the sermon from the church service as something no longer needed by the people , so there are journalists who thiiik the time is at hand for the abolition of editorials , and the concentration of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history and picture of the day . The time for this has not come , and may never come ; but our journalists already know that editorials neither make nor mar a daily paper , that they do not much influence the public mind , nor change many votes , and that the power and success of a newspaper depend wholly and absolutely upon its success in getting and its skill in exhibiting the news . The word newspaper is the exact and complete description of the thing which the true journalist aims to produce . The news is his work ; editorials are his play . The news is the point of rivalry ; it is that for which nineteen twentieths of the people buy newspapers ; it is that which constitutes the power and value of the daily press ; it is that which determines the rank of every newspaper in every free country . No editor , therefore , will ever reign over the United States , and the newspapers of no one city will attain universal currency . Hence the importance of journalism in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it usually has a daily paper , and in most large cities there is a daily paper for every twenty thousand people . In many of the Western cities there are daily newspapers conducted with great energy , and on a scale of expenditure which enables them to approximate real excellence . Many of our readers will live to see the day when there will be in Chicago , St. Louis , New Orleans , Cincinnati , and San Francisco daily newspapers more complete , better executed , and produced at greater expense than any newspaper now existing in the United States . This is a great deal to say , in view of the fact , that , during the late war , one of the New York papers expended in war correspondence alone two thousand dollars a week . Nevertheless , we believe it . There will never be two newspapers in any one city that can sustain such an expenditure ; but in fifteen years from to-day there will be one , we think , in each of our great cities , and besides that one there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as one or two having humbler aims and . eonteiit with a lowlier position . It is plain that journalism will henceforth and forever be an important and crowded profession in the United States . The daily newspaper is one of those things which are rooted in the necessities of modern civilization . The steam-engine is // not more essential to us . The newspaper is that which connects each individual with the general life of mankind , and makes him part and parcel of the whole ; so that we can almost say , that those who neither read . newspapers nor converse with people who do read them are not members of the human family ; - that is , not actually , not now ; though , like the negroes of Guinea , they may become such in time . They are beyond the pale ; they have no hold of the electric chain , and therefore do not receive the shock . There are two mornings of the year on which newspapers have not hitherto been published in the city of New York , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A shadow appears to rest on the world during those days , as when there is an eclipse of the sun . We are separated from our brethren , cut off , lost , alone ; vague apprehensions of evil creep over the mind . We feel , in some degree , as husbands feel who , far from wife and children , say to themselves , shuddering , " What things may have happened , and I not know it ! " Nothing quite dispels the gloom until the Evening Post - how eagerly seized - assures us that nothing very particular has happened since our last . It is amusing to notice how universal is the habit of readihg a morning paper . A hundred vehicles and vessels convey the business men of New York to that extremity of Manhattan Island which may be regarded as the countinghouse of the Western Continent . It is not uncommon for every individual in a cabin two hundred feet long to be sitting absorbed in his paper , like boys conning their lessons on their way to school . Still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down town , many of them reading as they go , and most of them provided with a newspaper for dinner-time , not less as a matter of course than the tin kettle which contains the material portio*i of the repast . Notice , too , the long line of hackney-coaches on a stand , nearly every driver sitting on his box reading his paper . Many of our Boston friends have landed in New York at five o'clock in the morning , and ridden up town in the street cars , filled , at that hour , with women and boys , folding newspapers and throwing off bundles of them from time to time , which are caught by other boys and women in waiting . Carriers are flitting in // every direction , and the town is alive with the great business of getting two hundred thousand papers distributed before breakfast . All this is new , but it is also permanent . Having once had daily papers , we can never again do without them ; so perfectly does this great invention accord with the genius of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous improvement for a long time to come ; the newspapers of the future will be more convenient , and better in every way , than those of the present day ; but the art remains forever an indispensable auxiliary to civilization . And this is so , not by virtue of editorial essays , but because journalism brings the events of the time to bear upon the instruction of the time . An editorial essayist is a man addressing men ; but the skilled and faithful journalist , recording with exactness and power the thing that has come to pass , is Providence addressing men . The thing that has actually happened , - to know that is the beginning of wisdom . All else is theory and conjecture , which may be right and may be wrong . While it is true that the daily press of the city of New York is limited by the telegraph , it has nevertheless a very great , an unappioached , national importance . We do not consider it certain that New York is always to remain the chief city of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must for many years . Besides being the source of a great part of our news , it was the first city that afforded scope for papers conducted at the incredible expense which modern appliances necessitate . Consequently its daily papers reach the controlling minds of the country . They are found in all reading-rooms , exchanges , bank parlors , insurance-offices , counting*rooms , hotels , and wherever else the ruling men of the country congregate . But , above all , they are , and must be , in all newspaper offices , subject to the scissors . This is the chief source of their importance . Not merely that in this way their contents are conimunicated to the whole people . The grand reason why the New York papers have national importance is , that it is chiefly through them that the art of journalism in the United States is to be perfected . They set daily copies for all editors to follow . The expenditure necessary for the carrying on of a complete // daily newspaper is so immense , that the art can only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the field ; it has the start of a quarter of a century or more ; and it therefore devolves upon the journalists of that city to teach the journalists of the United States their vocation . It is this fact which invests the press of New York with such importance , and makes it so well worth considering . It is impossible any longer to deny that the chief newspaper of that busy city is the New York Herald . No matter how much we may regret this fact , or be ashamed of it , no journalist can deny it . We do not attach much importance to the fact that Abraham Lincoln , the late lamented President of the United States , thought it worth while , during the dark days of the summer of 1864 , to buy its support at the price of the offer of the French mission . He was utterly mistaken in supposing that this paper had any considerable power to change votes ; which was shown by the result of the Presidential election in the city of New York , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Influence over opinion no paper can have which has itself no opinion , and cares for none . It is not as a vehicle of opinion that the Herald has importance , but sorely as a vehicle of news . It is for its excellence , real or supposed , in this particular , that eighty thousand people buy it every morning . Mr. Lincoln committed , as we can not help thinking , a most egregious error and fault in his purchase of the editor of this paper , though he is in some degree excused by the fact that several leading Republicans , who were in a position to know better , advised or sanctioned the bargain ; and leading journalists agreed not to censure it . Mr. Lincoln could not be expected to draw the distinction between the journalist and the writer of editorials . He perceived the strength of this carrier-pigeon 's pinions , but did not note the trivial character of the message tied to its leg . Thirty or forty war correspondents in the field , a circulation larger than any of its rivals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times , the popularity of the paper in the army , the frequent utility of its maps and other elucidations , these things imposed upon his mind ; and his wife could tell him from personal observation , that the proprietor of this // paper lived in a style of the most profuse magnificence , - maintaining costly establishments in town and country , horses , and yachts , to say nothing of that most expensive appendage to a reigning house , an heir apparent . Our friends in the English press tell us , that the Herald was one of the principal obstacles in their attempts to guide English opinions aright during the late struggle . Young men in the press would point to its editorials and say : " This is the principal newspaper in the Northern States ; this is the Times of America ; can a people be other than contemptible who prefer such a newspaper as this to journals so respectable and so excellent as the Times and Tribune , published in the same city ? " " As to ( American ) journalism , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always kept before our eyes . " That is to say , the editorial articles in the Herald ; not that amazing variety and fulness of intelligence which often compelled men who hated it most to get up at the dawn of day to buy it . A paper which can detach two or three men , after a battle , to collect the names of the killed and wounded , with orders to do only that , can not lack purchasers in war time . Napoleon assures us that the whole art of war consists in having the greatest force at the point of contact . This rule applies to the art of journalism ; the editor of the Herald knows it , and has the means to put it in practice . Even here , at home , we find two opinions as to the cause of the Herald 's vast success as a business . One of these opinions is this ,  --  the Herald takes the lead because it is such a bad paper . The other opinion is , - the Herald takes the lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly important to know which of these two opinions is correct ; or , in other words , whether it is the Herald 's excellences as a newspaper , or its crimes as a public teacher , which give it such general currency . Such success as this paper has obtained is a most influential fact upon the journalism of the whole country , as any one can see who looks over a file of our most flourishing daily papers . It is evident that our daily press is rapidly becoming Heraldized ; and it is well known that the tendency of imitation is to reproduce all of the copy excepting alone that which made it worth copying . It is honorable to the American press that . // this rule has been reversed in the present instance . Some of the more obvious good points of the Herald have become universal , while as yet no creature has been found capable of copying the worst of its errors . If there are ten bakers in a town , the one that gives the best loaf for sixpence is sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may puff up his loaves to a great size , by chemical agents , and so deceive the public for a time ; another may catch the crowd for a time by the splendor of his gilt sheaf , the magnitude of his signs , and the bluster of his advertising ; and the intrinsically best baker may be kept down , for a time , by want'of tact , or capital , or some personal defect . But let the competition last thirty years ! The gilt sheaf fades , the cavities in the big loaf are observed ; but the ugly little man round the corner comes steadily into favor , and all the town , at length , is noisy in the morning with the rattle of his carts . The particular caterer for our morning repast , now under consideration , has achieved a success of this kind , against every possible obstacle , and under every possible disadvantage . He had no friends at the start , he has made none since , and he has none now . He has ha* the support of no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won his object in spite of the active opposition of almost every organized body in the country , and the fixed disapproval of every public-spirited human being who has lived in the United States since he began his career . What are we to say of this ? Are we to say that the people of the United States are competent to judge of bread , but not of newspapers ? Are we to say that the people of the United States prefer evil to good ? As good democrats we can not assent to such propositions . Let us go back to the beginning , and see how this man made his way to his present unique position . We owe his presence in this country , it seems , to Benjamin Franklin ; and he first smelt printer 's ink in Boston , near the spot where young Ben Franklin blackened his fingers with it a hundred years before . Born and reared on the northeastern coast of Scotland , in a Roman Catholic family of French origin , he has a French int4lect and Scotch habits . Frenchmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be odious , so French // is he . A French naval officer was once remonstrated with for having invited him to a ball given on board a ship of war in New York harbor . " Why , what has he done ? " inquired the officer . " Has he committed murder ? Has he robbed , forged , or run away with somebody 's wife ? " " No . " " Why then should we not invite him ? " " He is the editor of the New York Herald . " " Ah ! " exclaimed the Frenchman , - " the Herald ! it is a delightful paper , - it reminds me of my gay Paris . " This , however , was thirty years ago , when Bennett was almost as French as Voltaire . He was a Frenchman also in this : though discarding , iu his youth , the doctrines of his Church , and laughing them to scorn in early manhood , he still maintained a kind of connection with the Catholic religion . The whole of his power as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that are good , and of the falsehood in things that are true , and of the ridiculous in things that are important . He began with the Roman Catholic Church , - " the holy Roman Catholic Church , " as he once styled it , - adding in a parenthesis , " all of us Catholics are devilish holy . " Another French indication is , that his early passions were romantic literature and political economy , - a conjunction of tastes very coznmon in France from the days of the " philosophers " to the present time . During our times of financial collapse , we have noticed , among the nonsense which he daily poured forth , some gleams of a superior understanding of the fundamental laws of finance . He appears to have understood 1837 and 1857 better than most of his contemporaries . In a C*ttholic seminary he acquired the rudiments of knowledge , and advanced so far as to read Virgil . He also picked up a little French and Spanish in early life . The real instructors of his mind were Napoleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , as much as their works , that attracted and dazzled him . It is a strange thing , but true , that one of the strongest desires of one of the least reputable of living men was , and is , to be admired and held in lasting honor by his feb low-men . Nor has he now the least doubt that he deserves their admiration , and will have it . In 1817 , an edition of Franklin 's Autobiography was issued in Scotland . It was his perusal of that little book that first directed his thoughts toward // America , and which finally decided him to try his fortune in the New World . In May , 1819 , being then about twenty years of age , he landed at Halifax , with less than five pounds in his purse , without a friend on the Western Continent , and knowing no vocation except that of book-keeper . Between his landing at Halifax and the appearance of the first number of the Herald sixteen years elapsed ; during most of which he was a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily press . At Halifax , he gave lessons in book-keeping for a few weeks , with little profit , then made his way along the coast to Portland , whence a schooner conveyed him to Boston . He was then , it appears , a soft , romantic youth , alive to the historic associatioiis of the place , and susceptible to the varied , enchanting loveliness of the scenes adjacent , on land and sea . He even expressed his feelings in verse , in the Childe Harold manner , - verse Which does really show a poetic habit of feeling , with an occasional happiness of expression . At Boston he experienced the last extremity of want . Friendless and alone he wandered about the streets , seeking work and finding none ; until , his small store of money being all expended , he passed two whole days without food , and was theh only relieved by finding a shilling on the Common . He obtained at length the place of salesman in a bookstore , from which he was soon transferred to the printing-house cow nected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And here it was that he received his first lesson in the art of catering for the public mind . The firm in whose employment he was were more ambitious of glory than covetous of profit , and consequently published many works that were in advance of the general taste . Bankruptcy was their reward . The youth noted another circumstance at Boston . The newspaper most decried was Buckingham 's Galaxy ; but it was also the most eagerly sought and the most extensively sold . Buckingham habitually violated the traditional and established decorums of the press ; he was familiar , chatty , saucy , aneedotical , and sadly wanting in respect for the respectabilities of the most respectable town in the universe . Every one said he was a very bad man , but every one was exceedingly curious every Saturday to see " what the fellow had // to say this week . " If the youth could have obtained a sight of a file of James Franklin 's Courant , of 1722 , *n which the youthful Benjamin first addressed the public , he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denounced and universally read . Two years in Boston . Then he went to New York , where he soon met the publisher of a Charleston paper , who engaged him as translator from the Spanish , and general assistant . During the year spent by him at Charleston he increased his knowledge of the journalist 's art . Th* editor of the paper with which he was connected kept a sail-boat , in which he was accustomed to meet arriving vessels many miles from the coast , and bring in his files of newspapers a day in advance of his rivals . The young assistant remembered this , and turned it to account in after years . At Charleston he was confronted , too , with the late peculiar institution , and saw much to approve in it , nothing to condemn . From that day to this he has been but in one thing consistent , - contempt for the negro and for all white men interested in his welfare , approving himself in this a thorough Celt . If , for one brief period , he forced himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feeling remained rooted within him , and soon resumed its wonted expression . He liked the South , and the people of the South , and had a true Celtic sympathy with their aristocratic pretensions . The salary of an assistant editor at that time was something between the wages of a compositor and those of an office boy . Seven dollars a week would have been considered rather liberal pay ; ten , munificent ; fifteen , immensely lavish . Returning to New York , he endeavored to find more lucrative employment , and advertised his intention to open , near the site of the present Herald office , a " Permanent Commercial School , " in which all the usual branches were to be taught " in the inductive method . " His list of subjects was extensive , - " reading , elocution , penmanship , and arithmetic ; algebra , astronomy , history , and geography ; moral philosophy , commercial law , and political economy ; English grammar and composition ; and also , if required , the French and Spanish languages , by natives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " J. U. B. , 148 Fulton Street . " Appli // cations , however , were not made in sufficient num'v*r , and the school , we believe , never came into existence . Next , he tried a course of lectures upon Political Economy , at the old Dutch Church in Ann Street , then not far from the centre of population . The public did not care to hear the young , gentleman upon that abstruse subject , and the pecuniary result of the enterprise was not encouraging . He had no resource but the ill-paid , unhonored drudgery of the press . For the next few years he was a paragraphist , reporter , scissorer , and man-of-all-work for the New York papers , daily and weekly , earning but the merest subsistence . He wrote then in very much the same style as when he afterwards amused and shocked the town in the infant Herald ; only he was under restraint , being a subordinate , and was seldom allowed to violate decorum . In point of industry , sustained and indefatigable industry , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . One thing is to be specially noted as one of the chief and indispensable causes of his success . , JA had no vices . He never drank to excess , nor gormandized , nor gambled , nor even smoked , nor in any other way wasted the vitality needed for a long and tough grapple with adverse fortune . What he on*ce wrote of himself in the early Herald was strictly true : - * I eat and drink to live , - not live to eat and drink . Social glasses of wine are my aversion ; public dinners are my abomination ; all species of gormandizing , my utter scorn and contempt . When I am hungry , I eat ; when thirsty , drink . Wine or viands taken for society , or to stimulate conversation , tend only to dissipation , indolence , poverty , contempt , and death . " This was an immense advantage , which he had in common with several of the most mischievous men of modern times , - Calhoun , George III. , and others . Correct bodily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the man who has them will be extremely likely to gain the day over competitors of ten times his general worth . Dr. Franklin used to say , that if Jack Wilkes had been as exemplary in this particular as George III. , lie would have turned the king out of his dominions . In several of the higher kinds of labor , such as law , physic , journalism , authorship , art , when the competition is close and keen , and many able men are near von . 011. - NO. 211. 25 // the summit , the question who shall finally stand upon it often resolves itself into one of physical endurance . This man Bennett would have lived or died a hireling scribe , if he had had even one of the common vices . Everything was against his rising , except alone an enormous capacity for labor , sustained by strictly correct habits . He lived much with politicians during these years of laborious poverty . Gravitating always towards the winning side , he did much to bring into power the worst set of politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves of the popularity of Andrew Jackson , and who were afterwards used by him for the purpose of electing Martin Van Buren . He became perfectly familiar with all that was petty and mean in the political strifes of the day , but without ever suspecting that there was anything in politics not petty and mean . He had no convictions of his own , and therefore not the least belief that any politician had . If the people were in earnest about the affairs of their country , ( their country , not his , ) it was because the people were not behind the scenes , were dupes of their party leaders , were a parcel of fools . In short , he acquired his insight into political craft in the school of Tammany Hall and the Kitchen Cabinet . His value was not altogether unappreciated by the politicians . He was one of those whom they use and flatter during the heat of the contest , and forget in the distribution of the spoils of victory . He made his first considerable hit as a journalist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington correspondent of the New York Enquirer . In the Congressional Library , one day , he found an edition of Horace Walpole 's Letters , which amused him very much . " Why not , " said he to himself , " try a few letters on a similar plan from this city , to be published in New York ? " The letters appeared . Written in a lively manner , full of personal allusions , and describing individuals respecting whom the public are always curious , - free also from offensive personalities , - the letters attracted much notice , and were generally copied in the press . It is said that some of the ladies whose charms were described in those letters were indebted to them for husbands . Personalities of Lthis kind were a novelty then , and mere novelty goes a great way // in journalism . At this period he produced almost every kind of composition known to periodical literature , - paragraphs and leading articles , poetry and love-stories , reports of trials , debates , balls , and police cases ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or twelve . If there had been then in New York one newspaper publisher who understood his business , the immense possible value of this man as a journalist would have been perceived , and he would have been secured , rewarded , and kept under some restraint . But there was no such man . There were three or four forcible writers for the press , but not one journalist . During the great days of " The Courier and Inquirer , " from 1829 to 1832 , when it was incomparably the best newspaper on the continent , James Gordon Bennett was its most efficient hand . It lost him in 1832 , when the paper abandoned General Jackson and took up Nicholas Biddle ; and in losing him lost its chance of retaining the supremacy among American newspapers to this day . We can truly say , that at that time journalism , as a thing by itself and for itself , had no existence in the United States . Newspapers were mere appendages of party ; and the darling object of each journal was to be recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public , the great public , hungry for interesting news , no one thought of it . Forty years ago , in the city of New York , a copy of a newspaper could not be bought for money . If any one wished to see a newspaper , he had either to go to the office and subscribe , or repair to a bar-room and buy a glass of something to drink , or bribe a carrier to rob one of his customers . The circulation of the Courier and Inquirer was considered something marvellous when it printed thirty-five hundred copies a day , and its business was thought immense when its daily advertising averaged fifty-five dollars . It is not very unusual for a newspaper now to receive for advertising , in one day , six hundred times that sum . Bennett , in the course of time , had a chance been given to him , would have made the Courier and Inquirer powerful enough to cast off all party ties ; and this he would have done merely by improving it as a vehicle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those ridiculous , tantalizing , corrupting salaries , which are // April , a little more than a single man needs , but not enough for him to marry upon . This salary was increased by the proprietors giving him a small share in the small profits of the printing office ; so that , after fourteen years of hard labor and Scotch economy , he found himself , on leaving the great paper , a capitalist to the extent of a few hundred dollars . The chief editor of the paper which he now abandoned sometimes lost as much in a single evening at the card-table . It probably never occurred to him that this poor , ill-favored Scotchman was destined to destroy his paper and all the class of papers to which it belonged . Any one who now examines a file of the Courier and Inquirer of that time , and knows its interior circumstances , will see plainly enough that the possession of this man was the vital element in its prosperity . He alone knew the rudiments of his trade . He alone had the physical stamina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dexterity , tact , and audacity , needful for keeping up a daily newspaper in the face of keen competition . Unweaned yet from the politicians , he at once started a cheap party paper , " The Globe , " devoted to Jackson and Van Buren . The party , however , did not rally to its support , and it had to contend with the opposition of party papers already existing , upon whose manor it was poaching . The Globe expired after an existence of thirty days . Its proprietor , still untaught by such long experience , invested the wreck of his capital in a Philadelphia Jackson paper , and struggled desperately to gain for it a footing in the party . He said to Mr. Van Buren and to other leaders , Help me to a loan of twenty-five hundred dollars for two years , and I can establish my Pennsyl vanian on a self-supporting basis . The application was politely refused , and he was compelled to give up the struggle . The truth is , he was not implicitly trusted by the Jackson party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the same time , they were a little afraid of the vein of mockery that broke out so frequently in his writings . He was restive in harness . He was devoted to the party , but he was under no party illusions . He was fighting in the ranks as an adventurer or soldier of fortune . He fought well ; but would it do to promote a man to high rank who knew the game so well , and // upon whom no man could get any hold ? To him , in his secret soul , Martin Van Buren was nothing ( as he often said ) but a country lawyer , who , by a dexterous use of the party machinery , the well-timed death of De Witt Clinton , and General Jackson 's frenzy in behalf of Mrs. Eaton , had come to be the chosen successor of the fiery chieftain . The canny Scotchman saw this with horrid clearness , and saw nothing more . Political chiefs do not like subalterns of this temper . Underneath the politician in Martin Van Buren there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the man , whose fathers were buried in American soil , whose children were to live under American institutions , who had , necessarily , an interest in the welfare and honor of the country , and whose policy , upon the whole , was controlled by that natural interest in his country 's welfare and honor . To our mocking Celt nothing of this was apparent , nor has ever been . His education as a journalist was completed by the failure of his Philadelphia scheme . Returning to New York , he resolved to attempt no more to rise by party aid , but henceforth have no master but the public . On the 6th of May , 1835 , ap .. peared the first number of the Morning Herald , price one cent . It was born in a cellar in Wall Street , - not a basement , but a veritable cellar . Some persons are still doing business in that region who remember going down into its subterranean office , and buying copies of the new paper from its editor , who used to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of board , and who occupied the only chair in the establishment . For a considerable time his office contained absolutely nothing but his flour-barrel desk , one wooden chair , and a file of Heralds . Everything appeared to be against his success . It was one poor man in a cellar against the world . Already he had failed three times ; first , in 1825 , when he attempted to establish a Sunday paper ; next , in 1832 , when he tried d* party journal ; recently , in Philadelphia . With great difficulty , and after many rebuffs , he had prevailed upon two young printers to print his paper and share its profits or losses , and he possessed about enough money to start the enterprise and sustain it ten days The cheapness of his paper was no longer a novelty , for there // was already a penny paper with a paying circulation . He had cut loose from all party ties , and he had no influential friends except those who had an interest in his failure . The great public , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even by name . The newsboy system scarcely existed ; and all that curious machinery by which , in these days , a " new candidate for public favor " is placed , at no expense , on a thousand news-stands , had not been thought of . There he was alone in his cellar , without clerk , errand-boy , or assistant of any kind . For many weeks he did with his own hands everything , - editorials , news , reporting , receiving advertisements , and even writing advertisements for persons " unaccustomed to composition . " He expressly announced that advertisers could have their advertisements written for them at the office , and this at a time when there was no one to do it but himself . The extreme cheapness of the paper rendered him absolutely dependent upon his advertisers , and yet he dared not charge more than fifty cents for sixteen lines , and he offered to insert sixteen lines for a whole year for thirty dollars . He *t once produced an eminently salable article . If just such a paper were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large city of the world , it would instantly find a multitude of readers . It was a very small sheet , - four little pages of four columns each , - much better printed than the Herald now is , and not a waste line in it . Everything drew , as the sailors say . There was not much scissoring in it , - the scissors have never been much esteemed in the Herald office , - but the little that there was all told upon the general effect of the sheet . There is a story current in newspaper offices that the first few numbers of the Herald were strictly decorous and " respectable , " but that the editor , finding the public indifferent and his money running low , changed his tactics , and filled his paper with scurrility and indecency , which immediately made it a paying enterprise . No such thing . The first numbers were essentially of the same character as the number published this morning . They had the same excellences and the same defects : in the news department , immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columns , the vein of Mephistophelean mockery which // has puzzled and shocked so many good people at home and abroad . A leading topic then was a certain Matthias , one of those long-bearded religious impostors who used to appear from time to time . The first article in the first number of the Herald was a minute account of the origin and earlier life of the fellow , - just the thing for the paper , and the sure method of exploding him . The first editorial article , too , was perfectly in character : - qwq $ 60,000 . ' " How have you made it ? ' By speculating in real estate . I bought three hundred lots at Goose Island at $ 150 apiece , they are now worth $ 400 . I would not sell them for $ 350 apiece , I assure you . ' Do you think so ? ' " Sartin . I have two hundred and fifty lot8 at Blockhead 's Point , worth $150 a piece ; some on them are worth $ 200 . I have one hundred lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the very lowest calculation . In short , I m worth a hull $ 60,000 . ' " Well , I 'm glad to hear it . You can pay me now the $ 500 you have owed me for these last four years . There s your note , I believe , ' said he , handing the speculator a worn piece of paper that had a piece of writing upon it . " The speculator looked blank at this . Oh ! yes - my - now- I d like - suppose , ' but the words could not form themselves into a perfect sentence . " I want the money very mi*ch , ' said the other ; I have some payments to make to-morrow . ' " Why , you do n't want cash for it surely . ' " Yes , but I do . You say you are worth $ 60,000 , - surely $ 500 is but a trifle to pay ; do let me have the cash on the nail , if you please . ' " Oh ! - by - well - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the money at present . ' " So you ca n't pay it , eh ? A man worth $ 60,000 , and ca n't pay an old debt of $ 500 ? ' " Oh ! yes I can-I'll-I'll-just give you my note for it at ninety days . ' " The D-l you will ! A man worth $ 60,000 , and ca n't pay $500 for ninety days ! what do you mean ? ' " Well now , my dear sir , I m worth what I say . I can pay you . There s my property , ' spreading out half a dozen very beautiful lithographs ; but really I ca n't raise that amount at present . Yesterday , I had to give three per cent a month for $4,000 to save my whole fortune . I had to look out for the mortgages . Take my note ; you can get it discounted for three per cent . ' // " No , I ca n't . If you will give me $ 260 for the debt , I shall give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether the proposition has been accepted we shall know to-morrow ; but we have many such rich people . " - Herald , Oct. 28 , 1836 . But it was not such things as these that established the Herald . Confined as he was to the limits of a single town , and being compelled to do everything with his own hands , he could not have much in his columns that we should now call " news. ** But what is news ? The answer to that question involves the whole art , mystery , and history of journalism . The time was when news signified the doings of the king and his court . This was the staple of the first news-letter writers , who were employed by great lords , absent from court , to send them court intelligence . To this was soon added news of the doings of other kings and courts ; and from that day to this the word news has been continually gaining increase of meaning , until now it includes all that the public are curious to know , which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals . While this man was playing fantastic tricks before high Heaven , his serious thoughts were absorbed in schemes to make his paper the great vehicle of news . Early in the second month , while he was still losing money every day , he hit upon a new kind of news , which perhaps had more to do with the final success of the Herald than any other single thing . His working day , at that time , was sixte*n or seventeen hours . In the morning , from five to eight , he was busy , in the quiet of his room , with those light , nonsensical paragraphs and editorials which made his readers smile in spite of themselves . During the usual business hours of the morning , he was in his cellar , over his flour-barrel desk , engaged in the ordinary routine of editorial work ; not disdaining to sell the morning paper , write advertisements , and take the money for them . About one o'clock , having provided abundant copy for the compositors , he sallied forth into Wall Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From four to six he was at his office again , winding up the business of the day . In the evening he was abroad , - at theatre , concert , ball , or public meeting , - absorbing fresh material for his paper . He converted himself , as it were , // into a medium through which the gossip , scandal , fun , and nonsense of this great town were daily conveyed bach to it for its amusement ; just as a certain popular preacher is reported to do , who spends six days in circulating among his parishioners , and on the seventh tells them all that they have taught him . Now Wall Street , during the years that General Jackson was disturbing the financial system by his insensate fury against the United States Bank , was to journalism what the army of the Potomac was in the year 1864 . The crash of 183T was full two years in coming on , during which the money market was always deranged , and moneyed men were anxious and puzzled . The public mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall Street was the point upon which all eyes were fixed . The editor of the Herald was the first American journalist to avail himself of this state of things . It occurred to him , when his paper had been five weeks in existence , to give a little account every day of the state of affairs in Wall Street , - the fluctuations of the money market and their causes , -* the feeling and gossip of the street . He introduced this feature at the moment when General Jackson 's embroilment with the French Chambers was at its height , and when the return of the American Minister was hourly expected . Some of our readers may be curious to see the first " money article " ever published in the United States . It was as follows : - " CoMIVEERcIAL . " Stocks yesterday maintained their prices during the session of the Board , several going up . Utica went up 2 per cent ; the others stationary . Large quantities were sold . After the Board adjourned and the news from France was talked over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent ; other stocks quite firm . A rally was made by the bulls in the evening , under the trees , but it did not succeed . There will be a great fight in the Board to-day . The good people up town are anxious to know what the brokers think of Mr. Livingston . We shall find out , and let them know . " The cotton and flour market rallied a little . The rise of cotton in Liverpool drove it up here a cent or so . The last shippers will make 2* per cent . Many are endeavoring to produce a belief that there will be a war . If the impression prevails , naval stores will go up a // good deal . Every eye is outstretched for the Constitution . Hudson , of the Merchants ' News Room , says he will hoist out the first flag . Gilpin , of the Exchange News Room , says he will have her name down in his Room one hour before his competitor . The latter claims having beat Hudson yesterday by an hour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , June 13 , 1835 . This was his first attempt . The money article constantly lengthened and increased in importance . It won for the little paper a kind of footing in brokers ' offices and bank parlors , and provided many respectable persons with an excuse for buying it . At the end of the third month , the daily receipts equalled the daily expenditures . A cheap police reporter was soon after engaged . In the course of the next month , the printing office was burnt , and the printers , totally discouraged , abandoned the enterprise . The editor- who felt that he had caught the public ear , as he had - contrived , by desperate exertions , to " rake the Herald out of the fire , " as he said , and went on alone . Four months after , the great fire laid Wall Street low , and all the great business streets adjacent . Here was his first real opportunity as a journalist ; and how he improved it ! - spendiftg one half of every day among the ruins , note-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , writing out what he had gathered . He spread before the public reports so detailed , unconventional , and graphic , that a reader sitting at his ease in his own room became , as it were , an eyewitness of those appalling scenes . His accounts of that fire and of the events following it , are such as Defoe would have given if he had been a New York reporter . Still struggling for existence , he went to the expense ( great then ) of publishing a picture of the burning Exchange , and a map of the burnt district . American journalism was born amid the roaring flames of the great fire of 1835 ; and no true journalist will deny , that from that day to this , whenever any very remarkable event has taken place in the city of New York , the Herald reports of it have generally been those which cost most money and exhibited most of the spirit and detail of the scene . For some years every dollar that the Herald made was expended in news , and , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure for // intellio'ence . If , to-morrow , we were to have another great fire , like that of thirty years ago , this paper would have twentyfive men in the streets gathering particulars . But so difficult is it to establish a daily newspaper , that , at the end of a year , it was not yet certain that the Herald could continue . A lucky contract with a noted pill-vender gave it a great lift about that time ; and , in the fifteenth month , the editor ventured to raise his price to two cents . From that day he had a business , and nothing remained for him but to go on as he had begun . He did so . The paper exhibits now the same qualities as it did then , - immense expenditure and vigilance in getting news , and a reckless disregard of principle , truth , and decency in its editorials . Almost from the first month of its existence , this paper was deemed infamous by the very public that supported it . We can well remember when people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were caught *reading it , and when the man in a country place who subscribed for it intended by that act to distinctly enroll himself as one of the ungodly . Journalists should thoroughly consider this most remarkable fact . We have had plenty of infamous papers , but they have all been sh6rt-lived but this . This one has lasted . After thirtyone years of life , it appears to be almost as flourishing to-day as ever . The foremost of its rivals has a little more than half its circulation , and less than half its income . A marble palace is rising to receive it , and its proprietor fares as sumptuously every day as the ducal family who furnished him with his middle name . Let us see how the Herald acquired its ill name . We shall then know why it is still so profoundly odious ; for it has never changed , and can never change , while its founder controls it . Its peculiarities are his peculiarities . He came into collision , first of all , with the clergy and people of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as some of our readers may remember , Catholics and Protestants had not yet learned to live together in the same community with perfect tolerance of one another 's opinions and usages ; and there were still some timid persons who feared the rekim. dling of the fagot , and the supremacy of the Pope in the United // States . A controversy growing out of these apprehensions had been proceeding for some time in the newspapers when this impudent little Herald first appeared . The new-coiner joined ' in the fray , and sided against the Church in which he was born ; but laid about him in a manner which disgusted both parties . For example : - " As a Catholic , we call upon the Catholic Bishop and clergy of New York to come forth from the darkness , folly , and superstition of the tenth century . They live in the nineteenth . There can be no mistake about it , - they will be convinced of this fact if they look into the almanac " But though we want a thorough reform , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first breath . We know the difficulty of the task . Disciples , such as the Irish are , will stick with greater pertinacity to absurdities and nonsense than to reason and common sense . We have no objection to the doctrine of Transubstantiation being tolerated for a few years to come . We may for a while indulge ourselves in the delicious luxury of creating and eating our Divinity . A peculiar taste of this kind , like smoking tobacco or drinking whiskey , can not be given up all at once . The ancient Egyptians , for many years after they had lost every trace of the intellectual character of their religion , yet worshipped and adored the ox , the bull , and the crocodile . They htid not discovered the art , as we Catholics have done , of making a God out of bread , and of adoring and eating him nt one and the same moment . This latter piece of sublimity or religious cookery ( we do n't know which ) was reserved for the educated and talented clergy from the tenth up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immediate disturbance of this venerable piece of rottenness and absurdity . It must be retained , as we would retain carefully the tooth of a saint or the jawbone of a martyr , till the natural progress of reason in the Irish mind shall be able , silently and imperceptibly , to drop it among the forgotten rubbish of his early loves , or his more youthful riots and rows . " There must be a thorough reformation and revolution in the American Catholic Church . Education must be more attended to . We never knew one priest who believed that he ate the Divinity when he took the Eucharist . If we must hai*e a Pope , let us have a Pope of our own , - an American Pope , an intellectual , intelligent , and moral Pope , - not such a decrepit , licentious , stupid , Italian blockhead as the College of Cardinals at Rome condescends to give the Christian world of Europe . " // that day , could relish the tone in which it was given . Threatening letters were sent in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Catholic pulpit ; its carriers were assaulted on their rounds ; but the paper won no friends from the side which it affected to espouse . Every one felt that to this man nothing was sacred , or august , or venerable , or even serious . He was like an infidel in a party composed of men of various sects . The Baptist could fairly attack an Episcopalian , because he had convictions of his own that could be assaulted ; but this stranger , who believed nothing and yespected nothing , could not be hit at all . The result would naturally be , that the whole company would turn upon him as upon a common foe . So in politics . Per2aps the most serious and sincere article he ever wrote on a political subject was one that appeared in November , 1836 , in which he recommended the snbversion of republican institutions and the election of an emperor . If he ever had a political conviction , we believe he expressed it then . After a rigmarole of Roman history and Augustus Ca*sar , he proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples of history Let us , for the sake of science , art , and civilization , elect at this election General Jackson , General Harrison , Martin Van Buren , Hugh White , or Anybody , we care not whom , the EMPEROR of t*ds great REPUBLIC for life , and have done with this eternal turmoil and confusion . Perhaps Mr. Van Buren would be the best Augustus Ca*sar . He is sufficiently corrupt , selfish , and heartless for that dignity . He has a host of favorites that will easily form a Senate . He has a court in preparation , and the Pra4orian bands in array . He can pick up a Livia anywhere . He has violated every pledge , adopted and abandoned every creed , been for and against every measure , is a believer in all religions by turns , and , like the first Ca*sar , has always been a republican and taken care of number one . He has called into action all the ragged adventurers from every class , and raised their lands , stocks , lots , and places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Octavianus was . He has a couple of sons also , who might succeed him and preserve the imperial line . We may be better off under an Emperor , - we could not be worse off as a nation than we are now . Besides , who knows but Van Buren is of the blood of the great Julius himself ? That great man conquered all Gaul and Helvetia , which in those days comprised Holland . Caius // Julius Ca*sar may thus have laid the foundation of a royal line to be transmitted to the West . There is a prophecy in Virgil 's Pollio ' evidently alluding to Van . But of this another day . " A man who writes in this way may have readers , but he can have no friends . An event occurred in his first year which revealed this fact to him in an extremely disagreeable manner . There was then upon the New York stage a notoriously dissolute actor , who , after outraging the feelings of his wife in all the usual modes , completed his infamy by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Herald took her part , which would naturally have been the popular side . But when the actor retorted by going to the office of the Herald and committing upon its proprietor a most violent and aggravated assault , accompanying his blows with acts of peculiar indecency , it plainly appeared that the sympathies of the public were wholly with the actor , - not with the champion of an injured woman . His hand had been against every man , and in his hour of need , when he was greatly in the right , every heart was closed against him . Not the less , however , did the same public buy his paper , because it contained what the public wanted , i. e. the news of the day , vividly exhibited . Th* course of this curious specimen of our kind during the late war was perfectly characteristic . During the first two years of the war he was inclined to think that the Rebels would be successful so far as to win over the Democratic party to their side , and thus constitute Jefferson Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preference as to the result of the contest , it was probably this . If the flag of the United States had been trailed in the mud of Nassau Street , followed by hooting ruffians from the Sixth Ward , and the symbol of the Rebellion had floated in its stead from the cupola of the City Hall , saluted by Captain Rynders 's gun , it would not have cost this isolated alien one pang , - unless , perchance , a rival newspaper had been the first to announce the fact . That , indeed , would have cut him to the heart . Acting upon the impression that the Rebellion , in some way , would triumph , he gave it all the suppprt possible , and continued to do so until it appeared certain that , whatever the issue of the strife , the South was lost for a long time as a patron of New York papers . // The key to most of the political vagaries of this paper is given in a single sentence of one of its first numbers : " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . " In his endeavors to act upon this lofty principle , he was sadly puzzled during the war , - so difficult was it to determine which way the cat would finally jump . He held himself ready , however , to jump with it , whichever side the dnbious animal might select . At the same time , he never for an instant relaxed his endeavors to obtain the earliest and fullest intelligence from the seat of war . Never did any journal in any country maintain so vast an expenditure for news . Every man in the field representing that paper was more than authorized - he was encouraged and commanded - to incur any expense whatever that might be necessary either in getting or forwarding intelligence . There were no rigid or grndging scrutiny of reporters ' dra.fts ; no minute and insulting inquiries respecting the last moments of a horse ridden to death in the service ; no grumbling about the precise terms of a steamboat charter , or a special locomotive . A reporter returning from the army laden with information , procured at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conqueror coming home from a victorious campaign , and he went forth again full of courage and zeal , knowing well that every man employed on the Herald was advancing himself when he served the paper well . One great secret of success the proprietor of the Herald knows better than most ; - he knows how to get ont of those who serve him all there is in them ; he knows how to reward good service ; he knows a man 's value to him . There is no newspaper office in the world where real journalistic efficiency is more certain to meet prompt recognition and just reward than in this . Not much may be said to a laborious reporter about the hits he is making ; but , on some Saturday afternoon , when he draws his salary , he finds in his hands a larger amount than usual . He hands it back to have the mistake corrected , and he is informed that his salary is raised . The Herald , too , systematically prepares the way for its reporters . Some of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the time of his glory , and indeed as long as he held the chief command . One // April , of the results of this policy was , that , while the reporters of other papers were out in the cold , writing in circumstances the most inconvenient , those of the Herald , besides being supplied with the best information , were often writing in a warm apartment or commodious tent , not far from head-quarters or at head-quarters . As long as General Butler held a command which gave him control over one of the chief sources of news , the Herald hoarded its private grudge against him ; but the S instant he was removed from command , the Herald was upon him in full cry . If , to-morrow , the same General should be placed in a position which should render his office a source of important intelligence , we should probably read in the Herald the most glowing eulogiums of his career and character . What are we to think of a man who is at once so able and so raise ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he is wanting in that sense of truth by violating which a man makes himself a liar . We can not call him a traitor , for his heart knows no country ; nor an infidel , for all the serious and high concerns of man are to him a jest . Defective is the word to apply to such as he . As far as he goes , he is good ; and if the commodity in which he deals were cotton or sugar , we could commeied his enterprise and tact . He is like the steeple of a church in New York , which was built up to a certain height , when the material gave out , and it was hastily roofed in , leaving the upper half of the architect 's design unexecuted . That region of the mind where conviction , the sense of truth and honor , public spirit , and patriotism have their sphere , is in this man mere vacancy . But , we repeat , as far as he is built up , he is very well constructed . Visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and good-natured old gentleman , who is on excellent terms with himself and with the world . If you are a poor musician , about to give a concert , no editor is more likely than he to lend a favorable ear to your request for a few lines of preliminary notice . The persons about him have been very long in his employment , and to some of them he has been munificently liberal . The best of them appear to be really attached to his person , as well as devoted to his service , and they rely on him as sailors rely on a captain who has brought them safe through a thousand storms . He has // the Celtic virtue of standing by those who stand by him developed to the uttermost degree . Many a slight favor bestowed upon him in his days of obscurity he has recompensed a thousand-fold since he has had the power to do so . We can not assign a very exalted rank in the moral scale to a trait which some of the lowest races possess in an eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nevertheless , it is akin to nobleness , and is the nearest approach to a true generosity that some strong natures can attain . What are we to say of the public that has so resolutely sustained this paper , which the outside world so generally condemns ? We say this . Every periodical that thrives supplies the public with a certain description of intellectual commodity , which the public is willing to pay for . The New York Ledger , for example , exists by furnishing stories and poetry adapted to the taste of the greatest number of the people . Our spirited friends of The Nation and Round Table supply criticism and that portion of the news which is of special interest to the intellectual class . The specialty of the daily newspaper is to give that part of the news of the day which interests the whole public . A complete newspaper contains more than this ; but it ranks in the world of journalism exactly in the degree to which it does this . The grand object of the true journalist is to be fullest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hour . That secured , he may neglect all else . The paper that does this oftenest is the paper that will find most purchasers ; and no general excellence , no array of information on minor or special topics , will ever atone for a deficiency on the subject of most immediate and universal interest . IDurfng the war this fundamental truth of journalism was apparent to every mind . In time of peace , it is less apparent , but not less a truth . In the absence of an absorbing topic , general news rises in importance , until , in the dearth of the dog-days , the great cucumber gets into type ; but the great point of competition is still the same , - to be fullest , quickest , and most correct upon the subject most interesting at the moment . But every periodical , besides its specialty on which it lives , gives its readers something more . It need not , but it does . // The universal Ledger favors its readers with many very excellent essays , written for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives its readers a great deal of sound advice in other departments of the paper . It need not do this ; these features do not materially affect the sale of the paper , as its proprietor well knows . The essays of such men as Mr. Everett and Mr. Bancroft do not increase the sale of the paper one hundred copies a week . Those essays are read and admired , and contribute their quota toward the education of the people , and reflect honor upon the liberal and enterprising man who publishes them ; but scarcely any one buys the paper for their sake . People almost universally buy a periodical for the special thing which it has undertaken to furnish ; and it is by supplying this special thing that an editor attains his glorious privilege and opportunity of addressing a portion of the people on other topics . This opportunity he may neglect ; he may abuse it to the basest purposes , or improve it to the noblest ; but whichever of these things he does , it does not materially affect the prosperity of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the requisite vigor . We have gone over the whole history of journalism , and we find this to be its Law of Nature , to which there are only apparent exceptions . All points to this simple conclusion , which we firmly believe to be the golden rule of journalism , - that daily newspaper which has the best corps of reporters , and handles them best , necessarily takes the lead of all competitors . There are journalists who say ( we have often heard them in conversation ) that this is a low view to take of their vocation . It is of no importance whether a view is high or low , provided it is correct . But we can not agree with them that this is a low view . We think it the highest possible . Regarded as instructors of the people , they wield for our warning and rebuke , for our encouragement and reward , an instrument which is like the dread thunderbolt of Jove , at once the most terrible and the most beneficent , - rublicity . Some years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of licentious men formed themselves into a kind of society for the purpose of devising and promulgating a theory to justify the gratification of unbridled lust . They were called Free-Lovers . To // have assailed their nightly gatherings in thundering editorial articles would have only advertised them ; but a detailed report of their proceedings in the Tribune scattered these assemblies in a few days , to meet no more except in secret haunts . Recently , we have seen the Fenian wind-bag first inflated , then burst , by mere publicity . The Strong Divorce Case , last year , was a nauseous dose , which we would have gladly kept out of the papers ; but since it had to appear , it was a public benefit to have it given Herald-fashion , with all its revolting particulars . What a punishment to the guilty ! what a lesson to the innocent ! what a warning to the undetected ! How much beneficial reflection and conversation it excited ! How necessary , in an age of sensation morals and free-love theories , to have self-indulgence occasionally exhibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fleeting , deceptive , imaginary charms ! The instantaneous detection of the Otero murderers last autumn , and of the robbers of Adams 's express-car last winter , as related in the daily papers , and the picture presented by them of young Ketchum seated at work in the shoeshop of Sing-Sing Prison , were equivalent to the addition of a thous*nd men to the police force . Herein lies the power of such a slight person as the editor of the Herald . It is not merely that he impudently pulls your nose , but he pulls it in the view of a million people . Nor less potent is publicity as a means of reward . How many brave hearts during the late war felt themselves far more than repaid for all their hardships in the field and their agony in the hospital by reading their names in despatches , or merely in the list of wounded , and thinking of the breakfast-tables far away at which that name had been spied out and read with mingled exultation and pity . " Those who love me know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oar whole observation of the daily press convinces us that its power to do good arises chiefly from its giving the news of the day ; and its power to do harm chiefly from its opportunity to comment upon the news . Viewed only as a vehicle of intelligence , the Herald has taught the journalists of the United States the greater part of all that they yet know of their profession ; regarded as an organ of opinion , it has done all that // it was ever possible for a newspaper to do in perverting public opinion , debauching public taste , offending public morals , and dishonoring the national character . The question arises , Why has not this paper been long ago outdone in giving the news ? It has always been possible to suppress it by surpassing it . Its errors have given its rivals an immense advantage over it ; for it has always prospered , not in consequence of its badness , but of its goodness . We are acquainted with two foolish young patriots who were wrought up to such a frenzy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our late war , that they seriously considered whether there was any way in which they could *o well serve their country in its time of need , as by slaying that pernicious and insolent man its editor ; but both of those amiable lunatics were compelled occasionally to buy the paper . Of late , too , we have seen vast audiences break forth into wild hootings at the mention of its name ; but not the less did the hooters buy it the next morning . Nevertheless , as soon as there exists a paper which to the Herald 's good points adds the other features of a complete newspaper , and avoids its faults , from that hour the Herald wanes and falls speedily to the second rank . Tw* men have had it in their power to produce such a newspaper , - Horace Greeley and Henry J. Raymond . In 1841 , when the Herald was six years old , the Tribune appeared , edited by Mr. Greeley , with Mr. Raymond as his chief assistant . Mr. Greeley was then , and is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that is , he can produce a greater quantity of telling editorial per annum than any other individual . There never lived a man capable of working more hours in a year than he . Strictly temperate in his habits , and absolutely devoted to his work , he threw himself into this enterprise with an ardor never surpassed since Adam first tasted the sweets of honorable toil . Mr. Raymond , then recently from college , very young , wholly inexperienced , was endowed with an admirable aptitude for the work of journalism , and a power of getting through its routine labors , - a sustained , calm , swift industry , - unsurpassed at that time iu the American press . The business of the paper was also well managed by Mr. McElrath . In the hands of these able // 1866 . The New York Herald . men , the new paper made such rapid advances , that , in the course of a few months , it was fairly established , and in a year or two it had reached a circulation equal to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were added to its corps ; - the vigorous , prompt , untiring Dana ; George Ripley , possessing that blending of scholarship and tact , that wisdom of the cloister and knowledge of the world , which alone could fit a man of great learning and talent for the work of a daily newspaper ; Margaret Fuller , whose memory is still green in so many hearts ; and others , less universally known . Why , then , did not this powerful combination supplant the Herald ? If mere ability in the writing of a newspaper ; if to have given an impulse to thought and enterprise ; if to have won the admiration and gratitude of a host of the best men and women in America ; if to have inspired many thousands of young men with better feelings and higher purposes than they would else have attained ; if to have shaken the dominion of superstition , and made it easier for men to think freely , and freely utter their thought ; if to have produced a newspaper more interesting than any other in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things had sufficeti to give a daily paper the first position in the journalism of a country , then the Tribune would long ago have attained that position ; for all these things , and many more , the Tribune did . But they do not suffice . Such things may be incidental to a great success : they can not cause it . Great journalism - journalism pure and simple - alone can give a journal the first place . If Mr. Raymond had been ten years older , and had founded and conducted the paper , with Mr. Greeley as his chief writer of editorials , - that is , if the journalist had been the master of the journal , instead of the writer , the politician , and the philanthropist , - the Tribune might have won the splendid prize . Mr. Greeley is not a great journalist . He has regarded journalism rather as a disagreeable necessity of his vocation , and uniformly abandoned the care of it to others . An able man generally gets what he ardently seeks . Mr. Greeley produced just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take , but not such a paper as the public of the island of Man . hattan prefers . He regards this as his glory . We can not // argue with him , because his course of management left the field to the Herald , the suppression of which was required by the interests of civilization . As there are many who cherish the opinion that it was the superiority of the Tribune to its rival which gave that rival the advantage over it , we will take the liberty of mentioning some features of its management which sufficiently account for its not winning the first prize in the journalism of New York . We ought not , perhaps , to call this taking a liberty , since the Tribune has habitually taken the public into its confidence , and opened its books for its inspection . Nor has any one a right to censure the conduct of a private enterprise , so long as it is conducted honestly and decently . We merely wish to maintain , that the position of chief newspaper in the United States is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and powerful journal has been conducted . Every properly organized establishment of much extent is so arranged as to leave the head of it nothing to do ; - a man-ofwar , for example ; a regiment ; a great mercantile house . It is so also that the organism called a Man is arranged ; his hands and his feet labor , his heart beats , and his blood courses swiftly in his veins ; but the brain , the master of the whole , reposes in still seclusion . There must be somewhere in a complicated system one untrammelled mind , without any routine duty , free to come , to go , to suggest , to oversee , to inspire the whole . There has been such a mind in the Herald office ever since it was firmly established ; but , until recently , in no other newspaper office in New York . There have been periods of many months ' continuance , when the editor of the Tribune , has written three columns , answered fifteen letters , and made from one to three speeches every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as it is necessary ; the moment the necessity ceases , it ceases to be a virtue . Error second . From the time the Tribune was started until two years ago , all the papers of its class were sold at about the cost of the paper on which they were printed ; which threw the burden of supporting them upon advertisers . By slow degrees , all the leading publishers discovered that this was an error , excepting alone the editor of the Tribune , who suffered // from it most . Actuated by an eminently proper ambition for an American editor , he desired , above all things , an extensive circle of readers ; and this was the reason why for so many yearsie set his face like a flint against every proposition for an increase of price . The motive was excellent ; but this excessive cheapness tended directly to frustrate the object . The Herald , with its torrent of advertising , could stand the cheapness , and still have income enough to indulge in the most lavish expenditure for news . The daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise in price , never made any money at all ; the entire profits of the establishment being derived from the weekly and semi-weekly editions . Now it is a law of periodicals , that the matter which brings money costs money , and brings money in proportion to its cost . To this law , no real exception can be produced . It may , therefore , be laid down as a rule , that the sale of the daily papers in a town will be in proportion to the amount daily spent by each in getting intelligence . We need not tell journalists how exactly this rule has held good in New York during the last five years . To all this Mr. Greeley would reply , that cheapness promotes circulation , circulation brings advertising , advertising brings money , and money lirings news . But the facts refute this plausible reasoning . This extreme cheapness made it impossible for the Tribune to compete in expenditure with a paper that had the cream of the advertising . Error third was a too intimate connection with party . The mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial columns does not materially injure its business , provided its partisanship is not allowed to invade or influence the news . But every journalist knows that the party aims of an editor do usually injure and limit his paper as a vehicle of news . Space demanded by the journalist is occupied by the partisan , and valuable intelligence is excluded because of its tendency , real or supposed , to make against the party . The Tribune , perhaps , has avoided this error more than any other leading journal , but it has not entirely avoided it . The political opinions of its editor are exceedingly strong , and it is wholly impossible for him to refrain from using every means in his power to secure their predominance . Nothing is more certain than this : that the // newspaper ( where the press is free ) which attains the indisputably first position , in point of circulation , income , and power , wins and holds that position by surpassing its rivals in Iournal* ism pure and simple . We have gone carefully over the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The most successful series of political articles ever published in a newspaper were those of Junius ; but an examination of Woodfall 's books has shown that their effect on the permanent circulation of his paper was scarcely perceptible . Every step in the progress of the London Times was won by purely journalistic triumphs . There was a period during the Napoleonic wars when all the great news reached London just in time for the evening papers . Instantly the evening papers rose in importance ; and they held the first position in journalism exactly as long as the great express arrived at noon ; and when that exceptional state of things ceased , they sank immediately into their former insignificance . Our own evening papers present similar facts . Their life consists in their continuing the news from the point where the morning journals are compelled to break off ; and their circulation , beyond a certain fixed number , increases in exact proportion to the interest of that news . It was not unusual during the war for the Evening Post to sell five times its average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the wires . All of which shows that one of the great points for a journalist to aim at is a position that will leave him absolutely free to tell the public all it is curious to know . Alone among the leading journals of America , the Herald conquered such a position . It makes a vile use of its power ; but to acquire such power is the proper aim of the journalist . Error fourth . In a work of the first difficulty , such as the winning of a great campaign , Or conducting a daily paper to the first rank , one man is a power , two men may be half a power , three men may , in certain rare circumstances , be some small fraction of a power ; but an association is no power at all . Partnership and association are excellent things , destined , doubtless , to further development ; but the most difficult feats always have been , and always will be , done by One Man . That an association is competent to maintain an exceedingly inter- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able , and influential newspaper , can not be denied ; for the Tribune Association has done this for many years . We only contend that , to compete successfully with so energetic , vigilant , and unscrupulous a despot as the proprietor of the Herald , controlling an income of three thousand dollars a day , required an untrammelled despot . When an association can successfully command an army or a fleet , then we may believe it competent to conduct the leading newspaper of a free country . The Tribune has done great and glorious things for us . Not free , of course , from the errors which mark all things human , it has been , and is , a civilizing power in this land . We hope to have the pleasure of reading it every day for the rest of our lives . One thing it has failed to do , - to reduce the Herald to insignificance by surpassing it in the particulars in which it is excellent . We have no right to complain . We only regret that the paper representing the civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have given it the greatest power . Mr. Raymond , also , has had it in his power to render this great service to the civilization and credit of the United States . He has *t still ; and if any newspaper now in existence is destined to supplant the Herald , it is probably the one founded and conducted by him . The Daily Times , started in 1852 , retarded for a while by a financial error , has made such progress toward the goal of its proprietors ' ambition , that it is now on the home stretch , only a length or two behind . The editor of this paper is a journalist ; he sees clearly the point of competition ; he knows the great secret of his trade . The prize within his reach is splendid . The position of chief journalist gives power enough to satisfy any reasonable ambition , wealth enough to glut the grossest avarice , and opportunity of doing good sufficient for the most public-spirited citizen . What is there in political life equal to it ? We have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career ; but this we may say , - that the mau who wins the first place in the journalism of a free country must concentrate all his powers upon that one work , and , as an editor , owe no allegiance to party . He must stand above all parties , and serve all parties , by spreading before the public that full and exact information upon which sound legislation is based . // During the present session of Congress we have had daily illustration of this truth . The great question has been , What is the conditron of the Southern States and the feeling of the Southern people ? All the New York morning papers have expended money and labor , each according to its means and enterprise , in getting information from the South . This was well . But every one of these papers has had some party or person'al bias , which has given it a powerful interest to make out a case . The World and News excluded everything which tended to show the South dissatisfied and disloyal . The Tribune , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Times , also , being fully committed to a certain theory of reconstruction , naturally gave prominence to every fact which supported that theory , and was inclined to suppress information of the opposite tendency . The consequence was , that an inhabitant of the city of New York who simply desired to know the truth was compelled to keep an eye upon four or five papers , lest something material should escape him . This is pitiful . This is utterly beneath the journalism of 1866 . The final pre-eminent newspaper of America will soar far above such needless limitations as these , and present the truth in all its aspects , regardless of its effects upon theories , parties , factions , and Presidential campaigns . Presidential campaigns , - that is the real secret . The editors of most of these papers have selected their candidate for 1868 ; and , having done that , can no more help conducting their journals with a view to the success of that candidate , than the needle of a compass can help pointing awry when there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have no right to censure or complain . Yet we can not help marvelling at the hallucination which can induce able men to prefer the brief and illusory honors of political station to the substantial and lasting power within the grasp of the successful journalist . He , if any one , - he more than any one else , - is the master in a free country . Have we not seen almost every man who has held or run for the Presidency during the last ten or fifteen years paying assiduous and servile court , directly or indirectly , or both , to the editor of the Herald ? If it were proper to relate to the public what is known on this subject to a few // individuals , the public would be exceedingly astonished . And yet this reality of power an editor is ready to jeopard for the sake of gratifying his family by exposing them in Paris ! Jeopard , do we say ? He has done more : he has thrown it away . He has a magnet in his binnacle . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him thirty years of labor and audacity to gain . Strange weakness of human nature ! The daily press of the United States has prodigiously improved in every respect during the last twenty years . To the best of our recollection , the description given of it , twentythree years ago , by Charles Dickens , in his American Notes , was not much exaggerated ; although that great author did exaggerate its effects upon the morals of the country . His own amusing account of the rival editors in Pickwick might have instructed him on this latter point . It does not appear that the people of Eatanswill were seriously injured by the fierce language employed in " that false and scurrilous print , the Independent , " and in " that vile and slanderous calumniator , the Gazette . " Mr. Dickens , however , was too little conversant with our politics to take the atrocious language formerly so common in our newspapers " in a Pickwickian sense " ; and we freely confess that in the alarming picture which he drew of our press there was only too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " wrote Mr. Dickens , " strikes its fibres deep in its licentious press . " Schools may be erected , east , west , north , and south ; pupils be taught , and masters reared , by scores upon scores of thousands ; colleges may thrive , churches may be crammed , temperance may be diffused , and advancing knowledge in all other forms walk through the land with giant strides ; but while the newspaper press of America is in or near its present abject state , high moral improvement in that country is hopeless . Year by year it must and will go back* year the tone of public feeling must sink lower down ; year by year the Congress and the Senate must become of less account before all decent men ; and , year by year , the memory of the great . fathers of the Revolution must be outraged more and more in the bad life of their degenerate child . " Among the herd of journals which are published in the States , there are some , the reader scarcely need be told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished gentlemen connected // with publications of this class I have derived both pleasure and profit . But the name of these is Few , and of the others Legion ; and the influence of the good is powerless to counteract the mortal poison of the bad . " Among the gentry of America , among the well-informed and moderate , in the learned professions , at the bar and on the bench , there is , as there can be , but one opinion in reference to the vicious character of these infamous journals . It is sometimes contended - I will not say strangely , for it is natural to seek excuses for such a disgrace - that their influence is not so great as a visitor would suppose . I must be pardoned for saying that there is no warrant for this plea , and that every fact and circumstance tends directly to the opposite conclusion . " When any man , of any grade of desert in intellect or character , can climb to any public distinction , no matter what , in America , without first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before this monster of depravity ; when any private excellence is safe from its attacks , and when any social confidence is left unbroken by it , or any tie of social decency and honor is held in the least regard ; when any man in that free country has freedom of opinion , and presumes to think for himself , and speak for himself , without humble reference to a censorship which , for its rampant ignorance and base dishonesty , he utterly loathes and despisei in his heart ; when those who most acutely feel its infar*iy and the reproach it casts upon the nation , and who most denounce it to each other , dare to set their heels upon and crush it openly , in the sight of all men , - then I will believe that its influence is lessening , and men are returning to their manly senses . But while that Press has its evil eye in every house , and its black hand in every appointment in the state , from a President to a postman , - while , with ribald slander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard literature of an enormous class , who must find their reading in a newspaper , or they will not read at all ,  --  so long must its odium be upon the country 's head , and so long must the evil it works be plainly visible in the Re . public . " To those who are accustomed to the leading English journals , ox to the respectable journals of the Continent of Europe , to those who are accustomed to anything else in print and paper , it would be impossible , without an amount of extract for which I have neither space nor inclination , to convey an adequate idea of this frightful engine in America . But if any man desire confirmation of my statement on this head , let him repair to any place in this city of London where scattered numbers of these publications are to be found , and there let him form his own opinion. ** // From a note appended to this passage , we infer that the newspaper which weighed upon the author 's mind when he wrote it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the general license of the press at that time , was not the Herald 's bad example , but Andrew Jackson 's debauching influence . The same man who found the government pure , and left it corrupt , made the press the organ of his own malign ant passions by bestowing high office upon the editors who lied most recklessly about his opponents . In 1843 the press had scarcely begun to recover from this hateful influence , and was still the merest tool of politicians . The Herald , in fact , by demonstrating that a newspaper can flourish in the United States without any aid from politicians , has brought us nearer the time when no newspaper of any importance will meddle in party conflicts , which have been the principal cause of the indecencies of the press . The future is bright before the journalists of America . The close of the war , by increasing their income and reducing their expenses , has renewed the youth of several of our leading journals , and given them a better opportunity than they have ever had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journals hitherto has been the wretched compensation paid to writers and reporters . To this hour there is but one individual connected with the daily press of New York , not a proprietor , who receives a salary sufficient to keep a tolerable house and bring up a family respectably and comfortably ; and if any one would find that individual , he must look for him , alas ! in the office of the Herald . To be plainer , decent average housekeeping in the city of New York now costs a hundred dollars a week ; and there is but one salary of that amount paid in New York to a journalist who owns no property in his journal . The consequence * that there is scarc*ly an individual connected with a daily paper who is not compelled or tempted to eke out his ridiculous salary by other writing , to the injury of his health and the constant deterioration of his work . Every morning the public comes fresh and eager to the newspaper : fresh and eager minds should alone minister to it . No work done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition , and consequently one // of the main conditions of a man 's writing his best is that he should write little and rest often . A good writer , moreover , is one of Nature 's peculiar and very rare products . There is a mystery about the art of composition . Who shall explain to us why Charles Dickens can write about a three-legged stool in such a manner that the whole civilized world reads with pleasnrc ; while another man of a hundred times his knowledge and five times his quantity of mind can not write on any subject so as to interest anybody ? The laws of supply and demand do not apply to this rarity ; for one man 's writing can not be compared with another 's , there being no medium between valuable and worthless . How many over-worked , under-paid men have we known in New York , really gifted with this inexplicable knack at writing , who , well commanded and justly compensated , lifted high and dry out of the slough of poor-devilism in which their powers were obscured and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper ! Some of these Reporters of Genius are mere children in all the arts by which men prosper . A Journalist of Genius would know their value , understand their case , take care of their interest , secure their devotion , restrain their ardor , and turn their t*alent to rich account . We are ashamed to say , that for example of this kind of policy we should have to repair to the office named a moment since . This subject , however , is beginning to be understood , and of late there has been some advance in the salaries of members of the press . Just as fast as the daily press advances in real independence and efficiency , the compensation of journalists will increase , until a great reporter will receive a reward in some slight degree proportioned to the rarity of the species and to the greatness of the services of which he is the medium . By feporters , we mean , of course , the entire corps of news-givers , from the youth who relates the burning of a stable , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphysician . These laborious men will be appreciated in due time . By them all the great hits of journalism have been made , and the whole future of journalism is theirs . So difficult is the reporter 's art , that we can call to mind only two series of triumphant efforts in this department , - Mr. // Russell 's letters from the Crimea to the London Times , and N. P. Willis 's " Pencillings by the Way , " addressed to the New York Mirror . Each of these masters chanced to have a subject perfectly adapted to his taste and talents , and each of them made the most of his opportunity . Charles Dickens has produced a few exquisite reports . Many ignorant and dull men employed on the New York Herald have written good reports because they were dull and ignorant . In fact , there are two kinds of good reporters , - those who know too little , and those who know too much , to wander from the point and evolve a report from the depths of their own consciousness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent , and depends upon that to make up for the meagreness of his information . The best reporter is he whose sole object is to relate his event exactly as it occurred , and describe his scene just as it appeared ; and this kind of excellence is attainable by an honest plodder , and by a man of great and well-controlled talent . If we were forming a corps of twenty-five reporters , we should desire to have five of them men of great and highly trained ability , and the rest indefatigable , unimaginative , exact short-hand chroniclers , caring for nothing but to get their fact and relate it in the plainest English . There is one custom , a relic of the past , still in vogue in the offices of daily papers , which is of an absurdity truly exquisite . It is the practice of paying by the column , or , in other words , paying a premium for verbosity , and imposing a fine upon conciseness . It will often happeii that information which cost three days to procure can be well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a paragraph , would be of very great value to the newspaper printing it . But if the reporter should compress his facts into that space , he would receive for his three days ' labor about what he expended in omnibus fare . Like a wise man , therefore , he spreads them out into three columns , and thus receives a compensation upon which life can be supported , if matter must be paid for by the column , we would respectfully suggest the following rates : - For half a column , or less , twenty dollars ; for one column , ten dollars ; for two columns , five dollars ; for three columns , nothing ; for any amount beyond three columns , no insertion. // To conclude with a brief recapitulation : - The commodity in which the publishers of daily newspapers deal is news , i. e. information respecting recent events in which the public take an interest , or in which an interest can be excited . Newspapers , therefore , rank according to their excellence as flew8papers ; and no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one thing for which they exist . Oonseque , ntly , the art of editorship consists in forming , handling , and inspiring a corps of reporters ; for inevitably that news paper becomes the chief and favorite journal which has the best corps of reporters , and uses them best . Editorial articles have their importance . They can be a powerful means of advancing the civilization of a country , and of hastening the triumph of good measures and good men ; and upon the use an editor makes of his opportunity of addressing the public in this way depends his title to our esteem as a man and fellow-citizen . But , in a mere business point of view , they are of inferior importance . The best editorials can not make , nor the worst editorials mar , the fortune of a paper . Burke and Macaulay would not add a tenth part as many subscribers to a daily paper as the addition to its corps of two well-trained , ably-commanded reporters . It is not law which ever renders the press free and independent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not powerful . Therefore , the editor who would conquer the opportunity of speaking his mind freely , must do it by making his paper so excellent as a vehicle of news that the public will buy it though it is a daily disgust to them . The Herald has thriven beyond all its competitors , because its proprietor comprehended these simple but fundamental truths of his vocation , and , upon the whole , has surpassed his rivals both in the getting and in the display of intelligence . We must pronounce him the best journalist and the worst editorialist this continent has ever known ; and accordingly his paper is generally read and its proprietor universally disapproved . And finally , this bad , good paper can not be reduced to secondary rank except by being outdone in pure journalism . The interests of civilization and the honor of the United States // require that this should be done . There are three papers now existing-the Times , the Tribune , and the World-which ought to do it ; but if the conductors of neither of these able and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then we trust that soon another competitor may enter the field , conducted by a journalist proud enough of his profession to b* satisfied with its honors . There were days last winter on which it seemed as if the whole force of journalism in the city of New York was expended in tingeing and perverting intelligence on the greatest of all the topics of the time . We have read numbers of the World ( which has talent and youthfuj energy enough for a splendid career ) of which almost the entire contents - correspondence , telegrams , and editorials - were spoiled for all useful purposes by the determination of the whole corps of writers to make the news tell in favor of a political party . We can truly aver , that journalism , pure a4 simple , - journalism for its own sake , - journalism , the diepassionate and single-eyed servant of the whole public , - does not exist in New York during a session of Congress . It ought to exist.               @ @ @ @ @ @
