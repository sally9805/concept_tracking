txt THESE are important documents , if not on account of their own intrinsic merits , at least on . account of the positions occupied by their authors . If they have not the merit of able state papers , they have the merit of containing some facts very important to be known and duly appreciated by the people of the United States . They have also the merit of containing the strong points of the argument ( if the argument have any strong points ) in favor of free trade , and a labored defence of that suicidal tariff act of 1846 . These documents give us the practical operation of that act during seven months of the fiscal year ending the 30th of June , 1847 , and in part its practical operation for one whole year , commencing December 1st , 1846 , and ending November 30th , 1847 . Why the practical operation of the act for the latter period was not given in full , is what we should like to know , but which neither the President nor the Secretary has seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , we shall be able to ascertain pretty accurately the facts withheld . The President , for example , states that the amount of revenue paid into the Treasury during the first year of the tariff of 1846 , was about thirty-one and a half millions of dollars .. But he does not tell us either the amount of exports or imports during that year , and of course we can not ascertain the average per centum of duties upon the whole importation of that year ; but as the amounts of exports and imports for the fiscal year ending the 30th June , 1847 , and also the amount of duties collected on those imports are given , we can ascertain precisely the average per centum of duty upon the whole importation of that year , which will enable us to guess pretty accurately what was the average per centum of duty on the whole importation for the year ending the 30th November . With these data , therefore , we shall be able to test the comparative merits of the tariffs of 1842 and 1846 . Both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the superiority of what they call revenue tariffs over all other tariffs , and especially over tariffs for protection . Thus the President in his message to Congress in December , 1845 , says " The object of imposing duties on imports should be to raise revenue to pay the necessary expenses of government . Congress may , undoubtedly , in the exercise of a sound discretion , discriminate in arranging the rates of duty on different articles ; but the discriminations should be within the revenue standard , and be made with the view to raise money for the support of government . " What the President means by the phrase , revenue standard , will perhaps appear more clearly from the following exquisite piece of reasoning " It becomes important to understand distinctly what is meant , by a revenue standard , the maximum of which should not be exceeded in the rates of duty imposed . It is conceded , and experience proves , that duties may be laid so high as to diminish or prohibit altogether the importation of any given article , and there ' by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be derived from its importation . Such duties exceed the revenue rates , and are not imposed to raise money for the support of government , If Congress levy a duty for revenue of one per cent . on a given article , it will produce a given amount of money to the treasury , and will incidentally and necessarily afford protection or advantage to the amount of one per cent . to the home manufacturer of a similar or like article , over the importer . If the duty be raised to ten per cent. , it will produce a greater amount of money , and afford greater protection . If it be still raised to twenty , twenty-five , or thirty per cent. , and if , as it is raised , the revenue derived from it is found to be increased , th' protection or advantage will also be increased ; but if it be raised to thirty-one per cent. , and it is found that the revenue prodnced at that rate is less than at thirty per cent. , it ceases to be a revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties at which it is ascertained from experience that the revenue is greatest , is the maximum 384 April , // rate of duty which can be laid for the bona fide purpose of collecting money for the support of government . To raise the duties higher than that point , and thereby diminish the amount collected , is to levy them for protection merely , and not for revenue . As long , then , as Congress may gradually increase the rate of duty on a given article , and the revenue is increased by such increase of duty , they are within the revenue standard . When they go beyond that point , and as they increase the duties , the revenue is diminished or destroyed , the act ceases to have for its object the raising of money to support government , but is for protection merely . " The object of the above reasoning , if we are able to comprehend it , is to prove that a certain low tariff of , say , fifteen or twenty per centum , will produce more revenue than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of duty which will produce the most revenue may be ascertained by actual experiment , and that rate , whatever it shall be found to be , is the revenue standard . Now this is all mere hypothesis and delusion , without a single fact to support it . There is no such revenue standard , nor is it true that a low tariff will produce as much revenue as a higher one , except where the low tariff prevents smuggling ; and we are much mistaken if the President 's own figures do not prove this . The President and his Secretary appear to have adopted , as the basis of their system of finance , Dean Swift 's celebrated paradox , that in political arithmetic two and two do not make four . If the President means to say , that a low tariff of five or ten per centum on coarse cotton fabrics , will produce more revenue from those fabrics than a high tariff of fifty or one hundred per centum would do , then he asserts a fact which nobody ever denied or disputed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the import of the article , and would therefore produce no revenue at all . If this was what the President meant , it was a mere truism , and required no argument to sustain it . But if his meaning was , that an average tariff of twenty per centum on the whole importation , will produce more revenue than an average tariff of forty per centum on the whole importation , then he asserts a palpable and plain absurdity , equivalent to asserting that the half is greater than the whole . The President 's parade of argument , therefore , is either for the purpose of proving a truism which nobody denies , or an absurdity which no sensible man believes . There is a well established principle of political economy , which neither the President , nor the Secretary of the Treasury , nor indeed any of their sect of political economists , seem ever to have learned ; which shows , if not the absurdity , at least the futility of their idea of a revenue standard of duties on different articles of import . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should , control the imports , without regard to the rate of the duties . No nation should ever import more than the net proceeds of its exports . If this rule is violated , disaster immediately follows , as our own experience abundantly proves . A government , therefore , which encourages its citizens to import more than the net proceeds of their exports , violates a fundamental principle of political economy . The imports of a nation , however , always do , and always must , exceed by seven or eight per centum , the nominal exports . This excess of imports is caused by the profits , or net proceeds , of the exports above the valuation . Every merchant who exports a cargo of goods expects to realize , not only their original cost , but a profit on them . He expects to exchange his goods for others of more value to him , or for money ; and the must be imported or there is an end to commerce . When a nation has got its proportion of the precious metals adjusted to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importation of specie , because it is worth more abroad than at home , and there will be a profit on the importation of goods and exportation of money . Now , unless a high tariff on imports will prevent the export and sale of our surplus products , to those who are willing to , give a good price for them , the rate of duty on the proceeds will not prevent them from being imported . So long , then , as our exports amount to a hundred millions of dollars a year , under a tariff that shall average fifty , or even one hundred per centum , our imports will equal or exceed that amount . It is true that a horizontal tariff of one hundred per 1848. // centum upon all importations , would entirely exclude a large portion of our present imports-all those that are produced , or could be conveniently produced , in the country ; but other articles would he substituted in their place , so as to equal the full amount of our exports . The only effect , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as coarse cotton fabrics , would be to exclude that article and substitute some other in its place to an equal amount and value . Although an increase of duty , therefore , on cotton goods , may decrease the revenue on that article , yet it does not follow , as the President seems to suppose , that the general revenue will be diminished , although such might be the case . If , for example , the duty on cotton and woollen goods should be increased to such a point as to exclude ten millions of them from our market , and articles paying no duty at all should be substituted in their place , the general amount of revenue would be diminished ; but he xvould be but a shallow politician who could not prevent such a result . The truth of this theory is proved by the history of every commercial nation in the world . Our imports have exceeded our exports every year since the government was established , with the exception , perhaps , of a single year . The same is true of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate of their tariffs . If the advocates of low tariffs will show a single exception to this rule , we will give up the argument . There is a class of goods , however , unon which high duties will produce less revenue than low duties , although the high duties may not diminish the amount of imports . These are goods of small bulk and great value , such u.s jewelry , expensive laces , &amp;c . A high duty on such goods would cause them to be *muggled to a great extent , and thus defeat the revenue . But the idea that an average high duty on the staple articles of consumption will prevent them from being imported through the custom-house , is utterly absurd . If it were otherwise , a tariff of two or three hundred per cent . on the transportation of oysters from Baltimore to Cincinn " ti would prevent them from being consumed in Cincinnati . If our government were to enact a tariff which should be equivalent to an average duty of fifty per centum upon the whole import of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of dollars , so long as our exports equalled a hundred millions of dollars ; and if our exports should equal one hundred and fifty millions of dollars , the duties on imports would equal seventy-five millions of dollars . The revenue has always been found to rise or fall in amount in proportion as the general average has been raised or lowered . The President 's own figures will show this . In his message to Congress in December , 1845 , he states the exports of domestic products for the fiscal year ending the 30th June , 1845 , to have been of the value of ninety-nine and threetenths millions of dollars . ( We omit fractions less than tenths . ) The imports for consumption for the same year , were of the value of one hundred and one millions of dollars , and the receipts into the Treasury on the above amount of imports , was twenty-seven and five-tenths millions of dollars , equal , within a small fraction , to twenty-seven per centum upon the whole import of that year . This was under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( December , 1846 , ) the President says : " The value of the exports for the fiscal year ending the 30th June , 1846 , amounted to one bandred and two and one-tenth millions of dollars . The imports for consumption for the same year , were of the value of one hundred and ten and three-tentbs millions of dollars . The duties paid into the Treasury upon the above amount of imports , was twenty-six and seven-tenths millions of dollars , " equal to twenty-four and a fraction per centum upon the whole importation for that year . This was also under the tariff of 1842 . Although the tariff is the same in different years , yet the average of duties will vary one or two per centum in different years , in consequence of larger proportions of free goods , or goods paying a low-duty , being imported one year than another . In his late message the President states the exports of domestic products for the fiscal year ending the 30th of June last , at one hundred and fifty and six-tenths millions of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specie for the same year , were one hundred and sixty and seven-tenths millions of dollars in value . Excluding specie , the imports amounted to one hundred.and thirty-eight and fivetenths millions of dollars , the duties upon which were twenty-three and seven-tenths millions of dollars , equal to fourteen and a fraction per centum upon the whole importation , including specie . Excluding specie , which paid no duty , the per centum of duty was seventeen and a fraction . During five months of this fiscal year , the tariff of 1842 was in operation , and in that time seven and eight-tenths millions of dollars were collected , leaving but fifteen and nine-tenths millions to be collected inder the tariff of 1846 . The actual average tariff of 1846 is , therefore , a good deal less than seventeen per centum ; but as our cause does not require us to stand for trifles , we will allow that the average duty under the tariff of 1846 was seventeen , per centum . This makes the tariff of 1846 about nine or ten per cent . lower than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the treasury from twelve to fifteen millions of dollars less than they would have been under the tariff of 1842 . In 1845 twenty-seven millions of revenue were collected on one hundred and two millions of imports . In 1846 twentysix millions of revenue were collected on one hundred and ten millions of iriiports , and in 1847 but twenty-four millions of revenue ( we give the benefit of the fraction ) were collected on one hundred and thirty-eight and five-tenths millions of imports , exclusive of twenty-two millions of specie . This enormous amount of exports and consequent imports , was caused by the bountiful harvest in this country and the dearth in Europe , and not in any degree by our tariff ; and yet the President and his Secretary have the hardihood , not to say audacity , to argue before the American people the superiority of the tariff of 1846 over the tariff of 1842 as a revenue measure . These high functionaries have not only attempted to maintain the superiority of that miserable delusion , which they have christened a revenue tariff , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make them speak favorably of their bantling . Thus the President tells us that " The net revenue from customs in the year ending on the 1st of December , 1846 , being the last year under the operation of the tariff act of 1842 , was $22,971,403 10 ; and the net revenue from customs during the year ending Dec. 1st , 1847 , being the first year under the operation of the tariff act of 1846 , was about $31,500,000 ; being an increase of revenue for the first year , under the tariff act of 1846 , of more than $8,600,000 over that of the last year of the tariff of 1842 . " But facts are stubborn things , and figures will not lie , even to accommodate the President . The above paragraph could have been put into the President 's message for no other purpose but to deceive . The object was to make the people believe that the tariff of 46 was more productive of revenue than the tariff of 42 , else why not give the exports and imports for the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have appeared that twenty-two and nine-tenths millions of revenue were collected on less than one hundred millions of imports , while only thirty-one and fivetenths millions of revenue were collected on nearly or quite two hundred millions of imports , and nearly the same amount of exports . This is too paltry , if not for the man , at least for the officer who wrote it . During the first year of the operation of the . tariff of 1846 , the treasury has lost from twelve to fifteen millions of dollars , which would have been raised under the tariff of 1842 . But the President and the free trade sect of politicians will , no doubt , tell us , that whatever the treasury may have lost by a low rate of duty , the people have gained ; that if the people have more taxes to pay in consequence of the low rate of duties , they have more to pay with ; all of which is as false as their theory . Among political economists of the old school , with Adam Smith at their head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever taxes were collected upon an article ofeonsumption , whether it was by an excise or an impost , must be ultimately paid by the consumer ; so that if twenty-five per cent . of duties were collected on an article imported for consumption , the coiisumer would have to pay twenty-five per cent . more for it than if no duty had been collected on it . This was a plausible but superficial theory , and it was received and 84:S. 387 // acted on for a long time ; but its falsity is susceptible of invincible demonstration . An impost is not strictly speaking a tax . Taxes are levied upon citizens and property within the jurisdiction of the government laying the tax . An impost is a bonus which the owner of property is required to pay for the privilege of bringing it within the territorial limits of another government for sale or use . The owner of the property upon which a tax is laid , has no option whether he will pay the tax or not ; but the owner of property upon which an impost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring his property within the jurisdiction of the government and pay the impost , or keep it out of that jurisdiction and save the impost . If he chooses to pay the impost and bring it into the country , he will then sell it for the most he can get , without any regard to the impost he has paid on it . Should lie attempt to regulate the price by tim impost he had paid , he would be laughed at for his folly . Between buyer and seller the duty paid on an article is never inquired after or thought of ; the market price is their standard . A large portion of the foreign goods sold in our market , and which have paid a duty of twenty-five or thirty per cent. , are sold at auction , and do not bring a cent more than they would , . if they had been imported free of duty . Up to about twenty-five on thirty per cent. , there is no doubt whatever , but what the foreign producer , and not the consumer , pays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in many cases the whole amount of the duties collected on the aoods . It is not , therefore , true that the people have gained what the treasury may have lost , under the operation of the tariff of 1846 . During the first year of that absurd measure , the country has lost from ten to twelve millions of dollars , and will continue to lose that much per annum as long as it shall be permitted to remain on the statute book . This has caused large deficits , and will continue to cause still larger deficits , in the treasury , which the President and his Secretary propose to supply by a tax on tea and coffee , now admitted free of duty , by a reduction in the price of the public lands , and by a loan , the present year , of 18,500,000 . It is perfectly right and just to lay an impost on tea and coffee . Indeed , the true policy of this country , and of every country , is to let no article of commerce be imported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy expense , annually , for the accommodation and protection of the commerce of the country ; and every person , whether citizen or alien , who p rticipates in the benefit of that commerce , ought to pay a portion of that expense , for the same reason , that every person who transports his property on railroads and canals ought to pay toll . No foreign goods , therefore , ought to be admitted into the country without paying a duty of at least five or ten per cent . It would , therefore , be good policy to lay . a specific duty of at least two cents a pound on coffee , and five and ten cents a pound on tea . Notwithstanding what the President and his Secretary may say to the contrary , yet the experience of all commercial nations proves , that specific duties , where they can be laid , are preferable to ad valorem duties . But as their theory of finance is built upon paradoxes , it was to be expected that they would reject experience . The policy of reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing the amount of revenue from them , is about as wise as reducing the rates of duty for the purpose of increasing the amount of revenue . The following quotation from the late Report of the Secretary of the Treasury , exhibits his policy in regard to the public lands , and his reasons for it . Although rather long , yet it is such a beautiful specimen of the Secretary 's reasoning powers , that we have not the heart to mutilate it " The recommendations in my first as well as *econd annual Report of the reduction of the price of the public lands in favor of settlers and cultivators , together with the removal of onerous restrictions upon the pre-emption laws , are again respectfully presented to the consideration of Congress . Sales at the reduced price , it is thought , should be confined to settlers and cultivators , in limited qu ntities , sufficient for farm and plantations , and the pre-emption privilege extended to every bone fide settler , and embrace all lands , whether surveyed or unsurveyed , to which the Indian title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at private sale on the first of this month were . AprL. , // 152,101,001 acres , and the unsurveyed lands to which the Indian title has been extinguished 71,048,214 acres , ( per table Z. ) The adoption of these two measures , for the reasons stated in my previous reports , would augment the revenue a million and a half of dollars per annum , operating as they would on 223,149,215 acres . It would , at the same time , increase the wages of labor , by enabling a much larger number of the working classes to purchase farms at the low price , whilst it would , at the same time , augment the wealth and power of the whole country . " When the public lands have been offered a long time for a price they will not bring , the failure to reduce the price is equivalent in its effects to an enactment by Congress that these lands shall not be sold and settled for an unlimited period . The case is still stronger as to the unsurveyed lands : there beiug an act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminals , and as trespassers , . the American pioneers who would desire to enter in advance into the wilderness , cover it with farms and towns , with the church and the school-house , extend over it the blessings of our free institutions , and enlarge by the axe and the plough , the cultivated area of the American Union . " Should the system proposed be now adopted , the surveyed as well as the unsurveyed lands opened to pre-emptors , and the Indian title extinguished within the coming year , or that which succeeds it , in addition to Iowaand Wisconsin , we should soon have two new States , Winesota and Itasca , in the great valley of the West , adjoining Wisconsin apd Iowa . Instead of draining the old States of their pbpulation , the graduation and pre-emption system will , in a series of years , increase their prosperity by giving them customers in the west who will carry to them their products and receive their imports or fabrics in exchange , increasing the transportation upon our railroads and canals , and augmenting our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proceeds of the sales of these lands is prevented for at least twenty years by the act of 28th January , 1847 , setting apart and pledging their proceeds to the extinguishment of the public debt . So far also as distribution may have been advocated with a view to favor aprotective tariff , it is now proved that a tariff for revenue not only yields a larger income than the protective system , but also advances more rapidly , in a series of years , the prosperity of the manufacturers themselves , by the augmentation of their foreign and domestic markets . " The present price of the public lands is one dollar and a quarter per acre , and the Secretary thinks , if their price was reduced to seventy-five or fifty cents per acre , ( although he does not say hQw much , ) VOL . I. NO . IV . NEW SERIES . 26 the revenue from them would be increased one and a half millions of dollars per annum ; and , according to the same reasoning , if they were reduced to twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still greater , for the same reason that an average duty of twenty-five per cent . on imports , will produce more revenue than fifty per cent . would do . But whether there be a revenue standard of the public lands , or what that standard is , if there be one , we are not informed . Now it strikes us that the reason more lands are not sold , is because more are not wanted for settlement and cultivation , and not because of their high price . To those who want them , the public lands are very cheap at a dollar and a quarter per acre ; to those who do not want them , they would be dear at twenty-five cents an acre . A certain portion of the population of the old States desire annually to emigrate and settle on the public lands . In other words , there is a market for a given number of acres of the public lands every year . The quantity wanted increases as our population increases , nor can it be essentially increased by reducing the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a dime an acre , the great mass of the population in the old States would not buy them . The Secretary 's project , therefore , for increasing the revenue , by a reduction in the price of the public lands , would be very likely to result as his project for increasing the revenue from imports , by reducing the rate of duty , has resulted . By reducing the price of those lands which have been a long time in the market , he would probably divert a part of th' current of emigration to those lands , and thereby prevent the sale of those of higher price , which would still farther diminish the revenue . The million and a half of revenue , therefore , anticipated from this project , is not likely to be realized , and that sum will also have to be supplied by loan . All the Secretary 's e*timates are based upon the exports , and consequent imports , of 1847 , and can , therefore , never be realized except in years of famine in Europe ; and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan of $18,500,000 , to carry on the government the present year . Add to this the millP*n and a half which he ex 1848. 389 // pects , but will not get , from the public lands , and the amount wanted will be twenty millions . Thus he says " The new tariff has now been in operation more than twelve months , and has greatly augmented the revenue and prosperity of the country , The net revenue from duties during the twelve months ending 1st December , 1847 , under the new tariff , is $31,300,000 , being $8,528,396 more than was received during the twelve months preceding , under the tariW of 1842 . The net revenue of the first quarter of the first fiscal year , under the new tariff , was $11,106,267 41 cents , whilst , in the same quarter of the , preceding year , under the tariff of 1842 , the net revenue was only $6,1*3,826 58 . If the revenue for the . three remaining quarters should e*4ual in the , average the first , then the net revenue from duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $44,426,029 64 . If , however , the comparison is founded on all the quarterly returns for fortyeight years , ( as far back as given quarterly in the treasury record , ) and the same proportion for the several quarters applied , to the first quarter of the year , it would make its net revenue , per table C , $40,388,045 . Although the net revenue from duties already received , being $15,506,257 41 , during the five months of this fiscal year , would seem to indicate its probable amount not less than $35,000,000 , yet it is estimated at $31,000,000 for the fiscal year ending 30th June , 1848 , and $32,000,000 for the succeeding year , in view of the possible effects of the revulsion in Great Britain . Although our prosperity is ascribed to the famine there , as though Providence had made the advance of one country depend upon the calamities of another , yet it is certain that our trade with Great Britain must be greater in a series of years , when prosperity would enable her to buy more from us ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us more in exchange , accompanied by an augmentation of revenue . " therefore to predict , that instead of thirtyone millions of dollars from the customs , the treasury will not receive over tweniysix , and probably less than twenty-five millions . Had the Secretary given us the imports and exports from the first of December , 1846 , to the first of December , 18&amp;7 , we could have predicted with more confidence . Supposing , then , that all the other estimates and calculations of the Secretary are correct , which they are far from being , and he will need a loan ; the present year , of more than twenty-five millions of dollars . Now an addition of seventeen per cent . to the present duties , properly distributed over the whole of our imports , would have produced just about that sum , and this would be a much more statesman-like measure , than a loan of twenty-five millions of dollars in the present , , or any other condition of public credit likely to exist , under the administration of President Polk and Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir R. Peel , then Premier of England , made the following exhibit to the House of Commons , as his estimate of the sources and amount of the British revenue , for the year ending the 6th of April , 1843 I estimate the revenues , says the Premier , at Customs , - - - ? 22,500,000 .

The only material reduction in the British tariW which our free trade party bruit so much , is the reduction of the duties on bread stuffs and provisions , which never amounted to a million of dollars a year . The population of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year our exports of domestic products , in value , never exceeded about one hundred millions of dollars , sometimes a little more , and sometimes a little less . The population of the British isles may he estimated at twenty-eight millions . There can be no doubt , but what the exports of the United States , in proportion to their population , are , and always have been , equal to the exports of England in proportion to her population . As England manufactures nearly everything for herself , it is natural to suppose that ours would be the largest , but suppose them to be equal ; then if twenty millions of people export . one hundred millions of produce , . twenty-eight millions of people would export one hundred and forty millions of produce ; or if we take the last year as the base of our calculations , and that twenty millions of people exported one hundred and fifty millions of produce , then , by the same rule , twenty-eight millions of people would export two hundred and ten millions of produce , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per centum upon the whole imports of England . This exhibit of the English Premier shows what an enormous amount of revenue may be collected from imports without oppression or inconvenience to the people . Although England collects over one hundred millions of dollars per annum from her commerce , which by somebody , with little or no complaint by the people of England , except the trifling sum collected on bread stuffs . Take away the corn laws , which have not yielded a hundred thousand pounds sterling a year for the last twenty years , and there has been little or no complaint by the people of England , about the duties on English imports . The oppressiveness of English taxation proceeds from the excise , the land tax , the window tax , and the hearth tax-in short ; from the taxes properly so called , and not from the imports , which , properly speaking , are not taxes . Except for the necessaries of life , no man pays an impost unless he pleases , and the necessaries of life are the subject of imposts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a general rule , every nation prpduces its own necessaries of life . A nation that depended on other nations for any considerable portion of the necessaries of life , would be in a very precarious condition , and could not long exist as a nation . Besides , the domestic product in every nation always regulates the market for the necessaries of life , such as bread and meat ; and hence , the importer , or foreign producer , and not the consumer , must pay the impost on these articles . Therefore it is , that the market price of flour in England regulates the price of flour in Ohio . If a duty of one dollar a barrel is laid on flour in England , flour immediately falls a dollar a barrel in Ohio . If that duty is taken off , flour rises a dollar a barrel in Ohio ; so that an English impost on flour is , in reality , a tax on the people of Ohio and others , who supply the English markets , and not on the people of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not raise the price of flour to the consumer ten cents a barrel . The balance of the impost would have to be paid by the producer . Hence , the hundred millions of dollars of revenue , which England annually collects from her commerce , is not paid by the people of England , but by the people of the whole world with whom she deals . This is one of the main-springs of England 's power . She levies tribute upon the whole world , but pays tribute to nobody . She merely humbugs the nations with the phantom of free trade . So long as no duty is imposed on tea , coffee , and spices , an opulent farmer and a comfortable liver in our country will be under no necessity of consuming a single article in his family on which either a tax or a duty has been paid by anybody . How absurd then to talk about an impost being oppressive to the people . What we call the comforts and luxuries of life , 1848. // are the principal subjects of duties , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stronger an article smells of money , the more distinction its use will confer , and the more it will be coveted by those who have the means of paying for it . There is therefore no danger that high duties will ever prevent the importation of foreign products , to the full amount of our exports . The history of English commerce furnishes abundant proof of this fact . A duty of four or five hundred per centum does not prevent the consumption of tobacco in England , from which the government derives an enormous revenue . The greater portion of this revenue , it is true , is paid by the consumers , but up to some thirty or forty per cent . the producer would pay a part . So a duty by our government , of two or three hundred per cent . on wine and silks , would not prevent them from being imported and consumed in large quantities . Who ever heard of an article of luxury being so dear , that nobody would buy it ? High duties are as much and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if the duties are included in the price the consumer pays for the goods , the producer would have no cause to complain of the duty . If a duty of a dollar a barrel on flour raised the price of flour a dollar a barrel in the English market , what cause would the American producer have to complain of the duty ? Every nation strives , by treaty or otherwise , to have its products subjected to as low a duty as possible by foreign governments ; but if the consumer pays the duty , they need give themselves no trouble on that subject . If , then , England collects a revenue of over a hundred millions of dollars on her commerce , how easily could the United States collect half that sum on their commerce . But Mr. Secretary Walker will find that this can not be done by reducing the duties on imports . For what purpose the following fanfaronade was put into the Secretary 's Report we are at a loss to conceive . Perhaps he thought he could darken counsel by a cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blunders from the public eye ; but if this was his object , he will find himself mistaken . His facts in the following quotation are all false , and his conclu sions absurd , as we shall proceed to show . We owe an apology to our readers , for so long a quotation of such stuff , but we could not well abridge or divide it without marring its beauty . The Secretary says : " In my report of July 22,1846 , it was shown that the annual value of our products exceeds three thousand millions of dollars . Our population doubles once in every twenty-three years , and our products quadruple in the same period - that being the time within which a sum compounding itself quarter yearly at six per cent . interest will be quadrupled-as is sustained here by the actual results . Of this $3,000 ,  - -  000,000 , only about $150,000,000 was exported abroad , leaving $2,850,000,000 , used at home , of which at least $500,009,000 is annually interchanged between the several States of the Union . Under this system , the larger the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil , and products , . the more extensive is the commerce which must exist between the States , and the greater the value of the Union . We see then here , under the system of free trade ampng the States of the Union , an interchange of products of the annual value of at least $500,000,000 among our twenty-one millions of people ; whilst our total exchanges , including imports and exports , with all the world besides , containing a population of a thousand millions , was last year $305,194,260 , being an increase since the new tariff over the preceding year of $79,014,647 . Yet the exchanges between our States , consisting of a population of twenty-one millions , being of the yearly value of $500,000,000 exchanged , make such exchange in our own country equal to $23 81 per individual annually of our own products , and reduces the exchange of our own and foreign products , ( our imports and exports , ) considered as $300,000,000 with all the rest of the world , to the annual value of thirty cents to each individual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanges annually of our own products as much as seventy-nine persons of other countries . Were this exchange with foreign countries extended to ninety cents each , it would bring our imports and exports up to $900,000,000 per annum , and our annual revenue from duties to a sum exceeding $90,000,000 . An addition of thirty cents each to the consumption of our products exchanged from State to State by our own people , would furnish an increased market of the value only of $6,300,000 ; whereas an increase of thirty cents each , by a system of liberal exchanges with the people of all the world , would give us a market for an additional value of $300,000,000 per annum of our exports . Such an addition can not occur by refusing to receive in exchange the products of other nations , and demanding the $300 ,  - -  000,000 per annum in specie , which could never 392 April , // be supplied . But , by receiving foreign products at low duties in exchange for our exports , such an augmentation might take place . The only obstacle to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freight from New Orleans to Boston differs but little from that between Liverpool and Boston ; and the freight from many points in the interior is greater than from England to the United States . Thus the average freight from the Ohio river to Baltimore is greater than from the latter place to Liverpool ; yet the annual exchanges of products between the Ohio and Baltimore exceed by many millions that between I3altimore and Liverpool . The Canadas and adjacent provinces upon our borders , with a population less than two millions , exchange imports and exports with us less in amount than the State of Connecticut , with a population of 300 ,  - -  000 ; showing that , if these provin.ces were united with us by free trade , our annual exchanges with them would rise to $40,000,000 . It is not the freight , then , that creates the chief obstacle to interchanges of products between ourselves and foreign countries , but the duties . When we reflect , also , that exchange of products depends chiefly upon diversity-which is greater between our own country and the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union-under a system of reciprocal free trade with all the world , the augmentation arising from greater diversity of products would equal the diminution caused by freight . Thus , the Southern States exchange no cotton with each other , nor the Western States flour. , nor the manufacturing States like fabrics . Diversity of products is essential to exchanges ; and if En* , land and America were united by absolute free trade , the recIprocal exchanges between them would soon far exceed the whole foreign commerce of both ; and with reciprocal free trade with all nations , our own country , with its pre-eminent advantages , would measure its annual trade in imports and exports by thousands of millions of dollars . " This learned Report , in which the Secretary says he has shown that the annual amount of our products exceeds three thousand millions of dollars , we have never seen , and we are therefore unacquainted with the , process of reasoning by which he thinks he has shown that magnificent fact . We suppose , however , that he has made use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commissioner of Patents . But we care not for his statistics or his estimates . We know , and every man of common sense who will reflect a moment upon the subject , may know , that they are false to an enormous extent . The products of last year , the largest ever made in the United States , did not exceed , and probably fell short of fifteen hundred millions of dollars in value . It is a well established principle of political economy , that the consumption of a nation must , and always will , about equal its production . If then three thousand millions were produced in a year , three thousand millions must , in so*ae form br Qther , be consumed in a year , or it wQuld not answer the purpose for which it was produced . Now does any man in his senses believe , that this nation ever consumed , in one year , products of the value of three thousand millions of dollars ? Suppose the people of the United States to be twenty millions , and the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty dollars in value . Now can any man who has any knowledge of the daily fare of the great mass of our population , believe , that men , women , children and slaves consume upon an average products of the value of on* hundred and fifty dollars per annum ? The thing is wholly incredible . One hundred and fifty dollars would enable each individual to pay two dollars a week for his board , and have fifty dollars a yearwherewith to clothe himself . The people of the United States would be much indebted to Mr. Secretary Walker , if be would make good his assertion with regard to their wealth . The great mass of our population do not consume food of the value of thirty dollars a head per year , and although a great many ( yet a small number in comparison to the whole ) consume ten times that amount , yet if we set down sixty dollars a head as the amount consumed by each individual , it will probably be a liberal allowance , which would make the annual consumption twelve hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably the full amount of our annual production . There is another process of reasoning which will conduit us to about the same conclusion . Exclude women and children , and those classes who do not labor , and it will leave about one-fourth of the population for productive laborers . In a population then of twenty millions there will be five millions of productive laborers . Now these laborers must average six hundred dollars each in order to make an aggre 1848. 393 // gate of three thousand millions . But every man who knows anything about labor , knows that such a supposition is utterly absurd . If we suppose each laborer to produce two hundred and fifty dollars a year , it will be a liberal allowance . This would give an annual product of twelve hundred millions . In the division of this product between labor and capital , we should probably be required to give to labor two-thirds , equal to eight hundred millions , and to capital one-third , equal to four hundred milllons . As women and children engage in some labor , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laborers is too small ; but there are those who consider the number of voters in a State where suffrage is universal , a fair measure of the number of productive laborers . If so , then our estimate is too large . But if we have under-estimated the number of productive laborers , we have also over-estimated the product of each laborer , as every man knows- who has been either in the habit of laboring himself or employing others to labor for him . But extravagant and absurd *s the Secretary 's facts are , his reasoning upon those facts is , if possible , still more extravagant and absurd . Our population , he tells us , doubles every twenty-three years , and our products quadruple in the same time . And by what process of reasoning , gentle reader , do you suppose he arrives at such a sage conclusion ? Why , forsooth , the Secretary says , that " any sum compound-. ing itself quarter yearly at six per cent . interest , will be quadrupled in that time .. " Now if there be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are not able to perceive it . Can it be possible that the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States believes that our productions were four times as great in 1847 as they were in 1824 , and that they will be four times as great in 1870 as they were in 1847 ? It is to be feared that the statistics of the learned Secretary have addled his brain , and confounded his powers of ratiocination . Of this three thousand millions of products , only one hundred and fifty millions* are exchanged with foreign nations , equal to only fifteen cents a head on the whole population of the world . The balance is used at home , Of this balance five hundred millions are exchanged annually among the States , equal to twenty-three dollars and eighty-one cents per head of our whole population , and this , we are told , is in consequence of free trade among the States ! " If our foreign commerce were increased to ninety cents per head for the whole world , ( estimating the population of the world at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual revenue of at least niitety millions of dollars . " Surely , Mr. Secretary , were the sky to fall we should catch larks . " An addition of thirty cents for each individual to the consumption of our prcrducts exchanged from State to State , by our own people , would furnish an increased market of the value of only six and threetenths millions of dollars , whereas an increase of thirty cents each by a system of liberal exchanges with the people of all the world , would give us a market for an additional value of three hundred millions of dollars per annum of our exports . " Very true , Mr. Secretary ; but should we have the three hundred millions to exchange ? The proper way to cook your hare , we are told , is first to catch him . But the Secretary tells us , that , " by receiving foreign products at low duties , in exchange for our products , such an augmentation might take place ! " Very like * whale ! The only obstacles , says the Secretary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the contrary , that our laborers would find other obstacles to an increased production of three hundred million dollars worth of products . " The Canadas and adjacent provinces upon our borders , with a population of near two millions , exchange imports and exports with us , less in amount than the State of Connecticut , with a population of three hundred thousand , showing that if these provinces were united with us by free trade , our annual exchanges with them would rise to forty millions of dollars . " Surely , Mr. Secretary , you do n't say this in sober earnestness ! The Secretary winds up his fanfaronade with the following flourish : " If England and America were united by an absolute free trade , the reciprocal exchanges between them would soon far exceed the whole foreign commerce of both ; and with reciprocal free trade with all nations , our own country , with its pre-eminent t*dvantages , would measure its annual 394 Aprfl , // trade in imports and exports by thousands of millions . " We have no recollection of ever having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the Secretary 's figures are so strange , that we can not make head or tail of them , and presume them to be misprints . Take for example the following " By table BB , it appears that the augmentation of our domestic exports , exclusive of specie , last year , compared with the preceding year , was $48,856,802 , or upwards of 48 per Gent. , and , at the same rate per ceut. per annum of augmentation , would amount in 1849 , per table CC , to $329,969,993 , or much greater than the domestic export from State to State . ( See tables from 7 to 12 , inclusive . ) The future per percentage of increase may not be so great ; but our capacity forsuch increased production is proved to exist , and that we could furnish these exports far above the domestic demand , if they could be exchanged free of duty in the ports of all nations . " The 1*ollowing paragraph looks very much as though the Secretary either had become or was about to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some already have ) shall surely find it to be their true interest , in addition to the wages paid to the American workman , to allow him voluntarily , because it augments the profits of capital , a fair interest in these profits , and elevate him to the rank of a partner in the concern , we may then defy all competition . " But whatever may be the meaning of this , we are inclined to believe that the Secretary 's term of office is too short to enable him to convert the whole United States into phalanxes , groups and series . On this wise do the President and Secretary argue in favor of the tariff of 1846 ; but the merits of that act are not confined to the reduction of duties . * It is not only the reduced duties , that have produced these happy results , ( says the Secretary , ) but the mode of reduction , the substitution of the ad valore*n for unequal and oppressive minimums and specific duties . " But without quoting farther , it may be stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facc , as the basis of their arguments , that a specific duty upon an article which excludes it from our market , is a tax upon the consumer of the domestic article to the full amount of the duty . Thus , a duty of ten cents a yard on cotton goods , which sell in our market for eight cents a yard , is nevertheless a tax on the poor consumer of the domestic article of ten cents a yard ; and a duty of a dollar a pair on brogan shoes , would be a tax of a dollar a pair on American brogans , although they could be bought in any quantity for seventy-five cents a pair ; and so a duty of one dollar a bushel on wheat , would be a tax on the poor American laborer of one dollar a bushel on all the wheat with which he feeds his poor children , although fifty cents should be the highest price he ever paid for a bushel of wheat . Now this is all ad captandurn vul*qus , and the President and Secretary both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stump , yet when gravely put forth from the high places they occupy , it is a disgrace to the Republic . The Secretary also says , " The great argument for protection ( by which he means high duties ) is , that by diminishing imports the balance of trade is turned in our favor , bringing specie into the country . " If the Secretary does not know this to be an untruth , he is even a greater blockhead than we had supposed him to be . We have heard no such argument , by any intelligent advocate of either high duties or a protective tariff , in the last twenty-five years . That some very absurd arguments have been urged , both in and out of Congress , in favor of protecting duties , is very true , but Mr. Secretary Walker must not assume that he refutes the policy of a protecting tariff , by refuting some of the arguments of its advocates . It is true , that the old school political economists advocated high duties , for the purpose of increasing the imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fallacy of that idea before our revolution , and the doctrine has never prevailed in this country among intelligent political economists . High duties are advocated by those who understand the subject , for the purpose of replenishing the treasury . Protecting duties are advocated for the purpose of increasing and extending the market for our products ; for the purpose of securing to the farmers of Ohio , for example , a steady and sure market for all the products of their farms at their own // door , instead of leaving them to seek a market across the Atlantic ; for the purpose of enabling them to make their exchanges in Cincinnati instead of Liverpool . Protecting duties may or may not augment the revenue . If they afford complete protection , by excluding the foreign article altogether , they will not augment the revenue , because they will not increase the average of duty on the whole importatioh ; but if the duty is raised , but not so high as to exclude the foreign article , the revenue will be replenished . It does not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the general revenue will be increased by an increased revenue on a particular article . Protecting duties , therefore , may greatly increase and secure a market for our own products , without either increasing or diminishing the general revenue . The home market , notwithstanding all Mr. Secretary Walker may say to the contrary , is of three times the value to us , that the foreign is or even will be . Two things are essential to commerce : goods for sale , and a market where they can be sold ; in other words , sellers and buyers . If there be no goods for sale , there can be no market , and if there are no buyers there will be no goods for sale . But Mr. Secretary Walker seems to think that if we have plenty of buyers , not matter about the good.s , they will come of themselves when wanted . Hence our exports are to equal thousands of millions as soon as free trade shall give us all the world for customers " The new tariff , " says Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem is solved , and experience proves that the new system yields more revenue , enhances wages , and advances more rapidly the public prosperity , " than the old system , we suppose , though the Secretary does not say so . The experience of a year of famine in Europe , with the most bountiful harvest ever known in this country , has , in the opinion of the Secretary , solved the problem . The experience of a single extraordinary year has overthrown the experience of a hundred preceding ordinary years ! And although the revenue from a hundred and fifty millions of exports under the tariff of 1846 , was less than the revenue from one hundred and two millions under the tariff of 1842 , yet the problem is solved , that the new system produces more revenue than the old ! We have no patience to reason longer with so absurd a man , and therefore dismiss him . We can not , however , take our leave of the President , without expressing on* regret that he should have attempted to disguise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station ought to have placed him above all subterfuge or trickery for the purpose of sustaining a favorite theory . This dirty work should have been left to the understrappers of his party in Congress and out of it . When he gave forth the responses of the Treasury department , he should have given them forth fairly , and not have made one-sided statements . Why did he not confine himself to the fiscal year ending the 30th of June last ? Why lug in five months of the following year ? But if he thought proper to give the amount of revenue under the tariff of 1846 , why did he not also give the imports and exports of that year ? Was he afraid that the people would see th ' *t the revenue under the tariff of 1846 was some ten or twelve millions of dollars less than it would have been under the tariff of 1842 ? It almost surpasses belief ; that a man of common sense could be sincere in the opinion , that a reduction of the duties would increase the revenue ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his party leaders were sincere in that opinion , or they never would have passed an act which would greatly reduce the revenue , at the same time that they entered upon an expensive war , which would , at least , double the expenses of the Government . Had they doubled the duties instead of halving them , they would have acted much more like sensible men and practical statesmen . The people will find out by and by , that empirics and demagogues make expensive rulers . They will find it the cheapest course in the end to place capable men at the head of their Govern ment.
