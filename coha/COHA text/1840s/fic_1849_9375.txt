Then came intrepid women from their homes , Bearing petitions blotted with their tears ; I marked each faltering step and pleading gaze , And graceful gesture , as they urg 'd their suit : Rawdon , with courtly air and polished phrase , Received them , but denied their modest claim , While Balfour mingled scorn with harsh repulse ; Till , blinded by their tears , they turned away , Hope 's slight raft lost amid grief 's ocean-tide . Scarce had they gone , when , clad in mourning robes , With mourning hearts , still sadder suppliants came The prisoner 's children ,  --  no fond parents near To aid . The eldest boy , with anxious brow , Too early marked by care , advanced the first .

In close embrace she clasp 'd the hand of one , A younger blossom , on whom nursery cares Were yet employed , but who , not versed in tears , Stood by his father 's foes to plead with smiles . They knelt , that touching group ! and would have spoke , But stifling grief denied them utterance , And all that they could cry was , " Save my father ! " Once from the eldest boy these words were wrung , " My mother 's dead ! Two children share her grave , Take not my father too !

But when the stern denial was returned , Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd round with desperate glance , and clenched his hands , While a quick shriek of agony burst forth From those young mourners , and in wild despair Reeling , they fell into each other 's arms , And thus were borne , in agony , away .

Footnote : 1Kb Hayne alone , walking calmly as if in meditation  --  listens as the bell strikes twelve . HAYNE HAYNE speaks . St. Michael 's chime ! Oh what a throng of scenes From day to day its signal ushers in . The infant 's welcome birth it heralds , or The bridal hour ,  --  while often floats its peal In solemn requiems round the couch of death : And like a requiem sounds it now to me , For I am dying ; death is felt by him Who in the settled gloom of midnight , knows To-morrow 's shades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried one ! on whose still couch The planted flowers have scarcely oped in bloom ; And ye , fair buds of being , who did close So soon your veined lids in death ;  --  I come ! I come !  --  too thankful that this treacherous earth O'er you has lost its power :  --  Ye rest secure ! Ye war not with the reveries , conjuring up Dim , phantom forms , that in the midnight crowd Too often round my pillow ; nor the dreams ( Thank God ! they are but dreams , ) where faces peer In madd'ning glee upon my spirit 's eye : Nor , worse than all , that looking for of death , Untimely and degrading , where the soul Leaves not the placid clay in quiet peace , But all is struggling horror !  --  Blessed ones ! Your bed is green , and there , through flickering leaves The sun slants downward on the springing stems , And moonlight slumbers gently on the dew . Not by your grave the mob 's coarse shout is heard , But summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with death-bronzed look , Frowns not upon that spot , but gushing tears Drop tenderly from loving eyes .  --  ' T is well ! My children ! would that I could thus be laid Where , from the burnished oak , the hoary moss Waves its grey banner to the passing breeze .  --  Alas ! my noble boys and orphan girl , Who still contend with life 's tumultuous waves , My whole heart sickens and my head is faint With thoughts of you ,  --  left fatherless . O God ! How tenderly would I have nursed their youth , Rest of that blessed mother 's fostering love , Whose gentle eye is shrouded o'er by death , Nor longer beams above their breathing sleep , Shedding a constant sunlight over all . Death had been soften 'd , dear ones ! could but I Have lain my cheek to yours , and felt your hands Press down my dying lids with filial care , And borne a message of your love to her , Who waits to greet her household in the skies .

Yet ' neath the waves of woe upon my soul , I feel an under-current of stern joy , That I may die for thee .  --  Oh ! many a hand Now feeble , will be nerved with sudden strength When the sad story of my wrongs is heard .  --  Touch 'd by my fate , the daughters of the South Shall bend in mingled thought around my grave , Aveng 'd by brother-swords . New England 's sons Hearing the tale , and bracing up their souls Shall rush upon the foe , fierce as the winds Athwart their icy hills . Posterity Will not unkindly dwell upon my name . But , Heavenly Father ! this is not the hour To cling thus fervently to earthly things ;  --  Let these low clouds of thought , though colored up With deathless hues of love and loyalty , Roll off , and leave me with myself and Thee .

I could not join the crowd , But wrapt in bitter musings , here remained . And what a solemn hush ! The zepyhr 's breath Scarce ruffles yonder vessel 's snowy sail ; And the blue wave , with such a gentle plash As summer rivers yield , kisses the bastion : White clouds rest lightly on the upper deep , The oars-man 's stroke falls clearly , and behold ! The very winds disdain to lift on high The British flag , on yonder distant tower . Nature is still , but what a tempest wild Rages in human hearts . I can not breathe This air , and the midsummer 's sun is faint To the hot fire that kindles up my soul . O God ! sustain him ! ' t is a fearful thing , With perfect sense and strong corporeal power , To quit this gladsome earth . SECOND SOLDIER . SECOND SOLDIER .

When wert thou there ? SECOND SOLDIER . SECOND SOLDIER . Last evening , and my inmost heart retains The vision still . A messenger I went , And saw them all  --  the children and their sire . And through my future life , on memory 's height That scene will stand , like some lone , broken column , Sad , but most beautiful ! Beside the door At which I entered , stood a Hessian guard . Alas ! my country ! do I live to tell Of foreign hirelings , who thus lord it o'er thee ? A coffin was at hand , shrouded above With sable pall , save where an open space Display 'd the garniture of white within . I little marked the prison ; but we know War decks not oft , with niceties of show , The grated chamber , where the sentenced lie , Though downy pillows willing slaves have spread , And busy love , with an untiring zeal , Has ministered through life to each slight wish . A thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sudden gush Of anguish from his friends , as the smooth lake , When from a passing cloud the rain drops fall , Breaking its stillness , chafes , but silently , And then reflects all heaven in calm again . Upon his knee nestled the youngest boy , Who conscious seem 'd of grief he thought to soothe With pretty toying.  --  Double love was his .  --  His fair twin-blossom had been laid asleep In early death , within his mother 's arms , And shared her grave ; therefore the father 's voice Grew tremulous , when he addressed the boy , And therefore did he hide his face at times , When nature was too strong , ' mid the child 's curls . Claspt in his other arm , leaned a fair girl , Glowing and fresh in childhood 's ripening bloom . I did not see her face , for on his breast She hung like a cropt lily , while loud sobs Came deep and shivering from her youthful frame . But once ( her head uprais 'd to wipe the tears She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ready coffin ;  --  a wild shriek Of piteous woe still ringing on my ear , Burst from her lips ; then to her father 's neck She clung , claiming protection . E'en as one Resolved to bear his part , the elder boy Stood silent , though the gushing tears burst forth And roll 'd unheeded down . The martyr spoke ; And in that listening group a footfall slight , Such the intense excitement of the scene , Would have seemed loud as thunder ; for a voice So near the grave sounds like an oracle . " ' T is not so dread a thing , my friends , to die , If the firm mind rallies its better thoughts , And looks without this shell of earth . ' T is but The foretaste of some few short years , or days Perchance , when stern disease , with tyrant touch , Harsher than hangman 's hand , would act its part . Oh ! weep not thus : a coward had I been , Ye might have wept , for bitter are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I chiefly grieve that this my tragic fate May rouse the unholy passion of revenge , And war , with hydra-head be arm 'd anew . " There was a moment 's pause , a lower tone , In soften 'd cadence , and I caught not all , But solemn words fell broken on my ear , " Children  --  religion  --  mother  --  grave  --  Almighty ; "  --  I heard no more , for gathering sobs arose From every heart ; the children to their sire More closely clung , and I , with gushing tears , Withdrew .

Hayne saw me , question 'd of my health and state , Soothed me with gentle words and Christian deeds , And granted me soldierly exchange , Yes , Britons whisper of his worthiness , And his too short reprieve sprang from their claim ( Unask 'd by him , but oh ! how felt by me ) " Humanity to prisoners .

Comrade , Thou'st viewed a noble ship with sails all set , Riding majestic on the ocean deep , And when a vexing wind has crossed her path Hast seen her yield a moment , then again Righting herself press nobly on her way .  --  ' T was thus with him .

But , brother , there are men and moods can throw A dignity o'er basest offices I felt this truth imprest by him . A crowd Gathering and swelling from the Eastern Bay , To where the woods upon the city 's bound , Northward arise , followed the soldier 's steps . His stripling son was there , and hardened hearts Melted to sympathy with his young grief . His father paused , and bade the weeping boy Bear his remains to his ancestral tomb : Then with the calm farewell man gives to man , When slumber 's couch is sought , addressed his friends , And folding round his soul faith 's radiant robe , Arose to Heaven . Methought the earth grew dark ; Men walked as spectres , and my reason reel'd.  --  Comrade , to me it is a soothing thought , ( Although a stranger , once alas ! a foe , ) That in his kindred burial-place in peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There many a pilgrim rev'rently shall turn , Foeman and friend , and sadly , deeply muse , While dwelling on the Patriot-Martyr 's wrongs , Who , doom 'd to die a traitor 's cruel death , Ask 'd but a soldier 's doom , and was denied . And let me whisper my heart 's prophecy .  --  His high resolve will nerve Columbia 's heart , Brace freedom 's arm anew , and teach her foes " How nobly an American can die . "
