txt BY the courtesy of the publishers , Messrs . Wiley &amp; Putnam , who are about to include the work in the American Series of their new Library , we are enabled to lay before our readers , in advance , a few pages of a book which , from the comparative novelty of the subject , its home interest , and the simple , sincere style in which it is written , can not fail of proving widely attractive . The cruise was performed in the U. S. ship Saratoga , in the years 1843-1844 , and the Journal comprises sketches of the Canaries , the Cape de Verds , Liberia , Madeira , Sierra Leone , and other places of interest on the West Coast of Africa . The value of the book will be found to lie in its honest air of good sense and good feeling . It is a literal Journal , clear , exact in its information , unincumbered by anything , impertinent or irrelevant . The Preface , which we quote , will interest the . reader in the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , which might else have been wasted in idle amusements , or embittered by still idler regrets at // the destiny which carried the writer to a region so little seductive as Africa , and kept him there so long . He now offers them to the public , after some labor bestowed in correction and amendment , but retaining their original form , that of a daily Journal , which better suited his lack of literary practice and constructive skill , and was in fitter keeping with the humble pretensions of the work , than a rearrangement on artistic principles . At various points of the narrative , however , he has introduced observations ordisquisitions from two or three common-place hooks , which he kept simultaneously with the Journal ; and thus , in a few instances , remarks are inserted as having been made early in the cruise , while , in reality , they were perhaps the ultimate result of his reflection and judgment upon the topics discussed . " If , in any portion of the book , the author may hope to engage the attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages which treat of Liberia . The value of his evidence as to the condition and prospects of that colony , must depend , not upon any singular acuteness of observation or depth of reflection , but upon his freedom from partizan bias , and his consequent ability to perceive a certain degree of truth , and inclination to express it frankly . A Northern man , but not unacquainted with the slave-institutions of our own and other countries-neither an Abolitionist nor a colonizationist-without prejudice , as without prepossession-he feels himself thus far qualified to examine the great enterprise which he beheld in progress . He enjoyed , moreover , the advantage of comparing Liberia , as he now saw it , with a personal observation of its condition three years before , and could therefore mark its onward or retreating footsteps , and the better judge what was permanent , and what merely temporary or accidental . With these qualifications , he may at least hope to have spoken so much of truth as entirely to gratify neither the friends nor enemies of this interesting colony . " The West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourist , than most other parts of the world . Few visit it , unless driven by stern necessity ; and still fewer are disposed to struggle against the enervating influence of the climate , and keep up even so much of intellectual activity as may suffice to fill a diurnal page of Journal and common-place Book . In his descriptions of the settlements of the various nations of Europe , along that coast , and of the native tribes , and their trade and intercourse with the whites , the writer indulges the idea that he may add a trifle to the general information of the public . He puts forth his work , however , with no higher claims than as a collection of desultory sketches , in which he has felt himself nowise bound to tell all that it might be desirable to know , but only to be accurate in what he does tell . On such terms , there is perhaps no very reprehensible audacity in undertaking the history of a voyage ; and he smiles to find himself , so simply and with so little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors of books ! " ArRIL 5 , 1845 . " Aucusv 2 , 1843. - LInERIA- We were visited by Governor Roberts , Dr. Day , and General Lewis , the latter being Colonial Secretary , and military chief of the Settlement . They looked well , and welcomed me back to Liberia with the cordiality of old friendship . The Governor was received by the Coininodore , Captain and officers , and saluted with eleven guns . He and his suite dined in the cabin , and some of the officers of the Porpoise in the ward-room . In the evening , we brought out all our forces forthe amusement ofourdistinguished guests . First , the negro band sang Old Dan Tucker , ' Jim along Josey , ' and other ditties of the same class , accompanied by violin and tambourine . Then Othello played monkey , and gave a series of recitations . The French cook sang with great spirit and skill . The entertainments of the evening , as the theatrical bills express it , concluded with Ma Normandie and other beautiful songs and airs , well executed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violin , and a landsman on the flute . " 5. - Sailed for Cape Palmas , in company with the Porpoise . " 9. - Anchored at Cape Palmas . We were boarded by Kroomen , in eight or ten canoes . While the thermometer stood at 75 or 80 degrees , these naked boatmen were shivering , and seemed absolutely to suffer with cold ; and such is the effect of the climate upon our own physical systems , that we find woollen // garments comfortable at the same temperature . " Visited and lunched with Governor Rasswurm . Called on Mr. James , a colored missionary , now occupying the house of Mr. Wilson , who has lately removed to Gahoon river . Mr. James presented us with some Thony , and a few Grebo hooks . He informed us that the fever had visited him more or less severely , as often as once in four weeks during* seven years . This may truly be called a feverish life ! He is about to remove to Gaboon . " The Catholic Mission seems to have driven the Preshyterian from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic priest from Baltimore , and the only white man of the Mission at present in Africa . Preparations , however , have already been made for twenty more , principally French , whose arrival is expected within a year , and who will establish themselves at different points along the coast . Mr. Kelly is now finishing a very cominodious house , on a scale of some magnitude , with piazzas around the whole . There is evidently no lack of money . The funds for the support of the Catholic mission are derived principally through Lyons , in France ; and the enterprise is said to be under the patronage of the King . The abundant pecuniary means which the priests have at command , and the imposing and attractive ceremonies of their mode of worshipso well fitted to produce an effect on uncultivated natures , where appeals either to the intellect or the heart would be thrown away-are among the chief causes of their success . It is said , too , and perhaps with truth , that as many converts are made , among the natives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of the prosperity of the mission must be attributed to the superior shrewdness and ability of the persons engaged in it  --  to their skilful adaptation of their precepts and modes of instruction to the people with whom they have to deal , and to their employment of the maxims of worldly policy in aid of their religious views . These qualities and rules of conduct have characterized the Catholic missionaries in all ages , in all parts of the world , and in their dealings with every variety of the human race ; and their success has everywhere been commensurate with the superiority , in a merely temporal point of view , of the system on which they acted . " Before returning on board , we called on King Freeman , who received us , seated on a chair which was placed in front of his house . His majesty 's royal robe was no other than an old uniform frock , which I had given him three years ago . We accepted the chairs which he offered us , and held a palaver , while some twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former visit to the colony , and appeared very glad to see me again . His town was nearly deserted , the people having gone out to gather rice . About the royal residence , and in the vicinity , I saw thirty or forty cattle , most of them young , and all remarkably small . It is said , and I believe it to be a fact , that cattle , and even fowls , when brought from the interior , take the coast-fever , and often perish with it . Certain it is that they do not flourish . " 11. - King Freeman came on board , dressed in his uniform frock , with two epaulettes , a red cap , and checked trowsers . He received some powder and bread from the Commudore , and some trifles from the ward room . " 12. - Joe Davis brought his son on board to learn sense . ' In pursuit of this laudable object , the young man is to make a cruise with us . The father particularly requested that hi* son might be flogged , saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' On such a system , a man-of-war is certainly no bad school of improvement . " 13. -A delightful day , clear sky , and cool breeze . We sailed from Cape Palmas yesterday , steering up the coast . " I have been conversfng with young Ben Johnson , one of our Kroomen , on the conjugal and other customs of his countrymen . These constitute quite a curious object of research . The Kroomen are indispensable in carrying on the commerce and maritime business of the African coast . When a Kroo-boat comes along-side , you may buy the canoe , hire the men at a moment 's warning , and retain them in your service for months . They expend no time nor trouble in providing their equipment , since it consists merely of a straw hat and a piece of white or colored cotton girded about their loins . In their canoes , they deposit these girdles in the crowns of their hats ; nor is it unusual , // when a shower threatens them on shore , to see them place this sole garment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When rowing a boat , or paddling a canoe , it is their custom to sing ; and , as the music goes on , they seem to become invigorated , applying their strength cheerfully , and with limbs as unwearied as their voices . One of their number leads in recitative , and the whole company respond in the chorus . The subject of the song is a recital of the exploits of the men , their employments , their intended movements , the news of the coast , and the character of their employers . It is usual , in these extemporary strains , for the Kroomen attached to a man-of-war to taunt , with good-hnmored satire , their friends who are more laboriously employed in merchant vessels , and not so well fed and paid . " Their object in leaving home , and entering into the service of navigators , is generally to obtain the means of purchasing wives , the number of whom constitutes a man 's importance . The sons of gentlemen ' ( for there is such a distinction of rank among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitate to go away , for a year or two , and earn something to take to their families . On the return of these wanderers-not like the prodigal son , but brin5ing wealth to their kindred-great rejoicinirs are instituted . A bullock is killed by the head of the family , guns are fired , and two or three days are spent in the performance of various plays and dances . The ' boy ' gives all his earnin*s to his father , and places himself again under the parental authority . The Krooman of maturer age , on his return from an expedition of this kind , buys a wife , or perhaps more than one , and distributes the rest of his accumulated gains among his relatives . In a week , he has nothing left but his wives and his house . " Age is more respected by the Africans than by any other people . Even if the son be forty years old , he seldom seeks to emancipate himself from the parental government . If a young man falls in love , he , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes propositions to the damsel 's father , who , if his daughter agree to the match , announces the terms of purchase . The price varies in different places , and is also infiueiiced by other circumstances , such as the respectability and power of the family , and the beauty and behavior of the girl . The arrangements here described are often made when the girl is only five or six years of age , in which case she remains with her friends until womanhood , and then goes to the house of her bridegroom . Meantime , her family receive the stipulated pPice , and are responsible for her good behavior . Should she prove faithless , and run away , her purchase-money must be refunded by her friends , who , in their turn , have a claim upon the family of him who seduces or harbors her . If prompt satisfaction be not made ( which , however , is generally the case ) , there will he a big palaver , ' and a much heavier expense for damages and costs . It ; after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his wife 's conduct , he complains to her father , who either takes her back , and repays the dowry , or more frequently advises that she be flogged . In the latter alternative , she is tied , starved , and severely beaten ; a mode of conjugal discipline which generally produces the desired e sect. hould the wife be suspected of infidelity , the husband may charge her with it , and demand that she drink the poisonous decoction of sassy-wood , which is sod as the test of guilt or innocence , in all cases that are considered too *ncertain for human judgment . If her stomach free itself from the fatal draught by vomitinb , the is declared innocent , and is taken back by her family wit ' *ont repayment of the dower . On the other hand , if the poison begin to take e *ect , she is pronounced guilty ; an emetic is administered in the shape of common soap ; and her husband may , at his option , either send her home , or cut off her nose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral system of these people , as regards the virtue of the women . No disgrace is imputed to the wife who admits the immoral advances of a white man , provided it be done with the knowledge and consent of her husband . The latter , in whose eyes the white man is one of a distinct and superior order of beings , usually considers himself honored by an affair of this nature , and makcs it likewise a matter of profit . All proposals , in view of such a connection , must pass through the husband ; nor , it is affirmed , is there any hazard of wounding his delicacy , or awakening his resentment , whatever be his rank // and respectability . The violated wife returns to the domestic roof with undiminished honor , and confines herself as rigidly within the limits of her nuptial vow , as if this singular suspension of it had never taken place . " In spite of the degradation indicated by the above customs , the Kroo-women are rather superior to other native females , and seem to occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purse , directs the household affairs , and rules the other women , who labor diligently for the benefit of their common husband and master . Their toil constitutes his wealth . It is usual for a man to live two , three , or four days , with each of his wives in turn . As old age advances , he loses the control of his female household , most of the members of which run away , unless he is wise enough to dispose of them ( as usage permits ) to his more youthful relatives . As a Krooman of sixty or seventy often ht*s wives in their teens , it is not to be wondered at that they should occasionally show a disposition to rove . " August 14 . Passed near Sinoe , a colonial settlement , but did not show our colors . An English merchant brig was at anchor . Our pilot ohserved , that this settlement was not in a flourishing condition , because it received no great resistance ' from the Colonization Society . Of course , he meant to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the remark . Many plants thrive best in adversity . " Anchored at the river Sesters , and sent a boat ashore . Two canoes paddled alongside , and their head-men came on board . One was a beautifully formed man , and walked the deck with a picturesque dignity of aspect and motion . He had more the movement of an Indian , than any negro I ever saw . Two men were left in each boat , to keep her alongside , and wait the movements of their master . They kneel in the boat , and sit on their heels . XXThen a biscuit is thrown to them , they put it on their thighs , and thence eat it at their leisure . " 16 . Ashore at Monrovia . The buildings look dilapidated , and the wooden walls are in a state of decay . Houses of stone are coming into vogue . There is a large stone court-house , intended likewise for a Legislative Hall . What most interested me , was an African pony , a beautiful animal , snow white , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five men chained together , by the neck ; three colonists and two natives , with an overseer superintending them . They had been splitting stone for Government . " A gun from the ship gave the signal for our return . Going on board , we got under way , and sailed for Porto Praya. " 20 . For four days , we have had much rain ; and I have seldom visited the deck , except when duty called me . Fortunately , Governor Roberts had lent me the report of the Committee of Parliament , on the western coast of Africa , the perusal of which has afforded me both pleasant and profitable occupation . It is an excellent work , full of facts , from men who have spent years on the coast . " 21 . XVind still favorable . The day is sunny , and all are on deck to enjoy the air . Damp clothes hang in the rigging to day , and mouldy boots and shoes fill the boats . " 24 . We find ourselves again off the harbor of Porto Praya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the death of Mr. Legare , and the loss of the storeship , at this port . All hands were saved , but with the sacrifice of several thousand dollars worth of property , besides the vessel . " On approaching the shore , three flags are observed to be flying in the town . One is the consular flag of our own nation ; another is the banner of Portugal ; and the third , being blue , white , and blue , is apt to puzzle a stranger , until he reads UNION HoTzL , in letters a foot long . When last at Porto Praya , a few friends and myself took some slight refreshment at the hotel , and were charged so exorbitantly , that we forswore all visits to the house infuture . To-day , the keeper stopt me in the street , and begged the favor of our patronage . On my representing the enormity of his former conduct , he declared that it was all a mistake ; that he was the master of the hotel , and was unfortunately absent at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid the exorbitant charge into his own hands , not a month before . It is delightful , iii these remote , desolate , and semi-barbarous regions , to meet with characteristics that remind us of a more polished and civilized land . // " The streets are hot and deserted , and the town more than ordinarily dull , as most of the inhabitants are out planting . The court has gone to Buonavista , on account of the unhealthiness of Porto Praya , at this season of the year . A few dozen scruhhy trees have been planted in the large square , but , though protected by palings and barrels , have not reached the height of two feet . In the centre stands a marble monument , possibly intended for a fountain , hut wholly destitute of water . " 25 . The boat went ashore again , and brought off the consul , and some stores . We then made sail , passing to windward of all the islands , and reached our former anchorage at Porto Grande . " 28 . There are one barque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor Porto Grande . They have been out from three to six months , and are here for water , bad though it be , and fresh provisions . Their inducements to visit this port , are the goodness of the harhor , and the smallness of the port charges . No consular fee has been paid until now , when , an agent being appointed , each vessel pays him a perquisite of four dollars . " This group of islands is chiefly interesting to Americans , as being the resort of our whale-ships , to refit and obtain supplies , and of other vessels trading to the coast of Africa . Little was generally known of them , however , in America , until 1832 , when a long continued drought parched up the fields , destroyed the crops , and reduced the whole population to the verge of death , by famine . Not less than ten thousand did actually perish of hunger ; and the remainder were saved only by the timely , prompt , and bountiful supplies , sent out from every part of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pervaded the community at home , on hearing that multitudes were starving in the Cape de Verd islands . Without pausing to inquire who they were , or whether entitled to our assistance by any other than the all powerful claim of wretchedness , the Americans sent vessel after vessel , laden with food , which was gratuitously distributed to the poor . The supplies were liberal and unremitted , until the rains returned , and gave the usual crops to the cultivators . " Twelve years have passed since that dismal famine ; but the memory of the aid extended by Americans has not yet faded , nor seems likely to fade , from the minds of those who were succored in their need . I have heard men , who were then saved from starvation , speak strongly and feelingly on the subject , with quivering lip , and faltering voice . Women , likewise , with streaming eyes , to this day , invoke blessings on the foreign land that fed their children , when there was no other earthly help . England , though nearer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mouthful of food ; and Portugal , the mother country , shipped only one or two small cargoes to be sold ; while America fed the starving thousands gratuitously , for months . Our consul at Porto Praya , Mr. Gardner , after making a strong and successful appeal to the sympathies of his own countrymen , distributed his own stores to the inhabitants , until he was well nigh beggared . He enjoys the only reward he sought , in the approval of his conscience , as well as the gratitude of the community ; and America , too , may claim more true glory from this instance of general benevolence , pervading the country from one end to the other , than from any victory in our annals . " 29 . Ashore again . An ox for our ship was driven in from the mountains by three or four horsemen and as many dogs , who chased him till he took refuge in the water . A boat now put off , and soon overtaking the tired animal , he was tied securely . When towed ashore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another to his fore-foot , each held by a negro , while a third took a strong gripe of his tail . In this manner , they led and drove him along , the fellow behind occasionally biting the beast 's tail to quicken his motions ; until at length the poor creature was made fast to an anchor on the beach , there to await the butcher . " There is here a miserable church , but no priest . Passing the edifice today , I saw seven or eight women at their devotions . Instead of kneeling , they were seated , with their chins resting on their knees , on the shady side of the church . " 30 . The crews of the whale-ships , when ashore , occasionally give no little trouble to the colonial police . This evening , one of their sailors came up to us , quite intoxicated , and bleeding // from a hurt in his head . He was bent upon vengeance for his wound , but puzzled how to get it ; inasmuch as a female hand had done the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His chivalry would not allow him to strike a woman ; nor could he find any man who would acknowledge himself her relative . In this dilemma , he was raving through the little village , accompanied by several of his brother whalemen , mostly drunk , and ready for a row . The Portuguese officer on duty called out the guard , consisting of two negroes with fixed bayonets , and caused them to march back and forth in the street . Fifty paces in the village would bring them to the country ; when the detachment came to the right-about , and ret*aced its steps . These two negroes formed precisely two-fifths of the regular military force at Porto Grande ; but , besides this formidable host , there are some thirty officers and soldicrs of the National Guard , comprising all the negro population able to bear clubs . " The women here have a peculiar mode of c*rrying children , when two or three years old . The child sits astride of the mother 's left hip , clinging with hands and feet , and partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a state of total nudity , and of co rse very slippery , this is doubtless the most convenient method that could be adcpted . " Lie gait of the women is remarkably free and unembarrassed . With no constraint of stays or corsets , and often innocent of any coverin* , the shoul 1ers have full play , a d the arms swin more than I have ever seen those of men , in our own country . Their robes are neither too Thundant , nor too tight , to prevent the exhibition of a very martial stride . The scanty clothing worn here is owing partly , but not entirely , to the warmth of the climate . Another cogent reason is the poverty of the inhabitants ; so , at least , I infer from the continual petitions for clothes , and from remarks like the following , made to me by a mulatto woman : - You very good man , you got plenty clothes , plenty shirt . ' " September 3 . The Cornelia , of New Bedford , came in and anchored . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 barrels of oil . " 4 . Left the ship in the launch on an expedition to the neighboring island of St. Antonio ; being despatched by the Commodore to procure information as to the facilities for anchoring ships , and obtaining water and refreshments . Our boat was sloop-rigged , and carried three officers , a passenger , and ten men . At 11 A. M. we sheeted home , ' and stood out of the harbor with a fair breeze , and all canvass spread ; but , within an hour , the wind freshened to a gale , and compelled us to take in everything but a close-reefed mainsail . The sea being rough and the weather squally , our boat took in more water than was either a reeable or safe , until we somewhat improved matters by con*tructing a temporary forecastle of tarpaulins . Finding it impossible , however , to contend against wind and current , we bore up for an anchorage called Santa Cruz . This was formerly a noiorious haunt for pirates ; but no vestige of a settlement remains , save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably have been the theatre of wild and bloody incidents , in by-gone years . The serrated hills are grey and barren , and the *urroundinu country shows no verdure . Anchoring here , we waited several hours for the wind to moderate , and tried to get soch sleep as might perchance be caught in an unsteady boat . " By great diligence in working against wi 1d and current , we succeeded in reaching Gcnelia at 9 o'clock in the evening of the seccnd day . Our mulato pilot , Manuel Quatrine , whistled shrilly through his fingers ; and , after a brief delay , the response of a similar whistle reached our ears from shore . A conversation was sustained for some moments , by means of shouts to-andfin in Portuguese ; a man then swam off to reconnoitre ; and , on his return , the people launched a canoe and carried us ashore , weary enough of thirty-six hours ' confinement in an open boat . We took up our quarters in the house of a decent negro , who seemed to be the head-man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper as the place could supply , sallied out to give the women an opportunity of preparing our beds . " Meanwhile , the pilot had not been idle . Though a married man , and the father of six children , he was a gay Lothario , and a great favorite with the sex ; he could sing , dance , and touch the guitar with infinite spirit and tolerable skill . Being well known in the // village , it is riot surprising that the arrival of so accomplished a personage should have disturbed the slumbers of the inhabitants . At ten o'clock , a dance was arranged before the dcor of one of the huts . The dark-skinned maidens , requiring but little time to put on their ball-costume , came dropping in , until , before midnight , there were thirty or forty dancers on foot . The figures were compounded of the contra-dance and reel , with some remarkable touches of the Mandingo balance . The music . proceeded from one or two guitars , which , however , were drowned a great part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clapping of each individual pair of hands in the whole party . A calabash of sour wine , munificently bestowed by a spectator , increased the fun , and it continued to wax higher and more furious , as the night wore away . Our little pilot was , throughout , the leader of the frolic , and acquitted himself admirably . His nether garments having received serious detriment in the voyage , he borrowed a large heavy peajacket , to conceal the rents , and in this garb danced for hours with the best in a sultry night . Long before the festivity was over , my companions and myself stretched ourselves on a wide bag of straw , and fell asleep , lulled by the screaming of the dancers . " The next morning we were early on foot , and looked around us with no small interest . The village is situated at the point where a valley opens upon the shore . The sides of this vale are steep , and , in many places , high , perpendicular , and rocky . Every foot of earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill is too great to admit of tillage , stone-walls are built to sustain terraces , which rise one over another like giant steps to the mountaintops . It was the beginning of harvest , and the little valley presented an appearance of great fertility . Corn , bananas , figs , guavas , grapes , oranges , sugar-cane , cocoa-nuts , and many other fruits and vegetables , are raised in abundance . The annual vintage in this and a neighboring valley , appertaining to the same parish , amounts to about seventy-five pipes of wine . It is sour and unpalatable , not unlike hard-cider and water . When a cultivator first tries his wine , it is a custom of the island for him to send notice to all his acquaint- VOL. lvI. -N 0 LXXXIII. ances , who invariably come in great force , each bringing a piece of salt-fish to keep his thirst alive . Not unfrequently , the whole produce of the season is exhausted by a single carouse . " The people are all negroes and mulattoes . Male and female , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of swimming out to sea , with a basket or notched stick to hold their fish ; and thus they angle for hours , resting motionless on the waves , unless attacked by a shark . In this latter predicament , they turn upon their backs , and kick and splash until the sea-monster be frightened away . They appear to be a genial and plea*ant-tempered race . As we walked through the village , they saluted us with Blessed be the name of the Lord ! ' Whether this expression ( a customary courtesy of the islanders ) were mere breath , or proceeded out of the depths of the heart , is not for us to judge ; but , at all events , heard in so wild and romantic a place , it made a forcible impression on my mind . When we were ready to depart , all the villagers came to the beach , with whatever commodities they were disposed to offer for sale ; a man carrying a squealing pig upon his shoulders ; women with fruits and fowls ; girls with heavy bunches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys , with perhaps a single egg . Each had something , and all lingered on the shore until our boat was fairly off . " Five or six miles further , we landed at Paulo , where reside several families who regard themselves as the aristocracy of St. Antonio , on the score of being connected with Sefior Martinez , the great man of these islands . Their houses are neatly built , and the fields and gardens well cultivated . They received us hqspitably , principally because one of our party was a connection of the family . I was delighted with an exhibition of feeling on the part of an old negro servant-woman . She came into the parlor , sat down at the feet of our companion , embraced his knees , and looked up in his face with a countenance full of joy , mingled with respect and confidence . We saw but two ladies at this settlement . One was a matron with nine children ; the other a dark brunette , very graceful and pleasing , *&amp;ith the blackest eyes and whitest teeth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right shoulder and under the left arm , arranged in a truly fascinating manner . " The poorer classes in the vicinity are nearly all colored , and mostly free . They work for eight or ten cents a day , living principally on fruit and vegetables , and are generally independent , because their few wants are limited to the supply . The richest persons live principally within themselves , and derive their meats , vegetables , fruits , wine , brandy , sugar , coffee , oil , and most other necessaries and luxuries , from their own plantations . One piece of furniture , however , to he seen in seveml of the houses , was evidently not the manufacture of the island , hut an export of Yankee-land . It was the wooden clock , in its shining mahogany case , adorned with bright red and yellow pictures of Saints and the Virgin , to suit the taste of good Catholics . It might have been fancied that the renowned Sam Slick , having glutted all other markets with his wares , had made a voyage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the machine in order . We met here a person whom we at first mistook for a native , so identical were his manners and appearance with those of the inhabitants ; until , in conversation , we found him to be a Yankee , who had run away from a whale-ship , and established himself as a clock and watch-maker . " After a good night 's rest , another officer and myself left Paolo , early , for a mountain ride . The little pilot led the way on a donkey ; my friend followed on a mule , and I brought up the rear on horseback . We began to ascend , winding along the rocky path , one by one , there being no room to ride two abreast . The road had been cut with much labor , and , in some places , was hollowed out of the side of the cliff , thus forming a gallery of barely such height and width as to admit the passage of a single horseman , and with a low wall of loose stones between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of small stones and earth had been built up , perhaps twenty feet high , along the top of which ran the path . On looking at these places from some projecting point , it made us shudder to think that we had just passed , where the loosening of a single one of those small stones might have carried us down hundreds of feet , to certain de struction . The whole of the way was rude and barren . Here and there a few shrubs , green in the crevices of the rocks , or wild flowers , of an aspect strange to our eyes , wasted their beauty in solitude ; and the small orchilla weed spread itself moss-like over the face of the cliff . At one remarkable point , the path ran along the side of the precipice , about midway of its height . Above , the rock rose frowningly , at least five hundred feet over our heads . Below , it fell perpendicularly down to the beach . The roar of the sea did not reach us , at our dizzy height , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live , seemed to kiss the shore as gently as the ripple of a summer-lake . This was the most elevated point of the road , which thence began to descend ; but the downward track was as steep and far more dangerous . At times , the animals actually slid down upon their haunches . In other places , they stept from stone to stone , down steep descents , where the riders were obliged to lie backwards flat upon the cruppers . " Over all these difficulties , our guide urged his donkey gaily and unconcernedly . As for myself , though I have seen plenty of rough riding , and am as ready as most men to follow , if not to lead , I thought it no shame to dismount more than once . The rolling of a stone or the parting of stirrup , girth , or crupper , would have involved the safety of one 's neck . Nor did the very common sight of wooden crosses along the path , indicating sudden death by accident or crime , tend to lessen the sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with the healthfulness of the climate , have made it a proverb , that it is a natural death , at St. Antonio , to be dashed to pieces on the rocks . But such was not our fate . We at length reached the sea-shore , and rode for a mile along the beach to the city of Poverson , before entering which metropolis , it was necessary to cross a space of level , sandy ground , about two hundred yards in extent . Here the little pilot suddenly stuck his heels into the sides of his donkey , and dashed onward at a killing pace ; while mule and horse followed hard upon his track , to the great admiration of ragamuffins , who had assembled to witness the entrde of the distinguished party . Poverson is the capital of the island // and contains about two thousand inhabitants , who , with few exceptions , are people of color . The streets are crooked and narrow , and the houses mean . We called upon the military and civil Governors , and , after accepting an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a further expedition . Passing over a shallow river , in which a number of women and girls were washing clothes , we ascended a hill so steep as to oblige us to dismount , and from the summit of which we had a fine view of the rich valley beneath . It is by far the most extensive tract of cultivated land that we have seen in the island , and is improved to its utmost capacity . We thence rode three miles over a path of the same description as before , and arrived at the village and port of Point-deSol . The land about this little town is utterly barren , and the inhabitants are dependant on Poverson for food , with the exception of fish . A custom-house , a single store , a church , and some twenty houses of fishermen , comprise all the notable characteristics of the principal seaport of the island . " It was a part of our duty to make an examination of the harbor , for which purpose we needed a boat . Two were hauled up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a dozen men to launch her ; - whereas , the fishermen being absent in their vocation , our party of three , and a big boy at the store , comprised our whole available masculine strength . The aid of woman , however , is seldom sought in vain ; nor did it fail us now . Old and young , matron and maid , they all sallied forth to lend a hand , and , with such laughing and screaming as is apt to attend feminine efforts , enabled us to launch the boat . In spite of their patois of bad Portuguese , we contrived to establish a mutual understanding . A fine , tall girl with a complexion of deep olive , clear , large eyes , and teeth beautifully white and even , stood by my side ; and , like the Ancient Mariner and his sister 's son , we pulled together . She was strong , and , as Byron says , lovely in her strength . ' This difficulty surmounted , we rowed round the harbor , made our examination , and returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance of the women , in dragging the boat beyond the reach of the waves . We now adjourned to the store , in order to requite their kindness by a pecuniary offering . Each of our fair friends received two large copper coins , together worth nine cents , and were perfectly satisfied , as well they might be-for it was the price of a day 's work . Two or three individuals , moreover , turned double corners , ' and were paid twice ; and it is my private belief that the tall beauty received her two coppers three times over . " After a lunch of fried plantains and eggs , we rode back to Poverson . On the way , we met several persons of both sexes with burdens on their heads , and noticed that our guide frequently accosted them with a request for a pinch of snuff . With few exceptions , a horn or piece of bone was produced , containing a fine yellow snuff of home-manufacture , which , instead of being taken between the thumb and fimm*er , was poured into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nose . Arriving at the city , we proceeded at once to the house of the Commandant , and in a little time were seated at dinner . " Our host was fitted by nature to adorn a far more brilliant position than that which he occupied , as the petty commander of a few colored soldiers , in a little island of the torrid zone . He was slightly made , but perfectly proportioned , with a face of rare beauty , and an expression at once noble and pleasing . His eyes were large , and full of a dark light ; his black hair and moustache were trimmed with a care that . showed him not insensible of his personal advantages ; as did likewise his braided jacket , fitting so closely as to set off his fine figure to the best effect . His manners were in a high degree polished and graceful . One of the guests , whom he had invited to meet us , understood English ; and the conversation was sustained in that language , and in Spanish . The dinner was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off very pleasantly , and was quite as good as could be expected at the house of a bachelor , in a place so seldom visited by strangers . Each of the Portugues e gentlemen gave a sentiment , prefaced by a short complimentary speech ; and our party , of course , reciprocated in little speeches of the same nature . The Commandant did not fail to express the gratitude due from the people of the Cape de Verd islands to America , for assistance in the hour of // 492 Alleghan , or Alleghamian America . need . Time did not permit us to remain long at table , and we took leave , highly delighted with our entertainment . " Mounting again , we rode out of town more quietly than we had entered it . A sergeant was drilling some twenty negro soldiers in marching and wheeling . his orders were given in a quick , loud tone . and enforced by the occasional application of smart bloxvs of a rattan to the shoulders of his men . Suspecting that the blows fell thicker because we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity to hasten forward ; especially as the approach of night threatened to make our journey still more perilous than before . After riding about three miles , we met two well-dressed mulatto women on donkeys , accompanied by their cavaliers . Of course , we allowed the ladies to pass between us and the rock ; a matter of no slight courtesy in such a position , where there was a very uncomfortable hazard of being jostled headlong down the precipice . We &amp;caped , however , and spurring onward through the gloom of night , passed unconsciously over several rough spots where we had dismounted in the morning . The last mile of our mountainride was lighted by the moon ; and , as we descended the last hill , the guide gave a shrill whistle , to which the boat 's crew responded with three cheers for our return . " A good night 's rest relieved us of our fatigue . The following morning , with a fair breeze and a six hours ' sail , we reached our floating house , and have ever since entertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the subject is beginning to be worn thread-bare . But , as the interior of the island of St. Antonio is one of the few regions of the earth as yet uncelebrated by voyagers and tourists , I can not find in my heart to spare the reader a single sentence of the foregoing narrative .
