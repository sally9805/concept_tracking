txt Too much , we think , is generally attrihuted to the influence of the prevailing spirit of the times , in determining the character of poetry . Those , from whose writings that character is inferred , are few in number , and , not unfrequently , in a position as far as possible heyond the reach of such an influence . Take , for example , Burns and Cowper ; who have been referred to with the view of showing , that the reforming energy , which manifested itself , near the close of the last century , in politics and various forms of literature , was communicated to poetry hy the same deep impulse . It would not he easy to name two individuals , of any literary eminence , who were more removed , hy circumstances , from the interests and passions , which swayed the living mass around them . When Burns , in the solitude of his lowly cottage at Mossgiel , was pouring the full tide of song from the depths of his proud and manly heart , he was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if // be had dwelt in the loneliest island of the North Sea ; scarcely acquainted even with the names of the poets of his time ; and finding the source of his inspiration in the fountain within him , springing up to immortality . Cowper was driven from the society of men by causes too painful and too familiar to require to be told ; his poetry was the music by which , when the evil spirit was upon him , " he was refreshed , and was well " ; nothing surely was indifferent to him , which might affect the moral welfare of his race ; but the hopes and interests of the world , and even its intellectual progress , were to him of little moment in any other point oC view . Going back a hundred years further , we indeed observe the influence of the spirit of the age on iDryden , who prostituted his gigantic strength to make sport for the Philistines at the festival of Dagon . But what trace of it is to be found in the character of Milton ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " his son'l was like a star , and dwelt apart . " The spirit of his time affected him no more than the gathering mist impairs the lustre of the star , which it hides for a moment from the eye . A mind like his was fitted to guide it , rather than obey . No doubt there are certain influences , which aid in determining the direction of poetical talent , as they do of every other kind . Milton kept constantly in view the sublime hope , that he might leave something to after times , so written , as that they would not willingly let it die . Whenever he alludes to his immortal work , it is plain , that he looks for no sudden popularity , or early fame . But poetry is now an article of traffic ; and one may fix its value with nearly the same precision , as the current prices of other commodities are stated in the daily newspapers . Instead of appealing to the judgment of posterity , the author of the present day stands before an awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prerogatives of such a judge may be , is shown by a circumstance , which Scott relates , in reference to his tale of " Ivanhoe . " His publisher had taken a fancy to Athelstan , the descendant of Saxon kings , who was untimely slain by the hand of Sir Brian de BoisGuilbert , the Knight Templar , and insisted , that Scott should restore him from this state of " cold obstruction . " Scott , who saw plainly enough the absurdity of the suggestion , re // sisted , for a time , but at last brought back the knight to life , and thus fixed a sad blemish on a work , which had otherwise been almost faultless . In another of his romances , St. Ronan 's Well , " the whole character of the story was changed in obedience to another suggestion of the same kind . All this comes from a determination to be popular ; of the chance of which , the publisher is admitted to be a better judge than the author ; at least , he can determine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is well understood , that Scott received about as much for every line of one of his poems , as was paid to Milton for each book of his " Paradise Lost . " The writer is thus driven , by a temptation which few can resist , to consult the prevailing taste , and to prefer the reward which awaits him here , to that which is reserved for the highest genius hereafter , when his merit will be weighed in the balance of calm , deliberate judgment . So has it been with most of the poets of our time . " As the lightning flashed , they went onward by its light ; when it vanished into darkness , they stood still . " Wordsworth is , indeed , a striking example to the contrary . He , from the beginning , avowed his persuasion , that the poet has before him the double task of creating the taste by which his works are to be valued , as well as the works themselves ; but we shall presently see , that others have been contented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have acted under the persuasion , that the voice of poetry was too small and still to make itself heard amidst the din of the wheels of industry , and the roar of the trumpets of reform ; that novelty alone could attract attention ; and that the question for them to solve was , what form of novelty would be most likely to produce the desired effect . At the same time , we believe , that there is more lamentation over the decline of poetry , than the exigency requires . The tendency , on the part of poets , is , doubtless , in that direction ; but the complaint is founded on a supposed indifference to all poetry on the part of readers . This indifference has been commonly ascribed to the progress of physical science , which , as many apprehend , is to obtain an entire monopoly of interest . But the danger , we apprt*hend , is greatly overrated . The two circumstances do not necessarily stand toward each other in the relation of cause and effect ; // though many will hardly believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincide in point of time ; as the people of Norway were out of patience with inoculation , because fish were scarce upon their coasts at the time when it was introduced . We have no fears , that the public attention will be so absorbed , for any length of time , by one pursuit , as to disregard all others . Such , certainly , is not the lesson of experience . Nothing is more common , than to attach an undue importance to the passing event , and the object before us. the complaint , in Johnson 's day , was of quite a different sort . Then , " the cook warbled her lyrics in the kitchen , and the thresher vociferated his dithyrambics in the barn . " That was a season of fat poetical kine . But there has been no perceptible increase , since his day , in the melody of the one , or the inspiration of the other . One age , or , what is the same thing , man in one age , is much more like man in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius , of any kind , is among the most rare of heaven 's gifts ; great poetical genius , perhaps , the most rare of all . And it would be quite unreasonable to complain , that blessings , which have been dispensed , in times past , in numbers scarcely equal to that of the centuries , should be lavished in showers upon this generation . We have had our share . As the shades were closing on the last century , there were many stars , of no ordinary promise , going up in the sky ; and it has been given to us to walk in their light . There is no period in English history , of the same length , more fertile in poetical talent , than the last fifty years ; not that the names of Shakspeare and Milton are not far greater than any which this age can show ; but that the diversity and brilliancy of those , who are but a little lower than the angels , have been far more signal than in former time . The present moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be followed by a bolder strain , than as the stillness of death . We propose to offer a few cursory remarks on some of the principal poets of our time ; and it will readily appear , to what extent they have , perhaps at first unconsciously , availed themselves of the influence of novelty in attracting the general attention . Scott is the most striking illustration of this as he was among the first . His " Lay of the Last Minstrel " was written at the suggestion of a lady , and gradually ex // tended far beyond its original design ; but he appears to have had little expectation of the triumphant welcome with which it was received . The idea was not new , though novel to modern readers . It was rather a revival of the old metrical romance , in which the exploits of the heroes of chivalry were recorded , for the edification of readers of ages long gone by . One would have thought it rather a hazardous experiment to attempt to excite much interest in the exploits of cavaliers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blacksmith 's hammer , or in those of mosstroopers , whose only appropriate station would have been the gibbet . But Scott 's knowledge of the world taught him better . He knew , that the recollections of the old glories of chivalry had a charm , like that of the green that overhangs its ruined fortresses ; and that , empty as it was , and senseless as were its usages , beside that modern civilization was very much its debtor , the world would never be weary of admiring its strange union of the liberal grace of refinement with the sternness of the rudest barbarism . But his true taste divined full well , that he could not reproduce the heroes of Proissart precisely as they were , and he therefore blended their harsher traits with modern sentiments and manners , and thus produced a picture , which , compared with the reality , was like the feudal system , as it appears in " Ivanhoe , " by the side of the same system , as portrayed by the venerable sages of the law . The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little interest in its details ; but , inspired as it was with all the wild and thrilling associations of chivalry , uttered in a measure singularly bold and animated , and fitly imagined to proceed from one of the bards , who seem to make a part of the romantic drama , its cadences fell upon the ear like the triumphant strains of martial music . It would be vain to attempt to describe their effect to those whose memory goes not back so far as the period when the poem was first published . Nobody saw or felt , that the versification was often hurried and ungraceful , almost extemporaneous , and rarely indicative of much revision . The right chord was touched and , when all readers were under the shadow of the spell , poetry of a much higher cast would have found neither " fit audience , " nor even " few . " " Marmion , " with its glorious battle // scene , kindled even fiercer enthusiasm . But the charm of novelty was passing by ; and the " Lady of the Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever poet dreamed , found less favor , though more judicious approbation , than the " Lay . " In the course of a few years , the tide had fairly turned ; insomuch that the " Lord of the Isles , " a hastily wrought , but thrilling tale , founded on one of the most memorable events in Scottish history , and presenting one of the few instances , in which the writer attempted to paint the real heroes of his country , was received either with indifference or faint applause . The poet , with the modesty which forms the unusual grace and ornament of popular talent , believed , that the fiery lustre of Lord Byron 's star had diminished the brightness of his own . But it was not so ; the probability is , that , had the order of their appearance been changed , he would have become the idol at the expense of his great rival . But the novelty was gone and , with the elastic energy , in which no man ever abounded more , he entered upon another , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he was enabled , free from the shackles of poetical measure , to pour forth the rich results of his study , keen observation , and knowledge of mankind , in a series of romances , which will be remembered long after all his critics shall have been forgotten . No doubt these are poems as truly as the metrical ones . But the form was one , which gave him the full command of his powers . With a perception of character , hardly inferior to that of Shakspeare , he could not , like him , fix it upon the canvass with a single touch of his pencil . But his sketches , though more slowly wrought , were nearly as lifelike and real . The impression , made hy these romances , was , in the first instance , in no degree inferior to that of the metrical ones , and it was much more durable in its character . If they excited attention by their novelty , they secured it by some higher qualities . If they have now given place to other forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exchange . Inferior minds have naturally resorted to inferior means to gain the public ear ; and , be the objections to the historical romances what they may , the cause of virtue will gain little by the substitution of what has followed them , from the swaggering dandyism of the Pelbam school , down to // the loathsome abominations of " Jack Shephard . " Such things attract attention , doubtless ; and the dramatist , who should build a gibbet on the stage , an appropriate implement , by the way , for the use of many modern fashionable heroes , would be sure to find an audience ; not from any talent displayed in the achievement , but from the unusual character of the exhibition . In some respects , it was with Lord Byron as it had been with Scott . At first he appears to have mistaken his powers ; he had set his heart upon excelling in satire , and regarded " Childe Harold , " the foundation of his fame , as the mere amusement of an idle hour . But satire certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to passion to preserve even a decent show of justice towards the objects of his wrath . Compare , for example , his " English Bards " with Dryden 's " Absalom and Acliitophel , " and it will be readily seen what a keen and fatal edge is given to satire by allowing the merit of its object , and thus presenting the evil qualities in revolting shade . XVhen " Childe Harold " appeared , this delusion passed for the time away ; for its high poetical beauty , aided in some degree , no doubt , by its author 's exalted rank , made it at once a favorite with all readers . From the moment that he caught the gale , he spread his sail to welcome it , with consummate skill . The man of mystery , half concealed , like ZEneas , in a cloud whose edges were bright with the glitter of rank and fashion , moving among men as if he were not of them , partly from a jealous shyness and partly from a sad contrast between his personal circumstances and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful interest . Nor was this unnatural ; with powers that might have raised him to the highest place in any way of life he had chosen to pursue , he had within him all the elements of a noble character ; but all , all were darkened by circumstances , that fill the mind less with indignation than with sorrow . His father was eminently distinguished as a worthless libertine , in an age when such distinction was any thing hut rare ; his parents lived apart , and he was early consigned to the exclusive charge of his mother , a woman of little sense and tempestuous passions , who would occasionally reproach and ridicule her son in consequence of that personal deformity , the consciousness of which was torture to him till his latest hotir . Under such circumstances , // the only wonder is , that his intellect and his heart did not become equally desolate . The heart perished , but the intellect survived . In the one , kind affections flashed occasionally forth , like the warm sunbeam through the gloom of a November day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; all that he thought or did was the result of impulse . In the other , there was nobleness enough to call forth in us deep and lasting sadness , that " the inward prompting , which grew daily upon him , " should have been so unlike those by which Milton consecrated himself to his high and holy task . All this , however , gave powerful aid to the effect of his poetry ; nor is it unjust to him to believe , that he was not reluctant to find the public eye fixed upon himself as well as on his works . Both were sufficiently out of the common track to attract immediate attention . A young nobleman , eminently distinguished for his personal beauty , flies from the brilliant circles that burn to welcome him , wraps himself in mysterious reserve , and becomes the victim of melancholy . When all appears bright and joyous to the common eye , his personal history and dark thoughts are shadowed forth in the wild and unearthly music of his poetry . He wanders in regions inspired by chivalrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eternal City , and the shades of orators , poets , and heroes , start from her ruined arches ; his foot is on the soil of Greece , and all the loveliness and glory of that treasury of literary fame are warmed into life before him ; once more upon the waters , and deep calleth unto deep ; and again he turns to the battle-field , where are gathered the buried martyrs of ambition ; and the earthquake of its artillery would hardly stir the soul , like his unveiling of its dark and bloody record . The great Mokanna dies ; his silver veil drops from his brow ; the mysteries of his seclusion , alas ! no holy ones , are revealed ; the friends who shared his table sell the results of his misplaced confidence before be is cold in his grave . Then the romantic interest attached to his person perishes , and he stands at the literary bar , shielded only by the majesty of his commanding talent . But the perversion of his genius is scarcely inferior to that of his moral powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draws after it , he is perpetually pursuing the same course which he perpetually denounces and condemns . His own poetical system , and those of most // of his contemporaries , he has often described as revolutionary ones , and has predicted their rapid decline . Doubtless they are so , as respects their adaptation to strike and dazzle , rather than to win permanent fame ; but there are few who have acknowledged the fact to themselves , and endeavoured to impress it on others , with the freedom and energy of Lord Byron . In fact , his letters present in this point of light a singular contrast to the course attributed to another ; his conduct being still wrong and his argument right . How long his writings will survive , must be left for other ages to determine ; hut if we might without presumption hazard a conjecture as to their relative chances of immortality , it would he that the smaller ones will outlast those which have given greater glory to his name . These are the two high-priests , whose oracles may be regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would it be difficult , by a brief review of the works of some of these , to show that the same effort to attract attention by novelty has been often made , with various degrees of power and success . But it is our desire to speak more particularly of one or two , in reference to whom such a charge is less applicable . Byron , in his enumeration of those who are proceeding upon what he calls the revolutionary system , has included Campbell , upon what grounds , we do no precisely see ; for , except in the instance of " Theodric , " which fell so silently from the press that it is hardly remembered , his course has been very much at variance with what we have described as the modern one . After a long interval of repose , perceiving the race of popularity which others were running , whose claims could hardly be considered superior to his , he appears to have become possessed with the desire of trying the experiment of a style , as unlike his natural one , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suited to a grave gentleman , " by r Lady , inclining to threescore . " The style was rough and jaunty , with an infusion of the swagger ; but it satisfied the reader as little as it became the author ; and can not fairly be taken into the account in an estimate of his poetical merits . The " Pleasures of Hope , " if not his best poem , certainly his most popular one , was published when he had scarcely reached the age of manhood ; and yet very few , // written in the full maturity of genius , have made a deeper or more abiding impression . No better evidence could be given of the strength of the impression made by any work , than the facility and frequency with which it is quoted ; and , considered in reference to this standard , we can scarcely point to the poem which has taken stronger hold of the general mind . Its forms of expression are household words ; the traveller in South America involuntarily speaks of Andes , as the " giant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not unfrequently clothed in the beautiful language of this remarkable poem . The age of the author , if it may not be admitted in the way of palliation of any alleged defects , is at least sufficient to explain them . Let any man look round upon the circle of his acquaintance , and see what the most intelligent would be likely to produce at the age of twenty-one , and he will surely cease to wonder at its imperfections . Perhaps those very imperfections have had the effect of increasing its popularity . The writer , a young man just leaving college , brought up in the ordinary seclusion of such institutions , where he is apt to become much more familiar with the men of ages past , than with mankind and nature as they are now , and sees every thing through the medium of colored glass , describes the visions of hope as they spring up in a mind , so taught and disciplined . He could not have done otherwise ; and , when compelled to go beyond the sphere of his observation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new to him , he is sure to overstep the modesty of nature . When we object to such a work that it is a juvenile one , the objection amounts to no more than this , that the dreams of his hope are not like those of older men . Indeed , the prevailing defects of this poem appear to us to be such as naturally spring from the inexperience of the writer . Occasionally , he is called upon to describe scenes unknown to him , and feelings with which he could not be familiar ; and here his views are derived from books , and want the reality and vividness of nature . He bids the youth go forth , in the enthusiasm of youthful hope , not to the stern discipline of life , to wrestle with temptation , to subdue the rebellious powers of evil , but to rest in the calm retreats of science , to follow the footsteps of the philosopher through regions above earth , to visit the walks of wisdom where the " sacred Nine // are nigh . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world ; still , it is the natural expression of the feeling of one , who has been reposing in the classical shades of the university . And this , to us , gives a charm to the work , which nothing else could give so well . His visions are bright with the hues of youth , and as undefined and changing as the kindling clouds , that gather in the morning twilight round the throne of the rising sun . To those , the shadows of whose dial are shortened into noon , the gorgeousness has vanished ; but , though they feel them no longer , they have felt them once ; and may regard the enthusiastic description of them , as the old , in Goldsmith 's " Village , " survey the sports of the young beneath the spreading tree . The theme is appropriate to the poet . The young man can not describe , because he can not know , the feelings , the interests , and the thoughts of age ; while , on the other hand , the hopes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still . The sentiment of memory , in all ages , is essentially the same ; even the young man , whose May of life has not yet fallen into the sear and yellow leaf , looks back , like Obidah , with thoughtful sadness on the path he has already traversed , as if it led from a brighter region than any towards which his footsteps tend and the aged know that it is too surely so . But it is far otherwise with hope ; the earthly hope of youth is as unlike that of age , as the elastic frame of opening manhood to the palsied and wasting form that trembles over the grave . Yet there are hopes , that come alike to all ; the anticipations of an immortal life ; and here it is that the poet throws aside the character of youth , and treats his grand and overwhelming subject with the fulness of his power . It may be admitted , that the writings of Campbell betray little evidence of the knowledge of individual character , or interest in it as an object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but is calm , contemplative , and thoughtful , except when roused to strong emotion by the trumpet-call of freedom . In this way , he may fail to gratify those who love to deal with that which " the blood most stirs " ; which excites and startles , rather than pleases ; but with the great majority of readers , who love the sunshine better than the storm , this quality is not likely to impair his influence . In " Gertrude of Wyoming " the story is abruptly and not dis // tinctly told ; the images are those of pastoral life , without much care for the truth of scenery or manners ; nor are the characters produced with any remarkable power . But the quiet retreat of simplicity and peace , made desolate by the most relentless of all foes , presents a contrast , which , when clothed in his rich and melodious versification , touches every heart . We have heard the opinion sometimes expressed , that his lyrical productions are wanting in fire , and awaken nothing of the feeling without inspiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of much labor , and finished with the most scrupulous care ; hut it is not easy to see how the charge of coldness can be brought against " Ye Mariners of England , " or the " Battle of the Baltic " except by those , with whom national glory is but an empty name . They certainly stir the spirit , as with the sound of a trumpet ; and we believe that they will animate the sailor 's heart , so long as the meteor flag of England shall burn upon the deep . We are far from pretending that Campbell can be regarded as among the greatest of the masters of the lyre ; but there are many elevated stations on Parnassus , beneath the level of the summit on which Shakspeare and Milton are enthroned . Posterity may have a welcome to extend to the prophet , as well as to the king . We can not entertain a doubt , that he will survive many , whose popularity in their day has gone far beyond his . He was probably capable of greater things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark of Scott , that he was frightened by the shadow of his own fame ; but this could hardly happen except to a genius naturally timid , and reluctant to incur the hazard of a bolder flight . Such fastidiousness is not unfrequently the companion and the curse of exalted powers ; it seems , like mauvaise honte in social life , to bind the faculties as with a spell , and to convert the living into stone . This infirmity has undoubtedly withheld Campbell from efforts , which would have given new lustre to his name . But he has the great merit , in which some of his contemporaries have been sadly wanting , of revising without scruple , and blotting without reluctance ; and has deemed it no mark of inspiration or of wisdom to pour out his efflisions like an Italian improvisatore , till the press almost pants in the effort to keep pace with him . His descriptive power is inferior // to that of Scott ; he has little of the passionate energy , nothing of the sublime egotism , of Byron ; little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best poetical qualities , mingled in just proportions ; in beauty of illustration , in the power of producing effect without extravagance , in the mechanism of his art , he yields to none of these . His animation is without vehemence , his feeling without frenzy , his melody without harshness . The young will continue to worship Byron , the old may give the preference to Wordsworth ; but the general reader , who asks neither consuming passion nor profound philosophy , will probably fix his affections on Campbell , as one who uniformly pleases , without ever aiming to startle or astonish . " Out , hyperbolical fiend ! how vexest thou this man talkest thou nothing hut of ladies ? " Sonie Sir Topas of twenty-five years ago might have thus as fitly exorcized the demon that possessed Moore , as he of the " Twelfth Night " did the one that troubled Malvolio . This distinguished writer , who still lives in the fancy of many as gifted with immortal youth , has probably reached the solemn portion of life 's journey , that lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet it is by no means unusual to hear him spoken of , as if , like Falstaff , he were still in " the va'ward of manhood . " When he was a very young man , he visited this country , and found its democracy so little to his taste , that he made it the subject of bitter satire ; but the ramshorn was not sufficiently sonorous for the Jericho , and our frame of government has fortunately survived the shock . On his return to his own country , he constituted himself the laureat of Bacchus and of Love ; became the oracle of young ladies , especially those of the boarding-school , who were charmed to find their sentimental passions , " the bloom of young desire , and purple light of love , " embodied in flowery and harmonious verse . If the truth must be told , his conduct in this respect was equally insidious and base ; and it tells ill for the moral feeling of the day , that the same sentiments which , clothed in plain terms , would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his graceful song . There are no terms of condemnation too severe to mark the prostitution of the divinest of arts to the foulest of purposes . Happily time , the great corrector of abuses , has a remedy for this , as for all // other evil ; the words , which flow winningly from the lips of youth , are ludicrous when mumbled by the toothless gentleman of sixty-five . Those who write for the centre-table must expect to be shortly out of fashion ; and to present themselves to the next generation like a hooped , cushioned , high-heeled beauty of the last century , rustling and creaking in a modern ball-room . Had Moore done always thus , he must have been regarded merely as one , who pelted gracefully with sugar-plums at the carnival ; as a writer of considerable powers , but low and vulgar tastes ; for it is not in the power of rank and fashion , whatever currency they may for the moment give to glittering and brocaded sensuality , so to construct the mask as long to hide its coarse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits his ambition to the applauses of Almack 's , will soon find thut " the lights are fled , the garlands dead " ; and , if he he a man of genius , of the highest poetical genius he can hardly be , will meet the sad retribution which invariably follows the abuse of exalted powers . Any strong and not unworthy feeling , like the dramatic pity and terror , purifies the heart . There was a subject on which Moore felt deeply , and felt like a man . This subject was the wrongs of his country . For , whatever may be our impression of the demands of policy or necessity , one can hardly glance over the dreary waste of Irish history , without seeing that if England has been just , her justice has been slightly tempered with mercy ; for the Eternal City , in the flush of her proudest march of victory , rarely dealt with her subjected provinces as England has done with her sister isle . At least , it is certain that the elements of modern civilization sprung up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Ireland has little cause of gratitude for aught that has been done by her conquerors to improve and elevate her . Even were this otherwise , there is enough in her present as there has been in her past condition , to make us cease to wonder at the intensity of feeling , with which her sons regard the condition of a land , abounding in all that nature or genius can bestow to make it great and prosperous . It was a fortunate suggestion , that induced Moore to adapt new songs to the old and favorite Irish airs , which have a charm for every ear , that has not been disciplined to stand the fire of a modern orches VOL* L.-NO. 107. 64 // tra ; and it was fortunate too , that he availed himself of the occasion to express his natural and patriotic feeling . This feeling pervades them all , and seems to change the whole char*acter of the poet and of the man . Something of the old leaven remains , but the Melodies that reveal it are the worst of the collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graces in which he had been used to flourish , are rich in truth and beauty , and occasional loftiness of . inspiration . A striking effect is produced in some of them by covering the sword with myrtle , like the patriots of old ; as , for example , in the singularly beautiful song , " When he who has loved thee , " which appears to express merely the invocation of a dying lover , while it becomes far more touching and impressive , when regarded as the last address of the martyr of freedom to his country . There are other instances of this , which will readily occur to those who are familiar with the " Irish Melodies . " We need say little of " Lalla Rookh , " because its prominent beauty is of the same kind with that to which we have just adverted , and its defects are of the same character with those of his earlier poems , though far from being disfigured by the same grossness . There is no great beauty in the thread on which its pearls are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tales , which attract no very intense interest until we come to " The Fire-worshippers " ; then , his foot is on the soil of freedom , conceit and glitter are forgotten in the glow of patriotic enthusiasm , and the heart goes with the martyr of liberty through his race of disaster and sorrow , till he climbs the blazing altar . Moore 's mastery over the language is perfect ; he seems to possess a magic spell for converting every thing he touches into melody ; in following his sweet and flexible versilication , one almost ceases to care what thought it expresses , or whether it conveys any thought at all ; and it must be admitted , that in his Oriental descriptions his inclination for display and brilliancy is sufficiently at home . But this inclination can not be long indulged , except at the expense of manliness . Genius is always in earnest ; it does not disdain the aid of ornament , but disdains to make it other than an aid . The glory of Prometheus was not to decorate the senseless clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " create a soul under the ribs of death . " Perhaps the secret of Moore 's defects is his ambition to make himself the idol of society . // Whoever estimates himself by the standard of fashionable praise holds his fame by the most precarious of all tenures . If Milton had aimed merely to catch the applauses of a court , and that the court of Charles the Second , what a blight would have been brought upon a genius , created by Providence for all time and all nations . Scott had acquired a monopoly of favor before " Gertrude of Wyoming " appeared ; and Moore 's " Lalla Rookh " was published while Byron was lord of the ascendant . Neither of these gained , nor did the authors probably expect them to gain , any remarkable popularity , as success was in those days founded on other qualities than such as they displayed ; and the character of poetry was but another name for the peculiar traits of that of Scott and Byron . Their march was so triumphant , that it overwhelmed most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southey , and the calm confidence of Wordsworth , were not to be repressed by any adverse circumstances . In general , they were driven from j ) oetry to other objects of pursuit ; even Southey paused awhile in his epic career , to pour out a flood of histories , books of the church , biographies , and reviews . Campbell quietly retreated to the lecture-room and the editor 's chair ; and Moore employed himself in building the totubs of the prophets , whose living oracles he had most held in reverence . But we must not forget , that our subject is more inexhaustible than the l ) patience of the reader . What the character of English poetry will be in time to come , presents a most interesting subject of inquiry ; but it would be as vain , we fear , to decide on it with certainty , as to predict the form and colors of the next year 's clouds . Now that the fashion of excitement has for the moment passed away , and the field is again undisputed and open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope , that the east will soon redden with the promise of a purer , if not a brighter dawn , than that of the times which are gone by ; not perhaps in the character of the intellect it shall call forth , but in that of the objects to which poetry shall be devoted . Is not the promise of its coming to be seen in the majesty with which even Byron , reckless and poor in moral elevation as he is , urges his crushing chariot wheels over the delusive glories of battle ; in the calm inspiration with which Wordsworth finds the beautiful and true // in the pure affections of lowly hearts , and traces the footsteps of his God amidst the grandeur of his mountain solitudes ; in the thrilling strains , with which Southey celebrates the regeneration of the soul , and the victory of innocence and faith over the spells of dark enchanters ? The hour , we trust , is not far distant , when the spirit of the age shall he hut another name for moral and spiritual advancement ; when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for in shame and blood , or in the tournaments and dungeon-keeps of barbarism . The beautiful spirit of poetry , " from heaven which came , to heaven returns " when her vestments are soiled hy the grossness of mortality . Nor will the sphere of her dominion he diminished , as it grows more pure . She may unveil the depths and power of the affections ; accompany the philanthropist on his voyage of charity ; light the lamp of love , and kindle the altar-fire of devotion ; go up with the martyr to the mount of sacrifice ; and like the angels , when " With solemn adoration down they cast , Their crowns , inwove with amaranth and gold , " consecrate herself and all her powers to Him , from whom the springs of real inspiration flow . But how , and hy what manner of man , is such a work to he accomplished ? Hear the answer in the words of one of the noblest of the sons of men . " An inward prompting grew daily upon me , that , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my portion in this life , joined to the strong propensity of nature , I might , perhaps , leave something , so written , to after times , as that they should not willingly let it die . " Such was the divine vision , that hurst upon the eye of the true prophet . Thus did he lift up his soul to the contemplation of the mighty task , which Providence had called him to perform . " The accomplishment of these intentions lies not but in a power above man 's to promise ; but that none bath hy more studious ways endeavoured , and with more unwearied spirit that none shall , that I dare almost aver of myself , so far as life and free leisure shall extend . Neither do I think it shame to covenant with any knowing reader , that some few years yet I may go in trust with him toward the payment of that , for which I am now indebted ; as being a work not to be raised from the heat of youth , or the vapors of wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some vulgar amorist , nor to he obtained by the invocation of dame // Memory and her Siren daughters ; but by devout prayer to that Eternal Spirit , who can enrich with all utterance and knowledge , and sends out his seraphim with fire from his altar , to touch and purify the lips of whom he pleases . " Let him , who would hind his brow with the amaranth that shades the fount of life , study at the feet of this great master . His home was left desolate ; the standard of freedom , long upborne by his strong hand , lay rent and trampled in the dust . He was poor , blind , and forsaken . But he counted all this as nothing . He " hated not a jot of heart or hope . " The celestial light irradiated his mind through all her powers . To the eye of man , his course was finished , and his purposes were broken off . Yet , in the fulness of time , the glorious vision of his youth and manhood was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
