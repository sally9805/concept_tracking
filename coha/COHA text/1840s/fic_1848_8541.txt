TO GEORGE H. PENDLETON , ESQ. , OF CINCINNATI . My Dear Pendleton , You first called my attention to this Dramatic Poem ; and I therefore think it but just to dedicate to you the translation ; should it bring me honour , you are , on that account , entitled to your share of it ; and should my little venture meet with ill success , I shall throw some of the blame on your shoulders , as an instigator and accomplice before the fact . When you first spoke to me of the pleasure you had enjoyed in witnessing a representation of this piece , we were at Berlin together , and had just met as strangers from a common and far country , and strangers too , to one another ; but we had already begun , for we began with the first hour of our acquaintance , to form those ties of mutual friendship which now unite us . And truly , my dear fellow , if mutual knowledge of character be , as wise men hold , the only safe ground for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that ; for , after all our subsequent travels and loiterings , after those pedestrian rambles in Switzerland which so sorely tried our soles ; and those six rough weeks on horseback that we passed in Greece ; after the hardships of our Syrian tour ; and the tedious monotony of a journey across the Desert , I can safely say , that not a nook or corner of the heart of each of our trio ( for I must not forget our trusty comrade R ..... ) was unknown to the other two ; seeing that , as an old Spanish proverb hath it : " In a long journey , with hard toil and slender fare , a man learns to know what his companion is made of . " After we had returned from our adventures , and parted upon the banks of the Rhine , about two years since , I wended my way to the learned shades of Heidelberg , and there amused the hours of an illness which befell me , by translating the first two acts of the play which you had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your admiration when I read the original , and particularly the second , third and fourth acts ; and thought at once that it might be susceptible of an English dress . So I manfully undertook the labour of translation , which was however interrupted at the end of the second act by a six months ' tour which my roving spirit led me to make in the romantic land of Spain ; and it was not until the past winter that I found leisure to finish my most pleasing task . But I have been filling a page intended for other eyes beside yours , with details which can interest you alone . Let me now pass from friendly greetings , and give to the public some account of the author , whom I have attempted to render . " Friedrich Halm " is , as you know , merely a poetical name , which Baron Mnch-Bellinghausen has assumed in lieu of his own very Teutonic one . He was born in the year 1806 at Cracow , where his father held a post in the Austrian service . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Griseldis , " represented in the year 1834 at the Theatre of the Imperial Palace at Vienna , with a success scarcely inferior to that which the " Son of the Wilderness " afterwards attained . He subsequently produced various other plays , such as : " The Adept , " " Camoens , " " Imelda Lambertazzi , " " A Gentle Judgment ; " and also versions of Shakspeare 's Cymbeline , and of a drama by Lope de Vega . All these , with the exception of the last , met with but little favour ; but " The Son of the Wilderness , " which succeeded them and was first performed in the year 1842 , is generally regarded as the author 's masterpiece , and is extremely popular in Germany both as an acting and reading play . This is attested by the frequency with which it is performed and the number of editions through which it has passed . The one I have made use of in making my translation is the fourth , published at Vienna in 1845 . Baron Mnch-Bellinghausen now occupies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owe an apology to my author for two liberties that I have taken with his text . He makes Ingomar a chieftain of the " Tectsages , " a name uncouth to the last degree to a poetical ear , even with the aid of the false quantity to which he has had recourse , in order to improve it . He pronounces the word " Tectosgen . " I have made bold to substitute " Ligurians , " which has a more melodious sound , while the change violates no geographical conditions , except so far as regards the Arverni , or " Avernier , " ( as he calls them , ) whom I have accordingly ousted and replaced by " Helvetians . " It has been my aim to give my performance as little as possible the air of a translation ; and yet , with the two exceptions I have mentioned , it will be found by no means an unfaithful version . But I am anticipating the judgment of the public . Would that I were as sure of its indulgence as I am of yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written altogether in foreign countries , and therefore without any of that aid from literary friends in the way of hints and corrections which must be so useful in a work of this description . Having thus put in my plea for favour , I throw myself on the mercy of critics , and remain . Ever yours , faithfully , C. E. A. Paris , March 10th , 1848 . DRAMATIS PERSON .

Scene SCENE Massalia : the Market-place ; in the foreground on the right , Myron 's house . Acta sitting on the threshold of the house ; at her feet , a step lower , Parthenia , spinning with a distaff ; at her side a basket of flax . ACTA . Acta Bethink thee , child , that Polydore is rich , A man of vigorous years , a widower , true , But rich , a man of station and of credit , And courts thee for his wife . PARTHENIA Parthenia ( rising . ) The sun is setting ; I 've spun enough , methinks , for this day 's labour , The olives at our neighbour 's must be gathered , And so I 'll hie me thither . ACTA . Acta No ! remain ! For once I will be heard , thou giddy one ! Enough have childish follies , freaks , caprices Been thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy wild , inconstant nature , And seriously give heed to serious words . PARTHENIA Parthenia ( sitting down again . ) I 'm list'ning , mother . ACTA . Acta So thou tell'st me ever , And , while I talk , thy truant fancy roves O'er hill and dale , as thou thyself art wont , The live-long day in chase of butterflies . ' T is now full time with thy spring 's youthful graces To lay up for the autumn . Only youth Woos love , and youth is gone , before we think ; But the sad lot of the unmarried , is A lone old age , and every fool 's derision ; And this lot will be thine , because thy mind Refuses heed to sage advice , and bids Thee to defiance . Medon first of all Did note the fact  --  PARTHENIA . Parthenia Why he was old , and lame , And ne'er spoke but to chide . ACTA . Acta Evander too . PARTHENIA . Parthenia So redolent of herbs , and oils , and ointments ! To be with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( springing up in anger , while Parthenia continues to spin ) . Right ! Go thou on ! Tread fortune under foot ! Repentance never failed to wait on Folly . Thou think'st perhaps , that on thy tree of life There blooms for thee some rare and wond'rous lot ; Forsooth , thou'rt handsome , and canst think right soundly , And rich , no doubt . PARTHENIA Parthenia ( springing up ) . Young am I , gay , and happy , ( Embracing her mother . ) My mother loves me , and what need I more ? ACTA . Acta Loves thee !  --  Yes ! though so little thou deserv'st it ; By all the gods ! we love thee  --  heartily  --  Yet no ! why do I fold thee in my arms ? I 'm angry with thee  --  bitterly .  --  Away ! We love thee , but thou hast no love for us ; ' T is but to brave us that thou wilt not marry ; Thou'st taken it perhaps into thy head To wait till the man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a pause ) . Mother ! I ' ll tell you what ' t is that I wait for ; Though I was yet a child , I marked it well ; You spoke to me of Hero and Leander , And of their love ; but when I sought to know What Love might be , you answered with a smile , And told me , how Love springs up and waxes , And shines with sudden light in darksome breasts , While every pulse speaks out : ' T is he ! he bears Within his breast a portion of thy soul ! Oh let me live for him , and with him perish ! These were your words ; I heard and marked them well ; And then , when Medon and Evander came To woo , I laid my hand upon my heart At stolen minutes , hearkened to its beating , Listened and listened , but my heart was still ; And so , I wait until it speak its will ! ACTA . Acta What say'st thou ? Had I then  --  ( Aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run on to youthful hearts ! ( Aloud . ) Thou silly child ! for this then ' t is thou'rt waiting ? Thy heart must speak ? Give up that foolish notion ! If e'er I did relate that stupid fable , ' T was but a jest , an idle nursery-tale , And hides beneath sweet words , fantastic dreams ; Open thine eyes to plain reality , And grasp Occasion by its scanty hair ! No second Polydore will ever court thee , So rich , so honourable .  --  PARTHENIA . Parthenia So honourable ! And drives close bargains for poor father 's wares , Higgles and saves  --  ACTA . Acta Say rather that he is A prudent manager , and when thou'rt once His wife , he may become much more . For once Be serious ! say " Yes ! " and so repay Our love ! say " Yes ! " my child ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia Henceforth , dear mother , I will no more through wood and meadow rove , Will sit at home like other maidens , vex you No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that  --  that Polydore , I can not , will not , Never can wed him ! ACTA . Acta Indeed ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia You 're angry , But ' t is the truth , and so I must speak plainly . ACTA . Acta And I must tell thee too , that we , thy parents , Are growing old , and long to taste of rest ; Our house and little farm are deep in debt ; Thy father is an humble armourer , The field his toil by day , the forge by night ; And when the plough rests , he must leave his home , As even now , laden with heavy arms , To sell among the neighbouring villages . PARTHENIA . Parthenia Poor father ! ACTA . Acta I , am yet more to be pitied . I , stay at home , but my care wanders forth And bears with him the burthen of his wares ; With him , climbs panting up the rugged steep ; I feel the storms that tear his hoary locks ; The rain that beats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some dark glen Waylaid by wild Allobroges ; or , worse Than they , the fierce Ligurians rush on him , Rob , murder  --  So I weep and weep , but thou , His darling , thou , the apple of his eye , For whose sake ' t is he ventures life and limb , Thou might'st end all his toils , and dry my tears . With one word make us happy , and withal Crown thine own fortune ; but thou wilt not do it ; Ungrateful girl ! so I must tell thee plainly ! ( She goes into the house . ) PARTHENIA Parthenia ( after a pause ) . Ungrateful ! No ! I call the gods to witness ! I am not thankless , I am not ungrateful ! Is it for me then that the rude storm beats On that gray head ? Is it for me that , sighing , My father climbs the hills with heavy burdens ? ' T is the last time ! I 'll let my mother see She wrongs me . I 'll at once  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Immortal gods ! The thought distracts me ; ' t would be living death ! And yet , why do I grieve ? My days are flying ; And , though the future lay so bright before me , Though my heart spoke , in language full of meaning , Of rapture yet unknown ; my mother says Love 's but a dream , an idle nursery tale ; And so at last there is no truth on earth ; The sweetest charm of life is but a fancy , Built on no more than daily common-place ; If it be so , by Heaven my loss is nothing ! I 'll spare my sighing for a worse occasion , Although I fear no worse can ever come Than giving up the fairy dreams of youth ; Yet , be it as it may  --  away reflection ! My father shall no longer toil for me ! No longer  --  who is that ? ' T is Polydore . ( Is about to withdraw . ) Yet no , I 'll stay ; since in this business My happiness is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's bid before I sell it . ' T is Polydore indeed , see how he struts , Tosses his head , and throws his brow in wrinkles ! Pride speaks in every look , in every gesture ; And I his wife  --  I feel my heart 's blood freeze . ( She pretends to be occupied with her distaff , while Polydore advances in the back-ground . ) POLYDORE Polydore ( without observing Parthenia . ) It will not do , this slave wastes all my susbstance ; Turn him away I might ; but then , the children  --  I can not watch them all in the same minute  --  I must have a good housewife ! PARTHENIA Parthenia ( aside ) . One would think The world 's salvation rested on his shoulders , And yet I 'll wager that he 's counting up To find how some odd farthing 's gone astray POLYDORE . Polydore ' T is true that my poor Callinice 's loss Can never be repaired ! dear , faithful soul ! She knew how to lay up ! But , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make A stirring housekeeper ; if I choose her , I 'll make a prudent choice  --  why see , she 's here ! I hail this meeting as a heavenly omen . Good day , Parthenia ; good day , my child ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia " Good evening , " rather , as the sun is setting . POLYDORE . Polydore And yet " good day , " so must I ever greet you ; There is no sunset where your bright eyes beam . PARTHENIA Parthenia ( aside ) . How hard he tries to smile and look engaging ! ( Aloud . ) I pray you , truce to all such pretty speeches , And let us gravely talk on grave affairs ; I hear , you think of taking me to wife ? POLYDORE Polydore ( aside ) . Methinks she 's somewhat forward . Ah ! I see ! Her love 's impatience can not brook delay . ( Aloud . ) I have some thoughts of it . PARTHENIA . Parthenia So mother tells me ; And , though surprised that your choice falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POLYDORE . Polydore Forgotten ! No ! A man like me forgets not His heavy losses , whether land or money , Or money 's worth , and that was Callinice ; But many a weighty reason urges me To a new marriage ; first of all , my children  --  PARTHENIA . Parthenia Poor orphans ! POLYDORE . Polydore They ! Oh , you can spare your pity ! A dainty , greedy set of most unruly , Rebellious rogues ! And now shall I lay out A good round sum of money to procure A pedagogue from Samos or Miletus ? Is not rude strength best tamed by gentleness ? And I know you are gentle  --  PARTHENIA . Parthenia Gentle ? Yes ! ( Aside . ) Even as the lamb , though to the slaughter led ! POLYDORE . Polydore Besides , my business so often takes me From home , now to the port , now to the market ; And shall meanwhile a slave watch house and home , Store-rooms and well-filled chests ? How much more trusty A wife , a faithful wife ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , and feel , at times , Quite young again , yet messengers announce The approach of age : a gray hair , now and then , Attracts my eye , or gouty twinges dart Along my limbs ; and who will nurse me then , Keep the room warm , and make me savoury broths , And draughts of wholesome herbs ? Only a wife , A loving wife . PARTHENIA Parthenia ( aside ) . Ye gods ! my courage fails . POLYDORE . Polydore There 's yet another reason , brightly shining In your sweet eyes , blooming upon your cheeks ; It is , my rose-bud ,  --  PARTHENIA . Parthenia No ! I pray you keep That reason to yourself , and tell me one thing : You know my father labours in the field Or at the anvil , carries on his shoulders His heavy wares to distant purchasers , And yet is faint with years , and needs repose ; Say , will you think of this , when I am yours ? POLYDORE . Polydore Why certainly I 'll think of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound attention . PARTHENIA . Parthenia But tell me what you 'll do for my poor father ? POLYDORE . Polydore Do ? Why how can you ask ? Ah ! my good girl , ' T is not for me to trumpet my own praises ; But yet , I 'll do whatever you can wish ; And , first of all , your father will become My father-in-law , he 'll be a near relation To Polydore , to the rich Polydore ; And know that my long line springs from the gods ! Think , what an honour : from the gods , my child ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia It may be so , but honour is not bread . POLYDORE . Polydore Let not that trouble you , for I 'll still take Your father 's wares , as I have done till now , At fair and honest prices  --  PARTHENIA . Parthenia At fair prices ! Is that the limit of your wondrous bounty ? POLYDORE . Polydore And one thing more :  --  now mark me , my good girl , And bear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portion ; as you live and breathe , Without a single drachma will I take you ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia Are you in earnest ? Will you really do All that for my old father ? POLYDORE . Polydore ' T is much , ' t is true : Perhaps too much . PARTHENIA . Parthenia By all the gods , it is !  --  It is too much ! And so a pleasant evening ! ( Is about to leave him . ) POLYDORE . Polydore Stay ! let me hear your answer ere you leave me . PARTHENIA . Parthenia Yes ! you shall have an answer . Mark me well ! Seek out a pedagogue for your wild brats , At any price , where'er one may be found ; To guard your house , look well to locks and bolts ; And when you 're sick , you 'll find at yonder corner A huckster , who has wholesome herbs on sale , And with them you can make your own sick-draughts ; But know , there grows on earth to me no herb So bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my answer , may it now content you ! ( She goes into the house . ) POLYDORE Polydore ( having gazed after her for a while , with an air of stupefaction . ) What ! Did I hear aright ? Am I rejected ? I , the rich Polydore ? The armourer 's daughter Refuses me , the offspring of the gods ! Scorns me , and says so to my very face , As if I were her father 's journeyman , And laughs at me , to boot ? On earth no herb So bitter as my loathed presence ! Ay ! it shall Be bitter to you , and to all your race ! Henceforth let that old blear-eyed rascal forge His arms to his own ruin ! Not a blade Will I take from him . I ' ll buy up the claims Of all his creditors , vex him with lawsuits , And drive him , with that saucy girl of his , From house and home , ay ! from the very city : I will not rest until his fate ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in violent agitation , Lycon , the fisherman , appears in the back-ground . ) LYCON . Lycon The people said , " Straight down the street , then round The corner , and the first house on the right From the fountain . " Then it must be this . He , there ! ( He goes to the house next to that of Myron , and knocks at the door . ) Within ! open the door , good people ! ' T is in vain To shut your ears and feign to be all deaf . Misfortune knocks too loud , and in the end You 'll have to listen . POLYDORE Polydore ( aside . ) What can this man want ? THEANO Theano ( opening the door of her house . ) Who knocks there ? LYCON . Lycon Come out ! THEANO . Theano What 's the matter ? Tell me ! LYCON . Lycon Are you the wife of Myron , the old armourer ? THEANO . Theano I ? No , my husband 's dead . LYCON . Lycon Then thank the gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Theano How ? What ? Mean you that Myron  --  LYCON . Lycon Is a prisoner ; And carried off by wild Ligurians . POLYDORE Polydore ( aside . ) Aha ! that comes just in the nick of time ! THEANO . Theano Myron carried off prisoner ? LYCON . Lycon Yes , I saw it With my own eyes . THEANO . Theano Ye everlasting gods ! Old Myron  --  see , there go two friends of his ! ( To Adrastus and Elpenor , who are passing in the back-ground . ) Adrastus ! Elpenor ! This man brings news That Myron has been taken prisoner , And carried off by the Ligurians ! ADRASTUS . Adrastus How ? can it be ? ELPENOR . Elpenor How did it happen ? Speak ! LYCON . Lycon As I was in a wood by the sea-shore , Fashioning a sail-yard for my little boat , There came along a man , heavily laden ; The bushes hid me from his view , and he Lay down , a bow-shot from me , on the moss ; When suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like howling wolves , appear . POLYDORE Polydore ( aside . ) Avenging gods ! this is your work . ACTA Acta ( appears with a maid on the threshold of her house , and descends the steps . ) As usual , that careless girl has left Her distaff here . Take it into the house ! LYCON Lycon ( to Theano , Adrastus , and Elpenor . ) The old man could not but submit , and so His little store was quickly made away with . ACTA Acta ( to the maid , who has meanwhile taken up the distaff . ) The basket too . ( the maid goes into the house with the distaff and basket . ) LYCON . Lycon They asked him then what trade He followed ; and when he replied : " I am An armourer , " they raised a general shout Of joy and exultation at their prize ; He must go with them to the mountains ; bound , And with his gray hair streaming in the wind , They drove him forth . ACTA Acta ( after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping suddenly short upon the threshold . ) Gray hair ! An armourer ! Bound ! Driven ! Speak ! Tell me ! Who was the man ? ( descending the steps . ) Tell me , I say , who was that armourer ? LYCON Lycon ( after a pause , to the rest , who stand with downcast eyes . ) Is that his wife ? ACTA Acta Yes ! I am Myron 's wife ! Ye gods ! Can Myron be  --  no ! no !  --  but why , Why are you dumb ? Tell me you were not talking Of Myron ! Speak , I say ! ( Pauses for a moment , and then cries . ) Ah ! wo is me ! ADRASTUS . Adrastus She faints ! ELPENOR . Elpenor Support her , or she falls ! THEANO Theano ( supporting the sinking Acta . ) Help ! Help ! POLYDORE Polydore ( aside . ) She has her share ! Now comes the beauty 's turn ! AMYNTAS Amyntas ( coming up , with other men and women , on hearing Theano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? THEANO . Theano Help me , friends , to bear This poor unfortunate into the house ! ( Theano and the other women carry the half-insensible Acta into the house . ) AMYNTAS . Amyntas And they that took him were Ligurians ? LYCON . Lycon Yes ; for three weeks have these wild , shaggy knaves , Forth broken from the mountains where they dwell , Been roving all about , as is their wont , Laying the country waste , attacking travellers , And driving the cattle from the pastures ; And these are they who captured Myron . PARTHENIA Parthenia ( rushing out of the house , and towards the group assembled around Lycon . ) Where is the man that brought this news ? Is't you ? Say ! is it true ? Were you a witness of it ? LYCON . Lycon I stood within ten paces as they passed , The old man , and the fierce barbarians . PARTHENIA . Parthenia And you escaped , and he  --  LYCON . Lycon They saw me not I was alone , and did not dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone by , Then turned to flee , but the old man perceived me , And called in piteous accents after me : " I am the armourer , Myron , of Massalia ; Go thither , I adjure you by the gods , And tell my friends to come and rescue me ! " Thereat one of the savages cries out : " Yes ! go ! and let whoever undertakes To free him , bring a goodly weight of silver ; His ransom has been fixed at thirty ounces , For that 's his value ! " So I hastened hither , And they kept on their course towards the Cevennes . PARTHENIA . Parthenia A prisoner ! No ! it is no time for tears , But let my eyes be clear , my heart be steel ! You say they went towards the Cevennes , and ask A ransom ? True , our house and farm with debts Are loaded , but we have friends . POLYDORE Polydore ( aside . ) Hard cash were better ! PARTHENIA .

Timarch of Massalia It may not be ; for an old law forbids it , Left to us from the time , when , but just founded , Massalia struggled with her barbarous neighbours , In desperate contest for her infant life ; ' T was then decreed , lest anxious care for some Might jeopardize the safety of the whole , And prudence share the fate of reckless daring , Massalia should protect her citizens , Only so far as her walls ' shadow reached : And now since Myron  --  PARTHENIA .

POLYDORE Polydore ( rising . ) Why , let me see : his ransom 's thirty ounces ;  --  No , no ! ' T were a bad bargain ! I 'm a man Who takes advice , and so I 'll follow yours ! I 'll get a pedagogue for my wild brats , And guard my house with trusty locks and bolts ; And when I 'm sick , I 'll buy herbs from the huckster At yonder corner ; that 's my better course ; But as for you , my pretty , scornful one , Why you can free your father as you may !

A forest of thick over-arching foliage ; where the wood opens , a prospect over a wild rocky landscape . In the back-ground , on the left , a half-extinguished fire , over which a kettle is suspended ; several Ligurians , clothed in the skins of wild beasts , are sleeping round about ; near them lie spears , helmets , shields , overturned goblets and flagons , in a disordered pile ; in the back-ground , on the right , some tents made of hides . In the fore-ground , on the right , Ambivar , Novio , and Trinobant , reclining around a mass of rock , and throwing dice . To their left , in the centre of the stage , Ingomar , sleeping under a tree , against the trunk of which are leaning his spear and shield ; at a little distance from him , Myron , sitting on the ground .

Myron It seems to me as though ' t were all a dream ! Like hungry wolves they ' ve swallowed their rude meal , And , after quaffing draughts of mantling mead , Now these are rattling with their dice , while those , Their uncouth limbs crippled by drunkenness , Lie with their eyelids closed in leaden sleep .

Here you have meat and drink enough , you sleep At night upon soft moss , and when we 're once At home , a furnace shall be built for you ; There you can work and hammer as of old , And live as you were wont !  --  MYRON . Myron And do you count As nothing , that I lose my freedom ? INGOMAR . Ingomar Freedom ! What ? It makes me laugh ! And do you miss your freedom ?

Myron And if'tis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who among you will nurse me , care for me ? INGOMAR . Ingomar Nurse you ? Is there an herb that cures old age ? For that disease we have a better plan ; Among us , when a man is old and sickly , He goes into the woods , takes with him food For three days , lays him down upon the moss , Under a tree , consumes all his provision , And after three days spent he goes to Heaven ! MYRON . Myron And you permit it ? You look on ? The son Suffers his father then  --  INGOMAR . Ingomar To die ! Why not ? Why linger on , while his last hours are flying , A torment to himself , to us a burden ? Strength is the sum of life ; when strength decays , Our life is but a sword-hilt without blade , An empty quiver , and we cast it from us ! MYRON .

MYRON . Myron The sacrificial axe ! Ah me ! I feel it Piercing my flesh ! Ah me ! INGOMAR . Ingomar He acts as though The world were nothing , did he not live in it ! MYRON .

What are these women ?  --  Vain , luxurious things , Created to bear children , and be slaves ! That cast , as soon as ripe , their wanton glances , That crouch around the fire , and suckle infants , Look at themselves in brooks , and twine their hair !

Alastor Of her own accord She came to us . As we lay in the thicket , Steps rustle in the distance , voices sounded , And she passed quickly by , alike regardless Of the sun 's heat , and of the stony path .

Here it can deck no statue 's sacred brow , Here ' t will ne'er light my mother 's eye with gladness ; I am alone , forsaken !  --  No , away , I ' ll weep no more ! I 'll call up all my pride , And , even though they gave me cause for sighs , No coward tear shall ever dim my eyes ! INGOMAR Ingomar ( appearing with some branches of blossoms , and slowly crossing the state ; aside . ) When e'er my little Folko asked for fruit , For flowers or for any other plaything , And cried : Oh , bring it to me ! I will have it ! Whether I would or not , I had to do it : And she , in many things , I find is like The boy ! There are the blossoms ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia Thanks ! But look , They 're of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the flowers  --  ( She throws some of the blossoms on the ground . ) INGOMAR . Ingomar I ' ll go again  --  PARTHENIA . Parthenia No , no !  --  I think this branch will do  --  I thank you ! INGOMAR . Ingomar For my reward tell me more of your home , Tell me now all your mother used to say ! I ' ll sit here close to you  --  PARTHENIA . Parthenia No , no !  --  Not here ! You 'd crush my garland , ruin all my flow ' rs ! INGOMAR Ingomar ( sitting down at her feet . ) Well then , let me sit here , and now begin ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia What shall I tell you ? INGOMAR . Ingomar Tell me how you love And woo , how Love springs up , how Love departs , Oh tell me what Love is , for , by the gods , The word is an Ocean to my thoughts , And I would fain look down into its depths ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia How Love springs up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me  --  Give me yonder violet !  --  That Love comes , like the flowers , over night ; That Love ' s a fire , that kindles to fierce light From a soft glance ; that dreams and fancies feed ; That Love 's a star , to Heav ' n our steps to lead ; A green spot in a parch 'd and barren land , A little grain of gold in Life 's dull sand , And that the gods , when weary of this earth , They fled to yonder skies that gave them birth , And with them took all else that charm 'd our sphere , Forgot celestial Love and left it here . INGOMAR Ingomar ( Who has kept his eyes fixed upon Parthenia ; after a pause . ) It is beyond me ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia Beyond me too !  --  My mother Thinks one can only feel it ! But she taught me A little song , that speaks in plainer words , To me at least ! How does it run ? Ah yes ! ( She speaks slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me what is Love !  --  Since all my question shun : My heart , I 'll ask of thee . " One feeling in two bosoms , Two hearts that beat like one ! " And say : whence cometh he ?  --  And how doth he depart ?  --  " None may his coming see ! True Love ne'er quits the heart ! And when is  --  No  --  " INGOMAR . Ingomar Go on ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia I know no more ! INGOMAR Ingomar ( passionately . ) Try to recall it ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia So I do , but can not ! It will come back to me at some odd moment , And then  --  Here I must have some roses !  --  Ha , I see a cluster yonder ! I must go ; Do you meanwhile watch flow ' rs and garland for me ! ( She springs up , throws her flowers and garland into Ingomar 's lap , and runs away , to the left of the fore-ground . ) INGOMAR Ingomar ( after a pause , without altering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) One feeling in two bosoms , Two hearts that beat like one . ( The curtain falls . ) ACT III . Scene Scene as in the preceding act ; Ingomar 's spear and shield leaning against the tree , as before ; the fire under the kettle extinguished . ) INGOMAR , ( buried in thought , appears with Alastor on the left of the fore-ground . ) ALASTOR Alastor ( concluding a speech which he has been making . ) And ' t is for this the others now have sent me , From you , our trusty chieftain , to demand The needful orders for our homeward journey .  --  INGOMAR Ingomar ( speaking to himself in a low voice . ) I 'll tell her  --  No , I will not ! For , by heaven , ' T would seem as if  --  No , I will say to her , That I am satisfied with her past service , That I !  --  ALASTOR . Alastor You do not listen to me !  --  INGOMAR . Ingomar You , Alastor ? True , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , the stream was emptied of its fish , The frightened game driven from ev'ry wood , And only scanty pasture left the herds . INGOMAR . Ingomar Yes , yes , ' t was so ! ALASTOR . Alastor The time is drawing near , Appointed by our tribe , at home , for fend And hostile inroad , to avenge old wrongs , Upon the Allobrogians . INGOMAR . Ingomar How ?  --  right , right !  --  Our Allobrogian feud  --  ' t was so appointed .  --  ALASTOR . Alastor And we are fearful not to be in time !  --  INGOMAR . Ingomar Not to be there in time  --  I ?  --  Ingomar ? Lightning and thunder sooner fail the storm , Than I the battle ! ALASTOR . Alastor That was our firm trust , And so speak out , when do we leave this place ? INGOMAR Ingomar ( speaking to himself in a low voice . ) I , leave this spot ?  --  I return homewards ?  --  Home ?  --  To her home let me go , ne'er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only home were here , As though it were my birth-place , and my eyes Had here first opened to the light of day , As though I ne'er had been , till I came hither !  --  ( aloud . ) Where are the others ? ALASTOR . Alastor Yonder in the moss , On the wood 's margin , at their early meal . INGOMAR . Ingomar Let them have mead , as long as our store lasts ; Tell them to drink !  --  ALASTOR . Alastor What , not break up the camp ? INGOMAR . Ingomar Until to-morrow I must weigh the matter  --  ALASTOR . Alastor Until to-morrow  --  INGOMAR . Ingomar Till to-morrow ! Leave me ! ALASTOR . Alastor How changed you seem to me in speech and nature ! I hardly know you ! Well then , till to-morrow ! And may the bright beam of to-morrow 's sun Bring wisdom and discernment back to you ! ( Exit in the back-ground on the left . ) INGOMAR . Ingomar What , hardly know me ! Oh , that shaft tells home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I am not well . Some sickness troubles me ; My spirit is wrapped up in feverish dreams , And my mind wanders blindly here and thither ! ( He throws himself upon the rock in the right of the fore-ground ; after a pause . ) I once had with my arrow pierced a doe ; Close to my victim , as she dyed the moss With her heart 's blood , that flowed from the deep wound , Her young one stood , not dreaming of its peril , Or the hard end that overtook its dam , For its young life had not yet passed its dawn .  --  As I approached , to throw the slaughtered deer Upon my shoulders , it came running up , And took its food out of my bloody hand , And calmly gazed on me with its mild eye . And ever must I think on that mild glance , Oft as I gaze into the girl 's bright eyes , Now sparkling in defiance , now revealing In confidence the pure depths of her soul  --  Her child-like soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ,  --  Again ? And yet again ?  --  By all the gods  --  Can I  --  Can Ingomar then think on nothing better Than on a slave , than on a woman 's eyes ?  --  ( Clang of goblets , and sounds of revelry behind the scenes . ) Hark how they shout ! Their furious war-cry tells , Loud swelling ' mid the goblet 's joyful clang , That coming vict'ry gives the banquet zest ; Already , in the fight , their vengeance quenches Their father 's shame in Allobrogian blood , And I  --  Away ! ye sickly fancies !  --  Leave me ! A plunge in the wild battle cools hot temples , In a foe 's veins a healing springs , And I will seek it and regain my strength ! For me the clash of arms , the fight , the triumph ; Have I to do with women ?  --  She , indeed , Seems of another nature from the rest , And when I think of ours at home , wrapped up In shaggy skins , sun-burnt and coarse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bondage , basely wooing Their master 's favour with lascivious arts , I can but loathe them  --  but this Grecian maid  --  ( Revelry and shouting behind the scenes . ) Again your battle-cry ! In vain , no echo Answers you in the beatings of my heart !  --  Ah ! I am sick ! Whatever be my ill , In my soul 's soul I feel the raging sickness still ! ( He throws himself again upon the rock , while Parthenia enters on the right of the fore-ground , with a basket on her arm , and walks slowly towards the left , without observing Ingomar . ) PARTHENIA . Parthenia They 're sitting now at home , and mourning for me , And thinking me tormented , ill-used , dead ; But how much better has it all turned out , Than they suppose , than I myself had hoped ! ' T is thus man dreams , and only Heaven is watchful . I 'm well enough content with these barbarians ; True , they are wild and rough , and yet untamed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he does himself oft look at me As if he thought at least to take my life , Yet I am sure I 've nought to dread from him ; I fear him not , he listens to sound reason , He is the best by far of the whole band ! ( Approaching the rock and perceiving Ingomar . ) Why here he is ! INGOMAR . Ingomar You here ! Whence come you , girl ? PARTHENIA . Parthenia From picking strawberries in yonder thicket . See my full basket ! Will you  --  INGOMAR . Ingomar No , no ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia No !  --  It is as easy to say " Thanks " as No ! " Thanks , " do you hear ? Why do you stare thus at me ? You are not , sure ,  --  INGOMAR . Ingomar What should I be ? Away ! Go , I would be alone ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia Be ' t as you will ! ( She leaves him . ) INGOMAR Ingomar ( springing up . ) Ah , leave me not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my brain , my blood is boiling . PARTHENIA Parthenia ( returning quickly . ) You are not sick ? Tell me , where lies your pain ? I 've stolen many a secret from my mother , And I can make draughts of health-giving herbs , And drive off giddiness with potent charms ! What ails you ? Tell me . INGOMAR . Ingomar Nothing ! Now'tis past ! It is as if your breath had cooled the fire , That burning fever kindled in my heart , As if your gentle voice had sung to sleep A moaning child ! But , ere you came , my thoughts Were driving in a whirlwind of mad dreams !  --  PARTHENIA . Parthenia But they have left you now ? INGOMAR . Ingomar From the wild banquet , Far from my comrades a strong impulse drives me , Their battle-cry grates harshly on my ear ; My heart pants for repose , and dreams , and dreams , And blushes at its dream , and dreams it over  --  Parthenia , I would thou wert a man ! PARTHENIA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be well ! You 'd be My fellow in the chase , in war my brother , Like your own shadow would I follow you , Watch when you slept , and carry you when weary ! Ev'n as the rock echoes the pealing horn , As the clear brook reflects the azure flower That blooms upon its bank , so would my soul Be but the image of your ev'ry feeling ! Your smile would be as mine , mine all your pain ; Our separate lives be woven into one ; The secrets of our souls , our inmost being , The heart 's pulsations , and the springs of thought  --  ( Stopping suddenly . ) Oh Heavenly Powers  --  PARTHENIA . Parthenia What ails you ? Speak ! What moves you thus ! INGOMAR Ingomar ( speaking slowly to himself . ) " One feeling in two bosoms , Two hearts that beat like one . " PARTHENIA . Parthenia That is the song I said my mother taught me . INGOMAR Ingomar ( half to himself . ) That is the song , that lulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent the cloud asunder ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia You 're dreaming still methinks ! INGOMAR . Ingomar Did you not say , Love was a fire , that a soft glance enkindles , And that dreams feed !  --  They feed it even now , And the fierce flame is mounting to the skies ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia What ? Love ! INGOMAR . Ingomar Did not your mother say that Love , Love was a star to guide our steps to Heaven ? Oh come then , come ! It sheds its glowing beams , And clear and brilliant lies the path before us ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia His eyes are sparkling , his cheek burns with passion ! Immortal gods . INGOMAR . Ingomar Call not the gods from where They dwell above the clouds ! Though they took with them All else that lent enchantment to the earth , Yet , as you told me , they left Love behind ; Oh let us love then , and be blest like them ! Parthenia , be mine ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia Away , thou'rt raving ! INGOMAR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , By all the flames that prey upon my heart , The goblet mantles , and it shall be quaffed !  --  Mine art thou , mine ! PARTHENIA Parthenia ( retreating in terror . ) Where shall I hide me ? Back ! INGOMAR . Ingomar Thou'rt mine ! PARTHENIA Parthenia ( pointing her dagger at her breast . ) Desist ! Or see me die ! INGOMAR . Ingomar Hold ! Hold ! Ah , drop that cruel steel ! ( Regarding her half in amazement , half in anger . ) What ails me then ? What keeps me back ?  --  I am her master !  --  Is She not my slave ?  --  Those angry orbs of hers dart lightnings through me ; What fear is I know not , but only fear , Methinks , could make me thus cast down my eyes ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia How wretched is my lot ! INGOMAR . Ingomar Thou , wretched ? What ! I did not frighten thee ? I was too hasty ! But hasty is my temper , rough my nature , And Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love ? Ah no ! I ne'er loved any one except my parents , But if I ever thought to leave my home , As others do , to follow one I loved , I thought ' t were only when some constant heart , With gentle , timid , patient tenderness , Should half compel , half yield itself my captive , Respect in me its innate dignity , Nothing exact , take all as a free offering ; He should protect me , lead me , carry me  --  But what avails it to waste words on you ! ( She leaves him . ) INGOMAR Ingomar ( throwing himself in her way . ) Stay , I command you ! Do you deem me then Unworthy of your words ! Learn what I am ! I am a mighty chief , my glorious deeds Resound in song through all my native hills ; I am your master , and your master 's favour Should honour you , methinks , and so reflect On my rank , and on yours ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia On my rank ! True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , The humble armourer 's child , yet I 'm a Greek , Massalia 's free daughter ! I was reared Mid the glad rites of bounteous deities , Nurtured upon the breast of gentle manners , And cradled in the arm of grace and beauty ! But you are the rough wilderness 's son , You grew up with the wild beasts of the wood , And though you are the first among your people , To us you 're but a robber , a barbarian , A cattle-stealer , and , at home , we punish Robbers and thieves with rods and with the cross ! INGOMAR . Ingomar Audacious  --  PARTHENIA . Parthenia Now , that I have spoken out , I breathe more freely , and do you reflect On your rank and on mine ! INGOMAR . Ingomar What , do you venture  --  Scorn And mockery  --  To me ?  --  Now then , by all the gods ! Learn , slave , how ' t is that slaves are taught their duty ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia Perhaps you tame them down with thirst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach them how to love ? But slaves can never love ; they only fear , And hate , even as I hate thee , and know That force will ne'er extort aught else from me Than one thing , bitt ' rer yet than hate ,  --  INGOMAR . Ingomar Be silent ! Or dread my wrath ! Speak not that word  --  PARTHENIA . Parthenia Contempt ! INGOMAR . Ingomar For that thy life shall make atonement ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia Take it ! INGOMAR Ingomar ( rushing upon Parthenia with his drawn sword , and suddenly stopping . ) No , no ! my own life sooner ! ( The sword drops from his hand . ) Wo is me ! I would and can not ! Fury burns within me ; Oh , I could tear myself to pieces now ! I am no more myself  --  My strength is gone ! ( Throws himself upon the ground , in the most violent agitation . ) PARTHENIA Parthenia ( after a pause . ) What does this mean ? Here at my feet the sword , That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stretched upon the ground ; his senses wand'ring  --  What means this ? Was I then too hard with him ? Ah , whither did my anger hurry me ? ' T was but his ignorance  --  Do I see right ? You 're weeping  --  Ingomar , why do you weep ? INGOMAR Ingomar ( springing up . ) Women may weep , not I ! Think you I weep ? I am but sick ! ' T is nothing more .  --  Contempt ! To me my nation 's pride , the foeman 's terror  --  ( After a pause , and looking at her angrily for a moment or two . ) Go ! I can bear your absence ! Did you think I could not ? Idle fancy ! Go , you 're free ! Free as myself ! ' T is I give you your freedom ! Go to your home ! Away , and linger not ! Your breath is fraught to me with sickly dreams , Your very glance is poison ! Hence ! Away ! ( He rushes off the stage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and in anger !  --  Be it so ; It was but just to mortify his pride , When the barbarian sought to humble mine ! And so my breath gives him these fev'rish dreams , And I must hence , and linger not ! Well then , He shall not say so twice  --  I 'm free once more ; Oh winged footsteps , bear me to my home ! My mother beckons me , I see my father Op'ning his arms  --  ( pausing . ) And shall I then part thus From him who made the yoke of slavery So light to me , who gave me back my freedom ? For though ' t was in his anger , still he gave it ! No ! By this light of Heav'n !  --  I 'll wait for him , He must come back this way . And then  --  I 'll trust To the occasion to inspire my tongue With what I ought to say . His wrath will vanish , I , his me homewards with a lighter heart !  --  ( As she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before placed her basket , Ambivar , Samo , and Trinobant , who have appeared in the back-ground on the right , during Parthenia 's last speech , advance by degress to the front of the stage . ) SAMO . Samo He said he ' d think upon it till to-morrow . AMBIVAR . Ambivar He 'll say the same thing then ! The end will be We 'll never quit this place ! TRINOBANT . Trinobant Thunder and lightning ! To lie here idle ! AMBIVAR . Ambivar And meanwhile our comrades Are pressing towards the Allobrogian land , And they 'll secure the best part of the booty ! SAMO . Samo We will not suffer it ! TRINOBANT . Trinobant Come ! Come to Ingomar ! This day we must begone ! AMBIVAR . Ambivar He 'll hardly think so ; He 's playing with his Greek girl , in the moss , List'nig to songs , letting her tell him stories  --  TRINOBANT . Trinobant Ay ! it is all her fault , the artful Greek , ' T is she that keeps him here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( They continue to speak together in a low tone . ) PARTHENIA . Parthenia Not yet come back ! He told me he was sick ; He told me so , and without doubt he is ! His face was now all fire , now deadly pale , So pale  --  And can he then  --  By all the gods , My heart beats quick  --  In yonder thicket 's shadow , I 'll follow unobserved upon his footsteps ! ( She hurries across the stage , and disappears to the left of the fore-ground . ) AMBIVAR . Ambivar Believe me , what I tell you is the truth , And Ingomar will ne'er break up the camp , Until that Greek is gone ! TRINOBANT . Trinobant But she is his ! AMBIVAR . Ambivar Not she ! The booty is not yet divided , And she 's ours yet , as much as his . SAMO . Samo Right ! She is ours ! TRINOBANT . Trinobant What ' s to be done with her ? AMBIVAR . Ambivar There is a vessel anchored on the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them we ' ll carry her ! They ' ll give us swords , Rich bracelets , armour , in exchange for her . SAMO . Samo So be it ! AMBIVAR . Ambivar Come , then ! TRINOBANT . Trinobant But when Ingomar Hears of it  --  AMBIVAR . Ambivar Let him hear of it when ' t is done ! ( Aside . ) He called me villain , and I 'll earn the title , Nor is even thus the debt I owe him cancelled ! SAMO . Samo I see her coming !  --  AMBIVAR . Ambivar Silence ! Stand aside ! ( They withdraw into the back-ground of the stage on the right , as Parthenia advances out of the thicket , on the left of the fore-ground . ) PARTHENIA . Parthenia He 's lying stretched upon the moss , and hides His face between his hands , and his hands tremble , And his breast heaves with deep and long-drawn sighs ! Can this be sickness , or  --  Ye gods ! I fear The subtle plague is taking hold on me ! AMBIVAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his companions , crept , unobserved , nearer to Parthenia , who stands buried in thought . ) Now is your time , my comrades ! ( The Ligurians seize her by the arms and hold her fast . ) PARTHENIA . Parthenia Back ! Release me ! What would you have ? SAMO . Samo Hush , hush , my pretty bird ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia Begone , I say  --  TRINOBANT . Trinobant Be quiet , girl , or  --  PARTHENIA . Parthenia No , You shall not ! AMBIVAR . Ambivar Off with her into the thicket ! PARTHENIA Parthenia ( as she is being dragged away into the thicket by the Ligurians to the right of the foreground of the stage . ) Oh , rescue me , ye great , avenging gods ! Help !  --  Rescue  --  ( Not until off the stage . ) Ingomar ! INGOMAR Ingomar ( advancing quickly on the left of the foreground . ) Who called me ? Was It not her voice ? ( Looking behind the scenes . ) Ha !  --  Ambivar !  --  A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground the sword , which he before let fall . ) Behold one here , and blood shall dye it !  --  ( Exit hastily to the right of the fore-ground ; after a short pause , Parthenia rushes out of the thicket . ) PARTHENIA . Parthenia Ah , wo is me ! Ah , horror , INGOMAR Ingomar ( following her closely , with the sword still in his hand . ) Stay , Parthenia ! Why do you fly ? ' T is I ! How pale you are ! Your strength is failing ! Let my arm support you ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia Away ! Your hand is bloody ! INGOMAR . Ingomar He is dead , And let the rest take warning from his fate ! You hang your head !  --  What , did their rude hands grasp My tender flower so roughly !  --  How you tremble !  --  They did not hurt you  --  Ha ! if it be so , They shall all make atonement ! One by one , Here in the dust I 'll drag them to your feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms !  --  INGOMAR . Ingomar While I am with you , There is no power on earth to do you harm ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia Ah , wo is me ! They come ! There !  --  INGOMAR . Ingomar Let them come ! My soul is borne aloft on eagle 's pinions , A more than mortal spirit swells my veins , And till a flash from Heaven lay me low , To all that men can do I bid defiance ! ( During Ingomar 's last words , Alastor , Trinobant , Samo , Novio , and other Ligurians , armed with spears , swords and clubs , make their appearance by degrees , in threatening attitude , on the right of the foreground . ) INGOMAR Ingomar ( advancing upon them . ) What means this ? Speak ! What is it brings you hither ? ALASTOR Alastor ( after a pause . ) Blood has been shed , and it cries out for vengeance ; Your sword has pierced the heart of Ambivar  --  INGOMAR . Ingomar It was because he laid his grasping hand On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is not yours ; Until a just division , all our booty Is common property  --  SAMO . Samo Give the woman up ! NOVIO . Novio Lay hold of her  --  INGOMAR . Ingomar Come on then , all ! PARTHENIA Parthenia ( throwing herself into the arms of Ingomar . ) Ah , hold ! They are too many ! Hold ! They 'll murder you  --  INGOMAR . Ingomar Woman , away , where men contend ! Come on ! ALASTOR Alastor ( throwing himself between Ingomar and the Ligurians . ) Hold , say I too , and do you comrades , listen ! We chose you as our chieftain , Ingomar , Assigning you a fifth part of the booty , That one among us might arrange disputes , Decide our quarrels , and protect our rights ; But you give yourself up to slothful ease , Unjustly take this slave unto yourself , And strike your comrade dead in hasty passion ! Thus have you , shield and pillar of our rights , Done double violence to right and peace , And ill repaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Ambivar , By his foul deed , robbed you as well as me , And without that had richly earned his fate ! As for the place I hold , know that it irks me Longer to keep such a presuming race As you in check ; so choose the paths you 'll follow Henceforth yourselves ; I am no more your leader !  --  The girl is mine ; the fifth part of the booty , Assigned to me in payment of my toils , Take as atonement for your comrade 's death , And as her ransom ! Speak , if you consent ! If you refuse , then let the sword decide ! TRINOBANT . Trinobant The fifth part of the booty  --  NOVIO . Novio Does he mean it ? ALASTOR . Alastor Ten oxen , at the least , fall to his share , And twice as many sheep  --  SAMO . Samo A bargain , say I ! ALASTOR . Alastor ( After a short pause , during which he and the others whisper together . ) I think we are agreed ! So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the booty ? INGOMAR . Ingomar None ! As I told you ! ALASTOR . Alastor Then the slave is yours , And if you now will guide our footsteps homewards , We promise to obey you as before . INGOMAR . Ingomar My mind 's made up ! I am no more your chieftain ! I will to our neighbours , the Helvetians , Among the Alps , for I would see new lands , And other customs ! Leave me when you will ! I go not with you  --  ALASTOR . Alastor Think of our inroad Among the Allobrogians  --  INGOMAR . Ingomar I 've thought of it ; We part ! ALASTOR . Alastor So be it then ! Ho , comrades ! Strike The tents , and let us make at once for home ! INGOMAR . Ingomar ( While Alastor and the other Ligurians slowly withdraw , to Parthenia . ) Now , maiden , fear no more ! They ' ll soon be gone , And were ' t not for your trembling , your pale looks , They had not , trust me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanish from your face ; Sit here and rest ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia Oh , Ingomar , I thank you ! INGOMAR . Ingomar Thanks ! And for what ? PARTHENIA . Parthenia I know you only followed The dictates of your heart ; but that your heart Gave you such dictates , that I , scorned at home , Found a protector in the wilderness , For this , oh let me thank the gods in you ! Think of me then , as I shall think of you , And so , farewell ! INGOMAR . Ingomar Farewell  --  What say you ? How ? You will not follow me to the Helvetians ? PARTHENIA . Parthenia You gave me back my freedom , let me then Go to my home  --  INGOMAR . Ingomar I  --  Give you back your freedom  --  I  --  Do you dream ?  --  PARTHENIA . Parthenia Do you take back your word ? INGOMAR . Ingomar My word  --  in truth , it seems to me as if  --  My word  --  it must hold good , you 're free ! PARTHENIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , Parthenia , ' t is as if ' t would ne'er Be day again on earth , as if the sun 's Bright beam were quenched in everlasting night !  --  I can not bear to think that you should leave me !  --  PARTHENIA . Parthenia My parents pine to see their daughter  --  INGOMAR . Ingomar Yes , ' T is so , you 're free  --  But no !  --  Ah think , Parthenia , Of the dark woods , the dark cliff 's dizzy height , The torrents raging through the savage glens , And bears and wolves lurking in every cavern , And you  --  think you alone  --  PARTHENIA . Parthenia I came alone , Alone I can return ! INGOMAR . Ingomar You shall not !  --  No , Novio and Alastor shall go with you ! Ho there ! This way ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia No ! Rather bear and wolf , Than those wild ruffians ! INGOMAR . Ingomar What , you think  --  In truth , ' T were to confide the lamb to the wolf 's care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I will myself go with you ! PARTHENIA . Parthenia You ? INGOMAR . Ingomar Why do you gaze on me so searchingly ? You think I were scarce better than the others ? Parthenia , I am not what I was ! I ne'er felt fear , scarce shed a tear in childhood , But you , to-day , have taught me to do both ; Dread me no more ! Believe , confide in me ; I call on all the gods to bear me witness  --  PARTHENIA . Parthenia Ah , do not swear ! To me your eye speaks language Far truer , holier , than oaths can utter ; If that be falsehood , then is nothing true !  --  Yes , you shall be my guide , I 'll follow you ! INGOMAR . Ingomar Do you consent ? Oh come then , let me lead you !

All this I owe you , and I had , methought , One day requited you with happiness , Such as ne'er yet fell to the lot of woman !

Ah , how I blushed that I had thought to teach you , And what ? Such things as I myself had learned With pain , despite the habit of long years , Mere lifeless forms , and words , and tinsel toys , When you 'd received out of the gods ' own hand , The genuine gold we think not to demand , The soul 's strong impulse that constrains to truth !
