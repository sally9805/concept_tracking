Dis child grins and winks at Miss Fortune , and , says he : I 'm on the road to fortune . Huzza ! ( More soberly . ) Dis nigger must n't explode in glorification . I 'm about decapitulating my prospectus of posterior fame  --  I 'm situated at the tail of Mister Legrand 's grand dashing caravanserai , as Mister Pompey , the shining brightest particular star in de whole firmament consternation , and I 'm bound to shine , like an eclipsed nigger . I 'm bound to shine , for an old she nigger told me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crawling little black imp ;  --  darkey , says she , thou will live a very adventurous existence  --  thou will be a dashing and smashing nigger in de middle of de big white folks .

Catharine Well , I 'll tell you , you 're on the road to fortune , if you play the bright nigger . Pompey , Pompey ( fervently . ) Give , give to Pompey de fortunate intelligence . Catharine . Catharine Well , I 've been some time at Mr. Legrand 's , and I know all about the family . Pompey . Pompey Give , give  --  Pompey starves for de facts . Catharine . Catharine Mrs. Legrand is a very bold , dashing , imperious woman ; you must n't offend her . Pompey . Pompey Ob course ; dis nigger idolizes de fair sex . Catharine . Catharine You must please her . Mr. Legrand is cold , sour and crabbish . You must n't never get him in a passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crabbed gemman ; has the gemman got de dust ? Catharine . Catharine That 's not my business nor yours . Master Charles is a pleasing young gentleman ; he 's coming back from the old world ; and my young mistress , you see , is cousin to Charles . Miranda is a very good and kind young lady ; let me tell you , in secret , that she loves Charles  --  she has sighed much since he is away . As I said , Charles is coming back , and that 's the point ; there 's likely to be some opposition in their love , and if you was asked to play a second cupid in the case , do it . Pompey . Pompey Ob course ; but a darkey play cupid de second ? Catharine . Catharine Why not ? Mind what I said , ' twill all be for your benefit , and you 'll please my young mistress and master . Mind , Pompey . Pompey . Pompey Ob course  --  dis nigger 's no fool . Catharine . Catharine That 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune , I 'll fool de world ; Dis adventurous nigger ' ll gain dust and laurels . Exit . Scene II .  --  Eugenia 's Room , poorly furnished . Eugenia sitting by a table , sewing . Eugenia , Eugenia ( in a calm and gentle tone . ) Poverty is no crime , indeed ; but still poverty has many smart inconveniences , that often bring misery and wretchedness . Work is not always very abundant , and then the remuneration is so trifling ; it requires skill and patience , indeed , and a firm steadiness , to thrive under these circumstances . But what should we care for more than a comfortable livelihood ? It is true that the price is exorbitant , for we have to ply the needle unrelentingly for a bare subsistence , to the loss of our health and spirits ; but we can not mend our lot  --  we must bear patiently our burden  --  it is not given to all to be rich  --  ( with a sigh )  --  but still , notwithstanding my willing resignation , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly at work ; alone in the world , I am deprived of the little and pleasant attentions of kindred ; and those that are rich enjoy themselves so well , always amid pleasures and feasts ; but we , poor laborers , we are despised ! ( brightening , ) but no matter , we earn an honest living , and as long as heaven will give us work and health we will be contented . ( Looking , with joy . ) Cousin is coming ; I am always so happy in his presence . Enter Joseph Sniffle , with a sunny countenance . Eugenia rises to meet him . Joseph , Joseph Sniffle ( with animation . ) How do you do , dear cousin ? Eugenia . Eugenia Very well , Joseph . Joseph . Joseph Sniffle Be seated , cousin . ( They sit . ) Always at work , as busy as a bee . Eugenia . Eugenia That is the poor 's only consolation , and happy they may be when they have it . Joseph . Joseph Sniffle Be contented , cousin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any lord . Eugenia . Eugenia Perhaps so , but do n't you think that if we were rich that we would be happy  --  much happier ? Joseph . Joseph Sniffle Well , it might be so ; I do think that money , well employed , may give happiness , notwithstanding the cry that is raised by some sordid , selfish and niggard wealthy individuals , that money will never secure happiness ; but they judge by themselves  --  they are too mean to spend their money , they torture their brains continually to seek to increase their stores  --  they will sometimes be even dishonest to do so ; it is no wonder to me that riches should make them wretched and miserable ; but it is a wonder , indeed , that they so tenaciously retain their money and unhappiness . But let us not think of that , cousin , the poor , honest and industrious are more independent than the rich , and if contented , they may be happier . To gain a fortune , cousin , I should not barter integrity and honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest man is the noblest work of God . " Eugenia . Eugenia You are right , cousin ; we are poor , but let us be honest  --  let us scorn gold saturated with tears and blood . Joseph . Joseph Sniffle Whilst we are in that vein , cousin , I must tell you what I have been thinking often , this  --  that mother often told me that one of her brothers had started for India when young , and he never was heard from ; now , he might not have died ; it is likely that he made an immense fortune , and as he was partial to you and I , should he remember us , how pleasant it would be ; I fondle the idea as the brightest hope . Eugenia . Eugenia Visionary illusion , Joseph  --  if you were disappointed at last , how miserable you would feel . Joseph . Joseph Sniffle True , cousin , but still a few thousands would be welcome  --  do n't you think so ? Eugenia . Eugenia Yes . Joseph Joseph Sniffle Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restless , but let us not indulge in dreams , that the non-reality would rend our quiet and happiness ; let us add our quota to the world 's wealth , without murmur , and live honest and industrious . I will now leave you , cousin ; be in peace and happy . Eugenia . Eugenia Thanks ! Conducts him to the door . Scene III .  --  The Battery . Enter Adolphus Horatio , dressed in the tip-top of fashion , scanning all with a glass . Horatio . Adolphus Horatio Delicious fine place , this , most charmingly captivating , but how sublimely ridiculous that it is the elysium of the poor and vulgar , to the exclusion of the recherch and high class of the haut ton ; supremely absurd . The country 's going to ruin , we are losing our rights , liberty is stealing our very breath , damn me  --  it is absolutely abominable , ' pon my honor . This enchanted spot was designed to be a love 's bower for the fair , the lovely resort of fashion  --  now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positively . Fair ones , you are robbed of your paradise . ( Looking . ) Oh , despair ! some low villains and rascals come ; their touch , their breath is polluted ! I shall expire ; positively . Retreats to exit on the opposite side . Enter Albert , a man of fashion , also . Albert , Albert ( to Horatio . ) Where bound , in that crazy locomotive fashion ? Horatio . Adolphus Horatio To the devil ! Albert . Albert What 's the matter ? Horatio . Adolphus Horatio Count , my dear fellow , how 'd do ? Albert . Albert Way , Horatio , you are always flirting , like a pert maid  --  it is the height of absurdity ; you a knight errant , you would fly from your shadow ! Horatio . Adolphus Horatio Damn me , I ca n't approximate myself to any plebeian knave , positively . Albert . Albert Nor to any knave . Horatio . Adolphus Horatio Nor to any knave , ' pon my honor . But where have you been lately , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Lewis 's ; ' pon my honor , my dear fellow , you are forgetting your friends  --  it is positively excruciating , damn me ! Albert . Albert Do n't think of it  --  some small matters . Horatio . Adolphus Horatio You know , my dear fellow , that you ca n't be spared ; you are the lion of every parlor and party ; you are the greatest sovereign of this land of sovereigns  --  the god of the fair and beau monde , ' pon my honor . Albert . Albert You are gilding a golden toy , Horatio . Horatio . Adolphus Horatio Bravo ! capital ! admirable , ' pon my honor . You will have that saying repudiated and obliterated , my dear fellow ; it will thenceforth be on your special account : that your brilliant illumination sparkles more than gold that glitters . Albert . Albert Then it will be superlatively extra and superfine . Horatio . Adolphus Horatio Illumined with a more brilliant radiancy than the physiognomy of the stupendous luminary . Albert . Albert A star of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albert . Albert A phoenix of the heavens . Horatio . Adolphus Horatio The sovereign , in majestic omnipotence . Enter John Flitch . John F. , John Flitch ( sarcastically . ) Two glimmering fools under a sparkling firmament . Horatio , Adolphus Horatio ( affrighted and shocked . ) Oh ! horribly vulgar ; let us be off , Count  --  come . Draws him . Exeunt . John F. John Flitch A count ! but two worthies , indeed ; these are fair samples of the transcendant phenomena of the age  --  inflated fools , that will , in a high flown and metaphorical jargon , soar in heavenly spheres  --  modern Balaams , above their masters , and sitting on an absolute and supreme throne of wisdom , fashion and folly  --  self-created species , for nature never intended to make of sovereign man fools and apes . Those fools are indeed a foul blot on enlightenment and civilization . To my mortification , I have been told that a fool of a nephew of mine was one of them ; I never was fond of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn  --  I always said that he would make nothing but a fool and an idiot , squandering his money like an ass , instead of employing it in a way to acquire wealth , fame and honors  --  I tried to inculcate principles and honor into his skull , but the dunce would have his way , and he preferred drifting in the immense ocean of perdition , rather than steering in the road to fortune ; well , it is impossible to teach wisdom to fools . Exit . Re-enter Albert and Adolphus Horatio . Horatio , Adolphus Horatio ( in a flutter . ) The old villain is gone , now I perspire with independence ; I ca n't stand plebeian vulgarisms  --  I would expire , ' pon my honor , my dear fellow . Albert . Albert Who is the impertinent old man ? Horatio . Adolphus Horatio An old scoundrel . ( Looking . ) He is coming this way ; let us step aside , my dear follow , we may pluck a bough of the old scoundrel 's genealogical tree . They step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That rascally nephew of mine , in his delicate exquisiteness , is actually ashamed of his father 's name  --  Flitch is too rude and vulgar for the overgrown scamp . Horatio . Adolphus Horatio You old scamp . John F. John Flitch But he must play the fool , with fashionable and pompous names  --  Adolphus , Horatio  --  the renegade , he would disown his old uncle , John Flitch , but I 'll stuff sense in his brainless skull with my cane . Exit in a flurry . Albert and Horatio come forward . Horatio , Adolphus Horatio ( indignantly . ) My dear fellow , you have heard the old villain  --  may I be excommunicated from the fair and beau monde if I stand that  --  I will have satisfaction ! Albert . Albert But who is the old man , Horatio ? Horatio . Adolphus Horatio The old fool is my uncle , damn me ! Albert . Albert Your uncle  --  John Flitch ? Horatio . Adolphus Horatio I think that he is , strike him perpendicular ! Albert . Albert He is rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horatio A magnificent idea ; bravo ! I 'll tell you something , my dear fellow ; the old man is rich , but he never did like me ; I am unfortunate , shockingly . I 'll propose you a plan to get rich and in favor . Albert . Albert By all means  --  do it . Horatio . Adolphus Horatio Your name is so unpoetical , so unmusical , so abominably rude  --  Albert . Albert What then ? Horatio . Adolphus Horatio We will change appellations . Albert . Albert But I have a letter of introduction to Mr. Legrand . Horatio . Adolphus Horatio I will be the man and the possessor , and I will introduce you . Albert . Albert Done ! Horatio . Adolphus Horatio Done ! ( Shakes hands . ) There , my dear fellow , your fortune is made , you will attain the summit of riches and happiness . ( Aside . ) But when my uncle gets the list of my rascalities , he 'll be thrashed . ( Aloud . ) But mind , my dear fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penitent ; you must be a smiling and tearful hero  --  but I could not stoop to such low vulgarities , damn me ! Albert . Albert Never fear , I 'll gull and bamboozle old John Flitch , - la- Yankee . ( Aside . ) Capital ! my position is untenable  --  if my father gets a gripe of him he 'll be shaken out of his senses . Horatio , Adolphus Horatio ( looking above . ) My dear fellow , look , methinks I see a little cupid flourishing a gold-filled cornucopia above our heads , ' pon my honor . Albert . Albert A bright vision  --  but the prize is mine . Horatio . Adolphus Horatio I am tired of being a republican  --  I give you my inheritance for a title  --  it 's a barter , my dear fellow . Albert . Albert ( aside . ) I am tired of being a penniless Count  --  I 'll be a rich plebeian . Horatio , Adolphus Horatio ( Looking . ) That impudent Flitch is coming back  --  I will have satisfaction ; speak boldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , you will beg pardon and get reconciled the next time . I 'll have satisfaction ; a Count ca n't stand insulted by a plebeian villain , damn me ! Albert . Albert He 's game , and he 'll be gammoned . Re-enter John Flitch Horatio , Adolphus Horatio ( advancing under the old man 's nose , impudently . ) I say , old fellow , who the devil are you ? John F. , John Flitch ( in a passion , leveling his cane . ) You fool and stupid villain , I 'll teach you respect for age . Horatio , Adolphus Horatio ( tremulous . ) Do n't , old fellow , if you assassinate , there will be an end to your teaching . John F. John Flitch You tailor 's walking advertisement  --  you despicable madcap and dressed up ass , I 'll teach you first , then let you go to the devil ! ( Leveling the cane . ) Horatio . Adolphus Horatio Do n't , old fellow . ( Bridling . ) I say , old fellow , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nobleman  --  and that I will not be insulted , damn me if I will ! I will have satisfaction  --  I will perforate your skull , old fellow . John F. John Flitch You villain ! ( Levels his cane . ) Horatio , Adolphus Horatio ( retreating . ) Now do n't , old fellow ; I will have satisfaction . Exit , pursued by the old man . John F. John Flitch A Count , indeed ! better fit for a lunatic asylum . A Count ! He exhibits his despicableness ; he has been left by his ancestors what he could never have earned . We recognize none but nature 's noblemen . A fair fame and honorable merits make the man , and not worm-eaten parchments and tailors ' gear ! Albert . Albert Old gentleman , you have insulted my friend  --  what do you mean ? John F. John Flitch I have uttered my meaning . Albert . Albert You have insulted my friend ! John F. , John Flitch ( shrugging his shoulders . ) A worthy pair . Albert . Albert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Flitch Hark ye , sir , you appear to have some grains of sense yet ; let me warn you in time  --  take my advice  --  abandon the acquaintanceship of that brainless fop ; know that you disgrace yourself in being a companion to that pampered simpleton . Albert . Albert You are impertinent , sir ; you have no right to counsel ; we are a free people ; but you have insulted me and my friend  --  you will hear from us . Exit in high dudgeon . John F. , John Flitch ( fervently . ) Oh ! the wickedness of the world , that we are to be insulted by such apes of men of the world ! The world is so wilful and independent that no one will bear a reproof , even when given by an old man . The world is progressing , but it is with giant 's strides along to ruin ; the world 's overwise in many respects  --  a boy is scarcely fifteen now when he must play the man , and be a sovereign master of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to degeneration ; the parental authority is set at naught  --  experience and old age is slighted and disregarded . Boys now , instead of being active and industrious , they waste their time , their precious time , in lounging , in dissipating , in indulging in vicious propensities . What a sad picture , indeed ! the flower of the country , the pride of the nation , the inheritors of our free and glorious institutions so degraded and effeminate  --  contaminated with idleness and dissipation ! Oh , my country ! I wish thee prosperity and greatness , but wilt thou be on the road to fortune in a few generations hence , with such elements ? ( Leans heavily , sorrowing . ) Enter Mr. Tarlatine and Rosaline . Mr. Tarlatine , Mr. Tarlatine ( to Rosaline . ) Here is an old man in distress : daughter , let us see to him . ( They adrance . ) Rosaline , Rosaline ( recognizing the old man . ) Mr. Flitch ! Mr. Tarlatine . Mr. Tarlatine Mr. Flitch , my dear sir . John F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do , Mr. Tarlatine ? Rosaline , I am happy to see you . Mr. Tarlatine . Mr. Tarlatine We are happy at this meeting , my dear sir , but why were you so distressed ? Rosaline . Rosaline What has happened to distress you , Mr. Flitch ? John F. John Flitch Thanks , my friends , for your generous and kind interest ; the fact is , I met two impudent fops , and I have been insulted , I scarcely know why , but the reflection is painful . Rosaline . Rosaline How naughty , Mr. Flitch . Mr. Tarlatine . Mr. Tarlatine Your Americans have no manners  --  a set of bears . This far-boasted liberty , which they seize without reason and discretion , makes them haughty , arrogant and impudent ; I regret that you have been a victim , sincerely . Rosaline . Rosaline I pity you , indeed , Mr. Flitch ; your countrymen have no manners  --  they are so rude and vulgar , it is positively distracting . John F. , John Flitch ( staring fixedly . ) Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am an American ? Rosaline . Rosaline Certainly , Mr. Flitch . Mr. Tarlatine . Mr. Tarlatine To be sure , my dear sir . John F. John Flitch And you are my friends , too . Well , now , my friends , is it consistent with your avowed friendship to express yourselves in those terms ? You knew that I was distressed , and you paid no regard to my feelings , which you wounded more , in heaping fuel on the fire . It is acknowledged that you have a keen sense of national worth and supremacy , that sense should give you an insight into human nature ; others have it as well , for human nature is the same everywhere ; but you spoke from an old grudge , with vindictiveness , in abusing your adopted country . I say it without bitterness , Mr. Tarlatine , but I do assert , that our freedom and liberty is not an empty and boasted pageant , it is real and substantial , and we reap the fruits and blessings every day . American liberty has long passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boasted thing  --  it has taken a firm and unconquerable footing  --  it will spread all over the world , and our eagle will cover the people with its wings in happiness and independence ; tyrants of the old world may well tremble  --  the rotten fabric of their thrones of despotism will tumble , and freedom and liberty will govern with justice , equality and principle . Mr. Tarlatine . Mr. Tarlatine I meant no offence , my dear sir , I do assure you . Rosaline . Rosaline We meant no offence , Mr. Flitch , and I and pa were not aware that the subject would be so painful . John F. John Flitch Neither was I , my friends ; overlook my warmth  --  I love my country with heart and soul , and I am a soldier in the field in its defence . Rosaline . Rosaline We will be delighted with your company , Mr. Flitch ; do us the pleasure to walk with us . John F. John Flitch I accept your invitation , Rosaline  --  I will be of your company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adolphus Horatio The old scamp has absquatulated , but I 'll have satisfaction  --  I 'll not stand that a Count be insulted by a plebeian . Albert . Albert And I 'll play the mediator , if necessary . Horatio . Adolphus Horatio And gammon the old scamp . He never did like me  --  no. never , ' pon my honor . Albert . Albert But he 'll like me  --  I 'll soft-soap him . Horatio . Adolphus Horatio Bravo , my dear fellow ! ( Looking . ) An old man and two angels on his arms come ; let us walk - la- fashion . ( They walk from right to left , arm in arm . ) Enter Colonel Diamond , Celestina and Claranda , arm in arm , and walk parallel to Albert and Horatio . Colonel . Colonel Diamond Well , girls , the air is killing , is it not ? the sea breeze cuts the face like grape-shots of small calibre . Horatio . Adolphus Horatio The American belles are magnificent creatures . Celestina . Celestina Did you hear the gentleman , sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Claranda Flattering , if sincere , sister . Horatio . Adolphus Horatio They are so noble and queenly in grace and beauty . ( Walks off . ) Celestina . Celestina He must be some foreign Count ; how sublime and eloquent he is . Colonel . Colonel Diamond Some foreign mushroom ! Come , girls , we will march our way home . Exeunt . ACT II . Scene I.  --  Parlor of Peter Legrand . Mrs. Legrand , negligently seated on a sofa , with a lap-dog seated on her lap . Peter Legrand , Esq. , and Miranda sitting by a table . Parlor furnished in gorgeous style . Mrs. Legrand , Mrs. Legrand ( fondling the lap-dog ; aside . ) How sweet and delicious is repose on a soft and voluptuous couch , amid the grandeur and elegancies of fashion  --  in the lap of fortune  --  in the bosom of all earthly splendors . Oh ! ' t is delicious to be away from the canaille , in the elysium of the beau monde . ( Aloud . ) By-the-by , husband , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legrand He has arrived in the steamer  --  he can not tarry long . Miranda , Miranda ( starting ; aside . ) Charles arrived ! Oh , joy and bliss ! Mrs. Legrand . Mrs. Legrand Miranda , my dear , do n't start ; do n't be at all anxious about Charles  --  you are not displeased at his return , I hope ? Miranda , Miranda ( with animation . ) Oh , no , aunt  --  I am delighted ! Mrs. Legrand , Mrs. Legrand ( aside . ) I thought so , but the silly girl will not be her own mistress ; young girls have no experience , they are blind to their interests , they will madly go to ruin rather than follow wisely the road to fortune , but I 'll keep a watchful eye . ( Aloud . ) Miranda , my dear , will you not retire and dress for dinner ? Miranda . Miranda Not yet , aunt , I will welcome cousin Charles on his return  --  he will be here presently ; will he not , uncle ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you may stay to receive your cousin  --  I remained at home to welcome Charles . Miranda . Miranda Thanks , uncle , I am delighted ! Mrs. Legrand , Mrs. Legrand ( aside . ) The girl is stubborn and perverse ; well , well , we 'll see . ( Aloud . ) Miranda , my dear , I have forgotten my handkerchief in my dressing-room , do go for it . Miranda . Miranda I will ring for Catharine , aunt . Mrs. Legrand , Mrs. Legrand ( aside . ) Foiled again ! one is not mistress in her own house , now . ( Aloud . ) Miranda , do n't take the trouble to ring ; but you might do me that slight service . Miranda . Miranda Well , aunt , I will . ( Rises to go . ) Enter Charles Legrand . Miranda , Miranda ( running to him . ) Charles  --  cousin  --  I am delighted at your return !

Peter . L. Peter Legrand I hope , Charles , that you have picked up something in your travels ? Mrs. Legrand . Mrs. Legrand And , Charles , that you have dropped your plebeian manners , having seen the aristocracy of the Continent . But Miranda , my dear , your errand . Miranda . Miranda I go , aunt . Exit .

Peter Legrand I know that it requires a wise man to make a good fool , but your fools are mere apes . It appears , Charles , that it was the height of your mother 's ambition that you should mimic some outlandish fools , but my object was that you should have acquired valuable knowledge , that would have been useful to you ; precious time should never be wasted in foolery and dissipation  --  and the road to fortune lies not in quoting vapid and high-flown phrases , and indulging in the cup ; you will find it so , Charles , perhaps too late .

Mrs. Legrand Mrs. Legrand There , husband , you are not overwise , perspiration is not over genteel  --  you should always be cool  --  never do any thing in a hurry . Peter L. Peter Legrand It could be no wonder if I were ruined by your follies ; you made Charles go on the Continent to pick up foreign airs , manners and vices , when he should have been at the counting-house , a useful and considerate man , as his father desires him to be .

Catharine , Catharine ( taking the dog . ) Poor thing , it is hurt , I will nurse it . ( Seeing Charles . ) So , here is Mister Charles ! How do you do , sir , ( curtseying . ) Charles . Charles Legrand Very well , Catharine . Exit Catharine . Mrs. Legrand . Mrs. Legrand A Count  --  not a man , husband  --  a Lord ! Peter L. Peter Legrand Not a man but a fool , I dare say .

Charles , there you have made a fool of yourself  --  you had no business with Counts or extra refined villains . Mrs. Legrand . Mrs. Legrand How ridiculous you are , husband ; why , it will be an honor to receive the Count ; he will be the lion of fashion . Peter L. Peter Legrand A plague on fashion ! Fashion will drag me to ruin and despair , at this rate , shortly . Your Count will be a lion , and you , silly fools , will worship him  --  it is the fashion ! Slaves ! Mrs. Legrand .

He must be rich , too  --  but Charles must not marry Miranda ; I am fearful that the girl loves him , but I 'll try to please every one . Peter L. Peter Legrand Charles , follow me to my room . Mrs. Legrand . Mrs. Legrand Why , husband , do n't be in a hurry , Charles has just arrived . Peter L. Peter Legrand But what is he doing here ? besides , I have business to attend to . Mrs. Legrand . Mrs. Legrand Attend to it , then , husband  --  you will speak to Charles on the morrow . Peter L. , Peter Legrand ( aside . ) A plague on fashion !

John F. John Flitch Those sentiments honor you , Eugenia ; industry is the best criterion of the value and usefulness of persons in all stages of life . Labor is far from being degrading  --  it is ennobling ; but depending on the gains of the morrow must be severe and uninviting circumstances ; but still the asperities may be softened by bearing the adverse fortune with resignation and cheerfulness .

You have taken the right course , young man , to gain wealth and a fair fame ; an honest and active life must lead on the road to fortune . Examples are plenty and tempting to withdraw the young from that sphere , to idle and dissipate ; but the sequel may be anticipated  --  after a short time of idleness and dissipation , want will overtake them , and a career of crime will be before them , which many will be apt to adopt , thus blackening an already worthless character .

Albert Do not traduce yourself , Claranda , for I am fully persuaded that where dwells candor , duplicity knocks at the door in vain . Claranda . Claranda You close every aperture admirably well , sir ; if I mistake not , your visit was intended for Miss Miranda . Albert .

Albert . Albert I would place my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest transports , if she would permit it . Claranda . Claranda Does she not permit it , sir ? Albert . Albert It would be supreme happiness to possess a gentle , amiable being , endowed with candor and innocence . Such an amiable being possesses the best dowry , beyond the world 's rapacity , out of the reach of mercenary intrigues , and of nature 's gift . A man could but be happy with such a being , enjoying the most serene happiness , in the bosom of a pure heart and sincere affections . If I mistake not , such an one  --  Claranda . Claranda May exist ; but why should you expose your beloved to the public 's gaze ? Albert . Albert But , Claranda , will you permit me ? Claranda .

What is love , indeed , that it makes us feel and act with pleasure and reluctance , eagerness and despotism ? A strange infatuation , that makes us passionate and hesitating , that moves us to interest and tenderness ; and then , to rend , dispel the charm ! I do not feel indifferent to Adolphus Horatio ; I feel that I love him , and the confidence that would have made me so happy , I have refrained  --  I have arrested the avowal that would have made my heart bound with joy .

Dreadful ! and I am past twenty ! Horrible ! Shameful ! Did I say past twenty ? No , I will remain at eighteen ; I have not the least ambition to ascend the ladder of age ; but that frightful age ! and not a beau , not a husband ! and I am getting to be an old maid ! Horrible !

John Flitch He was met in Paris by the son of our host , and by him he was introduced here . But I must tell you , Count , that your son bears a bad character in this city . Excuse my frankness , sir , I have cause to complain of his bad morals . Count . Count Vonspoker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bore also a bad character in Paris . You might perhaps not believe me , sir , but it is unfortunately true , that he has dishonored his name , his father 's name ; that he has forged letters of exchange . John F. John Flitch Is it possible ! He is a villain , indeed . Count . Count Vonspoker I was living quietly on my domain in Germany , my son was spending the season in Paris . I had no apprehension of any kind of misconduct on his part . I was very quiet about his absence , when one day I received several notes of exchange , negotiated by my son ; they were forgeries ! but like an indulgent parent , I paid them , not willing that my son should be arrested and branded a felon ! It was a cruel blow for a father , sir  --  the money was nothing , but that he had dishonored his name and acted so villainous a part , was horrible ! I arrived in Paris to reclaim him from his evil ways , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me of his departure ; and I learn with grief that he is yet a worthless fellow . John F. John Flitch I would not afflict you unnecessarily , sir , but the fact is that he has insulted me in a gross manner ; he has even dared , with a bars-faced impedence , to send me a challenge , without the slightest cause or provocation . Count . Count Vonspoker Alas ! the catalogue of his misdeeds is large ; but I am very sorry of the circumstance , sir ; do forget it , for my sake . John F. John Flitch I do , sir , I am pretty near in your predicament , sir . I had been absent from this city for several years ; and on my return I found my nephew an idle , dissipated , and abandoned fellow , dressed like a lord , although penniless , having squandered his money in vice and follies , rather than have been industrious and earned a fortune and a fair fame . The age is demoralised , sir  --  examples are numberless and pernicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissipate , abandoning all idea of usefulness to themselves and society ; that state of things is greatly to be deplored , sir , and we can deplore it on our account . I am furious at the conduct of my nephew , Count . I have received bills without number from all kinds of tradespeople , even for suppers and champaign . I do n't know if these debts have been contracted before my return ; if after , my rascally nephew has been playing the hypocrite ; he merits that I should disown him after this . Count . Count Vonspoker Do not do so , sir ; I am willing to forgive my son , and he is more culpable than your nephew . John F. John Flitch I have been told by my nephew that he had been debauched into a gambling house by your son ; the son of our host was also seduced there . Count .

Appearances have been kept up , indeed , and extravagance and folly have had unrestrained sway , to blast and destroy every thing , whilst a proper and judicious economy would have assisted me in my business  --  would have kept my credit unimpaired. and my standing in the commercial world . Who would place confidence in a man that has a wife that gives extravagant parties and balls , and makes his house a caravansary for the idle and dissipated  --  courting foreign adventurers , and feasting every one ? Absurd ! that man must break , or become dishonest  --  his guests must be his ruin ! Fashion , indeed ! the wife of a man on the verge of bankruptcy could not forfeit her word ; the ball had to take place although it would be my ruin and Mrs. Legrand 's death !

John Flitch Well , my friends , I believe that our task is done for the present ; yes . Colonel . Colonel Diamond Stop ! must astound the Continent with my presence  --  an American lord a greater sovereign than a king  --  Colonel of militia an armed phenomenon  --  Columbia 's son the stupendous luminary of the old world ! John F. John Flitch All anon . Well , my friends , we have all gained experience , and thereby wisdom , I hope , or at least sufficient knowledge not to fall in the same errors again . Well , my friends , you know that there are many ways to thrive in the world , but in this world of ours there are only two roads to thrive in , for our spirit , energy and enterprise make us go onward like a streak of lightning ! we would explode rather than stop at half way : like a locomotive , we must go onward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumbling in the ditch ; we go into every thing with a perfect rush , like our glorious sires of the revolution ; liberty or death ! we reckon to lose our whole capital , if we fail to make a princely fortune , and adversity makes us more buoyant and enterprising . Well , my friends , we are no phlegmatic Dutchmen , who will be content to sip a pot of ale and smoke a pipe in the same corner for fifty years ; no , we are bound onward , to conquer and make fortunes ; therefore , we have but two roads wherein to guide our footsteps , and they are the road to ruin and the road to fortune . Colonel . Colonel Diamond And the road to fame and glory , via militia chieftainship . John F. John Flitch It is included in the two . Colonel . Colonel Diamond It stands foremost  --  all clear the track for the militia Colonel  --  kings and queens will bend the knee to the militia chieftain and Columbia 's pride . John F. John Flitch There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim at the same thing by pursuing diametrically opposite ways . Let me exemplify this : We have found Joseph and Eugenia poor , but contented , honest and industrious , useful and good members of society ; their praiseworthy exertions were rewarded , fortune smiled on them in India , and a golden sunbeam alighted on them here ; the bearers were the interesting East Indians , Tanjore and Adoris . Adoris . Adoris We are most happy that our journey terminated so fortunately for our cousins ; we were only dispensators of the radiant smiles of fortune . Eugenia . Eugenia Many thanks , cousins  --  and to you , my dear sir ; our youthful dreams are realized ; we have gained a golden prize , and what is to me an inestimable treasure  --  a good and worthy husband . Joseph . Joseph Sniffle And I the best of treasures  --  Eugenia . John F. John Flitch Worth and virtue will always be rewarded ; honesty and industry will lead to the road to fortune ; but the young seem inclined to idle , lounge , sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and money  --  they call this fashion  --  but in so doing they advance with strides to a deep abyss , and they are on the road to ruin . Instead of clasping their lady-loves in their arms , Albert and Horatio , by their villainous conduct , would have been immured in the state 's prison ; they were saved the disgrace by fond and indulgent relatives . Count . Count Vonspoker Albert may thank the beauty that supplicated in his behalf  --  but still it is a parent 's duty to forgive the errors of youth , and now married to Claranda , he must make her happy as a daughter of mine . Claranda . Claranda Thanks , father ; I am sure that Albert will be worthy of you and me . Albert . Albert It will be my sole and ardent pursuit , Claranda . John F. John Flitch I have no doubt of it , my young friends . Our friend , the Colonel , it has appeared , sought to obtain a high national standing , but using unfair means to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Colonel . Colonel Diamond The Americans wide awake  --  a generous and jealous people  --  free and independent , but not as munificent as the militia  --  put on the shelf their devoted servant , but still the greatest , most valorous and generous people in the world ! a call of the President  --  universal sympathy  --  a bigger man yet  --  sent minister to the Tuileries . John F. John Flitch Fashion made Legrand a bankrupt , and the extravagance and folly of the wife a beggar of the husband . The road leading to fortune is not the most brilliant and showy one , but honesty and industry are good guides to it . My friends , I should like to see you all active , useful , and good members of society , engaged in some honest pursuit of industry ; there lies happiness , and in following an upright and industrious course of life , you will be on the road to fortune . Well , my friends , before bidding you adieu , I earnestly beg that you will follow that course , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and happiness . My friends , you have my best wishes  --  adieu ! Remember , I beg of you , the advice of an old man , and  --  THE ROAD TO FORTUNE !
