txt THE history of Ireland , chequered with eventful periods , and full to overflowing with stirring incident , offers nothing to the reflective mind so pregnant with interest as her present situation . There is a tide in the affairs of nations as in those of men . The political waters of the country in question have long had their rise and fall , - tumultuous and agitated in all times ; but certain indications now proclaim the coining crisis , in which the tide must reach the full . It is by no means our purpose to dive into this troubled sea , and drag up historic treasures , or to trust ourselves on its waves , in an adventurous search after undiscovered truths . To trace analogies between the past and the present , and from them to prophesy what is to be , is , if not altogether futile , at least a task out of our design . We hear O'Connell shouting forth " Justice to Ireland ! " We see Father Matthew pointing out temperance to Irishmen . We know that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been intemperate , the inevitable consequence of absolute ignorance , - which is , in its turn , the heaviest curse that a government can negatively inflict upon a nation . But can we , from these premises , venture to predict the consequences of the past oppressions , or the present outcry for redress ? The wisest statesmen of the old world confess themselves at fault on this momentous subject . That " something must be done with Ireland , or for Ireland , " is now more than the common-place cant of a dominant party in the state , ready to heap some new infliction on the country , or of a hungry opposition , willing to turn her hitter sufferings to political account . To solve the perilous problem , and say what the " something " is , we shall not , as we have already indicated , attempt . iNeither can any English faction , Tory , Whig , or Radical , now dare to do it . The great question has become a grand experiment , and it has fallen into proper hands at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfulfilled destiny , as a portion of European civilization , is to // 188 July , be completed only on her own soil , by her own sons . England has never had the virtue , and never probably could have the wisdom , to accomplish it . This incapacity is not , however , a lot peculiar to England . No nation has ever yet done perfect justice to another . No spontaneous spring of magnanimity has ever thrown wide the portals to a conquered and imprisoned people . A section of a population may be joined with its victors , under a promise of equal rights and a semblance of amalgamation , as was often effected by ancient Rome . A class may be emancipated ; a part may be freed from local restraints ; modern England furnishes examples . But no wholesale manumission has ever taken place from nation to nation ; and England is probably the last of all to make such an original and glorious bound on the career of greatness . In saying this , we do not mean to put a brand on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tyranny on their character . XXTe only specify , after all , a peculiarity of race , when we say that England has , of all nations as yet , most broadly developed the instinct of territorial ambition . It is no new position of ours ; and the Anglo-Saxon blood will everywhere rise up to admit it , with a glow of pride rather than a blush of shame . From the earliest of her wars with France down to the present time , England has been too narrow for the English . The possession of Gascony , wrenched from her after a fearful struggle ; the invasion of Ireland , where she has from the first kept firm hold ; the seizure of the American continent and islands , where she has still a footing , slippery it is true , but undisputed ; the overrunning of India ; the acquisition of Gibraltar , of the Cape of Good Hope , Malta , the lonian isles , and the colonization of Australia , are points enough on which to rest . We say nothing of expeditions now on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor of imputed designs on California . The brief enumeration already made sufficiently establishes , that the pride of colonial conquest is the absorbing " appetite , which grows by what it feeds on , " in the English mind ; a passion without bounds ; the sustaining excitement of the most wonderful nation the world has ever seen . Is it , then , to be for a moment imagined , that England will voluntarily concede to Ireland the " justice , " which , let O'Connell say or think what he may , means nothing less than the dismemberment of the British Empire ? The standard of // Repeal is at length fairly and openly hoisted , and nothing can now satisfy the vast majority of the Irish people , but a dissolution of that union , which was always repugnant to their feelings , galling to their pride , and which England has never attenpted to carry out in the true spirit of union . Ireland has been tied to England , not attached . The great object of her wishes is a divorce , let that object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague and visionary " justice , " for which she calls , and which , if once granted , we are told , would immediately silence the cry for repeal . But this " justice " is nothing more , than an untangible rallying-cry of war , - not a positive and specific banner , under which men might assemble and fight . The great principles of law and government , presumed to he invoked , form a mass of complicated difficulties in the present state of Ireland , which defies unravelling . Let England now do what she may , let her concede the whole list of grants , which the Irish people ask , and which their celebrated leader implores for , in the attitude and tone of a bold beggar , his hat in the middle of the road , and his weapon in its rest on the side-path , - nothing will satisfy six-sevenths of the people of Ireland hut a Repeal of the Union . What ulterior hope may lurk behind , in the minds of the enthusiastic or the far-seeing , it is not for us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might belie . But it is quite clear , that England must view the Repeal of the Union only as the first step towards the independence of Ireland . And can it be believed , that she will ever consent to that premier pas , which must be paid for at so ruinous a price ? O'Connell , in his last address , - a most important document , - pretends , or perhaps believes , that England will at once accede to the demand for repeal , now put forward in so formidable a shape . The sanguine people he addresses may join in and reiterate the opinion . But we pronounce it a mere fallacy ; not because we doubt O'Connell and his associates , either individually or in the mass , but because we know the English character . When did England ever concede so great a boon , or any great boon , of herself , and in good time ? Let her domestic history answer the question . Let American independence and Catholic emancipation stand forth in relief , as evidence all-sufficient . When necessity forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yielded greatly . There is no half-opening of the hitherto closed // hand , no faltering , no fear of misrepresentation , no care for the opinion of others , no doubt of her own judgment . The peace of 1783 , with the United States , the pacification of Europe , in 1814 , the Catholic Relief Bill , in 1829 , the Reform Bill , in 1830 , are a few out of many splendid monuments of national power and of the largest political sagacity . Whenever other nations or her own subjects act , for their own interest , with courage and industry , England has always shown , in the long run , her appreciation of those two main qualities in her own character . Sympathy with them will obtain fully , what justice or policy may fail to obtain at all . England , above all nations , knows how to yield with dignity , and to give with grandeur . We are not blind to her faults hut we glory in her virtues . And we are sure , that , if Ireland can put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spirit worthy of British admiration and esteem , those claims will , sooner or later , force their concession from the magnanimous spirit , which is enshrined in a tabernacle of pride and ambition . But , to expect that Great Britain will lop off the right arm of her power , fling away the best weapon of her armoury , and lay herself open to the assaults of an envious world , is to expect a suicidal infatuation , of which she has as yet shown no symptoms . Ireland must , we think , soon open her eyes to this . England will , we believe , soon take Ireland closer to her embrace . The Union , of which it is chimerical to anticipate the quiet repeal , must , undoubtedly , he fairly and fully consummated , if Great Britain would preserve her political existence , and strengthen its foundation . The greatest good , that England could grant to Ireland , modifying , if not altogether neutralizing a mass of misrule , was the advantage of her example . Trhe national union for all national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling in the common cause ; this , - the great secret of a people 's power , of which our own national motto , E pluribus unum , is the condensed expression , - England has been involuntarily teaching to Ireland for centuries ; and Ireland has at last got the lesson by heart . She has heen long reading in the volumes of experience , and not without results . Her past efforts for relief were mere preparatory steps for the race she is now entering on . Her training has heen complete . Her furtive glances at freedom have taught her to // bear the blaze of liberty . Every one of the wild and bloody trials , which she has made in the practice-field , has prepared her to enter the lists , for serious action , with reflective steadiness and concentrated force . Casting hack our looks upon Ireland as she was in 1782 , when Grattan raised the whole country , by the impassioned logic of his eloquence , into an attitude of independence , again at the formation of the Society of United Irishmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outburst of rebellion in 1798 , we can trace , step by step , the great gradations by which the country , in her own despite and unknown to herself , was reaching that measure of Legislative Union , by which she was , in 1800 , entirely engulfed . The patriotic declarations of these various epochs bear to each other , and to those of the present time , a complete similarity of tone and sentiment . They are , in fact , but links in the same chain of public wants and wishes ; the utterance of the same hopes , by different generations of men , for the common object of nationality . This might be supposed to suggest , by implication , the failure of all the present aspirations . But the previous popular movements , leading for a while to partial success , and followed at last by total thraldom , have no direct analogy with the agitation of to-day . Different sections of the same race have been and are struggling for the same purpose , the accomplishment of their political and social civilization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the times and the habits of the people . When Grattan , in 1782 , aroused an ardent population to arm for a loyal insurrection , and forced from the British Parliament a repeal of its own unconstitutional claim to bind Ireland by its statutes , more than four-fifths of that population were in the depths of political degradation , and the whole in a state of national debauchery and still untamed ferocity . England soon found means to cajole and disarm the volunteers , and , by goading the Catholics into premature and hopeless rebellion , turned the very weapons of the Patriot Protestants into instruments for crushing the people , and thus preparing the Parliament for the corruption , under the effects of which the Union was finally consun ) mated . When Wolfe Tone founded the Society of United Irishmen , the whole country was disjointed ; antipathies were rife ; and all the eloquent appeals of that // immortal combination of patriotism and talent were but so many acts of alliance with the policy of England , carried out by its Irish creatures , for that catastrophe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foot , at the mercy of its exasperated conqueror . The Union , the basest of all political crimes , - the partition of Poland was the boldest , - was carried ; Irish independence was trampled in the dust ; and England gained a vile triumph at a purchase far dearer than the proudest victory was worth . The Union , so effected , and followed up with vindictive energy , has been , hitherto , a total failure for all the . nohler purposes of national amalgamation . English ministers have borne down the rhetoric of Irish members in Parliament , by the weight of figures and of calculation , to show , that the Union has proved to Ireland a blessing , which Pitt , in his pamphlet , in 1799 , and Clare arid Castlereagh , in their speeches at the same epoch , promised that it sl ) ould become . But it is not by arithmetic , that popular sentiment can be smothered . The Union has proved a fiction . To make it a reality , the whole system of government , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . iMen are always found to work out the destinies of nations . The necessity of a case is sure to generate the instruments for its completion . The ministers , who have governed Ireland for the last few years , have been sensible of the duties of their mission , have labored to surmount its difficulties , and have prepared the country to cooperate in its own salvation . They bave sagaciously discovered , honestly admitted , and boldly resolved to extirpate , the evils which previous adrninistrations either saw not , denied , or cherished . Under their protection a noble self-confidence has sprung up among the Irish people , more effective , for purposes of good , than all the efforts of demagogues and the deceptions of factions can be for mischief . Proud in their recovered rights , the millions of Ireland were ripe for political and moral regeneration . Two powerful apostles have appeared among them , of characters wholly dissimilar , but with objects the same , and acting simultaneously with an influence unexampled and almost incredible . The double action of " peaceful agitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Mathew ; the decrease of crime ; the rapid spread of temperance ; fighting out of fashion and whisky out of favor ; the // distilleries closed for want of customers , and the jails left open for want of criminals , - all this presents a spectacle , sublime to the philanthropist , but appalling to the desperate faction , which has long trafficked in political rights , and made a mockery of moral worth . Those , who would hold the Irish people down in ignorance and debauchery , may well tremble at the work now going on . Those , who take pride in the advancement of the human race , who , though doubting the possibility of perfection , rejoice at improvement , must turn towards Ireland , - as we confess ourselves to do , - with sentiments of great admiration and with much solicittide . At this distance from the scene of pacific action , but deeply interested in the result , we will not presume to speculate further on what is going forward . When we took up this subject , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than these rapid remarks have done . We had piled on our table a heap of authorities . We proposed a treatise , and have only thrown off a sketch . In fact , the matter was at once important and pressing . Finding that we could not , from various causes , at present do justice to it in a lengthened essay , but anxious to call the attention of our readers , at home , to the mighty movement abroad , which must influence , in its results , a large portion of the population of this country , we have thus hastily put together a few of the thick-crowding thoughts , which the subject so abundantly supplies ; and we shall give some extracts from the latest and the best work , illustrative of the true state of Ireland . 2tyT* have closed , in despair of turning them to immediate account , many a tome , replete with matter of deep interest , besides some full of repulsive and wearisome details . rphe accounts of rebellions and massacres , from that of Sir John Temple , Knight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baronet , 1798 , made us " sup full with horrors . " The duodecimo History of Tom Moore , made us wonder , how one , who has sung so lightly and poetically of Ireland , could write about it with a ponderous pedantry , more fatiguing than the heavy folios of Plowden , or the pompous phraseology of Sir Jonah Barrington . Mr. Inglis 's rambling tour is amusing , and , in some minor details , instructive ; and Lady Chatterton 's " Sketches " are delightful specimens of good taste and good feeling , from the pen of a most accomplished gen // tiewoman . We might enumerate several other works , into which we have conscientiously looked , and with extracts from which we intended to enrich the present paper . But we must acknowledge , that , among all the writers , who have lately made Ireland the theme of their observations , none appears to have entered into the subject with so thorough a spirit of philosophical inquiry as the French traveller , whose work stands first on our list . M. de Beaumont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale of " Marie , " and as one of the authors of a hook on the American Penitentiary System . Romance and statistics are somewhat incongruous materials in the formation of a literary reputation . We are not now about to separate or examine the claims of Ni . do Beaumont on either score ; hut we c*p safely recommend the work before us , as containing comprehensive views of the social and political state of ireland , and as worthy of being quoted largely from , or , what is better , thoroughly studied , by those who wish for sound information on the affairs and the feelings of that country at the present extraordinary crisis . We might safely make our extracts at random , and not go astray . There is considerable perspicuity , and absence of prejudice , and an almost intuitive knowledge of national character , in those French writers of the modern school , Tocqueville , Chevalier , Beaumont , and some few others , which put to utter shame the shallow and narrow-minded English tourists , who have made America and a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To mark the absurdity of those flimsy creatures , who set aside " a whole year , " as a sufficient period for acquiring a general knowledge of this great continent , and for forming , xvriting , and publishing their opinions on all the complicated and mysterious materials which go to make the national mind of sixteen millions of human beings , we give the concluding paragraph of M. de Beaumont 's Preface , on the comparatively small , compact , and easily to he understood country of his inquiries . " The reader will see , from the preceding remarks , the nature of the author 's undertaking , the difficulties he encountered , and the efforts he has made to attain his object . Whoever supposes , that he thinks he has overcome these obstacles , is mistaken ; his conscience bears him witness only , that he // has left no means untried to surmount them . After one journey in England and Ireland he undertook his work ; but , at the end of two years ' labor , he became satisfied that he still wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sources of information , he visited these two countries anew , and attempted to take notice of what had before escaped his attention , and modified his first researches by these new observations . His book is the fruit of four laborious years . In the course of this long work , though his strength oftea failed him , he never lost courage . Laboring at first in an incorrect manner , he has written volumes , which he has afterwards destroyed , and which have thus cost him much time and trouble , which is almost lost ; but , after his mistakes , he retraced his steps , and sought the right road , till , as he thought , he found it . Resolved to accomplish his undertaking , at whatever cost , he has devoted himself to it entirely , and has resolutely withheld himself from every engagement and interest which could withdraw him from it . In thus describing the labor which his book has cost him , the author undoubtedly exhibits his deficiencies the more strongly ; but he would rather be accused of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the importance of which he had perceived . " In conclusion , whatever may have been the extent of his exertions and the length of his labors , he will be fully recompensed for both , if , in the picture which follows , he has exhibited one political truth of benefit to mankind , one moral principle of utility to the world ; if , in painting the condition of those who oppress , and those who suffer , he has been able to strengthen , in some minds , love of liberty and hatred of tyranny . " - Tom . I. Preface , pp. xix. - xx . Half of the first volume is devoted to a rapid historical sketch , which contains some imperfections , and a few errors , rather personal than political , but of little moment , and not worth the trouble of correcting . The latter part of the volume bears the sad wording , at the head of each page , Misery of the Irish , " " Causes of the misery ; and the pages , so headed , contain matter enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sufferings of man , and the indignation of all rational human beings , against the atithors of so much wretchedness . Listen to our author . " We must reflect long on this succession of ages ; we must imagine the rich and the poor invariably following , during this time , two different ways , one leading to extreme wealth , the other to extreme misery ; we must consider the // natural and necessary effects of these two courses , the one of perpetual accumulation , the other of progressive ruin , each increasing the other , and gaining new strength in every one of its consequences ; we must , I say , meditate long on these causes , to understand the excess of luxury to which the Irish aristocracy has arrived , and the inveterate misery by which poor Ireland is covered . " The revenues of the rich , in Ireland , sometimes rise to amounts , the immensity of which appears to us almost impossible . The wealthy man makes a magnificent career in this miserable country ; he has splendid edifices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - all this ; and often he possesses all this in two or three different places . " While millions of unhappy beings are at a loss , every day , how to supply their most pressing wants , the rich man seeks for some means to renew some satiated passion in his breast , or some half extinct appetite in his body . If he wishes to move his person , overcome with weariness of itself from one place to another , he may choose among the most beautiful roads , which rival those of England . Thus do luxury and wealth move with all ease and ostentation across the sufferings and miseries of the land . " Such is the Ireland which the rich man makes for himself . To see happy Ireland , we must choose a point of view which takes in a narrow and isolated field , confining the eyes to neighbouring objects ; but wretched Ireland , on the contrary , is open to the sight everywhere . Naked , famished misery , a vagabond and worthless misery , a mendicant misery , covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all forms , at all times ; you perceive it first in landing on the shores of Ireland ; and , from that moment it appears before you , sometimes under the appearance of the sick man who displays his wounds , sometimes under that of the pauper dressed in rags ; it follows you everywhere ; it surrounds you without ceasing ; you perceive its groans and tears from far ; and , if its voice does not move you with profound pity , it importunes and alarms you . This misery appears natural to the soil , and like one of its products ; like those endemic plagues which pollue the atmosphere , it pollutes every thing which approaches it , and touches the rich man himself who can not , in the midst of his joys , separate himself from the miseries of the poor , and makes vain efforts to shake off the vermin which he has created , and which attaches itself to him . " * * * * // Represent to yourself four walls of dry mud , which the rain , in falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubble for roof , or some squares of turf ; a hole rudely broken in the roof for a chimney , and , more frequently , the very door of the house , by which alone can the smoke escape ; one apartment , containing father , mother , grandfather , and children ; no furniture in this poor hovel ; one bed , made usually of grass and straw , serving for the whole family . You see , crowded in the fire-place , five or six half-naked children , before a scanty fire , the ashes of which cover some potatoes , the only nourishment of the whole family ; in the midst of the whole lies a dirty pig , the only inhabitant of the place who fares well , because he lives in filth . The J ) resence of the pig , in the Irish houses , seems , else*vhere , a sign of misery ; it is , however , a token of some comfort , and there is specially extreme poverty in the cabin where none dwells . " Not far from the cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half , in size ; it is sowed with potatoes ; rows of stones , heaped on each other , and bushes , crossing among these , form the inclosure . This dwelling is very miserable ; nevertheless , it is not that of the poor man , properly so called . This is the description of the Irish farmer and of the agricultural laborer . I have said , that there are no small proprietors below the great ones , and none but poor below the wealthy ; but these are miserable in different degrees , and with gradations which I could wish to show . All , being poor , use only the cheapest nourishment in the country , potatoes ; but all do not consume the same quantity ; some , and these are the privileged class , eat three times a day ; others , less fortunate , twice ; some , in a state of indigence , only once ; and there are those , who , more destitute still , pass one whole day , sometimes two , without taking any food . This life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted to , under fear of greater evil . He who eats more than he can afford , and fasts once less than he ought , is sure to have nothing with which to clothe himself ; and yet this prudence , this resignation to suffering , are often unproductive . " Whatever may be the determination of the poor cultivator in bearing hunger , that he may face his other xvarits , he is in general naked , or covered with rags , transmitted in the family from generation to generation . *C In many of the poor houses there is only a complete suit for every two persons ; this obliges the priest of the parish // always to say mass on Sunday several times . When one has heard the first mass , he returns to the house , takes off his clothes and gives them to the other , who goes at once to attend the second mass . " I have seen the Indian amidst his forests , and the negro in chains , and have thought , while beholding their pitiable condition , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fate of the Irish . Like the Indian , the Irishman is poor and naked , but he lives in the midst of a people who seek for luxury , and honor riches . Like the Indian , he is deprived of the good which human industry and the commerce of nations provide ; but he sees some of his equals enjoy this good to which he can not aspire . In the midst of his greatest distress , the Indian preserves a certain dignified independence . However poor and hungry , he is still free in the desert , and the feeling which he has of this liberty alleviates his sufferings . rI*he Irishman feels the same deprivation , without having the same freedom ; he is subjected to rules and shackles of all kinds ; though governed by laws , he dies of hunger , a sad condition , uniting the vices of the civilized with those of the savage state . Undoubtedly an Irishman who has shaken off his chains , and who has faith in the future , is indeed less to be pitied than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freedom of the savage , nor the bread of slavery . " I shall not undertake to describe all the circumstances , all the shades , of Irish misery , from the condition of the poor farmer , who fasts that his children may live , to that of the cultivator , who , less miserable , though more degraded , resolves to beg ; from resigned poverty , which is silent in the midst of suffering , to that which rebels , and , from violence , goes on to crime . " Irish poverty has an entirely distinct character , which renders it difficult of description , because it can be compared to no other poverty . Irish misery has a distinct form , of which there is no model or imitation . We feel , in beholding it , that we can not theoretically assign any limit to the wretchedness of a people . " In all nations there are more or less poor ; but a whole people poor is what we never saw , till Ireland showed it to us . " To know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to relate its miseries and sufferings ; the history of Ireland is that of the poor . ' * * * * * * " Misery descends , in Ireland , to depths elsewhere unknown . The condition , which in Ireland is above poverty , would be elsewhere accounted a state of frightful distress ; and the // wretched classes among us , whose fate we justly deplore , would form in Ireland a privileged class . These miseries of the Irish population are not singular accidents ; almost all are permanent ; those which do not exist always are periodical . " Every year , at nearly the same point of time , there is announced in Ireland , the beginning of the famine , its progress , its ravages , its decline . " In February last ( 1838 ) , the French press registered the annual cry of Irish misery , and gave the number of those who , in one month , died of hunger . Either through selfishness or humanity , many choose to think that the accounts given of Irish poverty are exaggerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made use of to paint the anguish of Ireland , is only a metaphorical expression , signifying excessive distress , and not the proper term , to express the state of people actually famished and dying for want of food . " It is especially in England that people like to keep in this state of doubt , from which , however , it is easy to emerge . " In 1727 , about a hundred years since , the primate Boulter wrote concerning Iteland , where he was the chief agent of the English government ; " Since my arrival in this country ( in 1725 ) , famine has never ceased among the poor . So dear has grain been , that thousands have been obliged to quit their dwellings to seek a living elsewhere . Many hundreds have perished . ' When Bishop Doyle was asked , in 1832 , what was the state of the population in the west ; What it always has been , ' said he ; people are perishing as usual . ' " In 1817 , fevers caused by poverty and hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sixtyfive thousand of whom perished ; and it has been calculated , that , in 1826 , the badness of the food made twenty thousand sick . " In the grand inquiry , made in 1835 , by the English government , into the social state of Ireland , the following question was addressed by the commissioners to their correspondents in each parish " Do you know of any death , in the course of the last three years , of which urgent want was the cause " And the inquiry proves a multitude of deaths , which want of food alone had occasioned . Here are the unfortunate , whom hunter has manifestly killed ; there , the wretched , whose death it has hastened . The latter perished from long exhaustio n ; the former at once , from disease and hunger . It would be a pa1n* ful labor to make an abstract of this whole inquiry , which comprises ten folio volumes , some of which contain more than nine hundred pages ; in which every page , every line , every word , // shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland is not related . " The commissioners charged with this memorable inquiry estimate , that in Ireland there are nearly three million of individuals , who yearly sink into absolute destitution ; these three millions are not only poor , they are wretchedly poor . Besides these three millions of poor , there are still millions of unhappy creatures , who , as they do not die of hunger , are not counted . " The author of this book , to whom similar testimony would have undoubtedly appeared sufficient , wished , however , to see with his own eyes , what his reason hesitated to believe . Twice , in 1835 and 1837 , he has , while traversing Ireland , visited expressly the counties where famine has been accustomed to rage with the most violence , and he has verified the facts . Shall he relate here all that he has seen ? No . There are misfortunes which are so much beyond humanity , that human language can not describe them . And if he were obliged here to relate the scenes of mourning and desolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries of despair which he has heard ; if he were obliged to tell of the grief of the mother 's voice , when refusing to her hungry children a little bread ; and ig in the midst of this extreme wretchedness , he were obliged to paint the insulting opulence displayed to all eyes by the rich man ; the immensity of his domains , where man 's hand has created artificial lakes , valleys , and hills ; the magnificence of his palace , which is upheld by columns of the most beautiful marble of Greece or Italy , and which the gold of America , the silk of France , and the cloth of India , vie with one * plendid dwellirws destined for another in adorninr the s the servants ; the still more splendid abode of the horses ; all the wonders of art , all the inventions of industry , and all the fancies of vanity accumulated in this place , in which the master does not even deign to reside , and which he only visits at long intervals ; the sumptuous and indolent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the miseries of which he is the author , has never seen them , does not believe in them ; who derives , from the sweat of the poor , 500,000 francs as rent ; each of whose senseless or superfluous enjoyments represents the ruin or distress of some unhappy individual ; who gives every day to his dogs the meal of a hundred families , and causes to die of hunger those who furnish for him this life of luxury and pride ; - if the author were obliged here to recall the dismal impressions which the sight of such contrasts has caused him , and the terrible questions which such inconsistencies have raised up in his mind , he feels that the pen would fall from his hands , and that he would not have courage to finish the task that he wishes to accomplish . " - Tom. 1 . pp. 200-210. // After giving these frightful and too true pictures of Irish misery , M. de Beaumont devotes a chapter to an effort to trace the causes of what he so accurately paints and so feeliugly deplores . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of a mauvaise aristocratic , and who , that has had any experience of the sordid , selfish , anti-national nature of Irish landlords , xviii not add his testimony to what follows ? " We can not consider Ireland attentively , we can not study its history and its relations , observe its manners , and analyze its laws , without acknowledgin* that its misfortunes , to bring about which so many fatal accidents and circumstances have concurred , have had , and still have , a prime , radical , permanent cause , one which predominates over all others this cause is a bad aristocracy . " All aristocracies founded on conquest or inequality , comprise , undoubtedly , many vices ; but all do not contain the same , nor do they possess an equal number . " " The English aristocracy , able and national as it is , would have perhaps been powerless to maintain itself , if , at the same time that it covers its vices with splendid virtues , it had not been protected by fortunate accidents . " Subject , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its strength for a selfish interest , it has strained to excess the springs upon which it is supported , it has concentrated beyond measure in its hands the posscssion of the soil which has been monopolized by a small number ; and those , who in England are proprietors , form so small a minority , in comparison with those who are not , that property would perhaps be in danger there , if it were in the eyes of the people a desirable object . " But , by a propitious event , more than by the effect of a wise policy , the soil in England has never to this day excited the envy of the inferior classes ; the English people leaves to its aristocracy the monopoly of the land , because it has itself the monopoly of industry . The immense domains of the lord have no attractions to the citizen , to whom the commerce of the whole world offers an unlimited arena , and who thinks that if he makes for himself a great fortune , he shall acquire , perhaps , some day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his honors. **rrhe English agriculturist cares little for the political system , whose effect is to send from the fields to the towns the inhabitants of the country , when this agriculturist , at a distance from the soil , finds in a manufactory as regular labor , // and better wages . This , it must be acknowledged , is the greatest security of the English aristocracy ; a weak and failing security , which will only last as long as English industry shall supply the world with its productions . " The Irish aristocracy , full of vices from which the English aristocracy is exempt , far from being , like this , aided by favorable circumstances , struggles against fatal tendencies . Thus the situation of Ireland by the side of England , has proved fatal to the Irish aristocracy ; for this aristocracy has never ceased to be English in heart , and almost in interest for which reason it has always resided , and still resides , more in England than in Ireland ; and this material fact , which separates it so often from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice most fatal to every aristocracy , which can really exist only in the condition of those who govern . The evils of Ireland are often attributed to the non-residence of the aristocracy ; hut this is taking the consequence of the evil for the evil itself . The aristocracy of Ireland is not l ) ad , because it absents itself ; it absents itself because it is bad ; because nothing attaches it to its country , nothing retains it there . Why , loving neither the country nor the peoI ) le , should it stay in Ireland , when England is near , inviting and attracting it by the charms of a more civilized and elegant society , and has the merit of being the country of its origin " In general , all aristocracy carries in itself the curb which moderates , if it does not stop it in its sallies and its selfishness . it is generally the case , that those who do not love the people fear them , or at least have need of them , and therefore do from calculation what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppress too much , for fear of exciting to rebellion ; they manage the national force from which they derive advantage , and thus sometimes appear generous , when they are only skilful and interested . " The Irish aristocracy has always had the misfortune of neither fearing nor hoping any thing from the people placed under its yoke ; leaning upon England , whose soldiers have always been at its service , it has been able to indulge itself without reserve in its tyranny ; the groans , the complaints , the threats of the people have never lessened the oppression , because beneath the popular clamors there was nothing to be dreaded . Does a revolt break out in Ireland the aristocracy of the country does not move ; the English artillery is there , and thunders forth upon the rebels ; and , when all has returned to order , the aristocracy takes , as before , the revenue fromthe lands . // " The Irish aristocracy has exercised a power , of which there has been no other example in any country ; it has for six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has given to it half the advantages and spared it all the expense . Provided with rights , privileges , and constitutional guaranties , it has made use of all the instruments of liberty , to practise oppression . Ireland has thus been constantly the prey of two tyrants , the more formidable , that the one has protected the other . The Irish aristocracy , considering itself as the agent of England , likes in this way to absolve itself from its own excesses and personal injustice ; and England , whose rights this aristocracy has exercised , chooses to throw upon the latter the abuse of power . " " The Irish aristocracy has two vices , which include all others ; of English origin , they have never ceased to be English ; having become Protestants , they have had to govern a people who have always been Catholics . " These two vices contain the beginning of all the evils of Ireland ; here is found the key to all her misery , all her embarrassments . If we would examine attentively this point of departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural consequences , the extraordinary circumstances for which we may vainly seek a cause elsewhere . These consequences are of three kinds ; some of which are called civil , because they regard manners ; others political , because they concern institutions ; the last religious , because they spring from the di erence of worship . The first affect more particularly the relation of rich and poor , proprietor and farmer ; the second , the reciprocal relations of governor and governed ; and the third , the situation , in regard to each other , of Protestant and Catholic . " - Tom . I. pp. 210-220 . Our author , having thus traced the causes of Irish misery , proceeds , in the natural sequence of just reasoning , to point out what he conceives to be the remedies . The increase of manufacturing establishments , a poor law , and voluntary emigration , are those which he indicates as among the minor ones ; but to these he gives but a very qualified recommendation . Probing deep into the sources of the evil , he views these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no actual prospect of good , short of rneastires which amount to a total revolution in the state . The repeal of the Union he deems unlikely , if not impracticable . And his wholesale plan of reformation embraces the abolition of all aristocratical // privileges , the division of landed prol ) erty among small proprietors , - as in this country and in Fiance , - and the total severance of the connexion between church and state . These , it will he admitted , were hut Utopian plans , as long as Ireland was morally besotted , and while England was expected to carry them out . Even when NJ. de Beaumont wrote , the grand secret of redress and the great principle of power had not been discovered . O'Connell had produced , it is true , that extraordinary political organization which carried emancipation , and which is disciplining the people for all the active exigencies of reform . But TEMPERANcE , the mighty foundation on which every thing great and good is to be built in Ireland , was not until , as it were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed of , as liracticable to any extent beyond mere local and passing occasions , or as a concomitant branch of a rational , yet commonplace , code of morals . Now , it is known , felt , and sworn to , by millions of determined men , as the one master-key to all the most difficult problems of national regeneration . The inspiration has fallen on those millions through the agency of one man . And Father Mathew stands alone , on the very highest pedestal of virtuous fame , in a holier ordination than that xxhich l ) riested him ; not as a mere follower of Grattan , or coadjutor of O'Connell ; not as a rival of the majestic eloquence and dignified patriotism of the former , or of the fierce energy and fiery perseverance of the latter ; but as the equal , in influence , of each of those great men , and forming with them a triple combination , whose attributes are not unaptly figured out by the verdure , brightness , and equality of the three-leaved shamrock , Ireland 's national emblem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm to either of the members in this trinity of fame . Grattan awoke in the hearts of bondmuen the lo* e of liberty . O'Connell taught them how to become free . Mathew is making them worthy of freedom . Grattan armed eighty thousand citizens , and won Ireland 's commercial and parliamentary independence by physical force . O'Connell enfranchised hundreds of thousands by claims of constitutional right . Mathew disenthralls millions from the tyranny of selfdebasement by the power of moral suasion . C rattan acted on the passions , O'Connell on the judgment , ilathew on the consciences , of men ; each being admirably fitted to the times in which his efforts came into play , and to the state of social // feeling on which he was to act . Each has labored well in his vocation . The result of their combined missions , - the happiness of Ireland , - is about to he accomplished . What that may be in its ensemble , its details , its working out , will in a great measure depend on others . To them , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a chaos of political turbulence and social debasement , the first and the highest place must be assigned , in the gratitude and veneration of the masses of whom they have made a PEOPLE . The first two of the remedies advocated by M. de Beaumont , manufacturing industry and a poor law , will now have fair play , which they never could have had as long as drunkenness was there to counteract them . The third , emigration , which , as a measure of state policy on a large scale , he considers too difficult for much good , will most probably be checked by the success of the others . When men have a home which is made habitable , a field for the exercise of labor , and a resource against the chances of distress , they will be in no hurry to abandon it ; they will have no necessity for severing the ties of social affection , or seeking beyond the ocean for shelter against the ills of their native land . So far as the United States may be affected by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of great interest . Those among us who deprecate an increase of immigration from that country , may rejoice in the amelioration which must tend to keep its population at home . Those who receive with pleasure each fresh accession to our millions , will in future have to hail the new comers with which every ship may be freighted , not with the mingled compassion and repugnance , excited by worn-down , servile victims of licentiousness and poverty , but with the welcome due to men proud in their self-respect , of temperate habits , and unspotted characters , and in all ways worthy of the citizenship which awaits them here . The abolition of the privileges of the " mauvaise aristocratie " of Ireland is among the most prominent of those projected remedies , which our author indicates as almost a necessary consequence of the rest . He draws a wide and welldefined distinction between the aristocracy , grown , by a long series of circumstances , to be an inseparable portion of the social system of England , and that dominant mass of titled // and endowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctive epithet . He plainly advocates the destruction of this mongrel aristocracy , with all its rights of entail , primogeniture , and other privileges . But he must be heard for himself . " When I say , that the aristocracy of Ireland must be destroyed and extirpated , even to its root , I do not mean by this a violent and sanguinary destruction . " I do not agree with those people , who think , that to establish order , prosperity , and union in a country , it is necessary to begin by murdering some thousands of persons , sending those who are not killed into exile , taking the property of the rich , giving it to the poor , &amp;c. &amp;c . I set aside all such methods as iniquitous , and I do not inquire if they would be necessary . I believe , without examination , that they are not necessary , that they are not just , and that they are atrocious . It is in my eyes a vicious proceeding , when one injustice presents itself to be reformed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is certainly and at present evil , in prospect of a future and doubtful good . I distrust those criminal means , which are sanctified by the end , and which , if the end fails , leave nothing but the crime to him who makes use of them ; or it may rather be said , that criminal means can never become honest . Besides , I am unwilling to admit , that injustice and violence ever profit either nations or individuals . I think too highly of the progress of humanity , to suppose , that excesses which dishonor it can ever he useful to it . A great crime sometimes seems to hasten forward liberty , but having impelled it on , by a leap , for one day , stops it perhaps for ages . If it could even be proved to me , that a crime is advantageous to the present generation , I should not think that this generation had a right to impose upon the next the infallible expiation of it . " I mean the abolition of the Irish aristocracy , understanding by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , of which it has made use only to oppress the people . Let it be deprived of its civil privileges , which have only been the means of gratifying its selfishness , and let that religious predominance be humbled , which , if it does not produce persecutions , perpetuates the remembrance of them . " To destroy the political power of the aristocracy , it is necessary that it should be deprived of the daily application of the laws , as it has been before deprived of the power of making them . Consequently , it would be necessary to de // stroy , from top to bottom , the administrative and judicial system , which rests on the institution of justices of the pe ace , and on the organization of the grand juries , as they are at present constituted , - and in the first place , to execute this destruction , it would be necessary to establish a system for the centralization of power . " - Tom . II . pp. 180- 182 . Into this subject M. de Beaumont enters at length , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood only by a reference to the book itself . Of two serious points , connected with this important portion of the xvoi'k , we can only say a few passing words , and can afford but small space for extracts . And first , of the Orange party ; that is to say , the loathsome faction which has domineered in Ireland for more than a hundred and fifty years , and which must , from the nature of things , and from its own action , perish like a pestilent weed , in its self-engendered rottenness . It is defined by iM. de Beaumont , as follows " The old Anglican party , which takes for a device the salvation of the Protestant church , and for a rallying-word , hatred of Popery , has for its sacramental principle the intimate union of Church and State , that is to say , of the Anglican worship and the Anglican aristocracy . Whilst every thing advances , and every thing about it changes , this party remains immovable ; and it will sustain , on the ruins of a universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not exclusively Protestant . " This party can not conceive of a Protestant society without a Protestant church , a Protestar*t government , a Protestant king , Protestant judges and functionaries , Protestant citizens and soldiers ; whoever in the country is not a Protestant , in the of this party , as if he did not exist and is , view has only an imaginary life . " It is the opinion held by this party , that every thing , which has been done contrary to this exclusive principle , has been ill done . The constitution was violated on the day when a single penal law against the Irish Catholics was abolished . These laws are in no wise oppressive to the Catholics ; it depends only on themselves to become free under the protection of the laws ; they have nothing to do but to make themselves Protestants ; it is very natural , that this conditioa should have been exacted from them , since Protestantism is the law of the country , the law of the State , the law of the soil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this party , the constitution was violated on the day when Scotland was permitted to have a Presbyterian church ; and a sort of sacrilege was committed , when the English Parliament endowed with the funds of the State , a seminary designed for the education of Catholic priests . The constitution was again violated , when the electoral right , the right to be elected to Parliament , was granted to the Irish Catholics ; in the eyes of this party , these concessions are as if they had not happened , and he who believes it impossible to retract , deplores them . Whenever such concessions are made to the Catholics , the Tory party sees , or feigns to see , a dreadful monster ready to escape from the iron cage where he is chained , to spring upon and devour the people this hideous monster is Popery . " This party holds in singular veneration the name of William the Third , Prince of Orange , the conqueror of the Boyne , and the last founder of the Anglican church in Ireland ; it is inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , gives at public festivals toasts to his glorious memory , and endeavours to support , in all their vigor , the religious passions on which the fortunes of that prince were elevated ; from which causes it took the name of the Orange party . " This party , which for more than a century trampled the Catholics under foot , holds them still more in scorn than in hatred . When they speak of an honest company , it is of course a company of Protestants that they mean . In their language , every thing which is Protestant is called respectable , in opposition to every thing Catholic . " This party considers , that all the ills of the country have come upon it from the weakness of the power , which did not , when an opportunity offered , sufficiently repress the rebels . Having stated , that after the insurrection of 1798 , sixty-six persons accused of rebellion , were executed at Wexford alone , the historian , Sir Richard Musgrave , who considers the repression as tender , adds , We may judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the true Orange man . Under the ardent religious and political passions of the Orange or Tory party , are found some interests , among others that of preserving immense privileges for an aristocracy which does not govern , and a magnificent revenue for a church which has nothing to do . " - pp. 88- 90 . The established church of Ireland is the other great feature of nntional grievance . M. de Beaumont says , " As long as the established church is the religion of the state , the // state will be odious to the country , and there will be no possibility of prosperity or repose for Ireland . " He con-tinues ; The Anglican supremacy is , to Ireland , the principal and the continual source of all evil . It signifies , to the Irish , violence , confiscation , rapine , cruelty . It is , in their eyes , the certain sign of injustice , of falsehood , and of spoliation . As long as the English church is the established worship in Ireland , wrong or right , this country will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is always treated as an oppressed and conquered country , because the most bitter remembrances of the conquest are all connected with Protestantism , and there is no recollection of Protestantism , which is not mingled with tyranny. ** * * * * * This principle of religious domination , in which are resuined and perpetuated all the old grievances of Catholic Ireland , will be , while it lasts , an inexhaustible source of division , hatred , attack , and resistance . It will render fruitless all authority , even the most beneficent , which is founded on this basis . Vainly will any government , in other respects the most national , attempt to establish unity in Ireland ; it will be powerless and fragile , if it is laid upon this vicious foundation . Vainly will reforms be made in the administration of the Anglican church ; it will be in vain to correct abuses , to abolish sinecures , to diminish the wealth of the clergy ; the evil will be always the same , as long as the principle prevails , which attributes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and this evil will always provoke the same risings ; the same violence , the same popular rebellions , will appear . What particular event will be the occasion of them we can not say , but the result will not fail to take place . - pp. *39-240 . Whence comes the inutility of the efforts which have been made to reform the Anglican church of Ireland ? It is because Ireland does not wish its reform , but its abolition . The radical vice of this church is , that it is established as the legal and official worship of a people , who have another form of worship . The abuse is , its very establishment . Its creation , in the bosom of a Catholic people , is a wrong , which perpetuates itself as long as that church endures . The great evil of the Anglican church in Ireland is , that it is placed in the midst of a population , which repels it without examination . Its riches , its luxury , its idleness , are assuredly **eat vices , but the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction , in Ireland , is the first step towards good sense and good order . " When we speak of abolishing the Anglican church , we do not mean to annihilate , in Ireland , the Episcopal worship , but only to destroy the political superiority of this form over all others . Neither would it be necessary , in abolishing the predominance of the Anglican worship , to replace it by the supremacy of the Catholic worship . What is important is , to establish in Ireland an equality of worship . Ireland , it is true , is Catholic in the main , as England is Episcopal , and Scotland Presbyterian ; and it would be logical , that Ireland should have a Catholic establishment , in the same manner as Scotland has a Presbyterian establishment , and England an Anglican one . But , in the first place , it is a great question , whether it is advantageous to unite church and state . Why associate human and perishable institutions with one which is of God , and which will never die ? What would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion as that of the state , except the destruction of the religious privileges of the Protestants , to transfer them to the Catholics ? After having abolished the iniurious supremacy of the Anglican church , which offends a majority of the Irish people , would you see the Protestant minority oppressed by the religion which it now oppresses " One of the greatest evils , to which Catholic Ireland could be exposed , is , that , after having been ruled over , it should wish to rule . This would be a fruitful source of misfortunes to England and to itself ; to England , because it would not bear this dominion of a sect , and because all the old passions of the Re formation would he aroused by this Popish pretension ; and to Ireland itself , which would be crushed anew by England . " It is important to the two countries , that Ireland should be accustomed to religious liberty ; and what better means are there , to give it tolerant customs , than to place all religions on the same footing ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to give to the Catholics of this country a Lesson of this sort . The equality of sects should come as a benefit ; soon , perhaps , they will consider it an evil ; and this will certainly happen , if this equality does not take place , in Ireland , till the Catholics are politically superior ; they will then consider equality of sects as only introduced for the degradation of their reli0ion. " - pp. 246-248 . We can not follow our author in the long cbain of argument by which he shows , to his own satisfaction , if not quite to our conviction , the facility of establishing a perfectly religious // equality in Ireland . Considering the long series of abuses inflicted on that country by the established church , - its intolerance , its enormous wealth , its lordly privileges , its insolent pretension , - we believe that no moderate modification of its present state can well be brought about by legislative enactinents , or that such would be at all likely to conciliate the Catholic population ; nor do we think any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is to us quite clear , that the flood of Catholic supremacy must pass over Ireland before the seeds of true Christianity can spring up . The destruction of " Protestant ascendency " is an inevitable necessity . The false system , so long fostered , has been the ruin of Protestantisrn . Orange ferocity and Catholic degradation have only prepared the way for Catholic power and Orange extirpation . Protestantism is gradually expiring in Ireland , from its own excess . It has long lost all moral force . Political power and social influence are gradually slipping away from it . It must , inevitably , rapidly lose every one of its hitherto overgrown prerogatives . Then Catholicism will most probably arise , in pomp , insolence , and persecution . Protestantism will either struggle violently , in tumult and blood , or disappear in expatriation . Protestant property will pass into Catholic hands ; and Catholic influence is not likely to change its nature , and become tolerant towards what it hates , and so naturally longs to be revenged on . England , from whom iVI. de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by following the course of great wisdom which seems to guide the present government , and by a magnanimous interference , hold the balance even between the conflicting parties , and mitigate the severity of the lot of overpowered Protestantism in Ireland . Catholicism may possibly be moderate , instead of rampant ; but , if so , it will not be Catholicism in its ancient spirit . However all this may be , - and who may penetrate the veil of futurity ? - we believe the only chance for true enlightenment in Ireland , according to the genuine principles of the Reformation , is in the existing church establishment being thoroughly purged , ay , or altogether overthrown ; when the state may really flourish in unclogged and legitimate power , and the church have a chance of starting anew , on a career in accordance with its pristine purity . We are reluctantly obliged to omit M. de Beaumont 's rcasonings , on the state of the judiciary , the magistracy , the infe // nor officers of justice , and the constitution of Irish juries , corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of all the ramifications composing the tangled xveb of Irish misgoveminent ; and he winds up his labors , by entering into the question , what can England do for Ireland ? - tracing , as far as his judgment can decide it , what is to be expected from each of the three breat parties , which now struggle for predominance in the United Kingdom . We consider an inquiry of this nature the less necessary on our part from the opinion with which we started , and which we now emphatically repeat , that it is by Ireland herself that the work of amelioration is to he done . The business is in her hands . She has at last taken it up in the right spirit ; and , whatever may he the something , which Providence has destined for the relief of a fine country and a noble people , it has now , for the first time for centuries , a fair chance of being fitly accomplished . We are happy in believing , that a strong sympathy will he felt throughout the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair occasion has offered for displaying the good feeling of the people at large in favor of their Irish fellow-citizens , the result has always been such as every philanthropic mind must approve . Peplorable collisions have from time to time arisen between the Irish and small fractions of the native population . Excesses have been committed by a few , ignorant , prejudiced , and hotheaded persons . But the good sense and respectability of the country has always reprobated those partial aberrations from propriety and legality . Our attention has been lately called to a course of lectures on Irish History and Character , delivered in New York , by Mr. Samuel G. Goodrich , ( the well known " Peter Parley , " ) and which are , we understand , very shortly to he published . We hope their promised appearance will take place in such time as to enable us to notice , in our next Number , a work , which , although it may be of slight dimensions , will , we are sure , contain matter of the highest interest on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers ' notice , and which we shall certainly follow up , in connexion with its bearings on this country.
