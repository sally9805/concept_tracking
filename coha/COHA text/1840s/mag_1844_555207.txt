txt THOUGH this beautiful volume is not printed for general circulation , we shall not violate any private confidence by giving some account of its contents in these pages . Mr. Cleveland was an occasional contributor to our Journal , and his papers were always welcomed by readers of taste ; this circumstance gives us , in some degree , a right to avail ourselves of the present opportunity to record , in a periodical which his writings adorned , our impressions of his life and literary character . // All who read the present volume , it is believed , will agree in thinking , that it contains the evidence of greater and more varied abilities than even Mr. Cleveland 's friends gave him credit for during his life . His attainments as a scholar and his talents as a writer formed only a small part of the bright assemblage of qualities which attracted their respect and won their affection . His various knowledge and his elegant tastes were blended with such amiability of temper , so much warmth and tenderness of feeling , such integrity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he made , on the minds of those most intimate with him , the impression , not merely or chiefly of a man of talent , a scholar , and an able writer or speaker , but of an accomplished gentleman , in the best sense of the term , - a warm and faithful friend , a lively , interesting , and urbane companion , a man not only of worldly honor , but of a character moulded by self-discipline into the fair proportions of Christian excellence . Those who were acquainted with him from his childhood know , that he was not framed for great bodily health and strength , that he had a delicacy of organization , which , if it did not betoken a short life , was still accompanied by no small portion of the irritability of temperament , which requires great and painful vigilance in keeping guard over the little acts of daily intercourse , not to degenerate into a wearisome peevishness of temper . They will remember , too , what noble and generous impulses chased these slight clouds away by their golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupted by this , his only besetting weakness , marked his demeanour towards all around him . But they only can know how much of a sense of duty , of submission to moral and religious principle , of struggle to suppress the rebellious murmurings of a diseased and irritable constitution , went to form the serene , balanced , and beautiful character which all who knew him admired and loved in the latter years of his life . And now that he has departed , we look back with unmingled joy upon his life and character . We feel the inestimable value of those principles , which enabled him to combat against the incessant attacks of constitutional , and therefore hopeless , ill health , - which , whatever the moralists may say to the contrary , is the most dangerous enemy a man is ever summoned to contend against , - and to mould the elements of his moral and intellectual being into a character // of such solid strength and exquisite proportions , that the strongest and most felicitously endowed may be proud and happy to emulate it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image , and one ever to be cherished in the memory , his intellectual powers , displayed as they are in still remaining monuments , naturally assume a prominence which they never seemed to have before ; they separate themselves , as it were , from the rest of his character , and attract our attention to them on their own account . His writings , too , being scattered in separate publications , and divided from each other by considerable intervals of time , produced a broken and comparatively feeble impression . We are , therefore , much gratified that the present collection has been made ; and , intimate as were our relations with the writer , the variety and extent of his acquirements , the beauty and vigor of his mind , and his command of so rich and elegant a style as this volume proves him to bave possessed , have almost taken us by surprise . He has written on many and widely different subjects , and always with good sense , clearness , and force ; not seldom with beauty and eloquence ; sometimes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of power that no feebler term than genius can properly express . It was but justice , then , to Mr. Cleveland 's memory , that this collection should be printed ; it is a memorial that his friends will look upon with pleasure and pride ; and when his daughter , bereft of him too early to understand her infinite loss , grows to maturity , she will have the inexpressible delight of contemplating in it the strength , grace , and beauty of her father 's intellectual endowments , though his outward form and features may have faded entirely from her recollection . The memoir , prefixed to the collection of Mr. Cleveland 's writings , from the elegant pen of Mr. Hillard , is all that the friends of the deceased can desire . The history of the short , but not uneventful life , is told with good taste , simplicity , and feeling . Though a warm and intimate friend , and though he writes in the affectionate tone which this sacred relation naturally inspires , he has been betrayed into no excess of eulogy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's virtues , into no exaggerated estimate of his talents . He has collected from the best sources the facts in the life of his friend , and wrought them into a narrative of // high interest , closing the biography with an exquisitely drawn character , in which he has analyzed with skill and power the traits and qualities of which that character was composed . The whole is executed in a manner worthy of the taste and talents of the writer , and of the memory of the lamented subject . Henry Russell Cleveland was horn in Lancaster , October 3 , 1808 . He was prepared for the University in a private school in his native town , under the instruction of those distinguished scholars , Mr. Sparks , Mr. George B. Emerson , and the late Mr. Solomon P. Miles . He entered the University at Cambridge in 1823 . Though very young , he displayed from the beginning the force of the good principles which had been carefully inculcated upon him during his childhood . He was never enticed into the vices and follies , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold out opportunities irresistible to the virtue of many . He showed no strong tendency to any one department of intellectual exertion ; but excellent capacities for all . The prescribed duties of the college he performed with conscientious care and punctuality . He held a very respectable rank in his class ; was fond of elegant literature , which he cultivated beyond the requirements of the college course ; and gave much time to moral and political science , for which he showed a taste beyond his years . His associates remember , particularly , the thoroughness and delight with which he studied voluntarily Montesquien 's profound work , the " Esprit des Lois , " at a time when most of them , older and less boyish to outward appearance than he , would have preferred the last new poem or novel , as a relaxation from their college studies . But he was most distinguished as a writer . He showed , from the beginning , an uncommon felicity in composition , and in this department , it is believed , he was not inferior to any in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , immediately after , engaged in a high school in Geneseo , New York , which , in conjunction with two of his classmates , he had agreed to conduct for two years . The responsibilities of the situation , and the discipline of teaching , had the happiest effect upon his character and powers ; and the society of that region , which , being made up chiefly of the families of wealthy landed gentry , is refined and agreeable to a remarkable degree , and distinguished // for a boundless and elegant hospitality , which he who has participated in can never forget , - this society , into which Mr. Cleveland was frankly welcomed as a most acceptable member , had a benign influence in moulding his manners , and strengthening the kindly feelings of his heart . But a violent fever compelled him to leave Geneseo before the expiration of the stipulated time , and he returned to Cambridge in the spring of 1829 , greatly enfeebled by the severe action of the disease upon a highly susceptible frame . But his time had been usefully and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher and disciplinarian with exemplary ability , he had read with critical care many of the old English authors , particularly Chaucer , for whose quaint , vigorous , racy genius , and genial humor he cherished a singular fondness ; and had laboriously studied the Latin literature , especially the works of Livy and Cicero , a love for whom was one of his predominating tastes to the end of his life . Indeed , to the influence of his Latin studies , and the stately and sounding periods of Cicero and Virgil , may be partly traced the excellences and faults of his own style , which had a natural tendency to a rhythmical pomp and solemn march of expression , in his more elaborate compositions . Mr. Cleveland passed the winter of 1830-3 1 in the island of Cuba , which he visited for the recovery of his health ; in the spring , he embarked for England , where he remained two months , and in August passed over to Paris . He established himself quietly in the French capital , and engaged at once in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris , he became connected with the American Legation , in the capacity of private secretary to Mr. Rives , the American minister . After a year spent in this way , he set out on a tour through Switzerland and Italy , visiting the principal cities , and studying with zeal and enthusiasm the literature and arts of that classic land . He returned to Paris in the following December , and resumed his former studies during the winter ; and in May , 1833 , returned to America , greatly benefited in health by his travels , and with a mind in which were laid up the accumulated treasures of knowledge and taste . In August , he became attached to the college in Cambridge , as a proctor , and occupied himself diligently as a student and private teacher . He also // 133 contributed several agreeable papers to various journals , which were marked by a matured and scholarlike elegance of style . From an article on Homer , published in the " American Quarterly Review , " and reprinted in the present volume , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we take a passage , as a specimen of his first manner . " In the eye of the early Greeks , man was born for no prep . aration for a future existence , but only to direct and enjoy the present . For him the universe was created ; the earth , his dwelling-place , hung central , and the heavenly luminaries revolved about it , pouring down their light and swaying the seasons for him alone . Not only the inferior orders of beings , but the deities themselves were formed for him . The god of day pursued his ceaseless path through the heavens to cheer his Ia. bors , and the chaste queen of night watched over his slumbers . The father of gods and men , the universal Jove , descended from Olympus to inspire him ; Minerva covered him with the awful shield of wisdom ; the goddess of grace and love placed her shrine in his heart ; and immortal powers , captivated with his beauty , forsook their abodes to seek on earth a loveliness which they found not in heaven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence centred in man ; and were he blotted from being , all things would pass away like a vain pageant , and heaven , earth , and hell , with all their inhabitants , would cease to be . " Nor was man wanting to these high destinies . Forming no idea of future happiness , nor of intellect vaster than his own , he assumed majestically the dominion on earth to which he was born , and girded himself for the fearful contest which was his inheritance . Against the elements which warred with his being , against the terrible powers of destiny , against the certainty of death , he engaged in a ceaseless struggle for victory . The sun , amazed at his crimes , started back in his course ; the gods , wounded by his spear , fled howling to Olympus ; and the dreary realms of Tartarus yielded up the dead to his victorious hands . Gathering into the present the might of an immortal spirit , he sought to ally it more closely to the perishable clay , lie coveted , above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroic achievements and by uniting himself with the gods , to rise at last to the starry Olympus . " Man , then , among the Greeks , the lord of the universe , to whom even the divinities were but ministering attendants , - man , gifted with an all-daring and all-grasping soul , created only to ennoble him here , was the highest manifestation of beauty , power , and majesty . Descended from a common parent with // his gods , his form was not inferior to their own , hut became the only model . For the poet or the sculptor , then , man was the great and only subject , and in him all their efforts were concentrated . In proportioa as he approximated in character and attributes to the supernatural beings , the works of genius in every branch , by being limited more exclusively to one model , became analogous . " - pp. 22-24 . In 1834 , Mr. Cleveland , and his friend , Mr. Edmund L. Cushing , opened a classical school in Boston , the plan of which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former , entitled " Remarks on the Classical Education of Boys , by a Teacher . " It was a work of great merit , and for the beauty of its style , the taste of its criticism , the wisdom and liberality of its suggestions , deserves to be reprinted and to take a permanent place in the literature of education . Under the excellent management of these two able teachers , the school acquired a high and just reputation . Mr. Cleveland devoted his best powers to its interests until his marriage , in February , 1838 . " From this period , " says his biographer , with equal truth and beauty , " the course of his life was singularly placid and uneventful . With the exception of a single winter spent in Boston , a few months in Cambridge , and occasional visits to Burlington , in New Jersey , the residence of his wife 's mother , he resided at the beautiful estate of Pine Bank , Roxhury . His retiring habits and the delicacy of his organization gave him a strong preference for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pronounced by the poet to be so favorable to virtue and happiness . His occupations were almost exclusively literary , though no inconsiderable portion of his time was devoted to the duties of a wide and generous hospitality . His friends will long associate his image , his smile of welcome , and the cordial pressure of his hand , with the breezy lawns of Pine Bank , the beautiful belt of trees which skirts its borders , its winding walks , and gentle waves that die away upon its pebbled shore . " - pp. xxiii. , xxiv . Besides the excellent articles which he contributed to periodical literature during this period , he wrote and delivered many public lectures , * which were very favorably received ; // and studied extensively the English , French , Italian , and Roman literature , not neglecting the German and the Greek . " To his other intellectual accomplishments , " says Mr. Hillard , " is to be added a knowledge of architecture and of music . His taste in architecture may be gathered from his article on that sub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy of eye and just perception of form naturally qualified him to judge of the merit of buildings , and this power had been improved by a study of the best works on architecture . With music he was well acquainted , both theoretically and practically . He had studied the laws of harmony and the principles of musical composition with a thoroughness not common in an amateur , and musical performances were to him a source of the deepest pleasure ; and though capable of enjoying and comprehending the highest excellence , he was exempt from that morbid fastidiousness which is displeased with any thing short of it . His favorite instrument was the organ , and he played upon it with skill , taste , and feeling . His touch , in particular , - which is a natural gift , depending upon physical organization , and which may be improved , but not created by practice , - was uncommonly fine . A simple strain of melody often acquired , from his manner of playing , a depth of expression which was never reached by more brilliant performers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of this volume is occupied by a selection from Mr. Cleveland 's contributions to periodical literature , embracing the following subjects " Felton 's Homer , " " Politics of Europe , " " Classic Mythology , " " American Architecture , " " Music of Nature , " " Hillard 's Edition of Spenser 's Poetical Works , " " Scenes in Europe , " and a humorous phantasy , entitled " De Diabolo . " These are followed by extracts from his unpublished lectures , and parts of his correspondence . They are all characterized by a finished style and scholarlike taste . Mr. Cleveland never wrote carelessly ; he was laborious in meditating his subjects , and precise in literary execution . A sustained elegance , sometimes rising into stateliness , and on rare occasions swelling into pomp , is his distinguishing attribute . As our readers will probably remember his hitherto published articles , we take a few extracts from the lectures . From one of them we take the comments on ancient destiny . pher , may be added a Life of Hudson , published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very elaborate article on Cicero , in the " North American Review . " // " Another peculiar characteristic which appears in much of the Grecian tragedy was the belief in fate , or destiny . This belief formed the exact counterpart to their view of life , and cooperated with it to form a perfect scheme or system of tragedy . Having invested man , as a finite being , with the energies and daring of an immortal nature , it was necessary to raise up an antagonist principle , which should both be the cause of , and account for , the trials and sufferings of life ; those trials and sufferings , which , to the believer in Christianity , are comprehended as a preparation for a higher and better state of being . And this principle was discovered in the dark and malignant workings of fate ; a power utterly remorseless , inexorable , and unrelenting , from which nothing could escape , and against which man was born to *vage a perpetual but ineffectual war . It was displayed in various ways ; to the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death ; but besides this , its power was peculiarly manifested in the sorrows and crimes of certain individuals . To some men their fate was predicted , and hung over them perpetually , in awful blackness , as in the case of Achilles , to whom the oracles had declared that he was fated to die under the walls of Troy . From others it was concealed , as when Agamemnon returned from Troy in triumph , only to be murdered by his wife . His fate was foreseen and announced by the prophetess Cassandra , though concealed from himself . But the most dreadful display of the power of destiny , as conceived by the Greeks , was in those cases in which it seizes upon the innocent and virtuous , and drives them , without the least power of resistance , into the commission of the most awful and revolting crimes . An eloquent writer , who gives an instance of this kind of fate , says : The mysterious power of destiny is potent and appalling . Leading its unconscious , helpless victim , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a catastrophe of undeserved but unavoidable horror , it makes the gradual development of the *iEdipus Tyrannus the most heart-rending series of action that the imagination can conceive . We drink the cup of agony by drops , and find it regularly increase in bitterness to the close . " ' - pp. 306-308 . In the course of these lectures , Mr. Cleveland analyzed , with much acuteness and ability , some of the principal creations both of classical and romaIltic literature . Among these , the analysis of the character of Hector is , perhaps , the most beautiful and striking . Passing on to the lectures on the romantic writers , we find // an ingenious contrast between the classic and romantic elements in literature , which deserves to be quoted . " The romance of King Arthur presents us with a bevy of characters , who are gathered into the fellowship of the Round Table , all stamped with the peculiar traits of chivalry , but who nevertheless display a sufficient degree of individuality and consistency of disposition , to distinguish each one , and to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We look in vain , it is true , for those perfect delineations of character which form the glory of the Homeric poems . Shakspeare himself has not surpassed , in this respect , the earliest of poets . It has been well said of our great dramatist , that , in reading any of his principal plays , we might distinguish the different speakers by what they say , even if the names were not prefixed to the sentences which they utter ; this remark equally applies to Homer . Each of the principal personages is represented with such consummate art , that we perceive his distinct individuality at once . We seem to have met and conversed with him . We feel certain how he would act , and what he would say , under such and such circumstances . We are no more in danger of confounding the different characters , or of mistaking one for the other , than in the experience of real life . This is not the case with the heroes of romance ; their individual traits are less plainly marked , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chivalrous character . A spirit is over them , which is stronger than the force of individual natures , and which bends into resemblance dispositions originally of a contrary tendency ; an atmosphere is around them , which spreads over all a brilliant and fanciful , but uniform hue . The disguise of the armor , which conceals friend from friend , *nd brother from brother , seems in a manner to extend to the character , and to conceal the traits , as it bars over with the iron visor the lineaments of the countenance ; and as the mailed knights are distinguished by the blazonry on their shields , so their individual attributes seem to be chiefly apparent through the medium of chivalrous sentiment and purposes . " We may find an analogy for this difference between the classic and romantic creations of character in the sculpture of the two schools . Classic sculpture seeks to portray the perfection of the human form ; it rejects all drapery that conceals the outline ; it presents every form of unadorned beauty , heightened by the charms of perfect execution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuality ; the Apollo bears no more resemblance to the Hercules , than the character of the Patron of Genius and the Arts to that of the God of Strength . The 12* // Venus , the Diana , the Laoco6n , the Niobe , of ' ancient sculpture , are equally marked by their own peculiar traits . " Gothic sculpture , on the other hand , arrays the human form in massive panoply , or in full and concealing drapery ; it presents the forms of warriors in complete armor , of mitred abbots or sceptred kings in robes of state . With peculiar magnificence it decorates the tomb with the effigies of those who have died in the faith , - for on the tomb , the threshold of another world , the sculpture of Christianity delights to proclaim the triumph over death , the life eternal , and the joys of paradise . But we look in vain , among its efforts , for that exquisite finish and that complete individuality which mark the productions of the Grecian chisel . " - pp. 320-322 . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but our object has been to give only a taste of their quality . In November , 1842 , Mr. Cleveland was again compelled , by ill health , to leave his home and visit Cuba . His health was apparently benefited by the beautiful climate of that island , by his travels , and especially by a voyage from Havana to Cura*oa and Bonaire , and the return , which occupied him agreeably about six weeks . His letters to his friends during the winter are very interesting , and some of them full of wit and humor . His mind never acted with greater freedom , his pen never moved with more grace and ease , than during these , the last months of his life . His letters abound in passages of elegant and lively description , which have almost the vividness of pictures of the tropical and luxuriant scenery , in the midst of which he was living . We are obliged to pass over most of those written from Cuba that are printed in this volume ; hut we take from a long letter , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bonaire , a singular and striking description of the comet , whose appearance surprized the whole world at that time . " When we had been out just one week , I was walking the deck a little after sunset , when my attention was attracted by a singular appearance in the western sky . At the first moment , my thought was , that it was a lunar rainbow , partly formed , but an instant after , I saw that there were no clouds , and that it could not be . It extended in a clear column of light , like the aurora , from the horizon to a height of about twenty degrees ; yet we watched it for nearly an hour , when it disappeared , without // observing more than this solitary column of light . It did not act like the aurora , and was not in the right part of the heavens , being in the southwest ; or , as the mate expressed it , it was about a-beam of sunset . ' It died away in the course of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next evening , to the astonishment of all of us , there was the same bright column of light ; it was higher up in the heavens , and we now perceived that it did not shoot up from the horizon , but terminated in a bright star , or ball of fire ; and we concluded , that it must be a comet of greater size , in appearance at least , than any which had ever before visited our System . Sublime , indeed , did the mystery seem to us , of this fiery phantom of the night , which had thus all suddenly appeared in our firmament , unheralded by astronomical prophecies , unheard of , unexpected . How impenetrable to us is its appearance ; we , a separated speck of human life , cut off from all intercourse with men , on a boundless sea ! How I have longed , and now long , to break the spell , - to know what it is , whence it comes , and why ! even the most vague speculations , from men of intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what the astronomers say of it ; why they did not know of its coming ; whether it has ever before been seen , or whether it has been flying in its immeasurable orbit since the creation , and has only now , for the first time , reached our universe , and come to claim a fellowship with the sun and the stars ! It impresses me with a feeling of awe , which is increased , perhaps , by the profound ignorance in which I must remain for the present concerning it . There , nightly , it flames in the western sky , stretching far across the heavens , in the pathway of the stars ; perhaps for countless ages it has been wandering in infinite space , till it has reached a solitude where creation ceases , - a desert of systems , which is beyond the reach of the most distant suns , - where the rays from the solar system are wearied out and fade into darkness , before they pierce the inconceivable distance . Perhaps it has now , for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is rejoicing in their brightness . Perhaps it will wander again into the unfathomable abyss , and continue to wander , till its next return shall witness the death of creation , - the sun blackened in the firmament , the stars shooting madly from their spheres , the earth shrivelled and burned with fire , and the nations gathered before their Maker . I shall not be able to hear any thing about it , till I reach Havana again . Here I can only learn that it was seen two nights earlier than we observed it , which was the 4th of March . I oannot help thinking of the tumult its appearance will create among Miller 's people , and the numbers it will add to his band ; // of the consternation and amazement it will cause ; and I could laugh outright , to fancy the wise looks of the astronomers , upon whom the comet seems fairly to have stolen a march . " - pp. 356 - 358 . Mr. Cleveland left Havana for New Orleans , on his way home , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous arrangement , an old friend and schoolmate , Mr. Ralph Em. * erson , of Paris . They remained some time together in New Orleans , and embarked ; on the 6th of May , in the steamboat Missouri , for St. Louis . Mr. Cleveland 's dis-. ease , which had doubtless been making silent progress through the winter , now suddenly and rapidly developed itself , and , on arriving at St. Louis , May 13th , he was obliged to be carried to the hotel , which he never left . The last letter printed in this volume , dated May 3d , at New Orleans , ends with these words " I long with unspeakable desire to get home , and feel that I shall never get well till I am at home . I shall be with you the first week in June ; nearer than this , I can not say . " Alas ! he died on the 12th of June , far from home ; though the " prayer of his heart , " that he might " see his wife once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Louis the day before he died . He was cheered by the presence and the more than fraternal kindness of his friend , Mr. Emerson , during his last illness . " Mr. Elliot , * too , " says the writer of the memoir , " acted the part of a faithful Christian friend , and administered the consolations of religion in the spirit of true Christian love . " We conclude this brief survey of the life and writings of our friend with a part of the admirable summary of his character by Mr. ilillard . " Mr. Cleveland 's moral character was strengthened and supported by a deep-seated principle of religious faith . The religious sentiment was first awakened in his heart upon his mother 's knee and in his mother 's arms , and these early impressions grew with his growth and clung to him through life . Submission to the will of God in hours of trial and discipline , and gratitude for the many blessings with which his life was crowned , were constant states of mind with him . His was never a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than he had received . He was grateful for the gift of life , for the affections with which // it was so blessed and hallowed , and for the opportunities of selfimprovement and usefulness which had been granted to him . His character had the crowning charm of humility . Upon the public services of religion he was always a regular attendant , and of late years he had been a careful and habitual student of the Bible . The triumph of his religious faith was seen in that hour when it is ever most severely tried , - in the hour of death . His last moments were brightened and sustained by those consolations and supports which Christianity alone can give . He died as a Christian should die , and as a Christian only can die . " But by more than all things else , Mr. Cleveland was distin. guished by the warmth , the depth , and the constancy of his affections . To love and be beloved were strong necessities of his nature . Kindness awakened in him a lively sense of gratitude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gratification of the affections furnished by the society of his family and friends , he found the chief happiness of his life . In the various relations of son , brother , husband , and father , he was most exemplary ; always affectionate , self-forgetting , and thoughtful of others . Between him and his friends there was the sunshine of perfect love and unbroken confidence . With them he knew no reserve . He shared with them his thoughts , his purposes , his hopes , and his fears . Towards them his countenance was never turned but with the most animating expression of kindness and affection . In their society his powers expanded and his nature seemed to breathe its genial atmosphere . In his looks and tones , his words of welcome and the cordial grasp of his hand , there was a persuasive power , which gave assurance to the self-distrustful and made the sensitive feel unconstrained . He was not strongly influenced by new faces or novel associations . The presence of strangers rather checked than aided the flow of his mind . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pressure of well-dressed crowds . Powerful excitements were always rather oppressive to his gentle and sensitive nature . He far preferred the charm of familiar faces , and the music of familiar voices ; to be surrounded by a few friends , when , without constraint , the mind may throw off whatever rises to its surface . His tastes were strongly domestic . In more than one family he was received upon the familiar footing of an inmate , before he had gathered round him a household of his own ; and after that time , he found under his own roof the elements of a happy and a useful life . Day after day glided tranquilly by in literary studies , and his wearied powers sought no other refreshment than could be supplied by the society of his family and friends . It is with scenes like these that his image will ever be associated // in the hearts of hi* friends , with the circle that gathers round the winter fireside , with the quiet stroll in the long lingering twilight of summer , with the occupations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of Family and Home . " We feel the loss of such a man to be a severe bereavement . To his intimate friends it seems as if a portion of the daily light which fell upon their lives were taken away . As we look mournfully into his early grave , the question forces itself upon the mind , Why were such powers , attainments , affections , so soon removed from an earth which had such need of them ? But this is not the mood in which this affliction should be contem .. plated . Gratitude for such a life should not be lost in grief for such a death . The character of a man 's life is not determined till its close . The hand of death alone puts a seal upon its excellence . The capacities which we honored , and the virtues which we loved , are not extinguished , but transferred to another sphere . The day of reunion is not far distant with any of us . His life on earth may now be viewed as a complete whole , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle is over and the palm is won . With him there is no fear of faltering goodness , oC decaying virtue , of wandering away from the pure lights which guided his youth . He has been faithful to the end . And now that the darkness of the grave has gathered over his form , and that we are to see his face no more upon earth , a sense of gratitude should mingle with our sorrow , that we have been permitted to have such a friend and to contemplate such a life . The memory of what he was should confirm our devotion to duty , our submissiveness to trial , our constancy in labor ; it should make us more pure , more kindly , more self-forgetful . We should show ourselves worthy of the affection with which he regarded us , by a more uniform devotion to those high principles which governed his life and hallowed his death . "
