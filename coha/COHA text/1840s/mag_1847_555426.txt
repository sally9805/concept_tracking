txt THIS work is a valuable contribution to the early political history of the United States , and we have finished the perusal of it with no ordinary degree of satisfaction . In regard either to the able and distinguished statesman whose biography it includes , or to the more general view it exhibits of the administrations of which he was a member , it must be considered as one of the most interesting works of an interesting class . Oliver Wolcott was an admirable specimen of the New England character , such a character , indeed , as you do not often find out of New England . There is little violation of modesty in saying this , as it was not marked by any of the higher traits of genius . Sagacious , prudent , industrious , temperate and frugal , enterprising and persevering , he added to these national characteristics the personal and hereditary qualities of honesty , independence , modesty , and firmness , with pimrity and simplicity of manners , and great amiability of temper ; and , as if to give zest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and the other members of his family , his character was marked by a slight touch of eccentricity . His grandfather , Rcger Wolcott* was descended from one of the Pilgrim fathers of New England , and was distinguished in the colony both for his civil and military services . His father , Oliver , - a name doubtless given in honor of " Old Noll , " - served as a captain in the provincial forces of New York , in defence of the northern frontier against the French and Indians . He continued in the army from 1747 to the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle . He then studied medicine , and settled at Litchfield , in Connecticut , at that period " on the outskirts of New England civilization " ; and by his practice , aided by the cultivation of a small farm , was enabled to marry and to rear a family , of whom the future secretary of the treasury was the first-born . The younger Oliver Wolcott was born at Litchfield , in 1760 , and acquired the rudiments of his education at the 14* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervals of his attendance at school , he was employed in looking after the cattle , and in the other usual occupations upon the farm . At the age of fourteen , he entered Yale College , and had for his classmates Joel Barlow , Uriah Tracy , Zephaniah Swift , and . A/'oah Webster . The last mentioned of these village prophets and patriarchs tells us that Wolcott " was a good scholar , though not brilliant , frank and faithful in his friendships , and generous to the extent of his means " ; and that " he possessed the firmness and strong reasoning powers of the Wolcott family , but with some eccentricities in his reasoning . " While he was pursuing his studies at Yale , his father , who had served in several civil offices in Connecticut , and had risen to be a general in the militia , was elected a delegate to the Continental Congress , and in that capacity signed the Declaration of Independence . He remained in Congress till the end of the war , was then made a commissioner of Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year 1786 was annually elected lieutenant-governor of Connecticut , until 1796 , when he was chosen governor , which office he held till his death , at the close of the following year . General Wolcott seems to have possessed a full measure of the qualities ascribed to his family , and his letters contained in the present publication convey a very favorable impression both of his head and heart , and do equal honor to the writer and his son , to whom they were addressed . To return to the latter ; in April , 1777 , while at Litchfield on a visit to his mother , his father being absent , attending Congress , news arrived of the march of the enemy to Danbury . The young collegian was summoned to repair to the rendezvous of the militia of the neighbourhood . His mother armed him , furnished his knapsack with provisions and a blanket , and dismissed him with the charge " to conduct himself like a good soldier . " The party to which he was attached had several skirmishes with the enemy during their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year he took his first degree at Yale , and immediately commenced the study of the law at Litchfield , under Tapping Reeve , well known as the founder and head of a private law-school of great celebrity . After the destruction of Fairfield and , // Norwalk , in 1779 , our young soldier attended his father , as a volunteer aid , to the coast , and at the close of the expedition was offered a commission in the Continental service . This he declined , having already made some progress in his professional studies ; hut he accepted an appointment at Litchfleld , in the quartermaster 's department , which did not materially interfere with their farther pursuit . In January , 1781 , he came of age , and was admitted to the bar . He removed shortly afterwards to Hartford , having left home with three dollars in his pocket ; this circumstance accounts for his acceptance , immediately on his arrival , of a clerkship in one of the public offices , with a salary of fifty cents a day . His diligence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , the next year , promoted him to a higher post , as member of the central board of accounts . Here his activity and usefulness were such as to procure his further advancement to be comptroller , when that office was substituted for the board of accounts . This early attainment of an honorable and responsible situation in public life introduced him to the society of the principal men of his own State , and to the acquaintance of many eminent men out of it . It led eventually to his appointments in the treasury of the United States , upon its organization tinder the present constitution , first as auditor , afterwards as comptroller , and finally as head of the department . The first of these offices he owed to the suggestion and influence of Jeremiah Wadsworth ; the second and third , to the recommendation of Alexander Hamilton ; but neither of them to his own solicitation . So well did Mr. Wolcott fulfil the expectations of his friends as secretary of the treasury , to which he succeeded upon the resignation of Hamilton , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to agree in opinion with Pickering and McHenry , who were dismissed for their adherence to Hamilton in his preference of General Pinckney to Mr. Adams as a candidate for the presidency . Nor did he quit the cabinet until the second nomination of Mr. Adams , when he considered it indelicate longer to remain in it . At this period , his whole fortune consisted of about three hundred dollars in cash , and a farm of about twenty acres upon Connecticut river , to which he retired . And yet , this man , whose conduct had been sifted again and again by his // political adversaries in Congress , and as often found unimpeachable , like that of Hamilton , his predecessor , and Pickering and McHenry , his former colleagues , was libelled by the scurrilous newspapers of the party in opposition , as having enriched himself by the plunder of the public . Hamilton , it is well known , was compelled to return to the practice of his profession for support , and left little else for his children than the inheritance of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in search of a maintenance in the settlement of wild lands ; and Mdllenry , who had previously possessed some property , spent a large portion of it in the service of the public . But not one of them was so wise in his generation as the men of this our world . They made no " friends of the mammon of unrighteousness , " they neither entered office in search of " spoils , " nor carried any with them out of it . We shall not be guilty of so much injustice towards them , as to compare them in other respects with their successors we shall draw no parallel between the party to which they belonged , and that which now conducts the national government . Indeed , it seems to us almost a profanation to apply the term " party , " with its modern associations , to the Federalists of the school of Washington and Hamilton . The name was given to them because they were the authors and advocates of the Federal Constitution ; while that of Antifederalists was given to the party who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former had borne conspicuous parts either in the cabinet or the field during the war of the Revolution . They had labored zealously to procure the adoption of the new system ; and as their claims to public confidence rested on their public services , their efforts were successful . With Washington at their head , they had encountered the anarchy which succeeded the war with the same indomitable resolution and favorable result with which they had combated the enemy from without . Hence the evils springing from the conflicting views arid interests of the several States , and from the feebleness of the Confederation , were rapidly disappearing under the corrective influence of the government which had superseded it . The union being thus happily cemented by bringing its discordant materials into harmony with each other , the administration of the new government passed , almost as a matter // of course , into the bands of its friends . But the vigilance and activity of its enemies , with the augmentation of their numbers from the dissatisfaction of some of the Federalists with the official arrangements and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority in the popular branch of the new Congress . Much of the discontent had arisen from offended State pride , and from the disappointment of individuals , who , knowing that their personal consequence depended upon the power and influence of their respective States , were un*vil1ing to transfer so large a portion of sovereign authority to the government of the Union . As they had obtained no part in the administration , they were the more disposed to regard it in the light of a foreign power , and as a substitute for the paramount jurisdiction formerly exercised by Great Britain . There were a few among them who had earned some distinction in the Revolution ; most of these had formed a part of the opposition which existed in the old Congress , and in some of the States during the war . That opposition , it will be remembered , had been directed against the authority and measures of General Washington and his friends , and was mixed up with the private cabals , in Congress and in the army , against the commander-in-chief . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and valor achieved the national independence were ranged on the side of the Federal Constitution , and now rallied in support of Washington 's administration . The following extract from a letter written by the elder Wolcott to his son , in 1793 , gives a lively view of some of the benefits conferred by the new government upon the country , and shows of what materials the opposition to Washington 's administration was then chiefly composed . The sentiments and opinions expressed do honor alike to the moral sense of the writer , and to his political sagacity . " I have examined the statement of the Secretary of the Treasury which you sent me , and although I am not able to judge of this business in the detail , yet the energetic reasons which he has assigned for his own conduct can not , I believe , fail of making the most convincing impressions , and fix his adversaries in a state of despondence . I never had the least doubt , both as to the abil. ities and rectitude of Mr. Hamilton . Indeed , a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national fiscal department must be conducted not only with regard to every species of prop erty // within the United States , but to the whole system of commerce , and whatever has the name of property , which can have any connection with this country . The man who can take so comprehensive a view , unaided by any former national experience , as to he able to establish a system of public credit , after it was by abuse of all public faith and confidence nearly annihilated , so as within the short term of four years fully to restore and establish it upon a stable basis , and by his provident care to guard against all contingencies which might do it an injury , and by the same operation raise a people from the most torpid indolence and despondency , to a state of the most vigorous enterprise , industry , and cheerfulness , and increase the value of property within the same period one third more than it before was ( which I believe has been the case within this State , notwithstanding our vast emigrations ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sensible burden upon any one , or deranging one useful occupation or business , must possess talents and industry and a species of intuition , which will ever insure him respect and the highest esteem from all but such only as are infected by that basest and vilest of human affections , envy . In this State I never heard any one speak of Mr. Hamilton but in terms of respect , and the same of the officers of his department . I shall furnish a number of gentlemen in this part of the State with the reading of the fiscal statement which you sent me ; for , although we are very quiet and confiding in the rectitude of the national administration , yet there are some who wish to have it otherwise ( or I am mistaken ) , if they dare make the attempt ; - at present , they dare not . " I have observed that gentlemen who have been for some time in Philadelphia seem to have very disagreeable apprehensions lest there should be some subversion of the national government . This I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months in Philadelphia during the war , but what I had different apprehensions , and those very disagreeable ones , relative to the state of the Union , from what I had upon my return there after a few months ' absence ; and I always found that to be the case in regard to every other member of Congress . Indeed , if they had not been frequently supplied with fresh hands , the condition of the members would have been intolerable . You will always judge right , if you believe that the vast body of the people who live north and back of that place are of emphatically different character from those who compose that factious , ignorant , and turbulent town . I believe that there is not one in fifty in New England but what will support the present government ( in which computation I include Vermont , and also reckon Parson Niles and some hysterical politicians in Boston ) , and I believe that there is // not more than one in twenty north of the Delaware ; Maryland , if I mistake not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , our southern friends shall incline to dissolve the Union , they must count upon the Potomac and the Ohio as the line of division . This part of the Union will not adopt the French ideas of juris. prudence . I believe before the year 1800 , Congress will be very willing to go to Conogochegue , or any other place , so that they can leave Philadelphia ; not but that one half of the bustle and turbulence of that town is a mere matter of affectation and pride , and more owing to habitual security than any serious wish to ob . tam what they seem to aim at . " The French are in a state of extreme delirium and extreme wretchedness . They will suffer all the miseries which war can inflict , and in its consequences , probably , famine and the pestilence . The avowed designs of the late European congress to give France a king will occasion serious reflection in the minds of millions of the Old World . The combination of kings to maintain despotism through Europe is a question which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Old XVorld. " - Vol. i. , pp. 101 , 102 . When the beneficial operation of the new government in the hands of the Federalists had become manifest , their adversaries , conscious of the odium attached to the name of " Antifederalists , " endeavoured to substitute for it that of " Republicans , " which , when the French Revolution broke out , they again exchanged for that of " Democrats , " and attempted , in further imitation of the French Jacobins , to fix the name of " Aristocrats " upon the Federalists . But as the people of the New England States were confessedly the most democratic , and those of Virginia and the other Antifederal States of the South undeniably the most aristocratic , portions of the union , this attempt failed . Their next effort was to render the name of Federalist odious , and in this they succeeded . But the means to which they had recourse would have proved quite insufficient , had they not been aided by a division among the Federalists themselves . Some of the remarks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period are so just and striking , that we will place them before our readers . " The period during which the Federalists held the ascendency in the administration of the national government was one of no ordinary trial . The system itself was a novelty , founded in the midst of dissentient opinions , and established in the face of power . // ful opposition ; its parts were to be adjusted and arranged , its proper attributes and limits settled and defined , the relations of the individual members with the whole to be harmonized , and the great and complicated machine to be set in motion . Besides the necessity of thus creating from a mass of disorganized materia1s* the framework of society itself , and of establishing the details of its functions ; of devsing a system of finance , by which , from a family of states hitherto unused to any general and common system , revenues should be raised , bearing equally upon all , revenues capable of meeting debts of extraordinary magnitude for a people of limited numbers , whose resources had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war ; of adopting plans of state policy under novel circumstances and relations , expansive as the growth of the nation , and to be permanent as its existence ; of embodying laws ; of rebuilding commerce from its wrecks , and calling forth arts and manufactures where they had been unknown ; there were other obstacles in their path . Almost coeval with its birth commenced a war , which , in extent , magnitude , and objects , was the most gigantic in the history of bloodshed . Institutions hoary with age and venerable from their sanctity ; empires which had seemed as permanent as the existence of man ; despotisms whose iron grasp had for centuries stifled the very breathings of liberty ; laws , and usages stronger than laws , which for good or evil had moulded men after their own fashion ; priestcrafts and castes , obeyed by prescription , were at once swept away before the whirlwind of revolution . The effects of this convulsion had not been confined to the shores of Europe or the east ; they had extended to America also . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself against the formation of a government was continued against its operation . It was with mutiny in the crew that the Federalists had to steer the ship of state through the dangers of an unexplored ocean , in this the most tremendous storm which ever devastated the civilized world . Every measure which might tend to a development of the power of the general government was resisted . Every embarrassment was thrown in the way of its action . The impatience which naturally arises from new burdens was taken advantage of , though their object was to pay the price of freedom itself . Sedition was stirred up to resist ' them . Falsehood and misrepresentation were employed ; distrust excited against tried and firm patriots . The personal popularity of demagogues was used to ruin men whose purity would not permit them to court the passions of the multitude . Alien influence was sought out to thwart or to govern the citizen . The national feeling in favor of republicanism , on the one hand , and // national detestation of monarchy , on the other , were invoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace of their own to the interests or the ambition of a foreign land ; the dread of war with France was held up as a bugbear to the timid , the fear of subjection to Britain as a spectre to the patriot . Public gratitude and popular hatred were alike aroused and called to aid . " There was undoubtedly an exciting influence , which rendered the attacks of the opposition upon the government more potent than they otherwise might have been , arising from the character of the people themselves . The sagacity of the Anti-federal leaders fully saw and appreciated the fact so truly expressed by Mr. Cabot , that the sentiments of the people were essentially democratic , the constitution of the government was only republican . ' The distinction was a vital one . There existed undoubtedly then , as perhaps to a more general though not more aggravated degree there exists now , a disposition to set up popular will above the laws made by the representatives of the people , to create as it were a law paramount to the fundamental laws of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluctuating and excited passions , and whose being is alike without authority or responsibility . This ultra-democratic tendency had been firmly and consistently resisted by the Federal party ; it had been as sedulously cultivated by their enemies . It was the fulcrum upon which rested the lever which was to overthrow the original system of American policy . " The ground on which the opposition succeeded in rutting the contest was undoubtedly the strongest they could have taken . There is that in the character of the democratic theory which recommends it to the imagination of many classes . Not the poorer class alone , who expect in its prevalence greater advantages to themselves , or at least greater control over the rich , - not the demagogue only , who hopes in its success the gratification of a selfish ambition , - but men of a higher order , both of intellect and of character , rank among its disciples . The visionary , who looks for truth in abstractions instead of experience ,  - -  the philanthropist , dreaming of the perfections of his race , - often , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the few , seeking a refuge for liberty in an opposite and as dangerous extreme ; are its advocates and adherents . " - Vol. it. , pp. 503- 507 . For obvious reasons , we can not trace the history of those dissensions in the administration party which did more than the malice of their opponents to ruin the Federalist cause . // Mr. Adams succeeded to the presidency , but did not command in full measure the esteem and confidence of the very persons who had elected him . He soon found that the opinions of Hamilton had more weight with them than his own , and that even the members of his own cabinet , whom he had continued in office after Washington 's resignation , sought counsel and direction from this master-spirit of the Federalist party . Prompt , decided , and even imperious in disposition , he resolved to be the sole guide of the policy of his own administration , or at any rate to choose his own counsellors . The breach between him and Hamilton grew wider every day , and their mutual jealousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adherents . The quarrel came at last to a head , through a determination which the president formed , early in 1799 , without consulting the heads of department , or even intimating his intention to them , to send a third embassy to France , in the hope of conciliating that power , and averting the danger of an open war between the two countries , which had long seemed irnminent . Most of the Federalists viewed this step with extreme disapprobation , considering it as ill-timed and humiliating to the United States , after the gross contumely and contemptuous disregard of the laws of nations with which the French Directory bad received the two preceding embassies . They believed that no honorable peace could be made with France under its feeble and distracted government , and that any treaty which might be framed would only give serious umbrage to Great Britain , expose our growing commerce to new and more serious hazards , and open the way for a wider diffusion of French Jacobinical principles in America . Three members of the cabinet , at least , Pickering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unwise . Among a large and influential portion of the Federalists , with Hamilton at their head , it was so strongly condemned , that every one foresaw at the time that there could be no zealous and united effort of the party in the ensuing election of a president . Mr. Adams was again nominated , but all the forces could not be rallied to his support . The following remarks of Mr. Gibbs , upon a great loss which the country suffered at this time , seem to be perfectly true and very happily expressed . " At this moment WASHINGTON died . At no period of his long // and useful life had the weight of his name and character been more wanted ; never could his loss have been a greater public affliction . While he remained , the Federalists knew that they had yet a rallying-point round which they could gather ; a leader whose firmness was unshaken , and upon whose wisdom they could always implicitly rely . His death hushed for a moment even the violence of the political storm , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of state had parted its fastenings . Those who have followed the early history of this country must have seen , and seen with pain , how much of its safety , how much of its virtue , depended upon the influence of a single name , on the popularity of a single individual . Disguise it as we may , the fate of the constitutional government would have been more than doubtful , had its infancy been committed to the care of another ; and there is too much reason to believe , that , even after his immediate guardianship had ceased , his earlier death would have involved its destruction also . " - Vol. ii. , p. 10 . Subsequent events contributed nothing to heal these internal wounds of the party . v1 ? he president refused to make Hamilton general-in-chief of the army after the death of Washington , to whom he had been second in command . Two of the recusant secretaries were dismissed from office , and Wolcott , the only remaining one , soon afterwards resigned . The Federalists still had a majority in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of union in their ranks , and a feeling of depression generally prevailed . Hamilton endeavoured to restore harmony by advising the party to give an equal vote to their second candidate , General Piackney , and thus allow the House of Representatives to choose between him and Mr. Adams . With this view , he prepared , and printed for private circulation , his celebrated " Letter concerning the Public Conduct and Character of John Adams . " A copy of this pamphlet was surreptitiously obtained and made public , and the breach became wider than ever . The natural result followed this open dissension in the party at such a ci-itical moment . Jefferson and Burr were elected over Adams and Pinckney ; but these two had an equal number of votes , and it remained for the Representatives to decide between them . The Federalists then committed their last blunder by strenuously attempting , in opposition to the urgent advice of Hamilton , to elect Burr instead of Jefferson to the office of president . They failed , and the reins of power fell from their hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great party which framed , adopted , and carried into effect the constitution of this country , which had Washington for its head , and the fathers of the Revolution for its counsellors , has become , in the mouths of a great part of the people of the United States , a byword and a reproach . It has heen dead for a quarter of a century , but the time has not yet arrived for writing its epitaph . The most interesting and valuable portion of Mr. Gibbs 's work is the correspondence of which it principally consists . Besides the letters of Wolcott himself , it comprises those addressed to him hy Washington , Adams , Hamilton , Cabot , Ames , Ellsworth , King , Pickering , McHenry , Trumbull , Goodhue , Hillhouse , Sedgwick , Goodrich , and other conspicuous members of the Federal party , during the period of its ascendency , and its decline and fall . The most attractive , perhaps , is the correspondence between Mr. Wolcott and his father , and other members of his family ; and none certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light than his letters to his wife . Upon reviewing the whole correspondence , the reader will not fail to remark , what might indeed have been predicted from the characters of the men , that it tends to exalt them in public opinion as much as the publication of Mr. Jefferson 's letters has exposed and degraded him . We confess we were nearly as much surprised as gratified to find in the letters of Hamilton so full a refutation of the calumnies and vituperation of which that great man was so frequently the object . We regret that our limits forbid our transcribing several of these in extenso , - more especially as they give so favorable an impression of the wisdomn and honesty of his career as a statesman , and of the amiability and disinterestedness of his character as a man . He it was whom the leaders of the opposite party accused of devotion to Great Britain , of hostility to France , and of attachment to monarchical principles . Yet when the British government , while the ratification of Mr. Jay 's treaty was pending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying provisions into France , Hamilton endeavoured to prevent the ratification until the order was rescinded ; and even if the order should be rescinded , he recommended that a remonstrance should accompany it , as a protest against the principle assumed in the order . " I incline very much to the opinion that this will be the proper // course of conduct in reference to the order to seize our vessels with provisions , viz. : to send to our agent the treaty ratified , as advised by the Senate , with this instruction , - that , if the order for seizing provisions is in force when he receives it , he is to inform the British minister that he has the treaty ratified , but that he is instructed not to exchange the ratification till that order is rescinded , since the United States can not even give an implied sanction to the principle . At the same time a remonstrance ought togo from this country , well considered and well digested , even to a word , to be delivered against the principle of the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1 . That in fact we are tcio much interested in the exemption of provisions from seizure to give even an implied sanction to the contrary pretension. " 2 . That the exchange of ratifications , pending such an order , would give color to an abusive construction of the eighteenth article of the treaty , as though it admitted of the seizure of provisions . " 3 . That this would give cause of umbrage to France , because it would be more than merely to refrain from resisting by force an innovation injurious to her , but it would be to give a sanction to it in the midst of a war . " 4 . It would be thus construed in our country , and would destroy confidence in the government . " 5 . It would be scarcely reputable to a nation to conclude a treaty with a power to heal past controversies , at the very moment of a new and existing violation of its rights . Yours truly , A. HAMILTON . " If an order had existed and has been rescinded , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratifications , as a protest against the principle , &amp;c. " - Vol . I. , pp. 223 , 224 . When the English minister complained of an article in one of our Indian treaties , as repugnant to certain stipulations entered into by the Indians with his government respecting their trade , Hamilton declared the ministry of Great Britain to be " as great fools as our Jacobins. " * When the British men-ofwar began impressing our seamen , Hamilton expressed to the Federal government his hopes that " a very serious remonstrance had long since gone against the wanton " practice ; and added , that in his opinion it would " be an error to be too tame with that overbearing cabinet . " t On this subject , * Vol . I. , p. 329. 15* t Ibid. , p. 330. // indeed , it is evident that he felt more keenly than his accusers ; for when the French envoy , Adet , reproached our government for submitting to the searching of our vessels by British cruisers for seamen , and his interference had been repelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he did not think " the position assumed by Mr. Pickering true , - that France had no right to interfere . I am of opinion , that , whenever a neutral power suffers liberties to be taken with it by a belligerent one , which turn to the detriment of the other belligerent party , as the acquiring strength by impressing seamen , there is good ground of inquiry , demanding candid explanation . " * When , under the administration of the elder Adams , the aggressions of France upon our commerce had induced the president , with a view of recommending retaliatory measures , to convene Congress at an extraordinary session , Hamilton , in his celebrated letter on the conduct of Mr. Adams , proves , by appealing to his own conduct at the time , in reference to our difficulties with France , that he was more anxious to put an end to them than any member of the administration . He states , that , " after the rejection of Mr. Pickering by the government of France , immediately after the instalment of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken , I urged a member of Congress , t then high in the confidence of the president , to propose to him the immediate appointment of three commissioners , of whom Mr. Jefferson or Mr. Madison should be one , to make another attempt to negotiate . " 4 And in corroboration of this , we find he expresses to Wolcott his sentiments on this subject at large . " Every one who can properly appreciate the situation of our affairs at this moment , in all the extent of po , ssible circumstances , must be extremely anxious for a course of conduct in our government which xviii unite the utmost prudence with energy . It has been a considerable time my wish that a commission extraordinary should be constituted to go to France , to explain , demand , negotiate , &amp;c . I was particularly anxious that the first measure of the present president 's administration should have been that , but it has not happened . I now continue to wish earnestly that * Vol. 1 .. p. 393 . Uriah Tracy , a Senator from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the margin is written , " Madison , Pinckney , Cabot. " // the same measure may go into effect , and that the meeting of the Senate may be accelerated for that purpose . Without opening a new channel of negotiation , it seems to me the door of accommodation is shut , and rupture will follow , if not prevented by a general peace . Who , indeed , can be certain that a general pacification of Europe may not leave us alone to receive the law from France ? Will it be wise to omit any thing to parry , if possible , these great risks ? Perhaps the Directory have declared that they will not receive a minister till their grievances shall have been redressed ! This can hardly mean more than that they will not receive a residing minister . It can not mean that they will not hear an extraordinary messenger , who may even be sent to know what will satisfy . Suppose they do . It will still be well to convince the people that the government has done all in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the enemies of the government call for the measure . To me this is a very strong reason for pursuing it . It will meet them on their own ground , and disarm them of the plea that something has been omitted . " 1 ought , my good friend , to apprise you , for you may learn it from no other , that a suspicion begins to dawn among the friends of the government that the actual administration ( ministers ) is not averse from war with France . How very important to obviate this ! " - Vol. i. , pp. 484 , 485 . In a subsequent letter , he says , - " We ought to do every thing to avoid rupture without unworthy sacrifices , and to keep in view the primary object , union at home . No measure can tend more to this than an extraordinary mission . And it is certain , that , to fulfil these ends , it ought to embrace a character in whom France and the opposition have full credit . " He was nevertheless " clearly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a manly tone , and that Congress should adopt vigorous defensive measures . " * Again , after the meeting of Congress , he observes of the incipient measures , - " I like very well the course of Executive conduct in regard to the controversy with France , and I like the answer of the Senate to the president 's speech ; but I confess I have not been well satisfied with the answer reported to the House . It contains too many hard expressions ; and hard words are very rarely useful in public proceedings . Mr. Jay and other friends here New York have been struck in the same manner with myself . " t // These letters , and the sentiments of the writer expressed in them , were doubtless unknown to the leaders of the opposition . That Mr. Jefferson and his satellites should have charged him with little short of a treasonable attachment to Great Britain , and , as a consequence of it , with an inveterate hostility to France , is therefore not to be wondered at ; we remember the tactics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the succeeding year , when the seditious conduct of certain partisans of the opposition was brought by the president to the notice of Congress , who were induced to legislate against it , we find Hamilton , the imputed advocate of arbitrary power , declaring that there were provisions in the bill , which , according to a cursory view , appeared to be highly exceptionable , and such as more than any thing else might endanger civil war .

" The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Washington 's administration , of considering the governor of each State as the first general of the militia , and its immediate organ in acting upon the militia , was wisely considered , and in my opinion wisely adopted , and well to be adhered to . " * But enough ; these instances are sufficient for our purpose , and , one would suppose , sufficient to have silenced his accusers for ever . Their malice pursued him to the grave and although the person by whom he met his death ceased to utter these slanders for a season , they were afterwards revived in the miserable party controversies of a later day . Is it too much to hope that they now may be permitted to sleep for ever ? When the presidential election of 1800 had resulted in an // equal vote for Jefferson and Burr , the personal interference and influence of Hamilton , it is well known , were exerted on the side of the former , and there can no longer remain a doubt , that they settled the question in his favor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a single eye to what he deemed the honor and welfare of his country , regardless of his own private interests , predilections , or enmities , or those of his friends . From the moment of his meeting Mr. Jefferson in the cabinet of General Washington , the latte*had** , , , * . been compelled to feel , and eventually to yield to , the superiority of his rival , towards whom he thenceforward cherished a bitter personal as well as political animosity . Hamilton , on his part , did not take pains to conceal his repugnance to the principles and character of Jefferson . He looked upon him as a visionary , but dangerous , theorist in morals and politics , as a dabbler in literature and science , and a hypocrite in every thing but religion , which , as a disciple of the school of Voltaire , he had affected to ridicule , with the malice , but not the wit , of his master . The two men were , in fact , as much opposed to each other in their private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the one brooded in secret over his resentments , while the other , with the frankness of a soldier , as well as the native candor of the man , on all proper occasions avowed his sentiments , without any other restraints than those imposed by delicacy and honor . He carried , indeed , his heart in his hand , and it is not surprising that foul birds should have pecked at it . His character , however , has survived the calumnies of his enemies , many of whom professed to have buried their resentment in his untimely grave ; but whether actuated by sincere veneration of the deceased , or by hostility to his murderer , is known only to the searcher of all hearts . But as the malicious attacks of his enemies could make no impression injurious to the character of Hamilton , so neither could their eulogies add one jot or tittle to his fame . So rich a combination of excellence , both of head and heart , of intellectual , moral , and social qualities , of various talents and knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity and public virtue , has seldom appeared in any age or country . True it is , he had his faults , for he was a man ; hut considered as a statesman and a patriot , we ne'er shall look upon his like again . // Contrasted with Burr , his character appears in a somewhat different , hut still more striking and favorable , light . Their relative position and feelings were widely different from those of Hamilton and Jefferson . Although , from dislike or suspicion of Burr , Hamilton had always avoided an intimacy with him , they had been fellow-soldiers in the Revolution , and fellow-citizens both before and afterwards . They were members of the same profession , and practised for many yeais at the same bar . In their mutual intercourse , they had always treated each other with the courtesy of gentlemen ; nor were they ever known to have a personal difference before that leading to the fatal rencontre between them . And what was the origin of that lamentable catastrophe , but the preference given to Jefferson by Hamilton in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one whom he knew to be his enemy , over one whom he regarded merely as a political opponent , and did not suspect of personal ill-will towards him ? Yet , when the question between Burr and Jefferson was pending in Congress , Hamilton interfered zealously and openly in favor of the latter , and unquestionably determined the choice of the House of Representatives . To this interference Jefferson owed his election , Hamilton his death ; and through this singular fatality was the life of this great and good man sacrificed by his magnanimity towards an inveterate enemy , and by a devotion to the welfare of his country superior to all private and personal impulses of interest or passion .

Where there is ample room and range for conjecture , it most naturally takes a wide scope , - as water , that is not confined to a channel , spreads out broadly , and is often shallow in proportion . No topic connected with the history of man is less circumscribed ; it is almost a tabula rasa ; scarcely a fence or a bound is seen to check the range of the speculations we have alluded to . They can expand at will , and most of them have taken advantage of this unbounded latitude . The truth is , there is a great gulf between the post-diluvian main stock of mankind and this branch found in the western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than four centuries , when we stand on its brink . A few vague traditions , like slender promontories , shoot forward into the shadows beyond . Those who move out on them , in the hope of reaching the other side , are much like the insect which crawls to the tip of a slender blade of grass growing on the xvestern shore of the Southern Pacific , as if in hopes of reaching the Asiatic shore . On the other hand , if we take our stand among the descendants of Shem , Ham , and Japhet , we are only told that they were scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth . This declaration must be received in all its length and breadth ; still , the gulf is not narrowed one tittle . We can only rest in the conviction , that there are ways past our finding out , and that the way whereby the red men came is one of those ways . We can not carry forward the chain one link . We can trace it back four hundred years , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thus sundered no mati can expect to join together . // But though we abstain from presumptuous and bootless speculations of this kind , still there is much to be done with respect to the aborigines , which is clearly within our power . We have dispossessed them , so far as our convenience has urged us , of their domains . Their history has fallen into our hands ; it is our duty , not so much to them as to the world , to preserve it . The Indians will find little compensation for such wrongs as they have suffered in the record that faithfully perpetuates their remembrance . The debt is not due to them ; they do not claim it . They looked little to the past , and reckon as little upon the future . A cloud was constantly behind tl*e** , that shut out that I ) ast from view ; and no light seemed to be before them . But they have left vestiges which we are expected to gather up . They are subjects of profound interest , as they enable us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderfully apart from the rest of mankind . Among those who have been busy in this antiquarian work , few will hereafter be more prominent than Mr. Schoolcraft , whose name is prefixed to the volume before us . We do not hesitate to say , that he has done more to bring it to profitable issues than any other man . Others may have spent more time among the Indians ; we do not count time in this case as any thing , unless it has been spent with zeal , intelligence , and good advantages . Trttders have passed their lives among them , become flesh of their flesh , and had opportunities of observing them under the most familiar aspects . But such men are proof that one may have eyes , and see not , and understandings , yet understand not . They generally divide the aborigines into two classes , - those who hunt , and those who do not ; just as they divide all animals into two tribes , - those which are fur-bearing , and those which are not . This is pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest and the beasts of the forest . Mr. Schoolcraft , on the contrary , observed with the eye of a philosopher . He has regarded the Indians as a study in all their phases , and has felt that it was only by continued and close observation that he could form any safe opinions of their character and manners . It is not every man that walks through a forest , who comprehends all its botanical distinctions ; probably not one in a thousand understands any of them . It is so , though not in the same degree , that observations on // the Indians may be useful or worthless . These persons may have seen only so many trees ; they are likely to have seen only so many men and women . The remarks of such men , in either case , have about the same value . Mr. Schoolcraft began his career of observation as a traveller among the Indian tribes . His early association with General Cass , in his official visits to them , gave him much opportunity for glances at their character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so considered by himself in after years , however he may have been satisfied with them at the time . In fact , travellers should distrust themselves , and be distrusted by all their readers , if they go one Jot beyond the mere facts which fall under their eyes . Even more than that should be required . When the record of a thermometer is given , its position as to exposure and height is also noted ; otherwise , little or no confidence is felt in the truth of the record . A traveller should state his point of view , and the duration of that view . When he merely passes through a place , taking a meal or two and a sleep , he is not authorized to go much beyond the board and bed of that place . He may comment on the cooking he meets with , and on the comforts or annoyances of his bed . Thus far he may go , not much farth&amp; . His sketches should be light and shadowy ; a dot and a line will generally fulfil all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travellers among the Indians were betrayed into the use of far more elaborate accounts , by the belief that none would be able to detect their exaggerations . At that early day , there might be a hope of impunity . But when Mr. Schoolcraft made his several journeys through the Northwest , standards had been set for the measurement of forest life . Had Baron La Hontan travelled one hundred years later , he would have been one hundred times more particular in his descriptions . He spread out rivers to ten times their proper width , and lifted up falls to more than four times their true . height . All travellers should keep an itinerary , as they probably do . The truth , as it appeared at the time , is no doubt then set down , being the fresh impression of actual observation . Such itineraries , when they happen to meet the public eye , are generally very acceptable and much prized . No distrust is felt about their genuineness . It would be politic in those who , from habit or more leisure // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give it some marks of haste , instead of removing them , with so much care , before publication . If they should go direct to the printer 's from their last stage , before they change their dress , and with all the soil of journeying upon them , they would be wise . I'he tan on their cheeks , and their coats out at the elbows , or covered up by a hunting-shirt , would be their best prefaces . While with this aspect , they are lions ; as soon as they change their dress , shave , and crop , they are confounded with the ordinary crowd . So it is with their itineraries ; they should come forth much as they went in , with no engrafting and little pruning . Ordinarily , the book of travels that comes out of the publisher 's hands is as unlike the notes which came out of the valise at the end of the journey , as a specimen of lead ore is unlike the pewter dish into which it may have subsequently been converted . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his books of travels among the Indians as mere highway and by-way sketches . These hasty glances , however , led him to desire further and better opportunities of investigating their condition , character , and history . He had seen their haunts , and many of their customs , but only in shreds and patches . Even his cursory views had convinced him that they were a peculiar people , and in no one thing more so than in their incommunicative deportment before strangers . The appearance of such persons among them was a signal for assuming an impassive and inexpressive aspect , that marked them , for the time being , as children of the mist . They drew in their prominent characteristics , like a tortoise drawing itself within its shell . Little is seen , and even that indistinctly . Inferences drawn from such appearances would be like the child 's opinion of a tortoise in such a state , looking more like a quoit than an animal , as long as the observer stands over it . Mr. Schoolcraft sought a position which would enable him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . He was for years among them , and became associated with them in such a way , that , at last , he saw them as they see each other . Their character and customs were gradually unfolded to his view through the course of an entire generation . And during all that lengthened period , his great object was to study them with a patient , philosophical , and liberal spirit , that he might gather // up materials for future use . These materials have been collected in his hands to a rare and valuable amount . We call them rare and valuable , because they all have the stamp of genuineness , and will hereafter aid more in constructing a monument to a perishing race of human beings , than any other that are in the white man 's possession . Some of them have been spread before the public eye ; but much , we believe , yet remains behind . There has not been an encouragement to bring them forth . This is no reproach to the public , which has its tastes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schoolcraft may not always have adopted the best means of propitiating those tastes . The titles he has used have not always heen expressive of his subjects . His " Algic Researches , " which will , at some future day , be regarded as the broadest and clearest mirror of the red man 's intellect that has ever been set up before the public eye , suggested nothing as to the bearing or purport of the volumes . The title is hardly equal to the old sign , " Inquire within . " And " Oneota " called for as much explanation . A novel may play bopeep with its reader in this way , as such readers generally delight to be puzzled . But all Mr. Schoolcraft 's works have deserved a right name . It is now some few years since Mr. Schoolcraft withdrew from his position in the Northwest , and became a resident of the State of New York . His inclinations have still led him to turn his attention to his favorite subject , and the volume before us shows what task , most intimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State of New York , during the year 1845 , passed a law which required a census to he taken of the Indians residing upon several of the reservations in the State , and inquiries to be made into their condition , advancement in civilization , and the like . Mr. Schoolcraft was appointed one of the agents for this duty , and made his report to the State government in October of the same year . The legislature ordered the document to be printed in such numbers as insured that degree of circulation through the community which suited a work of no pretensions to popularity . It should have a place in all public libraries , and would not be misplaced in such private libraries as propose to furnish sources of information relative to the aborigines of our country . New York has performed a most acceptable work in this // respect . She has long had within her borders the remnants of an Indian confederacy , which , in the early days of our country , stood predominant far and wide ; and to her credit be it spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true , the possessions of these remnants have been brought down to a narrow span . Their once broad domains , measured by latitudes and longitudes , have been reduced to a few reservations which are hardly measured by miles . But these dwindled spots are still theirs . individuals and companies have often tried to erase these few honorable exceptions from the map of the State . The Indians , however , have clung to the soil , and it is to be hoped that they will be permitted to continue there , until the experiment be fully made , whether the influences of a contiguous white population are conservative or ruinous to the red man . New York presents almost the only opportunity for this experiment . The Indians , as tribes , have been expelled from all the other States east of the Mississippi . Their lands have been purchased , and they have gone over the great river , and are now reëstablished nearly under the shadows of the Rocky Mountains . What will be the result of this vast transfer is yet to be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , segregated and hedged in ; though not civilized , yet feeling some of the influences of civilization , particularly its restraints . They were like so many wild buffaloes fenced round after the manner of domestic cattle ; wild still , but barred from that immense herding which gives them the blind and overwhelming power of an avalanche . Now , these fractions are added up into one formidable sum on the borders of the trans-Mississippi States . Indian tribes are mostly Ishmaclites with respect to each other . At present , this is the security of these States . They are safe , while the Indians have their hands against each other . As long as the barbarians contended among themselves , Rome was not molested . We have conducted tribe after tribe over the Mississippi ; all have been loath to go , but were uprooted , even from the least to the greatest . rVhe Indian , by his residence on any spot , scarcely changes a feature of nature ; and when he is driven to a new haunt , he leaves no memorial behind ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons . And yet , his attachment to // those haunts appears to be the strongest of all local affections . It is not , then , the broad and deep foundation , nor the lofty structure , that most endears a place to the human heart . riThe inhabitants of cities and cultivated fields may be drawn forth to new places , which will soon assume many of the features of the old . Skill , industry , and taste soon restore all , or nearly all , that had been lost . Not so with the dwellers in tents ; their hill-sides , their valleys , their streams , when once left behind , are left for ever . Nature does not repeat herself like art ; she has no fac-similes , few resemblances . The New York Indians have been permitted to remain where the white man found them , and they present the most interesting and satisfactory example of the change that may be wrought in the nomadic and savage character by the influences of contiguous civilization . It was exceedingly desirable that the progress and extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done only by the State atithority ; cursory and occasional views , such as individuals could take , would be of little advantage . It is evident , from the obstacles that Mr. Schoolcraft encountered , that none could have succeeded but an authorized and prudent agent of the State . It was natural that the Indians should regard with disapprobation or suspicion this attempt to number their tribes . They could not comprehend its objects , unless those objects were such as threatened their independence or welfare . The truth could not be stated to them , that their condition was a subject of curiosity , of philanthropic speculation ; that it was desirable to know how far they had departed from the customs of their fathers , and were shading off from their strong relief into the general complexion around them . Mr. Schoolcraft says , - " If I might judge from the scope of remarks made both in and out of council , they regarded it the census as an introduction of a Saxon feature into their institutions , which , like a lever , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its ultimate effects , to uplift and overturn them . " They objected to the census , but still more , says our author , to the scrutiny " which the act called for into their agricultural products , and the results of their industry . " We may well suppose this . rjheir numbers might be necessary to determine the distribution of pensions , &amp;c. ; but an account of their grain , // cattle , and other property was an unprecedented thing , and seemed only a preliminary to taxation . It required , no doubt , much prudence and familiarity with the Indian character to get over or around their objections . Mr. Schoolcraft was likely to be well qualified for this delicate task ; and it would appear by the result , that he was able to perform it without leaving any serious dissatisfaction behind . The census in one respect is important . We desire to know the extent of their population , that we may compare it with their numerical strength when the white man first came in contact with them , and particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceftil condition . We may thus judge whether that condition has been favorable or unfavorable to their increase . This is a very interesting question . It is often said that the red man fades under the light of civilization , and many facts have favored this assertion . The Indian , as a savage , has not thrived with the white man . His forests are cleared up , and his game destroyed or dispersed . He must change his habits , or starve . Many tribes appear to have preferred the latter course ; the New York Indians have been more wise , or more yielding . They have undergone this change ; they have ceased to be hunters , and have become agriculturists . Have they lost by the transformation ? Mr. Schoolcraft 's Report will answer this interesting question more satisfactorily than it has yet been answered . The number of these Indians was not accurately ascertained at former periods ; the statements made were likely to be exaggerated . Even admitting that these reports were true , still the conclusion is , that the Iroquois are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author , they are " now on the increase . " Such a conclusion , yell warranted , as this appears to be , must be gratifying to every benevolent mind . We have cut down all the forests of the aborigines , and the fur-bearing anin ) als have fled as their haunts have been removed . These animals could not change their habits ; the sun , let in upon their ranges , seemed to lick them up with the moisture that had softened these solitudes under their stealthy step for ages . It was feared that the wild man was as unchangeable as the wild animal , - that he , too , would pass away with the shadows of the forest . This Report shows that he has a more accommodating spirit than we formerly assigned to him . // The New York Indian has conformed to his altered circumstances . He has learned to live by the sweat of his brow , and has thus submitted to the great decree that was stamped on the destiny of man at the beginning . This is the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , he begins a new existence , or rather , he begins to insure a continued existence . A square mile of the untouched forest is not more unlike a cultivated farm , than the roving savage is unlike the tiller of the earth . Nature in her rough state is not intended to sustain a large people ; she gives no grains , and has no cattle . Her spontaneous productions , her maize , her potatoes , are little or nothing without the hand of man . These two great articles of human food had their origin in this hemisphere . They came into use after the discovery by Columbus , and this use is among the grand consequences of that discovery . Still , the traces of them in the wild state are hardly discernible ; the Indians knew them , but did not place much reliance on them as food . Mr. Schoolcraft 's report of the agricultural products of the Iroquois is most encouraging . The total population of the tribes is somewhat under four thousand ; the quantity of cultivated land occupied by then in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stop to inquire how this compares with the white population in this respect . The proportion may fall far below , and still be high enough to show that these Indians till land sufficient to give bread to themselves and fodder to their cattle . When this point is gained , they are safe . It is hardly possible for them to retrograde from it , and it is probable they will continue to advance . Hand in hand with their progress in agriculture is seen the increase in the number of their domestic animals . These animals , excepting the dog , are never seen with the savage they can not subsist in the forest . From the beginning , the gros et menu betail have consorted with the shepherd and the tiller of the ground ; they have hung around the tentopening and the threshold , yielding their necks to the yoke , their fleeces for raiment , their milk for food , their bodies for the sacrifice . They have lain down and risen up among the human race with household familiarity . The line between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creation . It has never been effaced ; and when man took to the forest and the chase , the cattle after their kind did not follow him . // The New York Indians have two thousand two hundred and seventy-five head of neat cattle , nearly one third of them being milch-cows . The butter made is in proportion , being over twenty thousand pounds yearly . The number of their horses , sheep , and hogs is equally encouraging . They have , also , according to this Report , nearly seven thousand fruittrees . These the Indians had in earlier days , while still in the savage state ; they must have scattered the seed soon after the white men had bearing trees . There may have been no design in it ; the apples they brought back from their visits to the white settlements , when eaten , and the cores cast into the bushes around , may have sprung up unnoticed until they began to hear fruit . General Sullivan , when he made his expedition against the Iroquois during the Revolutionary war , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he cut them down to the ground . This was an act of questionable propriety . It is allowable , under such circumstances , to devastate all crops , to raze habitations , to measure the destruction by the measure of that of which it is in retaliation . The Indians had been unsparing in their warfare ; it was intended to render their haunts on our frontier as untenable as possible . Whether this was effected in any degree by the destruction of orchards may be doubted . The apple was a luxury , not a support ; all other means of living having been removed , the apple-trees would have been counted as nothing . We have looked over the tables of this Report with much gratification ; they furnish proofs of the meliorated condition of the Indians that can not be gainsaid . It is true , they apply only to a few small tribes , which stand apart from the rest of their race . They are under influences which other tribes do not feel , or feel only so remotely as not to be benefited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving , and have all the ordinary chances of continuance as a people , we may regret that they alone are so ; that most of the other red men are deteriorating , with those chances constantly diminishing . Nevertheless , we have before us one instance that seems to contradict the general rule ; that convinces us that the existence , in the same community , of the two races , the white and the red men , is compatible . This conviction may lead to such general policy as will insure a similar destiny to other tribes . We can not bring those back which have been trans26 * // planted . The tree , once taken up , must be cherished where it has been set down again . In our guardian kindness , we have endeavoured to fence round the Indians , in their new habitations , against the white man . Prohibitions and penalties have been set up , which , like scarecrows , do not scare any thing . The country is as open as the face of the heavens ; it is almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . The only effect , probably , of these restrictive laws is to keep out honest men . Men go into the Indian country as they please , and do what they please when there , only taking care not to offend the Indians themselves . If all restrictions were taken off , more men might not go in , but they would be of a different description . Good men would , at least , be mixed up with the bad . Sieves ordinarily let through the flour , and hold hack the bran ; these laws operate like sieves reversed ; the bran passes through , leaving the better part behind . As the Indians can not be brought back to the white man , we would say , then let the white man go to them . Let them go in as they list , mix up with and teach them . It has been apprehended that the effect of such a freedom of intercourse would be bad . Possibly it would ; but the probability is the other way . The present system does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is sufficient not only to justify , but to call for , a change . If we preserve the Indians on the other side of the Mississippi as Indians , that is , if we shut out from them all the influences of civilization , they will either fall upon their own weapons , or upon ours . They will war with each other , until at last they may be led to war against us . In either case they bleed , and become exhausted ; and in one case , they are probably exterminated . To avert this double evil , they must be assimilated with us as the New York Indians are now assimilated . Such an assimilation will never be effected by present causes , which mostly work the other way ; others must therefore be put in operation . We can think of none so likely to be powerful and effective as an open and lawful intercourse with them . It is open enough now ; let it also be lawful . In this way , the Western Indians may gradually become like the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , perhaps , be saved . Mr. Schoolcraft bestows some attention , in his Report , // upon the history of the Iroquois . That part of it which is subsequent to the coming of the whites is sufficiently well known . Their preceding history is involved in shadows , and is nothing but tradition , having all the indistinctness of objects seen through such a medium . 1* ' 1r . Schoolcraft regards these traditions as worthy of record . They are so , particularly when given in their indian shape . This shape is generally so uncouth and distorted as to be thought to require tnodification . Such attempts may serve to render them more symmetrical , but they render them less valuable in the same proportion . Fossils are valued only while preserving the look they wore when disinterred . To polish one of these bones thus dug up , in order to make it more pleasing or less offensive to the eye , would not be a greater blunder than to remove the uncouthness and distortions of these traditions . They should be gathered up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incoherences , extravagances , and savage peculiarities . Thus presented for contemplation , they are a profound study . Mr. Schoolcraft has done more than any other man in this work of collection and preservation . His " Algic Researches " are made up of relics , which will grow in estimation as time advances . They are the best evidences of the inner man of the Indian that we have . His imagination is there exhibited in all its wildness and power ; and these qualities are often displayed in a striking and terrible degree . They refer as distinctly to the great cardinal events of the early world as do the traditions of Greece and Rome , and show whence the Indians came here , though not how , or when , they came . Vast ruptures are seen in the earth 's surface ; the two sides agree , and would fit , could they be brought together ; but when or how those sides were rent asunder , may not be known . Mr. Schoolcraft has also bestowed particular attention upon the " American antiquities , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carvings , and other works found in the Iroquois country , and has given delineations of most of them . These may not be important at this time , but they should be preserved , and made matter of public record . We can not always estimate the value of these remains at the time they are discovered . Our author says , - " There appear to be three eras in the aboriginal occupancy of the continent . " The first era he makes to refer to " the aboriginal // migration from other parts of the globe . " The " vestiges and proofs " under this head he justly deems exceedingly limited ; but he adds , - " The departments of physiology and philology , which have heretofore constituted the principal topics of research , are still attractive , and are by no means a closed field . " He has looked a good deal into these departments , and can form some judgment of their promise in these respects . We are glad to see that he is not discouraged , and hope that his further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have a doubt whether all the attention that has thus far been applied to this object has not been thrown away , unless it be counted something to ascertain that nothing could be done . The races that are supposed to have migrated from the Eastern to tl ) e Western hemisphere were of a character to leave no traces of their footsteps upon the face of nature that would outlive a generation ; we therefore look in vain through all the arctic regions for any physiological trace of these movements . The north gives up nothing ; it is not until we come into the milder regions , that we see any thing to arrest the eye . Mounds , barruws , and other structures there appear , but they suggest nothing Asiatic . They bespeak little , but that little has no more reference to Asia than to Africa . Language has been looked to for an answer . It is true that language speaks , but no American language , we believe , has as yet been made to utter an intelligible Asiatic phrase . Points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove no identity . As well might a Roman nose , when found among us , prove that ive came from Romulus . Such accidental resemblances may probably be found between nearly all languages ; some of the Indian and African languages may thus far agree . If this agreement Would not be an argument in favor of identity , in spite of the woolly head and the jet complexion , it would be none if these physical characteristics were out of the way . Such resemblances have been found between some of the Indian dialects and the Hebrew , and theorists have thence inferred that the " lost tribes of Israel " have been found in this hemisphere . Such theorists have the accommodating vision of Polonius . Unwritten languages are changeable , so as to have no fixed form . The dialects of America may well serve as // dews to local migrations , particularly those of a recent date ; such dews have been found , and have led to many plausible conjectures as to affinities . But when we attempt to run back with a language to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertainty and obscurity . An effort to trace back the genealogy of the first wolf we meet with in our forests to the shaggy nurse of Rome 's founders would hardly be more hopeless and bootless . But this applies to words ; there may be intellectual impressions that endure with time , and survive all changes of place . Such are some of the traditions found among the Indians , and which Mr. Schoolcraft has preserved . They refer to events that affected the whole earth , and the remembrance of which must have been ineffaceably stamped into the minds of all living beings . No people have yet been discovered , who appear to be without this stamp , more or less discernible . The most prominent of this kind of events is the flood . Tradition after tradition is met with among the Indians of this continent which bears this deep stamp . What are we allowed to infer from this ? Not that Indians sprung from any one quarter of the globe ; much less , that they came from the loins of any one people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupendous event , and , wherever they were , there was the remembrance of it . Hence , these traditions only show a connection with the post-diluvians ; they do not give any clew to Mr. Schoolcraft 's first inquiry , as to " the aboriginal migration from other parts of the globe . " F he second head of inquiry is much more promising , referring to the " migrations , wars , affinities , and general ethnological characteristics , prior to the discovery of the continent . " The latter part of this phrase might be stretched back to any age , however remote ; we do not presume , however , that our author intended his inquiries should endeavour to grope beyond all light . The objects of these investigations he states to be , " the grouping of languages , the similarity and dissimilarity of arts , modes of defence , and means of subsistence . " These are tangible objects , and may well employ much time and much talent ; they hold out much encouragement of success . While we would deride all vain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiries like these command our approbation ; we would cheer them on , for they can hardly fail to produce useful results . // The migrations of the tribes in this hemisphere have a deep interest . It is evident that their stay has been permanent nowhere . They have conquered and been conquered , until their history , so far as it can be ascertained , has been that of the clouds ; with their brightness and their darkness , their masses arid their tenuity ; now fixed , as if a part of the firmament ; now speeding from horizon to horizon , as if they were chariots of fire . These changes have left some vestiges behind them . A slight vestige is sufficient , as one hone is often sufficient proof of the existence of a certain animal ; a whole skeleton would not be more . The antiquities of this continent are now extensively known . In the north , there are mounds and specimens of rude sculpture ; in the central regions , there are architectural remains of a much higher order of human labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these antiquities , whether they could have been the work of such inhabitants as are satisfactorily known to have been on this continent , or whether they must have a higher reference . The more elaborate antiquities of the central regions were at first supposed to present the greatest difficulties . Mr. Stephens found many ruined structures which , for a time , suggested a doubt whether they could have been formed by such skill as we know has existed among the aborigines . That doubt is now removed . These structures are massy , but rude ; the sculpture is awkward and clumsy ; and PvIr . Schoolcraft cxbibits in his work a few delineations which would compare advantageously as to symmetry with most of 1'Ir . Catherwood 's . We believe the public mind is now satisfied , that there is nothing in the central regions , which obliges it to go beyond the time of the Spanish conquest to account for the work . The Guatemalian and Yucatanian are said to excel the Mexican structures ; this may be , and not embarrass the question . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with another ; the same skill would achieve much in a freestone country , that could do almost nothing in a granite country . We confess , we find more difficulty in accounting for the manner in which certain porphyritic " stone hatchets , " or " hammers , " occasionally found in the northern mounds , were made , than in accounting for all the structures of Mexico and Central America . These pieces of porphyry , or gre&amp;n // stone , are of the hardest composition ; granite is more easily worked than they . We know that diamond xviii cut diamond ; but it is supposing too much to believe that the In ( lians undertook to fashion these fragments of porphyry into shape by the application of the same stone , or a harder one , if they could find it . It would seem as if nothing but steel , and steel applied with skill , too , could have effected the modification . The boldest theorist has not ventured to give the Indians any help of this kind . Native copper and native iron have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aided them . They would have been even more powerless than the viper 's teeth against the file . If time would have enabled them to finish such a task , the difficulty ivould have been lessened , as an Indian has time and patience enough . It would be consistent with their habits to devote the leisure of months to such a work . But the mo ( lification of porphyry is not within the compass of time or l ) patience . Besides , there is an argument that goes still deeper . Had they the tools thus to work such stone , they would not have needed the stone utensil ; no stone hatchets xvould be made , when steel ones could be had . The Indians have had flint arrow-heads ; these must have taxed their ingenuity and labor in all respects . But there is cleavage in the flint-stone ; xvhile the greenstone is the severest compression of various components . It is almost as different from those components in their ordinary state , as the brick is from the clay of which it was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probably one can never be found which xviii satisfy us . Mr. Schoolcraft has looked much at languages to trace out these bonds of affinity . He has also examined mounds as be remarks* these mounds are the most intelligible witnesses of these affinities . They are everywhere seen ; it is wonderful how they dot and seam the vast Western interior . It is almost useless to inquire for what purpose they were thrown up ; they are so various in form as to baffle all conjecture . No modes of warfare known among the Indians seem to have called for such aids . Mankind , in their barbarous state , have had some uniformity in their warlike habits , their weapons having had some degree of similarity . But we find no xvarraut in history for these remains . It is not , therefore , with a view of untying or cutting this Gordian kno , t , // that we would study these tumuli ; we would look into them for such antiquities as resist the earth 's corrosive power , and bring them forth for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like another already known in a different latitude , one step is gained in the way of affinities ; if the same utensils or weapons are found in both , another step is gained . Indeed , the question of affinity is almost settled ; the same tribe had probably occupied the two grounds , and left distinctive evidences of its change of locality . It is difficult to arrange aboriginal chronology , desirable as it may be . There are traditions that the north and the south have shifted scenes , but wheth* , r the shift was towards or from the equator it is not easy to determine . These mounds , however , though dark oracles , may sooner or later deliver something intelligible ; all they utter should he carefully noted and preserved in this hope . The erection of the structures whose ruins are found in the central parts of America is accounted for with some degree of satisfaction . In a tropical climate , little labor is bestowed upon the shelter of the commonalty . In Egypt , when her pyramids and temples were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nearly the whole people was no doubt concentrated upon these masses ; a despotic government could command such a concentration . This consideration greatly diminishes the surprise at first felt in contemplating these wonders of the world . If the whole labor which any one of our large communities bestows upon its private dwellings were applied to one or two architectural objects , similar wonders would rise in our own land . The governments of the central parts of America appear to have been purely despotic . Their climate also was mild it is probable , therefore , that nearly the whole labor of the people there was applied to these public structures . The tumuli of the north are humble in magnitude , compared with the vast remains at the south ; with proper tools , they could be thrown up without difficulty . But there is no evidence that the northern tribes had any tools fitted for such a work . A small mound , heaped up by hand merely , would be a greater work than a very large one thrown up by spades . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these northern regions , that could command the labor of the multitude . We do not know , it is true , // what may have been in those early days ; but as far as warrantable conjecture goes , no such despotic organizations existed then . rjlhe Northern Indians appear never to have labored , in the usual sense of the word , either for themselves , or for those having the rule over them . They appear to have contemned manual toil , and on all occasions to have been ashamed to dig . XVe doubt whether all the toil , in the way of digging , that has been got out of the Northern tribes since they have been known to the whites , would achieve any one of the extensive works in question found in the State of Ohio . There is , therefore , the double difficulty in this question , - the want of the necessary labor , and the want of suitable means to apply it to advantage , had the labor been at command . The Indian antiquities at the north , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every step . Still , all opposition may be surmounted by such patient and industrious investigators as Mr. Schoolcraft . We have made no quotations from the Report before us , though we have availed ourselves largely of its facts . These constitute the merit and value of the volume , which hardly admitted much display of literary execution . The manner , however , is good ; the arrangement of the subject is judicious , and presents its various parts distinctly to view , while the style is unambitious and clear . We have alluded to the proofs of intellectual power in the Indians with which Mr. Schoolcraft had before furnished the public ; and we are now induced to make an extract from this Report , which has a bearing upon this point . It is a tradition of the Senecas . When we are looking for proofs of this intellectual power in the Indians , in what shape do we expect to find them ? They have been a barbarous people from the beginning . With such a character , Indian intellect can be expected to display itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develops itself in the infancy of a nation ; it is strong almost in proportion as the nation is rude , and gradually loses its force step by step with the advance of civilization . Imagination seems to be a wild product ; it luxuriates among a wild people , like the rank and unchecked growth of the face of the earth . The forest puts forth an enormous vegetation ; trees and parasites flourish there with a giant 's strength ; all the nourishment of the soil is sucked up by them . The sun licks up nothing ; a dense veil // intercepts its burning rays , and allows only their genial warmth to sift down upon the ground . Cultivation changes all this ; in regulating every thing , we restrain every thing it is improvement ; but it is still a check . The horse under the hit and in the draught is the same animal as the snorting courser of the prairie ; but his matchless energies are all cramped and subdued . It is nearly so with the imagination the Indian gives it full play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often obscured and overlaid with extraneous matter ; still , they are almost the only remains that bear the stamp of remote ages . We can not always understand them ; so it is with many coins ; nevertheless , they are preserved with great care , in the hope that interpretation may one day come . But these traditions are more valuable than coins in one respect ; they have a value , even if they fail to he interpreted . The imagination they display is independent of such interpretation . Very few of the Indian tales which Mr. Schoolcraft has heretofore published are intelligible in their bearing ; doubtless , they all had an application to events , either moral or physical . We may hope , but must probably hope in vain , to find out that application in most cases . The tree which has been prostrate for ages in the forest , if undisturbed , still retains an aspect in its final decay that leaves no doubt of its original character . It has not a leaf , a txvig , a branch , nor perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only index may be a long , slender tumulus , which , having become a mere spongy mass , a foot might kick out of shape with a few blows . As long as this tumulus remains , it shows to the least-practised eye that a tree once stood and had fallen there , though the most expert botanist might fail to detect the class or genus to which it belonged . It proves that a majestic forest once was there , and we care little whether the remains we now contemplate are those of an oak or a pine . Thus it is , in some degree , with these tales . They have doubtless lost their original texture , have lost nearly all that gave them , in their day of freshness , their beauty , their force , and their distinctness of character . Nevertheless , they are the best remains of the Indian character , and , as such , should be preserved with jealous care , with all their simplicity , all their mutilations , all their shapelessness . Mr. Schoolcraft gives us in this Report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention was , that the wood-cuts should present an exact fac-simile of what they copy , with every blemish , all rudeness of outline , and all awkwardness in filling up carefully preserved . The artist may have sometimes departed from this rigorous , rule ; we are led to suspect that he did not always do as badly as the original required . As the artist ought to have done in all instances , and as we believe his employer intended he should do , so we believe Mr. Schoolcraft meant to do with all these tales . The tradition we have alluded to , as given in this Report , is the following . Mr. Schoolcraft is speaking of the Senecas , when he says , - " The term by which they call themselves is Nundowaga , or the People of the Hill ; a name that leads us at once to consider the accounts of their own origin . Various relations of this story have been given , differing in some of their details , but all coinciding in the main events , namely : that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the Canandaigua lake , where they were put in imminent peril of utter destruction by a monstrous serpent , which circled itself about the fort , and lay with its mouth open at the gate . The following is given from a native source , and has some novel details to recommend it . " While the tribe had its seat and council-fire on this hill , a woman and her son were living near it , when the boy one day caught a small two-headed serpent , called Kaistowanca , in the bushes . He brought it home as a pet to amuse himself , and put it in a box , where he fed it on bird 's flesh , and other dainties . After some time it had become so large that it rested on the beams of the lodge , and the hunters were obliged to feed it with their deer ; but it soon went out and made its abode on a neighbouring hill , where it maintained itself . It often went out and sported in the lake , and in time became so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . They consulted on the subject one evening , and determined to fly the next morning ; but with the light of the next morning the monster had encircled the hill , and lay with his double mouth extended before the gate . Some attempted to pass out , but were driven back ; others tried to climb over its body , but were unable . Hunger at last drove them to desperation , and they made a rush at the pass , but only rushed into the monster 's double jaws . All were devoured but a warrior and his sister , who waited in vain expectancy of relief . At length , the warrior had a dream , in which he was showed that if he would fledge his arrows with the hair of his sister , the charm // would prevail over the enemy . Lie was warned not to heed the frightful heads and hissing tongues , hut shoot at the heart . Accordingly , the next morning , he armed himself with his keenest weapons , charmed as directed , arid boldly shot at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster proved that the wound was mortal . He began in great agony to roll down the hill , breaking down trees and uttering horrid noises , until he rolled into the lake . Here he slaked his thirst , and tried by water to mitigate his agony , dashing about in fury . At length he vomited up all the people he had eaten , and immediately expired , and sank to the bottom . " - pp. 60 , 61 . This tradition is doubtless given as it was received . It has all the marks of Indian crudeness and extravagance about it , and may therefore be regarded as genuine . Mr. Schoolcraft hazards an interpretation of it , which is not objectionable as far as it goes , but seems to fall far short of what might be warranted by the scope of the tradition . It has relation , without doubt , to an important event in the early history of the Senecas ; a dim shadow cast forward into subsequent times , showing an obscure outline of some great revolution . It would be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to narrate a similar modern event in equally figurative language . The Indian families are designated , as Mr. Schoolcraft has largely explained in his various works , by totems , or names of certain animals , birds , &amp;c . The serpent in this case may signify a chief who was adopted , while young , into the bosom of an alien tribe , and who , when he had become strong , returned the kindness , serpent-like , with ingratitude and injury , bringing his benefactors to the brink of ruin . The elevation of the serpent to the " beams " is probably only a mode of intimating the elevation of the stranger to superiority and power in the friendly tribe ; the change of diet from bird 's flesh to deer 's meat bespeaks the increase of his exactions . All the steps from secret enmity to open hostility are shadowed forth . The siege is plain enough , and the destruction of all the tribe , excepting a warrior and his sister , in the course of it , is equally so . The mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fancy has a wide field to play in . The agency of the woman in bringing it about - an agency so common in the troubles of life - is exerted in a strange way . We are left to conjecture how her " hair " overcame // the enemy . Fledging arrows with it , unless they were Cupid 's darts , gives us no clew . " Golden locks , " and even " raven hair , " have had a large share in catastrophes but not such raven hair , - the black , coarse , lank locks , that invariably cover the squaw 's head . The white man 's fancy can not comprehend this ; but the red man 's may . We have less to do , however , with interpretations of this tradition , than with its merit in comparison with similar proofs of intellectual invention exhibited by the ancients of our own color . This tradition will compare advantageously , in most points , with the stories which set forth , in a like allegorical manner , the early events of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figurative or romantic , and only less susceptible of interpretation because the early Indian history is utterly unknown . Grecian and Roman history began in fable , and might have ended in obscurity , had the same ignorance prevailed in after times as at the beginning . The allegory of the Golden Fleece has covered over with a sort of classic beauty an expedition that was probably not less predatory , nor more daring , than numberless Jndian expeditions that lie concealed under their allegorical coverings , which have not become classical only because the Indians never became civilized . The light of letters fortunately shone on our ancients as they advanced in growth . It was not so with the Indians ; they have had no records . Nations have risen and sunk , and left no memorial behind them . Thdividuals have acquired fame , which , like a deep and strong sound , has vibrated through the air far and wide , catching the attention of every ear , and calling forth the admiration of every mind ; but which , like a mere sound , sooner or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague tradition , like that we are considering , might give it an uncertain existence , but without lineament or distinctness , liable to any appropriation , and bearing down with it , from generation to generation , no proof of persons , and but a misty proof of an event . It is a subject for deep reflection , this difference of fate that marks the achievements of civilw*atmon and barbarism . The one has a perpetuity that may end only with civilized man ; the others die with the generation that witnessed them . Probably the degree of merit or splendor has been the same ; a nation may have been saved , or a nation may have been 27 * // destroyed ; but whether the latter event be a subject of regret is a different question . The good examples of history are valuable , but the bad ones work mischief . And what is the proportion that the former hear to the latter ? That of the good to the bad men in Sodom . We have heard it intimated , that the national legislature proposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a census taken of the Indians under the guardian care of the government . We hope this will prove to be true , for many reasons , which our limits do not permit us to enumerate . And we also hope that Mr. Schoolcraft 's valuable services will be secured in the work.
