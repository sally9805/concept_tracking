Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : THE SISTER 'S FAREWELL from Poetry for seamen ( 1845 ) TO THE SAILOR-BOY . Since where waves are gliding And the tall ship riding Thou dost choose to dwell , Where the sea-bird screameth , And the bright flag gleameth , Brother , fare thee well . Where the orchard shineth , Where the grape-vine twineth , Or the nut-tree laden , Thou , while song-birds waken , Hast with strong arm shaken For some bright-eyed maiden ,  --  Where in summer weather , Oft we ' ve played together , ' Neath the old oak tree , With our dog beside us , While no sorrow tried us , I 'll remember thee . Where the brook is sheenest , And the leaves are greenest , In the forest fair , With a sad emotion , Rover of the ocean , I shall miss thee there . When dark skies are pouring , And loud tempests roaring , Sea-boy , wilt thou be High among the shrouds , Wet by dripping clouds , Thinking then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil fly thee , Making God thy guide : Dearest sailor brother , Let us love each other , Whatsoe'er betide . Heavy night-winds swelling Round our quiet dwelling , Shall thy form restore : Thinking of the billow , On my restless pillow , I 'll for thee implore . Oh God ! to whom we cried Our cradle beds beside , When life was free from pain ; From the storms above him , To the hearts that love him , Bring him safe again . Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : TOM HARDY . from Poetry for seamen ( 1845 ) Tom Hardy was a merry lad , His pleasant face made others glad , Like suns that cloudless shine ; Aloft he ran with right good will , The topsail reefed with ready skill , And snugly clewed the line . Obedient still at every call , And friendly to his messmates all , For others ' pain he felt ; And ever neatest of the crew , On Sundays , in his jacket blue , At morning prayers he knelt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperance pledge he early signed , Nor from that promise roved ; In every duty free from blame , Blow high , blow low , ' t was all the same , Still happy and beloved . But once , upon a sickly shore , The burning fever smote him sore , And when we shipped again , Still to his sad disease a prey , He wasted like the snow away , And all our care was vain . So , with weak hand , he took the key From out his chest , and gave it me : " This to my mother take , My little all to her I leave , And tell her not too much to grieve , For her lost sea-boy 's sake . Here is the Bible that she gave , It was my compass on the wave When prosperous skies were fair ; And now , when darksome billows roll , It is an anchor to my soul , That drives away despair . Cut from my temples , when I 'm dead , A curling lock of hair , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll truly mourn for me , Who slumber in the far , deep sea , No more her voice to hear . And now , my peace with God is made , So , not of the last foe afraid , I meet a watery grave ; For near me , with an outstretched hand , I see my blest Redeemer stand , My parting soul to save . " Bright rose the morn , but cold as lead Lay poor Tom Hardy , pale and dead ; Though yet a smile of joy Sate on his face , while sad and true The roughest tar amid the crew Mourned for the sailor-boy . Now , sometimes while my watch I keep At lonely midnight , on the deep , When all is calm and clear , I seem to hear his well-known voice , " Oh messmate , make your God your choice , And to His haven steer . " Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : THE WHALER 'S SONG . from Poetry for seamen ( 1845 ) There she lies !  --  There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where away ? " Just three points west , Where the white surge meets the skies . Head the vessel ! Trim the sail ! Let us see this mighty whale . There she blows !  --  There she blows ! Man the boats ! for nothing stay ! Such a prize we can not lose , Stretch to your oars ! away ! away ! Grapple closer , careful steer , Launch the harpoon , laugh at fear , Plunge it deep , the barbed spear , Strike the lance , in swift career , Give her line ! Give her line ! Down she goes , through the foaming brine , Sponge the side , where the flying coil Marks the monster 's speed and toil ; But though she dives to the deepest ground , Which the plummet fails to sound , ' T is all in vain ! All in vain ! She hath that within her side , Will surely bring her up again . Spout ! Spout ! Spout ! The waves are maddening all about , Every billow on its head Strangely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seething main , In her flurry and her pain ; Take good heed , my hearts of oak , Of her terrible flukes , as she tortured lies , Lest they hurl us to the skies : But lo ! the pride of her strength is broke , Heavy she lies , as a mass of lead , The mighty-monarch whale is dead ! Row ! Row ! Row ! In our ship she must go , Changed by fire to a liquid stream , Over the broad Pacific 's swell , Round Cape Horn , where the tempests dwell , Many a night and many a day , Home with us , she must sail away , Till we joyful hail once more , Old Nantucket 's treeless shore ; There when the fair whom we love to please , Sit by the fireside at their ease , Let them remember , if they will , The hardy tar , who on seas afar Risked his life their lamp to fill . Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : CHILD IN A STORM . from Poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean , Glides on , where skies are bright , And rolling waves right merrily Propel her homeward flight ; But lo ! the angry tempests Rush from their prisoning cell , The rocky coast frowns dark and dread , The wintry surges swell . ' T is night ! Amid the breakers The headlong vessel goes , And shrieking , like a wounded man , Strives with her vengeful foes ; Pale grows the boldest mariner , For scarce the trumpet 's cry Is heard amid contending blasts , Whose warfare shakes the sky . How fearful is the tumult , The cry , the wail , the prayer , Wild mingling with the deafening storm In echoes of despair : But in the lowly cabin , Rocked by the raging sea , There calmly sat a beauteous boy , Upon his mother 's knee . He sang a hymn of heaven , Then spoke so sweetly mild , " The Bible saith our Saviour dear Doth love the little child ; It telleth of a happy home Beyond the stormy sky ; Mother ! He 'll take us there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His smile was pure and peaceful As the pearl beneath the deep , When the booming battle thunders , Across its bosom sweep ; Hoarse came the words of horror From men of sinful life , While innocence , with soul serene , Beheld the appalling strife . Morn ! Morn !  --  The clouds are breaking , The tempest 's wrath is o'er , The shattered bark moves heavily To reach the welcome shore ; Hushed is the voice of thunder , And quelled the lightning 's flame , For prayer had touched the gate of heaven , And listening Mercy came . Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : HOMEWARD BOUND . from Poetry for seamen ( 1845 ) Hail distant mountain ! rearing dim O'er my loved land , thy lofty head , How welcome is thy sight to him So long by chart and compass led ; Speck though thou art , and wrapped in haze , Right pleasant ' t is on thee to gaze . I ' ve marked the lordly Teneriffe Rise with rough forehead from the sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dulcet melody ; Yet rather would my longing ear The wild birds of my country hear . I ' ve sailed where Chimborazo towers Amid old Andes ' giant chain , And where the bright Brazilian flowers Pour living fragrance o'er the plain ; But sweeter is the clustering vine That doth my lowly porch entwine . I ' ve roamed where Himmaleh aspires With snowy crest o'er Indian vales , And where perfumed from spicy groves The freighted vessel fills her sails ; But dearer far yon mountain hoar , Blest herald of my native shore . Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : THE HEROIC SAILOR . from Poetry for seamen ( 1845 ) Footnote : 1Kb It was a fearful night ! The fire devouring spread From roof to roof , from street to street , And on their treasures fed ; Hark ! ' t is a mother 's cry , Shrill mid the tumult wild , As rushing toward her flame-wrapped home , She shrieks , " My child ! my child ! " A wanderer from the wave , A sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sympathetic glow ,  --  Quick up the cleaving stairs , With daring step he flew , Though sable clouds of stifling smoke Concealed him from their view . The astonished crowd beheld His bold , adventurous part , And while they for his safety feared , Admired his noble heart ,  --  For blazing timbers fell To choke his dangerous road , And the far chamber where he groped Like reeking oven glowed . How loud the exulting shout ! When from that mass of flame , Unhurt , unshrinking , undismayed , The brave deliverer came ,  --  While in his victor arms A smiling infant lay , Pleased with the flash that round his bed Had wound its glittering ray . The mother 's speechless tears Forth like a torrent sped , Yet ere the throng could learn his name That generous hero fled ; Not for the praise of man He wrought this deed of love , But on a bright , unfading page , ' T is registered above .

I keep my lonely watch At midnight 's solemn hour , And when the rushing waves go by With wild resistless power , A spirit whispereth from their foam , " O Sailor ! Sailor ! welcome home ! " ' T is often in my thoughts , That quiet home and fair , And in my sea-rocked dream I see The infant sleeping there ; And tears that from his mother 's eye Gushed when I bade them both good bye . Upon their love I muse , When wrathful tempests roar , And heavenward lift the earnest prayer , To see their face once more ; And joyful join the happy band Whose home is in my native land . Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : HOPE IN GOD . from Poetry for seamen ( 1845 ) Appear for my defence , my God , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , And unprotected head . Thine are the ocean and the land , And man 's frail dying race , While those who walk in pride , thy hand Is able to abase . Let not my hope in thee be crossed , Who have no help beside , Nor on the winds my prayer be lost , Thou Everlasting Guide ! But bid thy mercy and thy love Encompass me around , And thoughts of heavenly comfort prove A balm for every wound . Uphold me in temptation 's field , Where I am called to go , Nor let my feeble spirit yield To earthly sin and woe . For though the wildest storms may rise , And darkness rule the sphere , The hope that anchors in the skies Hath nought to do with fear . Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : LESSON OF THE SEA . from Poetry for seamen ( 1845 ) Go down unto the sea , Where white-winged navies ride , Whose mighty pulses heave so free In strong , mysterious tide ; Deep in whose coral-cells Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth Hath laid him down to sleep . Go forth upon the sea , And at the break of morn , Teach its young waves the words of prayer , Before the day is born ; And when the night grows dim , Beguile the billows wild , With the holy hush of thine evening-hymn , As the mother lulls her child . Go , bow thee to the sea , When the heavy breakers roar , And a meek-hearted listener be To all their fearful lore ; And learn when tempests lower The lesson of the wave , " One Voice alone can curb our power , One Arm alone can save . " Go homeward from the sea , When its trial-hour is past , With deeper trust in Him who rules The billow and the blast ; And should the charms of earth Around thy bosom creep , Forget not in thine hour of mirth The wisdom of the deep . Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : LINES TO THE AUTHOR OF " THIRTY YEARS FROM HOME . " from Poetry for seamen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clime Hardship and toil have marked thy way The thundering battle steeped in blood , And the wild tempest 's fearful sway . But now , thy peaceful hearth beside , Thy happier lot it is to see Domestic comfort flourish fair , And yield its cherished fruits to thee . Forget not in thy daily prayer To praise the Hand that safely led Thee through the perils of the wave , And snares of sin thy path that spread . Son of the Sea ! thy choice is made , Fast by thy Saviour 's cross to cling ; So mayst thou reach His haven blest , And join the triumphs of thy King . Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : DRINKING SONG . from Poetry for seamen ( 1845 ) Drink , friends , the parting hour draws nigh , Drink , and forget your care , The sultry summer-noon is high , Drink , and your strength repair ; The farmer with his toil-brown hands , The soldier , tired of slaughter , The camel mid the burning sands , Drink deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Our mother Earth also ; He , jocund drinks , above the cloud , She , thirsting , drinks below : Drink friends , drink deep , before we part , To loving wife , or daughter , Or bright-eyed maid who rules your heart , Drink deep , but only water . Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : " I WENT TO SEA . " from Poetry for seamen ( 1845 ) I am a sailor , rough and bold , And yet my boyhood fair , Was nurtured in a pleasant home , By parents ' tender care ; But at their hearth or by their side I had no mind to be , E'er since I heard a story told Of one who went to sea . I sat in school , but book and rule Still no instruction brought , The snowy sail and foaming flood So filled my roving thought ; And when on quiet pillow laid , There was no rest for me , For every fleeting vision sung The music of the sea . My father bade me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And told how healthful toil would heap The silver in my hand ; But when he died , I felt , alas ! From all allegiance free , And though my widowed mother wept , I left her for the sea . I ' ve sailed where arctic oceans spread , And icy mountains frown , And the fierce fire of tropic suns Hath burnt my forehead brown ; I ' ve sailed among the Indian isles , Where grows the spicy tree , And where the broad La Plata rolls , Rich tribute to the sea . I ' ve climbed the shroud when storms blew loud , And every star was dead , And winter in the midnight cloud Had muffled up her head ; I ' ve seen our good ship go to wreck , For such was heaven 's decree , And in the boat , mid breakers white , Have dared the raging sea . Yet still that Pilot , who the helm Of this round world doth guide , Preserved me when the jaws of death Were yawning dark and wide ; Though when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This too ungrateful heart forget The Ruler of the sea . But , blessed day ! a holy man To me a Bible gave , That life-boat to the struggling wretch , Who darkly beats the wave ; And now its blest and warning voice , Doth speak good words to me , Whene'er my midnight watch I keep Upon the lonely sea . And then , my mother 's image comes So pitiful and meek , As when with streaming eyes she stood Her last farewell to speak ; When from her pleasant cottage door I made such haste to flee , And in my wilful mood forsook Her kindness for the sea . That Book divine , which bids us shun The dread undying flame , Doth strictly for our parent-guides , A filial reverence claim ; But mother , mother , kind and dear , How have I honored thee ? With many a pang I paid thy love , Before I went to sea . God give me grace to see her face , And sooth her sorrowing care , And freely with her feeble age My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , On the repentant knee , Hear her fond lips rejoicing bless The wanderer from the sea . Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : THE SAILOR 'S SICK CHILD . from Poetry for seamen ( 1845 ) Come , mother , sit beside my bed , And of my father tell , On the deep ocean far away , Where foaming billows swell ; I wish that he were with us now , While sick and faint I lie , ' T were good to hear his loving voice , And bless him ere I die . Mother , it troubles me to see Those stranger-ladies come , And urge you so to leave my side , And work for them , at home ; Methinks they coldly gaze on me , And shake their heads , and say , How feeble and how pale I grow , And waste , and waste away . And oh , it grieves my heart to think , From morn to evening shade , That you so oft for them must toil , And have from me no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , You wish it were not so , But I should have no food or fire , Unless you sometimes go . When slow the sunset fades away , And twilight mists appear , The sound of your returning step Is music to my ear ; How happy are those children dear , Who , on their couch of pain , Behold a mother always near , But still , I 'll not complain . There ' s nought on earth I love so much As your dear face to see , And now , indeed , the time is short We can together be ; Still draw me closer to your side , And to your bosom fold , For then my cough I do not heed , Nor feel the winter 's cold . Yet when the storm is loud and wild , I cover up my head , And pray Almighty God to save My father from the dead ; So , in his lonely midnight watch Upon the tossing sea , Perhaps beneath the solemn stars He will remember me . I know I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , But he can find my little grave , Where early spring flowers blow ; And you will comfort all his cares , When I in heaven shall be ; But mother , dearest ! when I die , Oh ! be alone with me . Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : HYMN FOR THANKSGIVING DAY . Footnote : 1Kb from Poetry for seamen ( 1845 ) Sons of the boisterous sea , With grateful hearts we share The blessings of this happy land , Which heaven hath made its care ;  --  Whose glorious flag is borne High o'er the ocean 's breast , Whose strong-winged eagle proudly makes Among the stars his nest . Not with the cup that drains Our best resolves away , And leaves its poison in our veins , We keep the feast to-day . But from the hateful cloud Of dark intemperance free , We praise the Giver of our joys , Who ruleth land and sea ;  --  Who saved us when the surge Rolled high in threatening pride , And from the shipwreck and the blast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love His precepts we obey , The whole of future life may prove One blest Thanksgiving day . Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : PRAYER IN SICKNESS . from Poetry for seamen ( 1845 ) Oh Thou , whose healing touch So oft the sick did save , When thou didst dwell with men below , And tread the raging wave ; In weakness and in woe , I bow my dropping head , Oh ! give the pitying angels charge To watch my lonely bed . Be with me , while the hours In speechless suffering roll , And make each pain a teacher , Lord , Unto my sinful soul . Should vigorous health once more Reanimate my frame , Inspire me with a purer zeal To glorify Thy name . Thy precepts to obey My roving heart incline , And grant that both in life and death Thy holy will be mine . Sigourney , L. H.
