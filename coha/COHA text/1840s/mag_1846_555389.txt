txt THIs work is creditable both to its author and its publishers . Mr. O'Callaghan is of opinion that full justice has not yet been done to the history of the first settlement of New York . So far from agreeing with Chancellor Kent in the sentiment expressed in his historical discourse , that " the Dutch colonial annals are of a tame and pacific character , and generally dry and uninteresting , " he says he has found them " teeming with every material which could render historical research a work of pleasure and improvement . " We admire this spirit , even when we can not quite come up to it . It is the main-spring of all antiquarian investigations . Without it , very certainly , the volume before us could never have been // written ; and yet this makes but a part of the author 's project . It contains a narrative of events in the colony of New Netherland only down to the year 1646 . Should the public afford sufficient encouragement , the remaining eighteen years , containing the record of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume soon to follow . We hope that in his honest expectation Mr. O'Callaghan will not be disappointed . But knowing , as we do , how small is the class of persons in America who encourage researches of this kind by purchasing the printed results of them , we could have wished that he had condensed his matter a little more , so as to have placed it all within the risk of a single publication . The general outline of this story has long been pretty clearly understood . It has been much illustrated by the labors of the New York Historical Society , and very clearly traced out in the large work of Mr. Bancroft . The third voyage of Henry Hudson , the subsequent use made of his discovery by the Dutch West India Company to extend their trade , the later colonization of the country through a system of manorial grants , and the final merging of the settlement under the British authority , are all established facts , within the reach of every man who wishes to be well informed in the history of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained a dim notion of something more than this . The names of those three redoubted persons , Wouter van Twiller , William Kieft , and Peter Stuyvesant , successively governors of the Dutch colony , have , through the efforts of the worthy Diedrich Knickerbocker , reached a degree of immortality which no ordinary exertions would probably have earned for them . We have always had our doubts , we must confess , whether the mock-heroic style should be extended beyond the limits of pure fiction . When applied to real events and actual persons , it creates impressions which a bona fide his tonan finds it difficult , if not impossible , afterwards to correct . We perceive that Mr. O'Callaghan does not even mention the existence of the work alluded to , and so far from manifesting a tendency to copy the example , he errs , if possible , in going to the opposite extreme . In the records of the jolly Dutchmen there are some anecdotes which may well provoke a smile from the most serious . The principal merit of this book is shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had by its author to original sources of information . A large appendix contains many documents essential to a good understanding of the institution for which New York is most remarkable , that of its manors . With the single exception of an opinion advanced respecting the cause of the peculiar hue of the Indian race , which the author seems to suppose artificial , we perceive little to find fault with . Upon some points of considerable interest we do not quite agree with him , and it is to these that we propose to confine our attention in the rest of this article . Mr. O'Callaghan in his preface declares that " truth and historical justice " have been his main objects ; that is , justice to the Dutch who laid the foundations of the great State of New York , against the prejudices which earlier writers , into whose hands their history has fallen , have instilled into the public mind . He does not mention the names of the writers of whom he complains , although it is tolerably clear that he means those of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in all instances , been perfectly careful and accurate in speaking of their Dutch neighbours . We are very glad , at any rate , that the latter should find , even at this day , a friendly organ to state their case in the most favorable manner . Yet , on reviewing the impressions which the present work has left upon us , we are led to doubt whether it is likely to effect any important change in their favor . Whatever may have been heretofore written will find some countenance from , if it is not actually confirmed by , the author . In the character of the Dutch , as a people , there has always been a great deal deserving of respect and even of admiration ; but it certainly does not show to so great advantage in the early records of New Netherland as it has generally done at home . The reason of this becomes obvious upon the slightest examination . The principle upon which the whole project of colonization rested was radically defective . The results all took the complexion of the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discovery and colonization of the eastern coast of North America , of whom the most active and the most successful were the French and the English . Next in order caine the Spanish and the Dutch ; and last of all , the Swedes . The spread of the influence of the first nation was in a great degree , if not entirely , . due to the religious ardor of the mission // aries of the Catholic faith , impelled by a higher principle than any which the world can give . The motives of the British were more mixed , and differed in the different colonies which they planted ; but we think it will be found that their early prosperity bore a pretty direct proportion to the share which religious feeling had in the movement . In the Dutch undertaking this impulse had no part . It was in its outset a project for securing a monopoly of the fur trade , and afterwards it became only a speculation in lands . No such men originated it as were found to take the lead in similar undertakings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter country an iron race , iron not simply in their power of endurance of physical evil , but also in their moral and intellectual constitutions . A portion o.f these , nursed in the cradle of the Reformation , remained at borne to strangle the monster of absolutism which was laying its desperate fangs upon their political liberty . Another part brought with them their heroic qualities to expend in the construction of a new social system , better consonant with their ideas of what men ought to be than any thing which they had seen in Europe . lit was their faith which kept them true as the magnet to the pole to this leading purpose of their expatriation . This carried them without flinching through all the dangers of disorganization incident to the primary stages of the social system . This supplied to them a cheering consolation , when the powers at home looked coldly upon their enterprise . How was it in these respects with the Dutch ? The first comers were mere agents to collect beaver-skins and ship them off to their employers , the commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectable and substantial class , were nevertheless only the creatures of wealthy speculators , who were following into the new world that ignis flttuus which has constantly played tricks with them in the old , - the creation of new principalities and powers for themselves and their posterity . However solid and intelligent the individuals may have been , they could do little to correct the evil of rapacity , the offspring of selfishness , which must necessarily follow a mere money-making adventure . The Dutch West India Company looked , for compensation for all its outlay , to the exclusive control of the trade in furs . The patroons who finally settled the country under them , whilst they openly promised to sustain that monopoly and to confine // themselves to colonizing , studiously bought up the most important positions for traffic , for the purpose of undoing their masters by secret competition . Such was the temper of the colony . We may be committing injustice , but , after a careful examination of the present volume to find traces of any public spirit in the action of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confess our , disappointment in finding none whatever . The original discovery of that part of the American coast which the Dutch occupied is due to Henry Hudson , an Englishinan in search of adventure , who only transferred himself to the service of the East India Company of Holland after he had , by two fruitless voyages , exhausted the ardor for enterprise of his countrymen at home . The grand desideratum of his day was the hitting of that passage in the American hemisphere which was not doubted to exist , and to lead directly to far Cathay , the land of wealth and magnificence beyond the wildest dreams of European fancy . This was the all-devouring passion of that navigator himself . To him , new discoveries were nothing , excepting as they gave encouragement to his hopes . Even the broad river which will carry his name to future ages had no attractions for him , excepting as it might prove an opening to the Western seas . When he had traced it to its shallows , he turned back with a sense of disappointment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he had done , but how he had failed . Rejected from further service by them , he once more found favor in the eyes of his own countrymen , and again was sent out upon the waters to try and solve that geographical problem which , at one time and another , has cost so many brave men their lives . It cost him his , for he perished in the great northern sea which has taken his name ; perished , too , at the moment when he believed himself to have hit the right path . The vision of Cathay , like that of the philosopher 's stone and the elixir of life , became , in the agony of projection , a fruitful source of great realities to the world . The discovery of the Hudson river was a mere accident , but it ope*ned to the Dutch a region , which , had it been duly improved by them , might have become , far more effectually than Medea 's caldron , the means of their rejuvenescence in more than pristine beauty on the western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect . ' It was , however , but an instant . // The thing then sunk into tbQ form of a common commercial adventure , to be measured by the return of beaverskins . While this continued fair , the concern might answer . As it declined , the eyes which had become glutted with the spoils of privateering adventure turned with contempt from those small beginnings , and rested for solace upon the fields of Oriental luxuries , and the monopoly of cinnamon and nutmegs and cloves . The West sunk in the balance , when weighed against the golden mines which had been discovered by turning eastward around the Cape of Good Hope . It is , however , but fair to the Dutch to account in another way for their relaxation of energy in colonizing America . They were from the first made fully aware , that , however good their title to the country might be , it was actually disputed by a power with which , for many reasons , they were anxious not to quarrel . And as , in controversies between nations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show of physical force in the background , they must have had in mind the possibility , either that their improvements might inure some day to the benefit of Great Britain , or else that they were to be retained only at the cost of war . The English sovereigns , resting upon the sweeping navigation of Cabot , claimed a monopoly of the continent of North America from Maine to Florida , and stretching over from sea to sea . As against the claims of other nations , founded upon a disposition to colonize and improve a part of this vast unoccupied territory , such a pretensiolt could scarcely for a moment stand the test of reason . Neither do the actual grants successively made by Elizabeth and James , with lavish profusion , of countries so entirely unknown that they could only be designated by parallels of latitude , seem to constitute in themselves a solid support to their claim in its widest extent . Whatever might be the justice of their title on the east , or towards the south , of Manhattan , it seems perfectly clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that spot , or of the river that flowed by it , previously to its discovery by Hudson ; - neither had any disposition to occupy it been manifested before the arrival of the Dutch . Looking back at these events from the point we now occupy , we see no reason to dispute the validity of the title of the latter , // thus earned as well by possession and improvement , as by discovery . But whatever may be our opinion in the abstract , it is certain that the British never adopted it . The record of this fact is indisputable . It appears in the early and earnest , but friendly , remonstrance of the Plymouth governor , Bradford , as well as in the ruder incursion of Captain Argall . It is placed beyond question in the public papers which passed between the two countries . From all these indications , it must have been perceived by the Dutch undertakers of the colony , that , sooner or later , and whenever it should grow to be worth a struggle , it would be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scarcely a single event in history is calculated at this day to call forth more surprise from rational men , than the pretensions put forth by the leading nations of Europe to the ownership of the lands discovered after the voyage of Columbus . In making these , the pope of Rome , as vicegerent of the Deity , led the way , and Spain , France , Portugal , England , Holland , eagerly followed , without appearing to entertain a shadow of doubt of the propriety of their course . Yet , if we analyze the right supposed to be acquired by discovery , it is , to our limited comprehension , difficult to place it on any satisfactory basis . Independently of the total disregard of the claims of those human beings actually found upon the soil , it seems but a poor dog-in-themanger doctrine , as respects the industrious and active among the other nations of mankind . That a single glance cast upon any one of the beautiful scenes of the creation should of itself constitute a shadow of a claim to exclude for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of an indefinite extent of territory behind it is not consistent with justice or reason . The original claim of property in the earth rests upon the grant of it by the Creator , who adapted the cultivation of it to meet the wants of mankind . But this necessarily implies use . It is predicated upon the condition of Iabqr and occupation . Without it , there would scarcely seem to be any good reason why lands should not remain for ever in common . When , therefore , the sovereigns of Europe assumed to parcel out among themselves a great part of the habitable globe , out of all proportion to their wants or even their means of occupation , solely because the people 39 * // of the old world then first attained a knowledge of the existence of the new , they created for themselves a law of nations having no force excepting in their consent to wink at the rapacity of one another . rube first consequence of the doctrine was to spread misery and desolation and death over the fairest portion of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy thick and fast , which might germinate in later ages to the mutual destruction of myriads of industrious and innocent people . Assuming , then , the just view to be that the rights of nations depend more upon their intent of beneficial occupation of new territory than upon the individual who sees it first , we can he at no loss to decide the conflicting questions of title which spring up in the history of New Netherland . As against Great Britain , the right of the Dutch was made good , not by the mere accident , that Hudson first of Europeans saw and examined the country when he was on his way to look after something else , nor yet by the attempt of a few traders to secure a monopoly of such articles of value as the wilderness could be made to supply ; but by the actual purchase and taking possession of the soil by industrious men , intending to cultivate and improve it for their own benefit and that of the world at large . This point once settled , there yet remains another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitated , and which lit is not so easy to decide . Where colonization is made in a country admitted to be open , there must he some limits to the region claimed for settlement . How are these limits to be defined , as between two communities not very far distant from each other ? For instance , in the present case of the Dutch , how far east and west , and south and north , is their title to be considered valid ? Here Mr. O'Callaghan falls back upon the old pretension of first discovery , and maintains for them , on ' that score , an exclusive right to the whole country between Cape Cod and Delaware Bay . He is therefore disposed to find a great deal of fault with the English Puritans for endeavouring to crowd upon the banks of the Connecticut river , whilst the Dutch had actualJy bought and occupied a trading-post at its mouth . We are not yet disposed entirely to agree to this . That the Dutch had at first no intention to colonize on that river is clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first visit to the Plymouth colony people , that they would do well to transfer themselves there , - a proposal which the latter considered and " let pass . " They never , at any time , went farther than to purchase a small tract of land and establish their trading-post . The question , then , is , whether this act , of a few days ' priority to a similar act of the English , is to be regarded as rightfully sealing up against improvement for an indefinite period the whole of the beautiful valley of the Connecticut . We can not ourselves so consider it . New colonists were pouring , wave upon wave , into the country from Great Britain , in search of fresh and favorable spots to improve in the Western wilderness . Were they to he shut out from access to the region west of Cape Cod , because precisely half a dozen Dutchmen held an insignificant and temporary station in the midst of it ? There was no attempt made by them at colonization , for they could barely maintain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no probability of such an attempt , so long as the fine valley of the Hudson lay open to exhaust their enterprise . Under such circumstances , we can scarcely regard the encroachments of the English in this quarter in quite so heinous a light as our author does . Nor yet can we go so far as to applaud the tone of the English , when they in their turn pronounce the Dutch to be the intruders . This they certainly were not . They had rights on the soil , which should have been respected , - and which on the whole were tolerably well respected , when we consider the character of a new country , and the natural tendency to angry collision among people thrown together with uncongenial habits , and speaking different languages . They ultimately receded only before the pressure of settlements which destroyed the objects of their station , the collection of heaver-skins . Where , then , is the hardship ? Does it consist in the fact , that the Dutch have been called hard names by persons who felt jealous and afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of men . Or is it that they lost a fine territory which they might have kept ? Surely , if fault there be anywhere , it lies with themselves , who , so far from making a new empire on the Connecticut , had not vigor enough to retain even that which they had founded on the Hudson . To sum up the whole matter , it appears that this tract of country was // lying open to enterprise , nearly equidistant from the colonies planted by two different nations of Europe at about the same time , the boundaries of which had never been settled or acknowledged between them . It can not be surprising , that , under such circumstances , it should be most rapidly settled from that quarter in which the numbers increased the fastest . The English in a few years ' time were able to count a thousand of their people for every hundred of the Dutch that could be found within the limits of New Netherland . We are well aware that the view we take is the New England side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our author . Indeed , he is not sparing of his censure of the old 1*uritans , charging them with unfaithfulness to their professions of religion , ingratitude to their benefactors , and crying injustice in this part of their conduct . Their reasoning , " if admitted , would , " he thinks , " at once afford to every person , who may incline to covet his neighbour 's goods , a satisfactory plea to appropriate them to his own use . " To this we beg leave to object , that a most important element of distinction is entirely overlooked . Let the goods be once clearly proved to be his neighbour 's , and we think that they , and we know that we , would not have had a word to say to justify the appropriation of them by any one else . Let the right of property to the lands on Connecticut river be clearly proved to have been in the Dutch , and so admitted by the English , and we will consent to call the Puritans downright robbers and land-plunderers for going there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , it may be as well to plead in their behalf , that they refused to acknowledge the ' title of their neighbours to colonize anywhere along the coast , even at Manhattan , and they maintained their ground by the very same argument which the Dutch applied to them in the case of Connecticut ; that is , by the claim of prior discovery on the part of Great Britain . No sooner were they made aware of the Dutch intention to set up a trading-post at the mouth of the river , than they took immediate measures , by doing the same thing , to keep the title in abeyance by means of this joint occupation . So far , therefore , was the Dutch right from being clear and unquestionable , that it was not simply disputed , but absolutely denied . Nor is it material to the present question , that the Puritan position should have been in every particular cor // rect . It is enough , if the case can be shown to have been one upon which men 's minds can honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , whatever weight may be given to the original claim of discovery , it can not be construed to furnish the Dutch with more than an inchoate right to the territory watered by the Connecticut river , suhject to be made perfect by actual colonization within a reasonable time . This condition failing , the title of that people speedily dwindles down to a right to possess a comparatively insignificant tract of land for purposes of trade ; and even here , it becomes rather a right of property than of absolute dominion . Perhaps we have gone over these old disputes at the hazard of being tedious . But no one can fail to see that they are not entirely without their parallel in a case which is at this moment agitating the population of the United States and of Great Britain ; we mean the question about Oregon . Should the negotiation upon this subject long continue open , the same result can scarcely fail to happen in that territory which took place two centuries since in New England . The tiller of the soil will drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the respective countries be defined by a treaty , - an issue which all must , in the view of a worse alternative , unite in desiring , - Great Britain will herself be driven to colonize in that quarter , or she will not avert the consequences which we have predicted . Neither would war itself , however long and furiously kept up , do more than to postpone them . Although the question would , in the case of a treaty , entirely change its nature , yet the tendency of things has already been sufficiently manifested on this side of the water to justify the inference , that a difference in casuistry would not be attended with a corresponding difference in action . With the flood of population advancing to the westward , as it has done for half a century , over this continent , it may become a question for future generations to open , whether any nations shall have a right to hold for ever unquestioned vast territories in habitable climes , conceded to be theirs under the claim of prior discovery , without at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for other purposes than to sustain an insignificant trade . There is still another phase of this question , which we // desire briefly to show , in order to save being misunderstood . Persons belonging to one nation will frequently transfer themselves to countries occupied by and acknowledged to belong to another , and colonize there . This is voluntary expatriation . Such persons swear allegiance to a new sovereign authority , and are bound to obey it . This was done by many persons who came first to New England , but ultimately removed to New Netherland . It would in all probability have been done by more , under the temptations held out by perfect liberty of conscience on the one hand and greater laxity of moral discipline on the other , had the Dutch authorities in the colony shown more symptoms of firmness , and secured something like a system of adequate protection . This was not the case . The direction of the colony came from the other side of the water , and its early instruments were weak and wavering and incapable . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minuits , was simply the manager of the trade , and directqr of the returns of beaver-skins made to the Company at home . So little had he of national character or individual pride in the colony , that , not a great while after he left it , he is found acting as a voluntary guide of the subjects of Sweden to the country situated on the river Delaware , with intent there to establish a new and adverse settlement , notwithstanding it must have been known by him to lie within the limits always even more earnestly claimed by his fellow-countrymen at Manhattan than the Connecticut lands . The person who succeeded Minuits , Walter van Twiller , is stated to have owed his promotion from a clerkship in the Company rather to the influence of friends than to his personal merit . He seems to have failed in setting a suitable example of sobriety and discretion to a community which stood greatly in need of it . One of the most respectable authorities of the period , David de Vries , gives but a sad account of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is clear from his narrative that there was not even a dream of teetotalism in those days , in New Netherland . " I moreover told the secretary , " says De Vries , " that I was astonished that the West India Company should send such fools to the colonies , who knew nothing but how to drink themselves drunk . " From his account , there was a wide difference in the mode of conducting business , and in the selec // tion of agents , between the West and the East India Companies of Holland , which seems to betray the comparatively small value they placed on the settlements by the former . " In the East Indies , " he continues , " nobody was advanced to commander but after a long service , and after it was known that he was competent for the office ; that he had first to serve as an assistant , - then under-koopman , - then koopman , before he came to be upper-kooprnan ; and advanced farther according to merit . But the West India Company send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never seen any service , and must of course go to destruction . " When he went home to Amsterdam , he found things no better in the Company . The directors were quarrelling with one another in such a manner as to deter him from prosecuting his intentions of colonization any further at that time . In the mean while , another authority tells us that Van Twiller was shrewd enough to take care of his own interest at the expense of that of his employers , and in violation of their orders . He took conveyances from the indians of large tracts of land , for his own private benefit , without the Company 's knowledge ; and upon the first appearance of remonstrance by the schout fiscal , or sheriff , Van IDinclage , who had succeeded Notelman in this , the second , post of the colony , he manifested no want of energy in terminating the services of that officer and sending him home in disgrace to fatherland . Van Dinclage , to be even with him , made such representations of his conduct at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The jolly and careless Wouter van Twiller was compelled to give place to a successor in the person of William Kieft . But Kieft , with not so many gross vices , perhaps , proved a worse director than his predecessor . His imprudence* not to say wickedness , in sanctioning a cowardly butchery of the neighhouring Indians , not unfriendly at the time , the very existence of the main settlement itself . The sufferings of the people , made houseless and homeless by the savages in revenge for this onslaught , prompted them to blame Kieft for the act ; and he , in his turn , after making an humble and public profession of penitence , strove to make those who had instigated him take a share of the odium . The fact probably was , // that many had approved the act as a bold stroke of policy before it was committed , who were very glad to throw the whole responsibility for the event , after it was seen to have turned out badly , upon the shoulders of the chief director . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he asked that eight persons should be selected by the commonalty , to whom he might submit propositions intended to relieve it from its distressing situation . The eight men were accordingly chosen , and this act constitutes the only approach to the right of representation which we discover in this history . Neither was that attended with any important results . Time passed on , - Kieft got over his alarm . The eight met weekly to consult , but Kieft paid no attention to them . They ventured to advis* he told them to go about their business . They obeyed , and there was an end of the representative principle in New Netherland . In the mean time , however , the settlement xva* going . backward every day . At the end of a quarter of a century , the population amounted to but three thousand souls . In and around New Amsterdam , the male adults in 1648 did not exceed one hundred . Such were the consequencs of a system of government without responsibility to the people , whom it was but incidentally intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit to a great commercial corporation in an opposite quarter of the globe . We have already remarked that the first intention of the Dutch West India Company was to monopolize the trade of the new settlement . This system , however , presented few inducements to emigration . Perhaps there were not many independent agriculturists in Holland inclined to come out to Affierica , even upon the more favorable terms which the corporation subsequently offered . A corresponding class of people to those who came to New England seems to have been greatly wanting . Resort was had to modes of action in some degree peculiar to Holland . Temptations were held forth to the wealthy to undertake to plant colonies on their own account . Hence sprung the rights of patroons , and the transfer to the new of the manorial rights and privileges of the old world . Every person who did , within four years from the time/ of giving notice of his intention to the Company , plant a colony of fifty souls , upwards of fifteen years old , in the country , became entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , at the place selec*ted by him , he obtained the right to extend the limits of his estate sixteen miles along one bank of a navigable river , or eight miles on both sides , and as far into the interior as other occupation did not forbid . Within the territory thus marked out , the patroon became in many respects a sovereign . He had the power to administer justice , civil and criminal , in person or by deputy , and to appoint local officers and magistrates . He enjoyed the exclusive right of fishing , fowling , and grinding within his jurisdiction . He held his colony subject to testamentary disposition , with all the privileges ,  --  the monopoly of mines and minerals , and water-courses , the rights of preemption and of fines on the transfer of estates , and of succession in the case of intestates , - which the Roman law would have secured to him in his own country . In other words , any man might found a sort of feud*d principality in the colony of New Netherland , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion grew the manor of Rensselaerwyck , of which many people have lately heard so much in connection with the anti-rent troubles of the State of New York . This was colonized by Kiliaen van Rensselaer , who does not , however , appear to have himself come out to look after it . The presetfl work of Mr. O'Callaghan contains much information upon this peculiar feature of the early colony , and it has many original documents relating to that particular manor , which have not before seen the light , so far as we know . From these it would appear , that the aforesaid patroon set off farms , built the necessary buildings , furnished the stock and agricultural implements to the farmer , in exchange for which he received one tenth of the produce of the farm , and one half the increase of the stock , in addition to the rent agreed upon , which was payable in grain , beaver-skins , or wampum . He had also a right of preemption of the annual return of grain and stock , as well as of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mill-sites , and consequently every tenant was bound to get his grain ground at his mills . But it should not be inferred from this enumeration of the ancient rights of patroons , that they have existed of late in any similar extent . The grants of land under which all the existing difficulties in the counties of Albany and Rensselaer have arisen hear date since the year 1785 . The mode of tenure is evidently founded upon the old system , but it has // been varied to meet the changes of the times . A low annual rent is charged , payable in kind , - four fowls , a fixed quantity of wheat , and a day 's work by a man and team . The same reservations are made of mines and water rights , of pr&amp;imption rights on the sale , and of fines on the transfer of estates , equal to one quarter part of the gross amount for which they sold , which were originally established . All the other and greater privileges of special jurisdiction and of monopoly have vanished . Even those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously exercised ; yet such is the contrast between the opinions of men in the first days of the colony and at the present time , that several counties of the great State of New York are even now in a condition little short of rehellion against the law , on account of the existence of the mere shadow of these ancient tenures . In order , then , fully to comprehend the principles upon which this colony of New Netherland was founded , it will be necessary to bear in mind that the system of settlement was two-fold . By the one , the manors were created , and a mutual feudal relation of patroon and vassal established , as we have endeavoured to show ; by the other , certain privileges were accorded to the inhabitants of separate hamlets , villages , or cities , the principal of which was that of recommending for local magistrates a certain number of persons out of whom the Director could make selections to please himself . The administration of justice hetween man and man was thus , in some measure , retained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the nearest approach we can discover in this history to the idea of popular freedom . The law was administered according to the prescriptions of the civil code , a system , it should be observed , which , however perfect in some of its features , is not based upon that wholesome jealousy of authority which has been the safeguard of human liberty*vith the Anglo-Saxon race . Town-meetings were utterly prohibited , as contrary to the spirit of the new institutions . The Director and his council , as the representative of the sovereign power , were the proper fountain of all laws for the redress of existing evils . As Mr. Bancroft very justly observes , " The schoolmaster and the mitiister were praised as desirable , but no provision was made for their maintenance . " What was the consequence ? Churches were commenced , and schools opened , but the funds intended for // the completion of the one , and the support of the other , were emhezzled , or applied to other purposes . Every avenue to enterprise was choked by restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went hand in hand . A fourthpart of the city of New Amsterdam consisted of grog-shops , and houses where nothing could be got hut tobacco and beer . " Such are the frank admissions of Mr. O'Callaghan himself . And yet he finds fault with Mr. Bancroft for saying , that " the emigrations from New England engrafted on New Netherland the Puritan idea of popular freedom . " To us nothing seems more perfectly demonstrable . Our author , on the other hand , claims for the Dutch proprietary system the cherishing of that idea . " It was , then , " he says , " to the wise and beneficent modifications of the feudal code which obtained there , and not to the Puritan idea of popular freedom , ' introduced by emigrants from Connecticut , - as some incorrectly claim , - that New Netherland and the several towns within its confines were indebted for whatever municipal privileges they enjoyed . The charters under which they were p , Janted , the immunities which they obtained , were essentially of Dutch and not of Connecticut origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of popular privileges in New Netherland fall , therefore , into an error , sanctioned neither by law nor by history . Strange as it may seem , while every colony , and almost every hamlet , had its local magistracy , the citizens of New Amsterdam , the capital of the whole province , continued , greatly to their discontent , without a voice in the management of their municipal affairs . The government of that city still remained in the hands of the Director-general and his council . " - p. 393* In this statement our author may be correct , but we scarcely know how it can he maintained against the evidence furnished by his own work . In the very next paragraph to the one we have quoted , he admits that Kieft was perfectly absolute in his government , and that the only check to which the colonists could look for protection , the right of appeal from the Director 's judgment to the court of Holland , was totally cut off by him in 1643 . Furthermore , when , in the year 1653 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ventured , under the direction of George Baxter , the man who had been Kieft 's English secretary , to ask for some participation in the government , the immediate reply of hon // est Peter Stuyvesant , the last and best of the Dutch governors , was , " Will you set your names to the visionary notions of the New England man ? " And he dispersed the meeting at last with the summary declaration , that " he derived his authority from God and the West India Company , not from the pleasure of a few ignorant subjects . " Surely , this doctrine could not have been safely uttered in a community acknowledging any idea of popular freedom . " Had we been under a king , we could not have been worse treated , " murmured the people , when Kieft was exercising unchecked as much absolute power in his degree , as ordinarily falls to the lot of any king . But though we are not able to see the Dutch colony of New Netherland in quite so favorable a light as our author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his industry and zeal in its behalf . Although the outward aspect of the settlement is not promising , owing to the radical defect in its origin , we yet know very well that a great deal of the best of human nature lay quietly under the surface . If the government was indiscreet , or selfish , or vicious , many of the people were quiet and substantial and moral , living in the fear of God and with good-will to man . We hope that Mr. O'Callaghan will continue his labors , and give to the public the remaining and most interesting part of the history , namely , that which embraces the administration of the worthy General Stuyvesant . And if he still find it in his heart to complain of the encroachments of the Puritan race , which ultimately overturned the domination of the ilollander , let him console himself with the reflection , that the colony throve greatly under the infliction . Even at this day , New York will be found to owe a considerable share of its extraordinary prosperity to the spirit of descendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion of the three millions of her population.
