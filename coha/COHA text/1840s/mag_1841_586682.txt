txt THE works cited below comprise the entire body of the published writings of the good and great man whose name is prefixed to the present article . They consist of what is usually termed Miscellanies - namely , Review papers , discourses , sermons , and essays , on a variety of subjects and occasions - filling , in the aggregate , five handsomely printed volumes of respectable dimensions . They are collected and published , it seems , by a brother of Dr. Channing , and simultaneously on both sides of the Atlantic . And as the greater portion of them , from the fugitive nature of their original form , and the exhaustion of their earlier editions , were before almost inaccessible to vast numbers of readers , acquainted only with the unique reputation which they have gathered about the name of their author , we do not doubt that the valuable service thus rendered by the publisher to the cause of good public and private morals will be well repaid by the most acceptable reward - the reward of a widely extended circulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present durable , cheap , and elegant form ; with a corresponding diffusion of * The Works of William E.

Of those portions of these volumes relating to the tenets of the particular sect of Christianity of whose ministry Dr. Channing is well known to be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of place here to speak , whether in the language of approval or dissent . Thus much , however , at least , it m*y be lawful to say , - that even in what may be termed his polemical writings , we look in vain for any trace of that spirit , hatefully proverbial as the odium titeologicum , which is so commonly seen to stimulate the zeal of sectarian controversy ; and of which it is not to be denied that no stinted measure has been poured forth against those who support the doctrines so eloquently and beautifully advocated by Dr. Channing . We allow ourselves here no more than this simple allusion to a fact which none will gainsay , - leaving it to others to judge for themselves , according to the bias of their own respective views , how far its merit is to be ascribed to the individual character of the writer , or to the general tendency of that system of religious opinion , whose influence would - naturally inspire him when in the act of interpreting it . Whether it is the naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair on his pages , and the native tones of its voice which speak from them in accents so loving , and with a power so persuasive - or whether thesp are but the reflection of the bright visions of a mistaken enthusiasm , and the eloquent utterance of a genius misleading by the errors by which it is itself misled - it would be too foreign to the character of such a work as the present for us even to hint an opinion . Nor even independently of those portions just adverted to , is it our present purpose to enter into a general review of the rest of the contents of these volumes , as a complete whole - complete in one pervading harmony of spirit and character , though consisting , as before remarked , of detached miscellanies , written at long - distant periods , and suggested by widely different occasions . It is to what we may be permitted to style Dr. Channing 's political works , that we desire to invite the attention of our readers . It may not indeed be easy , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to draw any line of discrimination which shall include any given number of his writings in this category , to the exclusion of the rest . None are on topics of partisan , or even of a political character , according to the usual acceptation of the term ; and it is only inferentially , from the consequences which can not but flow from his general principles , that a conjecture // is to be formed from these volumes to which of our two great parties , in their present organization , their author 's preference inclines . In some of them , however , and especially in his more recent writings , these general principles are so strongly stated , and their applicability to the leading party questions of the times is so direct and manifest , that we feel not only entitled to claim Dr. Channing as an open member of the political school to which we profess adhesion , but proud to refer to him as one of the most powerful advocates of its high and beautiful philosophy . We care little , whether he has bestowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day between the supporters and the opponents of the late administration , himself to recognise or not the general harmony of the fundamental principles of the former with his own . We care less , whether , in the exercise of that elective franchise which is no less the high duty than the high privilege of every American citizen , he has found such a preponderance of good over evil in the practical conduct of affairs by the late administration , as to secure to it and its friends the support of his vote . That it must at any rate have been clearly impossible for him to cast it in the scale in behalf of those by whom that administration was overthrown , whatever may have been his early sympathies with that party , we feel a perfect assurance . We are content to know that whether we coincide or not in our views of the same measures , and support of the same men , our general principles have the identity of a common foundation and a common aim . The development and application of those principles constitute the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and participate in this noble national struggle of politics . And probably a more efficient influence in the promotion of that object may be exerted by such a voice as Dr. Channing 's , when , uttered from a position of tranquil retirement , aloof from either party , both are ready to listen with more open ear , and more unprejudiced mind , to its sweet and silvery persuasion . Dr. Channing is a democrat , in the highest , purest , and truest sense of the term . Nay , more - we feel authorized by the testimony of his own writings to assert - he is a " locofoco . " If asked for an exposition of the system of opinions to the supporters of which that uncouth but not unmeaning nickname has been attached , we scarcely know any sources to which we should prefer to direct the candid seeker than to passages it were easy to cull from the present volumes . And if any of his friends should be displeased at the application we have here ventured to make of it , we can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // no other knowledge of its true meaning than they have imbibed from the abusive misrepresentations of its enemies , that they have taught themselves to regard it in any other sense than as a3designation of which they may well be proud , even for one whose name is itself a title of respect , as rare in degree as it is unanimously awarded wherever he is known We have already intimated that Dr. Channing has not always been a democrat . In his earlier life , as we have been informed , he was not exempt from the effect of that contagious atmosphere ' of opinion from which a resident of Boston could not without difficulty escape . He is one of those who have had to work out the great problem of the democratic theory for themselves , not only without the benefit of the hereditary reception of its lending principles , but in spite of the obstacles of early prejudice and surrounding social example and influence . He is a democrat , not accidentally nor passively , but by the result of an active , original working of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fundamental principles of human nature , - stimulated by an earnest love for his kind , and by a high faith , noble yet neither vain nor proud , in those boundless capacities of progress and elevation , inherent in that humanity which was the last and best creation of an almighty power , wisdom and love , - guided by the reasoning powers of a mind well trained in the processes of philosophical inquiry , and fearless in the pursuit of truth , - and above all purified and hallowed by the influence of that Religion ( we speak of it in a sense far superior to any of the temporary distinctions of sectarian form or doctrine ) of which he has been one of the most devout and devoted ministers . In fact , according to our view of both , so far as it relates to the ptesent existence of humanity , Christianity and Democracy blend into each other with a similarity so complete , a harmony so perfect , as almost to tempt us to pronounce them but double aspects of a single truth . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as the greater and the less , the whole and the part . For while the one , affecting the mutual relations of mankind , within the confines of earth and time , is included within the other , that other extends immeasurably farther , involving the relations of mankind with its Creator , apd its future destiny when time shall be merged in eternity , and the universe by which we are surrounded shall have passed away like a scroll . They are as two concentric circles - the one , though finite , yet embracing a world - the other , with a periphery of an infinite radius , spreading immeasurably beyond every limit of space and time - yet both coincident so far as the smaller extends . The highest point // of view in which Democracy is to be regarded , is the one here alluded to , its identity with Christianity ; while , on the other hand , among all the intrinsic evidences which attest the eternal truth and the divine origin of the latter , none impresses our mind more powerfully than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Democracy . A brief statement of some of the fundamental ideas of Democracy wiW suffice to illustrate our meaning , to those whose reflections on the philosophy of their own faith , political and religious , may not have made them familiar with the great truth on which we have touched . If there is one principle more thoroughly and intimately pervading the whole system of Christianity than another , it is that of the essential equality of all humanity . It recognises no distinction of birth , station , wealth , or power . It knows no respect of persons . It says that " the first shall be last , and the last shall be first . " Its precept is to " honor all men . " It attaches to the single individual human soul a value infinite as the boundless capacities which it ascribes to it , and as the eternity through which those immortal capacities are to exist and to act . Setting a whole universe in the scale against a single soul , it pronounces the former utterly worthless , in the comparison of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mental energy and moral elevation , may seem to distinguish them to our view into greater or less , better or worse , it rebukes the pride of the one , and exalts the humility of the other , by placing them all on one common level , with reference to their inherent capacities and latent energies , as similar and equal infinities . In like manner does a true Democracy rest upon these same fundamental ideas of respect for the individual man , in the simple dignity of his manhood , and the recognition of his rightful natural equality as a member of the social body , with all others of his kind . It constitutes every citizen a component part of the national sovereignty . It confers on none any factitious advantages or privileges , not equally accessible to the poorest and obscurest of his fellows . It sees no additional claim to consideration , no greater interest or stake in the well-being of the common society , no higher right to the possession of political power , in any circumstances of wealth or birth . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the accumulation of property , it confers no artificial *irivileges or advantages , on classes or individuals , other than those of nature 's own endowment* Merit and talent are the only // titles to social eminence which it acknowledges . It knows none of those conventional distinctions which , under other systems of institutions , classify men into superior and inferior social strata , and generate between them sentiments at variance with those fraternal sympathies naturally incident to the universal equality of a democratic community - sentiments of envy , subserviency and hatred , on the one side ; of contempt and fear , on the other ; of alienation and antagonism , on both . It thus unites with Christianity to bring out the great principle of human brotherhood , with a fulness and a force incompatible with any other form of political organization ; teaching man to behold in his fellow another self ; to recognise and respect in him all the kindred capacities and natural rights , which are attested to him by his own consciousness , and of which he would glaim for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him as one of the highest of duties , an earnestness in every labor of philanthropy calculated to promote either their - physical well-being , or their moral improvement and elevation . It thus identifies itself with the principle of that divine commandment on which - in conjunction with another to which alone it is second - rest " all the law and the prophets . " Its perpetual precept is that golden rule of justice which embodies our highest conception of human morality , and which is but another form of the expression of the same divine principle , " to do as we would be done by . " It evolves a spirit of mutual benevolence even out of that very self-love which , while inseparable from our individuality , wouki seem naturally most hostile to that higher and holier sentiment . It tends to create a just respect for our neighbor , even as a consequence and reflection of that pride which is so often an inordinate respect for ourselves . Hence , too , its hostility to every unnecessary interference with that unfettered liberty of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first and most precious of his own natural rights . And thus it is that a true democracy tends ever in the direction of liberty , private as well as public ; that it is hostile to that multiplication of legal regulations and coercions , which is the favorite resort of every other principle of government ; that its constant effort is to untwine , one after another , the folds of those countless restrictions upon individual freedom , with which it has been the favorite employment of legislation in all countries and times , to swathe and fetter the natural growth and action of the social body . Hence its aim to simplify government ; to moderate the strong working of its machinery ; to curtail it of many of its accustomed functien* to strip it , as much as possible , of those dazzling splendors and those dangerotis // energies , which it is the aim of the opposite political theory to accumulate and strengthen . Thus it is that a Jefferson , as the interpreter and apostle of democracy , could state , as the ultimate result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mere prevention of wrong , and the dispensation of justice between man and man . And thus it is that a " Democratic Review , " impressed with a conviction of the dangerous tendency of all strong government , whenever it transcends the narrow limits of this duty - of the positive evil which it is constantly doing , and the incalculable good which it prevents , by discouraging the free development of voluntary individual or combined action - could select no motto more forcibly and briefly expressive of the general political theory to the exposition of which it is devoted , than that which is read by every eye that glances on the title page of this work . It will be manifest , therefore , to those who have never before regarded it in this point of view , that a true democracy is a something very different from a mere government of a majority , through the machinery of representation and universal suffrage ; though these latter are necessary incidents to the former , and the proper and natural modes of its action . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the multiplicity of legislative interference with private freedom , to the oppression of minorities , or the violation of the natural rights of individuals , under one form of political organization than under another - whether in the hands of numerical popular majorities , or of aristocracies , oligarchies or monarchies . Far from asserting the infallibility of majorities , it is fully conscious of the constant tendency of power to abuse and misuse , by whatever hands exercised ; and considering a strong popular government only a less dangerous evil than a government by any minority interest or power in the community , its aim is to curtail and reduce the action of all political government , so as to bring it as net*rly as possible down to the ultimate result which has- been before stated - namely , the simple prevention of violence and crime , and the dispensation of justice . The harmony , the identity , between such a democracy and all that part of Christianity which affects its human relations , will be sufficiently apparent in its mere statement , to preclude any necessity of dwelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be made the subject of a more extended illustration . We are far from intending to assert that the democracy of our institutions , as generally understood and exercised , even by the party the most disposed to cultivate this as their true principle of life and health , ' is of the pure and elevated order to which we // have here referred . We have spoken but of the principle , in its essential and abstract character , and not of that imperfect comprehension and more imperfect application of it to practice , which the enthusiast of this noble and beautiful faith may mourn to behold around him in whatever direction his eye may turn . We are yet indeed but in a state of transition , of struggle , and of a confusion which is almost a moral chaos . We move in the midst of inconsistencies and absurdities the most gross . We are as far from realizing a true democracy , as the Christian world is from proving , by its practical fruits , the realization of a true Christianity , such as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission to the earth was , at the same time to teach it by his precept and to illustrate it by his life . Yet do we contend that we have correctly stated the principle , however imperfectly and inadequate ly . And endowed as it is with the deathless vitality of truth , and with a progressive energy which the resistance of error may delay but can never either arrest or divert , we have the same faith in its ultimate full development and perfect triumph , which we have in the future complete realization of that Christianity , of which democracy may be said to be but the application to the political affairs of society . And the blessings and glories which , as we firmly believe , are destined to mark the arrival of that millennial consummation of the earthly destinies of our race , eye hath not seen , ear hath not heard , nor hath it entered into the mind of man to conceive . The broad line of distinction which divides this modern democracy of which we have spoken , from those ancient systems of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fail to be obvious to the eye of every reader . They were at best but violent governments of ignorant and passionate majorities ; while often indeed they were but aristocracies in disguise . They knew not that Christianity from which alone we have learned this , one of its sublimest lessons . Sanguinary , selfish , ignorant and tyrannical , they were pervaded by a spirit the reverse of that which we have shown to be the essential principle of ours . And in the name of the latter we protest against any inference being drawn from the failure of the former , against that faith we have avowed in the indefinite progress of society , toward the perfect development of all the illimitable capacities of greatness and goodness inherent in human nature , under the radiant guidance of these twin angel sisters we have named , a true Christianity and a true Democracy . This is incomparably the most interesting as well as the most important aspect in which American democracy is to be regarded , // its Christian character . It is well indeed for us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathers came to erect , had its corner-stone originally laid in Religion . Inestimable as are the benefits which we have already to acknowledge from the direction thus early given to our national movement , we believe that we have as yet known but a faint experience of the blessed and glorious results which are yet to develop themselves from this source . In Europe , also , significant symptoms are beginning to show themselves that Christianity is there too awaking to a consciousness of its true mission on the earth . Its revival is found to be coincident with that remarkable extension of democratic ideas of which in every direction we have so many indications . And even from among the ministers of that form of Christianity which has been usually considered the least friendly to free and liberal modes of thought , we have seen , in the person of a De la Mennais , one of the boldest and warmest champions of democracy drawing all his political inspiration from the same sacred source . While Catholicism is for the most part radically liberal in Irelnad ; and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost within the very shadow of the Vatican , are to be found zealously republican and democratic , under the noble banner which is reared on high , in the face of the nation and of the world , by the " Giovine Italict . " It is true that the prejudice against democracy , in the minds of a considerable portion of the religious community , derived from its unfortunate association with infidelity in the last century , is not yet entirely dispersed . But it is gradually yielding to a more enlarged and more enlightened view of the whole subject . As we begin to discern more intelligibly the general laws that governed the social and moral movemeat of that period , than was possible to those engaged in the very midst of its whirling confusion , we can see this one of its phenomena in a clearer and truer light than that in which it showed itself to our fathers . We are beginning to understand , that , where the associatioa chiefly existed , it was because Christianity was known only in a state of corruption and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had assumed , and in an intimate alliance for mutual support with false and wicked systems of political and social institutions . Nor can we wonder , however we may regret , that so many of that school of bold and free thinkers , whose noble mission in their generation and age was for the overthrow of the latter , should have confounded what was so inseparably blended , - and , when they obeyed the great impulse within them which bade them raze to the ground that huge Bastille of violent and fraudu // lent tyranny , whose hideous mass had for centuries disfigured the fair face of the earth and darkened the light of the heavens - its atmosphere , sighs - its moat flowing with tears - and its foundation , broken hearts - that they should have forgotten to spare the temple , too , which they found within its walls . But the democratic spirit of reform , which still now , as then , impels in the direction of the same movement the same class of minds , to the destruction of all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that is radically vicious and false , has now recovered from the grievous delusion which then led it into so many an error and so many a crime . A great reaction of opinion and feeling has taken place . The Philosophy which before , in its blind rage , assailed the Altar with the same blows which it aimed at the Throne , now comes , penitent and purified , to kneel before it ; and b*efore going forth on its unintermitted crusade against all the dark powers of falsehood and wrong that yet tyrannize the earth , to seek its inspiration there , and there to consecrate the weapons with which it girds itself for its holy warfare . And this is the answer we have to return to those who taunt us with the seeming inconsistency of acknowledging as the first and greatest Apostle of American Democracy , one whom we know to have been in his day an avowed unbeliever in that very Faith in which we now seek the highest sanction of all that he taught . Jefferson was what his generation , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some respects he was greatly before his own and even our day , in this we have moved onward far in advance of the position then occupied by him and those of his stamp . Nor do we doubt-from the general character and temper of his mind - that if he had been born amidst the better influences which have constituted the moral atmosphere breathed from childhood by the present rising generation of American youth , he would have been no less fervent and zealous a Christian , than he was , and would still have been , a Democrat . We are far indeed from pretending that the democracy of our whole party rises to this level , or is of this character ; nor even that all the leading men whom we may support , or with whom we may coöperate in our political movements and contests , either practice , feel or understand such a democracy . But large numbers of them do , and exert a very powerful influence upon the whole ; while the main body of the latter is strongly possessed by a yearning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of these principles . The general bias of the democratic party is hi this direction - that of the other party in the opposite , toward strong government and wrong govern / // ment ; toward the arrest of the whole movement of democratic reform and progress ; and toward the cultivation of a spirit between man and man , the reverse of that of fraternal equality , respect , and love , which we conceive to be true spirit of democracy . All this we most earnestly believe to be true , whatever exceptional cases , whether of individuals or classes , may be found , accidentally or temporarily , on either side . And we believe and we deceive ourselves if , in our political discussions , we have not often shown - that the course our party has pursued , in supporting or opposing the leading practical measures which have been of late years the subjects of contest between them , has never been at variance with these principles . We return then to the point from which this train of remark has been suggested to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the phase in which we have attempted to present the democratic principle of our age and country . Of such a democracy it is fitting and natural that a Christian minister should be a friend and an advocate . Nor , - notwithstanding the adverse influence of the prejudice just referred to , as well as of some other causes of which we shall not speak , upon the general political opinions of that class of men , - is Dr. Channing the only similar instance we might cite . In his case , too , it is evident that his democratic principles have been derived from his religion ; as also that their formation has been progressive in his mind . Though all the productions of his pen are characterized by a warm spirit of philanthropic sympathy with his kind , and a desire to elevate and improve those broad masses of them who most need it , yet is it evident in his more recent ones , that this spirit has , with the course of time , assumed a still more fervent glow , and the convictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His later writings have been entirely on subjects relating to this democratic movement of the age with the genius of which his own mind is so profoundly imbued . We would particularly specify his lectures on Self-Culture the Laboring Classes , his recent Address before the Mercantile Library Company in Philadelphia , as well as the Introduction prefixed to the present general collection of his writings . The lectures on Self-Culture and Labor have on former occasions been reviewed and liberally quoted from in the pages of this work . And we would gladly , if permitted by our present limits , lay before our readers a few of the numerous other passages we have noted for extraction , in illustration of the remarks which they have suggested . We must be content to refer them to the original volumes , the very reasonable price of which places the whole easily within the reach of the most moderate means . // In point of style , Dr. Channing is one of the most pure and elegant of the living masters of the language . It is distinguished by a limpid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crystalline lucidity of the drops formed by some refined process of distillation - a chaste but severe beauty which often suggests to us the idea of fine sculpture in Parian marble - a vigorous Anglo-Saxon force and energy , when suitable to the occasion - a sincerity and fervor of manner which is the natural expression of the spirit by which his pen is always guided - a plain simplicity which adapts itself alike to the highest and the humblest comprehension - and that calm repose always so gracefully characteristic of conscious strength . A labored attempt to disparage his writings in this respect was made in a late number of the Edinburgh Review . It was only at the expense of a most unfair hypercriticism that the Reviewer ( supposed by many to be Lord Brougham ) was able to make out his case . And even if any degree of justice be conceded to it , with respect to some of his earlier writings , those of a later date are certainly entirely free from the defects there charged . We would commend the study of Dr. Channing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for no other reason , as a fine model for the formation of stylewell assured that they will scarcely fail to gather from them at the same time treasures of thought , and of high and pure moral truth , infinitely more precious than any graces of language or charms of **25;311;TOOLONG Oun subject is free trade . It is at all times a great one ; but recent events have given it a more pressing interest . The minds of men , high and low , are getting filled with it . At home and abroad , it is working its way into popularity . Statesmen no longer , in their folly and ignorance , disregard it ; for the cries of the oppressed , on whose heart it has been impressed by the agony of ages , have reached their ears , and Providence , by its severe discipline , is bringing home to the conviction of all minds , the necessity for nobler and freer systems of policy than have heretofore prevailed . Much has been gained to the cause of truth within the last few years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tears and blood - has come to the aid of the simple-hearted advocates of right . The friends of restriction , the enemies of their race , are giving way ; they have abandoned the field of argument ; they shrink before the developments of circumstance ; and in their despair , begin to find that their only shelter is in the most narrow and disgraceful selfishness . The day for reasoning has almost passed , and we approach the moment of action . Everything in the aspect of the world indicates a momentous change . Irrepressible longings for a higher order of things are everywhere manifesting themselves ; workmen , scholars , politicians , editors , are all laboring with the birth of a great principle ; the signs of the times point to the advent of a period of more enlarged freedom . If we needed any evidence of this , it might be found in the document whose name is placed at the head of this article . It is a document to be studied . Full as it is of dry details , of dull statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of science or literature that we have recently seen , is more worthy of attention . It is the offspring of a grand movement , the first.fruits of a rich harvest , the precursor of a mighty , world-embracing revolution . On its face , it purports to relate only to a narrow question of revenue ; but looked at more closely , it discovers far deeper and broader relations . It is connected with a great question of political and social improvement , with the elevation of depressed mile lions , with an expansion of the sphere of human activity and happiness , with the progress of civilization and refinement , and with the establishment of universal peace over the globe . * Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Import Duties , with the principal Evidence . London , 1840 . V2 // This document consists of a report and evidence on the operation of the tariff system , presented to the British House of Commons . It was made in March of 1840 . The names of the persons attached to the report , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts impart to it a title to high respect . The committee by whom it was prepared was composed of some of the most distinguished intellects of England , and the witnesses , of whose experience and knowledge they availed themselves , were among the most competent men of the nation . Of the former were Mr. Hume , Mr. Villiers , Mr. Labouchere , Mr. Ewart , Mr. Duncombe , and Sir Henry Parnell ; and among the latter were included members of the Board of Trade , officers of the customs , manufacturers , merchants , practical as well as theoretical philosophers - mea selected from classes whose pursuits amply qualified them to give an account of the working of the principle of commercial restriction . The investigation was comprehensive and minute ; no pains seem to have been spared to get at the truth ; the subject was examined in all its bearings . We* propose to make the document the basis of some remarks on the general subject . The restrictive system had its origin in cupidity , operating on the folly of man . In those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages , it sprang up simultaneously with the more selfish spirit of commerce . Two notions werc at the bottom of it , which were both false . The first was , that wealth consisted exclusively of gold and silver ; and the second , that the prosperity of a nation depended upon the excess of its exports over its imports . It became a great object , then , to restrain importation . Public legislation and private enterprise alike worked for this end . Exportation was to be encouraged , and importation impeded . Bounties , drawbacks , treaties of commerce , and colonies were resorted to for the former ; and prohibitory duties , for the latter . Nothing was undertaken or allowed that did not tend to produce a favorable " balance of trade . " This became the leading , fundamental idea of business . For this navies were built , manufactures established , agriculture stimulated , and the powers of government enlarged . The balance of trade was the main thing . It was the elixir of social life ; it was the long-sought philosopher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society still clings to this absurd and pernicious attachment . In some respects , its notions of its true welfare have been expanded , but they can hardly be said to have advanced . Our tariff systems are just as preposterous in theory , and even more destructive in practice , than the old exploded mercantile system . The // two are modifications of the same great error . They both start from a misconception of the rights and duties of nations , and end in producing a state of wide-spread national distress . They are both marked by a bigoted devotion to selfish interests , by an utter disregard of the happiness of the many , and by a debasing abandonment of every just , noble , and generous feeling . At what does the tariff system aim l It proposes that every nation shall produce for itself , as far as such a thing is possible , every article that it consumes ; that it shall rely entirely upon its own natural or created resources ; that it shall cultivate the soil and manufacture fabrics for itself ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ports , or admitted only upon the payment of high duties ; and that when these duties are not altogether prohibitory , they shall be so devised as to give the largest amount of " protection* ' to the domestic manufacturer . Now , we object to this doctrine in every aspect in which it can be presented . We object to it , because it is politically wrong ; because it violates the first principles of economical science ; because it is hurtful to industry ; because it puts back the civilization of the world . We object to it because it is a political wrong . This is manifest in two respects . It is wrong , first , because it involves a departure from the true functions of government . The objects for which government is instituted are simple and few . It is an agency established by the whole body of the community for the protection of their general interests . No power was ever given it to interfere in the relations of trade . It steps out of its sphere , whenever it attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given security to its subjects in the possession and use of their property and persons , when it has confined its action to the passage of equal laws , when it has guarantied to all the results of their labor , it has done all that can be required of it . It has fulfilled its design ; it has answered the ends for which it was framed . it deserves the name of a just and perfect go*ernment . But there are men who seem to look for more from its action . They wish it to take the control of the entire business of society , to convert it into a kind of omnipresent and omnipotent providence , or as it has been pointedly said , to make it " a jack of all trades , architect , engineer , schoolmaster , merchant , theologian , a Lady Bountiful in every parish , a Paul Pry in every house , spying , eaves-dropping , relieving , admonishing , spending our money for us , and choosing our opinions for us . " Is trade to be encouraged , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal improvements to be prosecuted , the state must // furnish the means ; are benevolent enterprises undertaken , the state must stand sponsor for their success . In short , whatever is to be done , the first appeal is made to the state . Individual agency is discarded , the mighty force that dwells in associated voluntary effort is overlooked ; no person but the magistrate , no authority but the authority of the political power is suffered to put hands to any great work . The sagacity , the strength , the perseverance of private enterprise is nothing , and the state is all . We protest , we repeat , against this doctrine . It is cruel ; it embarrasses and corrupts government ; it misleads the confidence of the people ; it transfers their trust from themselves to others ; it destroys individual energy ; it impairs free , self-dependent , vigorous exertion . But it is the doctrine upon which all restrictive systems are founded . They take for granted that men are not qualified to judge of their own affairs ; they proceed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ; they substitute an awkward , ignorant agent for an active and acute one . It is time such absurdity were brought to an end . It is time that so detestable an insult were rebuked . The doctrine we are combating is wrong , in the second place , because it looks to a partial exercise of the powers of government . If we should admit that it is the duty of government to interfere with private matters , it does not follow that it should act unequal ly . An organ of society in the broadest sense , it must aim at the welfare of the whole of society . The general good , in the most unlimited acceptation , is its supreme object . By this is meant , not the general good , as some understand it , referring too often to a special and private good only , but a good which reaches every member of the community ; in which every man bears a part ; which embraces all the integers of the social arrangement , be their position or character what it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community , but of a class . Every one of is acts would be a usurpation . It would be guilty of the grossest oi frauds . It would perpetrate the most unrighteous tyranny . Now , a tariff , in the nature of it , is a special exercise of power . The very end it proposes is partial . Its main design , its principal feature , is to build up a certain class , by laws made in their favor . It says to the rest of men , " You must consent to surrender your rights ; you must relinquish your privileges ; you must submit to expense ; you must bear additional burdens , that certain of your neighbors may thrive . It is desirable to establish a certain branch of trade , and you must contribute to itsearly support . We must hope with the superior industry or superior resources of the world , and you must help us . We must prosecute every art and // manufacture for ourselves , and you must share in the loss . No matter how little adapted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise , no matter how disinclined you may be to the scheme , no matter how much it may injure your own particular interest , it must be undertaken . A few wise men have decided upon it , and it must be done . " This is the language the restrictionists address to others . Can anything be more insolent ' ! Can anything be more fraudulent ' ! Does it not propose to the state to put its hands into the pockets of its subjects , against their will , and for no just object ' ! Does it not practise a despotism upon the minds , as well as upon the free action , of citizens ' ! It is true , we are told to suffer the present evil , for the sake of an ultimate greater good ; but that , as we shall show , is an error . No such good is ever returned . Besides , this is universally the plan of knaves and tyrants . It is quite as insulting as the offence it is brought to palliate . What , shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done for our future good ! Shall he who is trampling upon our highest rights , prate to us of future good ' ! Have we no faculties to discern what makes for our own welfare ' ! And must we yield our judgments and consciences to the same hateful authority that despoils us of our property ' ! The objection that tariff laws operate unequally , good under every government , has a special force under the peculiar government of the United States . Adopt which theory you may , as to the abstract nature and functions of government , there can be no dispute as to the duties of the United States government in the premises . It is imperative that its laws should be equal . The nature of the federal compact , the history of its origin and design , and the instrument which declares its powers , alike proclaim in bold , solemn , unequivocal terms , the sacred equality of the States . How much this equality is impaired by a tariff system , we shall not now proceed to say . Let a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble portion of the Union - a controversy that came near involving the fairest people of earth in a bloody , fratricidal war , declare its history . We have not the heart . The system , again , violates every principle of an enlightened political economy . And here we hardly know where*to begin . In contemplating the fulness of the argument , we feel emphatically what the French call the " embarrassment of wealth . " The field of argument is so broad , that you may put in your sickle anywhere with safety . Trace the working of tariffs from beginning to end , it will be found to be disastrous . But our space warns us to confine ourselves to a single train of argument . // " We impose tariffs ; " urge their advocates , " in order to stimulate domestic industry . " This is their strong position . Let us see how it is . The reason why an import duty is necessary to establish or continue any branch of business , is that it is less productive than other kinds of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure so large a return as they might employ in some other way , and consequently are withdra*vn . Men are unwilling to devote their means and skill to that which is bringing them a profit much inferior to what is gained in other similar pursuits . To meet the difficulty , government contrives a plan , by which competition in that particular line is excluded , and those who prosecute it enabled to subsist . The rate of profit is raised to the average rate of profits in all kinds of employment , But how has this been done l Why , by subtracting the whole amount of labor and capital engaged in the new protected business from other business . The effect has been to produce a mere transfer of labor and capital . Neither the one nor the other has been increased . Money has been taken from the pockets of one class of men and put into those of another . What one class has gained , another has lost . One method of industry has been encouraged , but all other methods have been depressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more productive , by diminishing and exhausting their energies in other departments . What general advantage has there been in this l In what way has industry been stimulated l By diminishing its productiveness in ninety-nine branches , in order that the hundredth branch may be raised to the average productiveness of what the others were before ! This is stimulating industry with a vengeance . It could only be equalled in folly by the policy of a surgeon who should drain the blood from every limb in the body to force it into a finger that in some way or another had become paralyzed ; or by that of a gardener who should carefully draw the earth from the roots of his vigorous plants , that he might heap it up about some feeble and ricketty shoot . But the working of the system does not stop here . It is impossible to impose a protecting duty on any article without increasing the price of it . If the price be not increased , the duty is useless ; but if the price be increased , that increase has two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular article is narrowed - since fewer persons are able to purchase it at the advanced rate - and consequently the demand for the labor employed on it is diminished ; and , secondly , a rise of the price of any one article , entering into general consumption , raises the cost of production of all others , and to that extent injures // them in the foreign market . " If we can raise cotton for instance , " says a simple but learned writer , " at ten cents a pound , and bring it into market as cheap as other nations , we have as good an opportunity as they , for selling it . If we can raise it at nine cents , we can undersell them , and supply the whole market : or if we sell it at the same price as before , we gain one cent more on the pound . If , by increase of the expenses of living " ( an effect that must always follow the establishment of a protective duty ) " we can not raise for less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we shall be obliged to give up the selling of cotton , either partially or altogether : and the industry engaged in transporting and raising the cotton , and what we receive in exchange for it , must be either partly or wholly thrown out of employment . " How much lower , as we may afterward show , could the manufactures of Great Britain be furnished , if her absurd laws , prohibiting the importation of corn and raising the prices of provisions to her laborers , were abolished l Nor is this all . By shutting out the competition of foreigners , tariffs include the demand for these products for which foreign goods are exchanged . No person , we presume , is so silly as to imagine that articles of import are a mere gratuity . Foreign merchants or manufacturers are not apt to be so abundantly benevolent . They expect to receive an equivalent for what is shipped to another nation . This equivalent can only be some product of its labor . It must consist either in agricultural produce , or in manufactured fabrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and silver that represent one of these or all . Whatever it be , it is the result of labor . How manifest , therefore , that you lessen the demand for domestic labor to the same extent that you diminish foreign trade . Nay , to a much greater extent : for , if a nation produces a commodity for itself , it employs only the labor necessary to its production ; but if it gets that commodity from others , it employs the labor exerted in producing those articles for which it is exchanged , the labor exerted in sending those articles to a foreign port , the labor exerted in bringing back the desired commodity , and the labor which is requisite to construct the vehicles and vessels by which the barter is effected . The whole course of industry is changed , and with it those habits that give skill and facility . So that tlis vaunted system , whose chief recommendation is , that it encourages domestic industry , interferes with that industry at every stage of its progress . And the effect of this interference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulating until there is a complete prostration of the energies of every kind of employment . // There are large classes of facts - of historical facts - in melancholy illustration of these reasonings . They may be reduced to four points . ( 1 . ) Wherever the restrictive system has been adopted , and precisely in the degree in which it is adopted , have the rights and interests of industry suffered . ( Q. ) Yet in these very nations , branches of industry not falling under the protective principle , have attained a surpassing vigor. ( 3 . ) Where resort has never been had to it , industrial pursuits have been prosecuted with the most energy , and reached a state of solid and permanent prosperity , proof against competition , and superior to ordinary vicissitudes of trade . ( 4 . ) While in nations generally free , the modes of employment specially protected have been those which were the least successful and most liable to fluctuation . Let any one who would possess himself of abundant and satisfactory evidence on these heads , consult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is overwhelming . There is France , beautiful France , as she is called , so cramped by the stays which a vicious legislation has invented , that her limbs can hardly move . Her coal , her salt , her iron , her gravel , her cutlery , in short , almost every branch of industry , has been the object of an enormous protection . A duty imposed on one article has been followed by a prohibition imposed on another . All classes have clamored for the assistance of the government . With what result ? A population ill clothed , ill fed , and ill lodged ; their agriculture stagnant : their trade subjected to fluctuation ; their resources but half developed ; and their social existence disturbed by a perpetual fear of tumult and riot . Russia , with an agri. cultural territory covering nearly a moiety of Europe , is far be . hind , in all the elements of trade , nations that are not one hundred times her size . With a fitness for industry that is almost illimitable , her industry can scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is entirely depressed by their enormous restrictions . The effects we see in the constant embarrassment of her treasury , in the stationary state of the people , and in an entire want of the evidences , and even of the spirit , of internal improvement . Spain , shackled from the beginning with the fetters of a barbarous legislation , finds her harbors deserted , her cities tenantless , her colonies dwindling into troublesome dependants , and her beautiful interior trampleJ into ashes , by the hosts of an infuriated banditti . Austria , in all things , in her politics as in her trade , the slave of a merciless despotism , bewails a bankrupt treasury , and a degraded , spiritless , and impoverished people . But no nation illustrates more pertinently the folly of commercial restriction than Great Britain . For ages , the government // of that nation has tasked and misdirected the productive powers of its people . It has prescribed to them to whom they shall sell , and from whom they must purchase . It has built up monopoly after monopoly , added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretched laborers are crying with tears of agony to be released from their oppressions . Tory statesmen may close their eyes to the cry , heartless reviewers make a mockery of the notes of alarm , money and fraud succeed in stifling the voices of the masses , but there can be no mistake as to the fact . A thousand speechless but eloquent tongues tell us that the body of the people suffer . They have become the prey of rapacious landlords . The bread is wrested from their mouths , the cup dashed from their lips , and even the rag is torn from their naked limbs by cruel monopolists . They can not long suffer in vain . If their complaints are unheeded , they will take their rights in their own hands . They will teach their tyrants justice , or perish in the attempt . Yet , let it be marked , in these very nations , branches of industry that have escaped the vigilance of protection have , at the same time , escaped the misery which is its inevitable result . The Biscayan provinces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal legislation of their own , the only provinces in which the prohihitory principle has not been introduced , are likewise the only provinces that can be said to have attained anything like a general prosperity . The cotton trade in England was at first a persecuted trade it was made the subject of repeated taxes ; yet those who pursued it have never sought the aid of government ; and its progress has been perfectly unexampled . Of all the German States , Saxony has developed her industry the most rapidly , and her legislation has always been the most liberal . The manufactures that have grown up spontaneously in Germany , have become the most advanced , while those that have suffered the most are such as are of modern date , fostered into existence under the late Prussian tariffs . " We have been slumbering , " said a cotton manufacturer of France , speaking of the utter want of enterprise among his fellows , " we have been slumbering under the tree of protection . " Switzerland has never had the foolishness to establish protective tariffs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industry that is driving the competition of England and France entirely from the market . Laboring under every disadvantage of position , she has continued to gain the ascendency of the most powerful and wealthy rivals . But we could string facts of this kind until the patience of the reader is exhausted . In the third place , the tariff system is one that defeats its own purVOL . IX . No . XL. -W // poses . When adopted by one nation , it leads to recriminations on the part of others that are mutually hurtful . No duty was ever imposed by one people , that was not retaliated by the people whom it was devised to affect . Men reason with themselves in this wise : If our neighbor refuses to deal with us , he can not expect that we should deal with him ; he has commenced a hostile movement , and we will prosecute it to the end ; he has sown the wind , and let him , if he pleases , reap the whirlwind . ' This proceeding may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christian doctrine is too little infused into the conduct of either individuals or communities to hope that when you smite them on the one cheek , they will turn the other also ; when you have stolen their coat , that they will give you their cloak . It is the old Jewish spirit which still operates . An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth , is too often the sole maxim . Duty against duty is the commercial war-cry . Statesmen say to each other , by rejecting our commodities , you compel us to reject yours ; you force us to countervail your own restrictive legislation by a legislation equally restrictive . A contest thus begins , which , carried out , can only terminate in the ruin of either party . Friends are turned into enemies ; consumers into competitors ; dependants into rivals ; servants into masters . When nations find that their products obtain no market abroad , they abandon the traffic , and what was formerly procured by exchange , they attempt to produce for themselves . They soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the supply of foreign demands . Great Britain , in this way , denying a free entrance to her ports of the products of the continent , has raised up a host of rivals on the continent . " Protection , " said Lord Palmerston in his admirable Speech on the Sugar Duties , " protection is a game that two can play at . It is impossible that a great country like England can go on protecting , as it is called , and that other countries should not follow its example . Can we tell other countries that they ought to diminish the duties of their tariffs ; that competition is the very life of trade ; that emulation inspires activity and enterprise ; and that without enterprise and activity commerce can never flourish and be beneficial to those who carry it on- can we hold these doctrines to other nations , and at the same time persist in our own restrictive system l When we propound these civil principles to foreign governments , they listen to our arguments with incredulity : they appeal from our doctrine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell us , in diplomatic paraphrase , when you alter your own commercial system , when you bring down to a moderate amount your excessive import duties , we may become converts // to your doctrines , and shall be ready to talk with you about a revision of our own tariff . ' " The experience of Great Britain has given a melancholy force to these observations . She has pursued her restrictive system , until she has driven her own manufactures from some of the finest markets of the world . Her industry has found its profits gradually sliding away without scarcely perceiving the cause . " Every year , " says one of her most eminent statesmen and authorities , " a smaller and smaller portion of the manufactures we export consist of articles in the making of which much labor and skill are employed ; every year a greater portion is composed of articles of an elementary nature , not destined for use and consumption , but as materials to afford employment to foreign manufactures ; every year the protecting system is raising up manufacturing competitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and British capital , are transferring themselves abroad to render foreign competition more and more formidable . " Instances of these truths may be adduced in any number from the evidence furnished to the House of Commons . Great Britain , by means of her corn-laws , laid oppressive duties upon the agriculture of Prussia , and she finds that , in consequence , her manufactures have been excluded from nearly all the German States . It has led to the formation of leagues , by which her most extensive and profitable markets have been closed . She refuses to receive the timber of Sweden and Russia , and in return these nations prohibit the introduction of her most lucrative manufactures . France , wanting things that she produces , and producing many things that she wants , has utterly shut up her ports to a large portion of British products . England has interdicted the coffee of the Brazils , and the large demand which once existed there for her manufactures has been transferred to Austria , France , and Switzerland . She has rejected the bread-stuffs of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rival manufacturers springing up under her very nose . Thus , whenever she has attempted to apply the principle of her exclusive system , the only effect has been to cramp her own industry . Under a misnamed protection , she has found destruction . An arrangement designed to foster her domestic capital , skill , and labor , has had the effect of exhausting them . British capital , expelled from home , is making its way into Belgium , Mexico , Germany and Italy ; at Vienna , the largest manufactories are conducted by Englishmen ; at Ronen , the foremen of the chief establishments are English ; and in Holland , South America , and the United States , the most powerful competition that England meets comes from Englishmen . " Do not , " is the urgent cry of t*me manufacturers of the continent to // the British legislators , " do not repeal your corn laws ; do not modify your tariff ; do not destroy the protective principle ; they have built us up ; and will in a few years enable us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission was sent out a few years since , to negotiate a mutual modification of tariffs with the nations on the continent , they everywhere met with foreign manufacturers , who trace their own existence and prosperity to the suicidal policy which had been persisted in by Great Britain . They found that the stimulus which England fondly supposed she was administering to her own vigor , had only strengthened her foes . She had depressed and withered her own resources , while she was animating the energies of her emulous neighbors . She was diverting the blood from her own heart , to pour a tide of life into the veins of her adversaries . The poisoned chalice offered to others was commended to her own lips . This result is rendered more striking by the fact , that without disturbing causes , it would have been hard to rival the manufacturing superiority of England . Her immense wealth , her vast possessions , the thrift and perseverance of her people , her advanced knowledge and skill , and the general free spirit that pervades her institutions , would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , falsely ambitious , she has aimed at too much . Haughty and imperious in the conduct of her foreign relations , she has alienated her natural allies and best friends . A system of overbearing insolence and selfish exclusiveness has lost her the noblest possessions . " You taxed us , " once said an American to the English , " you taxed us into independence , you fought us into a maritime power , and you now enact that we shall be your manufacturers . " A kindred policy towards other nations of the world will inevitably produce the same effect . Let younger nations profit by her example ! But in the fourth place , the effect of this rivalry is not confined to its mere commercial influence . It spreads itself through the entire legislation and spirit of nations . A feeling of hostility is engendered that sooner or later works itself up into open enmity . At first mere competitors in trade , they become in the end bitter political opponents . No cause has been more prolific of war than the restraints governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn asunder the ties that should bind the universal race of man into a firm brotherhood* They are a part of an odious system of isolation , founded upon the principle that different nations are necessary enemies , and that reciprocal intercourse and exchange are pernicious . Nothing could be further from the truth . Nations were not created enemies . They are // made so , only by the false and cruel political creeds which it has been the interest of crafty statesmen to maintain . Nations are but aggregates of equal human beings . They are collections of individuals , endowed with the same rights , moved by the same motives , destined to the same end , with ourselves . They are not dens of reptiles whom we may trample to the earth , not hordes of outcasts whom we may pillage and burn , not swarms of miscreants whom we are commissioned to sweep from the earth . They are men like ourselves ; they are fathers , and brothers , and children ; they are interested in all that interests us ; partakers of a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and eat and sleep ; the dire necessity of this human life is laid upon them ; the eternal obligations of truth and duty are impressed on their hearts ; the great problem of man 's existence is to be solved by them as by us . Are they no more to us than the brutes that perish l Are they beings to be hated , - to be cheated , - to be hacked and hewed as billets of wood l Have we no friendly feelings , no cordial and kindly sympathies , no heartfelt greeting to extend to them ? Must our intercourse for ever continue to be the intercourse of proud and antagonistic powers l Such is the spirit of the restrictive system . It fortifies national prejudices ; it increases the occasions of conflict ; it abjures the civilizing influences of commerce ; it surrounds the nations with a wall as impenetrable as the wall of China , that the people may vegetate in stupidity , barbarism , and selfishness . None of the consequences of Free Trade have more strongly impressed our minds than its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe that free trade could at once make the world what it should be ; but it would give it the opportunity to become so , and put it on the way . It would bind diverse interests into a solemn league of good-will . Men seem to have taken it for granted , that the diversity which prevails in the climates and soils of the earth should be a reason for a diversity of interests among its inhabitants . Because there are different governments , they infer that there should be hostile governments . But such was not the intention of nature . The differences and diversities of which we have spoken are designed to enlarge the number of our enjoyments . The products which contribute to human comfort and improvement are multiplied by means of it . The luxuriant fruits of the south , the useful ores of the north , the agriculture of one region , and the manufacture of another , are made attainable to the whole Yace . This is an advantage , however , which can only be appropriated through free trade . Restraints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Free trade makes the wealth of each the common property of all . It spreads everywhere whatever the Deity has made for the fruition of his creatures . It leads to perpetual interchange , to an unceasing barter of one thing for another , to a general and ever-growing feeling of amity . It weaves , through all the ramifications of soci ety , so many ties of trade ; it binds the mutual dependence of nations so firmly , it connects one with another by so many ligatures , brings them into such neighborhood , that disruption and war are rendered morally impossible . Those rancorous feuds , in which millions of property and millions of precious lives are lost , could never arise . They would be instant destruction to all parties ; and should any disagreement at any time occur , a more safe and rational mode of arbitration than war would be the universal resort . Why is it , that the twenty-six sovereign and independent nations , known as the United States , maintain themselves in harrnony ? * They are , in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners , their local interests , their domestic institutions ; yet there is no banded police on their frontiers , no standing armies at their citadels . Diverse as are their interests in one sense , Free Trade has made them harmonize . Reciprocity and intercourse have given them a strong attachment . They feel themselves to he fellows ; they know themselves to be one . Well , then , let the same relations be instituted among the nations of the earth , - let them be placed upon an equal footing , - the ports of the world open to the world , the world offered to the enjoyment of the world , - and there would be the same prosperity and peace . To this end , finally , we think , all things are tending . Freedom , good-will , universality , are the goals of the modern movement . We see it in science , in literature , in social effort , - why should it not be in politics and commerce l Human action , in all the departments of intellectual and physical labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is making against exclusiveness , privilege , and monopoly . Classes are sinking , but the multitude are rising . Literature has come out of the cloister , and is making its appeal to the crowd . Science has left the Sorbonne ; she no longer walks with the savans alone ; she is making her way into the cottage ; she takes the artisan by the hand ; she wafts her treasures on the winds . Religion flings aside the cowl and surplice , and takGs up her residence with the poor and despised ; she is leaving the guilded and vaulted church , to raise her anthems and breathe her prayers under the free canopy of heaven . How then , we ask , how can Commerce resist this mighty onward rush of tendencies l The signs to which we referred in *opening this discussion will best answer the query.
