txt In our summary for February we were compelled from want of space to break off from this subject . On Friday , 22d December , the debate on the above bill was continued . On motion of Mr. Yulee , the condition requiring the State to commence the work in two and complete it in ten years , was stricken out . Mr. Underwood , of Kentucky , moved to amend the bill so as to appropriate a certain sum of money to enable the Secretary of War to have the everglades explored , and a report made to Congress , as soon as may be practicable , with a view of ascertaining what action is necessary in regard to them . He did this , he said , for the purpose of testing the principle involved in the bill , and to ascertain how far they were to depart from the usual legislation of Congress on this subject . They had had propositions from Arkansas , and might have , should this bill pass , from every State in the Union where there are public lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits . He was willing , as a member of the Committee on Public Lands , to have all this land explored by the topographical engineers of the United States , and reports made by them , stating the nature of the improvements which ought to be made , the quantity of land which would thereby be rendered saleable , its value , and the expense attendant upon these improvements . He then proceeded to remark upon the vagueness of the information submitted to the Senate as to the nature and expense of the work to be performed ; but , he continued , his objection to the whole bill lay a little beyond this . He wished , if it could be done , to allow the General Government to retain its jurisdiction and control over the public lands , not only in Florida and Arkansas , but in every other State construct all necessary drains , and then sell the lands and allow every State in the Union to participate in the distribution of the proceeds in an equal interest . But , as he would not play the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government will not do this , then rather than that the country should remain in its present unproductive condition , he would be in favor of the States draining these lands , and appropriating them to some useful purpose . But he believed the General Government would do it better than the States , and ought to do it . He did not know but that after they had sent out competent engineers to explore , to level , and to estimate the cost of such a proceeding , and had received from them a full report of what they had done , they might ultimately adopt the course now proposed , and give these lands to the States in which they lie . By obtaining this knowledge , they could determine whether to do so or not ; and the information thus acquired would he of great value to the States to whom such lands might be given . The estimate of the maximum cost of this work is $500,000 . Could the work be accomplished for that sum , it would take the General Government one , two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas , if it was to be commenced by the State within two years , especially under the present condition of its finances , its completion need not be expected for some ten or fifteen years at the least . Mr. Westcott contended that a topographical survey of these lands would be perfectly useless to Congress . They had already authentic information from various most respectable s9urces , all of them agreeing that these lands were perfectly worthless , and would not pay the cost of surveying . The question propounded by the Senator , if he mistook not , was , whether Congress was prepared to enter upon the business of improvement with regatd to these lands , as well as to those overflowed by the Mississippi and its tributaries ? There were some who entertained constitutional objections as to the power of Congress to enhance the value of either public or private lands by making public improvements within the States . But he ( Mr. Westcott ) had other objections . Of all public improvements , those devised , carried on , and completed*by the Federal Government were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the work ; another year to make the necessary reconnoissances and surveys ; another year to put the results in proper form , in printed statements and maps ; another year to bring the matter before Congress ; another year or two to have it criticised and canvassed ; and some three or four years after that to get an act passed authorizing the commencement of the work . Except works of a peculiarly scientific character , the army officers were the worst persons to be employed on them . They are gallant in warfare , but they know very little of other matters . Lie woald rather trust the exectition of a work to a practical civil engineer than to the whole corps of topographical engineers , as high a respect as he 420 April , // had for most of them . It would be executed infinitely better by officers appointed by the State , who would be interested in having it done effectually . Mr. Downs , of Louisiana , contended for the general principle embraced in this bill . All admit , he said , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a State , to hold large bodies of public land within it which are not available either for the purposes of the General Government or for the use of the State . Here was not less than one-eighth of the State of *Florida totally worthless both to that State and the General Government . The State thinks that , instead of permitting these lands to remain a desert , where a human being can scarcely penetrate either by land or water , she can make them available . This fact being satisfactorily ascertained , there ought to be no hesitation in ceding them even without conditions . In reply to the supposition of Mr. Downs , that Mr. Underwood 's amendment embraced the principle of the distribution of the proceeds of the public lands , the latter stated that his amendment did not touch that question . He had only referred to that policy for the purpose of showing that he wished to get rid of the system which now prevails in regard to those lands . The simple question upon the amendment was , whether they should , by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once seven million eight hundred thousand acres of land ? His friend from Florida must excuse him if he had more confidence in the officers of the topographical corps than in any gentlemen who might be selected for the occasion . Mr. Johnson , of Louisiana , considered it utterly out of the question for the General Government to attempt improving those lands . There had not been a single instance of such a measure being adopted since the formation of the Government . Mr. Underwood replied , that in all applications heretofore for the cession of lands to aid in the construction of public works , the principle upon which they had been sought to be justified was , that it would render the laud still retained by the Government so much the more valuable . Why may not the Government , he asked , accomplish the same object by opening a canal or otherwise draining the land , for the purpose of making the whole so much the more valuable ? Mr. Benton thought the officers of the General Land Office were the proper persons to look to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these matters . In an official report from this source they were told that the everglades could not be surveyed without first being drained . So , then , they had all the information they needed in order to act definitively upon this bill . There is an axiom that when any property passes from hands that can not use it into hands that can use it , there is a public gain , and it was in that point of view that he regarded all these inundated lands in the United States . He had no idea of the Federal Government making money by any operation it engages in. he did not think it could do so , and it ought not if it could . Upon national considerations , as well as upon those which apply to the State , he thought it important that they should pass this bill . The further consideration of the bill was here postponed ; and the attention of the Senate was mainly occupied , until after the holydays , with private and other hills of little general interest . The only question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention of Congress , was the Bill for the DRAINAGE OF SWAMP LAND5 . On the 2d of February , Mr. Vinton moved to lay the bill on the table , giving to Louisiana the overflowed and swamp lands in that State , now unfit for cultivation , but his motion did not prevail ; yeas , 45 ; nays , 100 . The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading . Mr. Vinton moved to reconsider the vote first taken . He said that he would be glad to give his support to the bill , if he could believe that it could be done without setting a precedent which would involve the Government in very great difficulty in disposing of the public lands hereafter . This bill proposed to do what never has been done before . It does not undertake to tell the amount of lands in Louisiana unfit for cultivation . Pass this bill , and you can not sell lands there until it be decided what lands are unfit for cultivation . The effect is to take every foot of laud out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Hall , of Missouri , said that Congress had last session passed a law authorizing those who had selected lands unfit for cultivation , to select other lands in lieu thereof . Mr. Vinton replied , that that subject bore no relation to this . The greatest objection to the measure was this . Many years ago , under a resolution which was passed , the land officers and receivers were directed to report to the Gov*rnmnent what lands were unfit for cultivation . They reported three fourths in Florida , Alabama , Louisiana , Arkansas , Mississippi , and even in Illinois , one of the richest countries in the world . If this bill pass , these States will come in on Congress for siinilar favors , and with just as much reason . The swamp lands cost twice as much for the surveys as the other lands . Mr. Thibodeaux said , that to his personal knowledge , surveyors , in order to draw money from the Treasury , surveyed the marshes which have not been sold , and never will be . Mr. Vinton replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been surveyed . Mr. 1-Jarmanson said , that the number of acres of swamp 1849. 421 // lands in Lousiana was originally five millions . That State had made thirteen hundred miles of levees at a cost of more than eight millions of dollars ; by this three millions of acres had been rendered fit for cultivation , and the Government , without contributing a dollar in return for these advantages , had put the money derived from the sales into the Treasury . The lives of some of the people of Louisiana depended upon the passage of this bill ; much of the land was now overflowed . Pass it and the place of pestilence will be made a place of health . After some remarks from Mr. Brodhead in favor of the bill , Mr. Boydon moved to lay the bill on the table , which was negatived , and it was then passed ; yeas , 101 ; nays , 61 . CASE OF A NEW YORK SANTA FE TRADER . On the 22d of February , the Bill for the relief of Peter X. Harmony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on motion of Mr. Yulee . It appears that in the spring of 1846 , Mr. Harmony left St. Louis with a large caravan of merchandise for Santa Fe and Chihuahua ; near Santa Fe he was stopped by the advanced corps of General Kearny 's army , and ordered into the rear with his train , and was informed that war existed between the United States and Mexico , he being ignorant of it up to that time . Subsequently . however , Mr. harmony was permitted to leave Santa Fe and to move on with his caravan toward Chihuahua , in pursuance of his original intention , under information that he would be allowed by the Mexican authorities to trade witb the Mexican people . On his way he was intercepted by Col. Doniphan on his march to Chihuahua ; his mules and wagons were pressed into the public service , and employed as part of the army train till their arrival at Chihuahua . The fatigues of the march broke down the animals of the caravan . The goods were declared to be contraband of war by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traitors who should trade for them . After remaining in Chihauhua some two months , Colonel Doniphan moved on to Saltillo , and offered his army as an escort to Mr. Harmony 's train , if he should think fit to accompany the troops . Mr. Harmony could not go from the crippled condition of his mules ; and thus the animals , the wagons , and the goods were lost . The Bill as it passed the House provides for compensation for the mules and wagons . The committee of the Senate report an amendment , providing an indemnity for the other property-that is , the goods of the caravan . The whole bill will amount to $80,000 or $100,000 . Mr. Mason , Mr. Dickinson , Mr. Underwood , Mr. Rusk , Mr. Walker , Mr. Hale , and Mr. Upham advocated the passage of the bill as amended . Mr. Calhoun , Mr. Miles , and Mr. Bradbury opposed the amendment making restitution for the goods . The amendment was agreed to and the Bill passed. - New York Herald . ARMS FOR CALIFORNIA ADvENTIJRERS . On the 22d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration the joint resolution in favor of furnishing emigrants to California , New Mexico , and Oregon with arms and ammunition from the public stores , at the government price . The Bill was passed after a few explanatory remarks . A NEW DEPARTMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT . A report of a Bill to establish a department of the interior was presented to the House of Representatives on the 12th of February , by Mr. Vinton of the Committee of Ways and Means . This Bill was opposed by several of the members on the ground that it was brought forward too late in the session . The Bill was however read . It enacts that from and after this act there shall be created a new executive department of the government , to be called the Department of the Interior ; the head of which is to be called the Secretary of the interior , to be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate , and to receive the same salary as the other secretaries , $6000 . The Bill defines the duties of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Customs , and for an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury . The Bill was then ordered to be printed to enable the members to look into it . On the 15th February , the House resumed the consideration of the Bill , and after some debate the question on the passage of the Bill was taken , by yeas and nays , and decided in the affirmative . Yeas 112 . Nays 78 . The title of the Bill was altered to an Act to Establish the Home Department . The Bill was the next day transmitted to the Senate , duly signed by the Speaker , by the hands of the Clerk of the House . On the 17th *f February , this Bill was read in the Senate and referred to the Committee on Finance . On the 3d of 1*Iarch , the Home Department Bill was taken up in the Senate . The Department was to include the Bureau of Pensions , Indian Affairs , and Patent Office . The debate was animated , and was conducted by Messrs . King , Cameron , Bright , Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the evening session , when the Bill was warmly opposed by Mr. Mason , Mr. Allen , and Mr. Dickinson , and supported by Mr. Webster , Mr. Jefferson Davis , Mr. Berrien , and Mr. Downs . The Home Department Bill then passedthirty-one to twenty-five . 422 April , // THE MILEAGE QUESTION . In the House of Representatives , on the 21st February , this bill was taken up , regulating the mileage of members , and providing that the distance for which mileage shall be allowed be computed by the shortest continuous mail route ; and likewise restricting the amount to be appropriated to the purchase of books for the members . After some debate , the yeas and nays were called for , and taken on the passage of the bill , and decided in the affirmative byyeas , 157 ; nays , 16 . FOREIGN PAUPERS . On the 17th of February the Senate took up the resolution offered by Mr. Webster on the 8th of that month , directing an inquiry to be made into the expediency of requiring security from emigrant paupers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An amendment making provision for printing certain directions of the Supreme Court on the subject , was then submitted and agreed to , and the resolution adopted . RELIEF TO SUFFERERS BY TIlE WAR . A bill was reported in the House on the 12th February , making provisions for the families of those who have died since the war of wounds received , or diseases contracted in Mexican service . The bill was considered , read , and passed-New York Herald . CIVIL AND DIPLOMATIC APPROPRIATION BILL . The chief battle-ground of the contending parties of the North and South has , since our as summary , been an amendment , backed by Mr. Walker , the Senator from Wisconsin , to the bill for making appropriations for the civil and diplomatic expenses of Government . The amendment provided , " under the direction of the President , to extend the revenue laws , the navigation laws , the Indian laws , with all other general laws of the United States , as far as applicable , over the territory of California and the territory of New Mexico . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill making APPROPRIATIONS FOR TILE CIVIL AND DIPLOMATIC EXPENSES of the Government for the ensuing fiscal year . Several amendments were recommended by the Committee , and Mr. Atherton , of New Hampshire , gave a detailed explanation of them . All the amendments proposed , except one , were then adopted collectively , without opposition . The bill contains a provision for the ABOLITION OF FLOGGING IN THE NAVY , which the Finance Committee recommended should be stricken out . Mr. Hale , of New Hampshire , was opposed to this recommendation , and made an eloquent speech against the whole system of flogging . Mr. Badger , of North Carolina , spoke at some length in favor of the recommendation of the Committee . Mr. Yulee , of Florida , made a few remarks in favor of striking out this provision , chiefly on the ground that it did not appropriately belong to this bill . It would be better to let the Committee on Naval Affairs look into the subject of flogging ; and if they should find it proper and convenient to do so , they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niles spoke against the recommendation of the Committee , and Messrs . Butler , Breese , Clayton , ' Phelps , in favor of striking out the clause . The question was taken , and the motion to strike out carried . On the 20th Feb . Mr. Walker , of Wisconsin , submitted an amendment for the extension of the revenue laws of the United States over California and New Mexico ; also to extend the Constitution of the United States , and all general laws which are applicable , over the same ; likewise , that the President appoint the officers and make the necessary regulations to carry these provisions into effect  --  the object being to preserve order and administer justice in these territories . Mr. Bell , of Tennessee , offered an amendment to the amendment providing for a State Government in California , and striking out of Mr. Walker 's amendment everything which is inconsistent with Mr. Bell 's proposition . A discussion ensued as to the propriety of Mr. Bell 's amendment , which was sustained by the Chair and by a vote of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Senators , said , that he was much embarrassed by the disapprobation evinced by several of the Senators to his proposition ; but a sense of duty prompted him to persist , however unpleasant it might be . He saw that it was the only chance for getting a vote on this most important subject . Without concluding his remarks , at the suggestion of several Senators , Mr. Bell gave way . On the 21st , Mr. Bell resumed his remarks in support of the amendment he bad submitted . He contended , that the creation of a State Government , as provided for in tiis amendment , was strictly constitutional , and proceeded to show that such an amendment could be properly engrafted upon the bill which was under consideration . Mr. Berrien , of Georgia , rose and addressed the Senate , in an able and eloquent speech , denouncing in warm terms the proposition of the honorable Senator from Tennessee . The mode which the gentleman had taken to introduce it was a departure from all parliamentary precedent , and contrary to every rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and took exception to some of the positions which were assumed in the report of the Judiciary Committee on the subject . 1849. 423 // The yeas and nays were called , on motion , on Mr. Bell 's amendment . The result was , yeas , 4 ; nays , 39 . The vote on Mr. Walker 's amendment was postponed , in order to afford an opportunity for revisal . On the 22d , Mr. Webster submitted a few remarks , with reference to the territorial question . He concluded by exhibiting a paper which he proposed to offer , hereafter , as an amendment to the general appropriation bill , authorizing the President to maintain possession of New Mexico and California , and , for the purpose of preserving authority and order in those territories , directing him to employ such force as may be necessary of the army and navy ; the existing laws to remain in force there , and officers appointed to see that they are regularly executed ; martial law not to be proclaimed at any time , and an appropriation to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the object of the bill . The report was ordered to be printed . On the 23d , the Senate resumed the consideration of this bill . Mr. Dayton , of New Jersey , submitted , as an amendment to Mr. Walker 's amendment , the proposition of which he had given notice on Wednesday . It provides for a temporary government to be extended over New Mexico and California . Mr. Webster rose and addressed the Senate , in an eloquent speech . He said , the Senate and the country would bear him witness , that he had no hand in bringing about the state of things which had called for these proceedings . The state of things now existed ; and the business in which the Senate was now engaged showed , in a very marked manner , the impolicv of their territorial acquisitions upon the Southern border . But things past should not be mingled with things present . Sufficient for the day was the evil thereof . It was not well to dwell too much on the past , nor wise to attempt too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peaceable government to California , to preserve the lives of well-disposed residents , and to restrain those who were evil-disposed . We should not go beyond this object at present . No attempt should be made to execute the revenue laws . It could not be done without courts , which could only be established under a regular government . Any government for those territories must , at present , be substantially military . A bill had come from the House , for extending the revenue laws over the territories . The course he would recommend to the Senate would be , to resist all these amendments to the general appropriation bill ; and when that bill should be disposed of , to take up the subject of the territories , and act independently on it . If the Senate should see fit to adopt this course , when the House-bill alluded to came up , he would move to strike out all af ter the enacting clause , and insert the proposition handed in by him on Wednesday . The disposition which had been manifested by the Senate showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill were acceptable . He had avoided , and would avoid all extraneous subjects , and would bring up no subjects which were calculated to excite local prejudices . He would oppose all movements which were calculated to prevent the adoption of a secure system for regulating and preserving peace in the new territories . The Senate adjourn d without taking any further action on the bill . In the House of Representatives , on the same evening , a debate arose , incidentally , on the question of the new territories , and which we can not refrain from giving , in order to afford our readers the perusal of a sketch of one of the most able speeches which has been delivered during the late Session . It was induced by some observations offered by Mr. Turner , of Illinois , who said : That as this was perhaps the last time that his voice would be heard in that hall , he proposed to make a few remarks , expressive of some views which he held on the subject of slavery , and , in connection with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and California . He held it to be the duty of the present Congress to provide a government for each of those territories , and for this he had several reasons . First , by treaty stipulations we have bound ourselves to the inhabitants of those territories , to furnish them protection until such time as they may be admitted into the Union , as States . Many propositions have been brought before Congress pointing to this result . We have had territorial bills , and bills which proposed to admit those territories into the Union as States . He , for one , was decidedly in favor of giving them territorial , and not State governments . " It is well known to every member , that there are now people in the territories who emigrated from all parts of the Union . They have gone there , many of them , to take up permanent abodes ; others , to amass fortunes and return . but would it be just to those people , and to our friends and brethren , to impose on them the burden and expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet houses to shelter them ; their fields are not yet cultivated , and they have to rely on the surrounding country for their means of subsistence . Should we , then , throw on them the burdens of State government-burdens never before thrown on any people without their consent ? " here Mr. Turner was interrupted by a question of order , which the Chairman and the House decided in his favor . Mr. MeClelland , by permission of his colleagues , said , that if Congress should pass a law enabling the people of California to form a 424 April , // State government , it was for the people to accept or reject the law . It was not obligatory on them . He would vote for such a measure , to let the people there come into the Union . Mr. Turner was aware that there are many persons in favor of State governments for the territories at this time . He was not vain of his qualities , hut he believed that , if prejudices were entirely laid aside and stripped of externals , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State governments for the territories . There are , however , so many externals , that the minds of members are not able to receive sound arguments . But he addressed himself to his constituents and to the country ; let the test of time bear him out whether he was right or wrong . He was not aware that there was any large or respectable body of citizens of New Mexico or California who wished to come into the Union as States . Conceiving the fact that the people have the right to organize State Governments , and apply for admission into the Union , he would ask his colleague , whether the people of New Mexico and California have met in convention and applied for admission ? Until they made application , it would be an act of tyranny to force State governments upon them . Many gentlemen are in favor of this , for the purpose of avoiding the vexed question of slavery . It is not right it should be dodged in any way . It should he met boldly and fearlessly . So long as slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be settled , some way or other . It threatens the permanence of the Union . He then took up and reviewed , in condemnation , the Southern address of members of Congress . This brought up Mr. McDowell , of Virginia , who said , that he was in favor of admitting the territories of New Mexico and California as States . The bill which had been proposed by his colleague , ( Mr. Preston , ) and that introduced by the Senator from Illinois , ( Mr. Douglas , ) rest on the same basis , and must be rejected or passed on the same foundation and for similar reasons . Both these measures , however , are liable to objection ; not , in his opinion , fatal objections . He looked on them as furnishing , at a critical moment , a means by which the existing difficulty may be settled . Mr. Madison said , that the right of Congress to control a territory was founded in necessity , being a suspension of self-government ; and ought never to be extended farther , and continued longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national safety to protect-the most important and imperative obligation . On the other hand , government and laws are to be provided for the territories . In all the attempts hitherto made there has not been success ; but they have been rather prolific of apprehension and alarm , and stirring up a spirit of enmity and feud among us . In this gloomy conjecture , mediation and peace , which had no intimacy VOL . III . NO . IV . NEW SERIES . with sectional interests and feelings , which cut loose from the abounding sources of jealousy and disturbance , and to which there can be no constitutional objections , can pacifically terminate all national disputes . Our Constitution was founded upon compromise . It was a question of wisdom at that day , and is so at thn present . He called upon Congress to carry out the spirit of that instrument . The South , being the smaller portiou of the Union , was not able to protect itself from aggression from without ; therefore he asked gentlemen to act in accordance with the objects for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The people of that section , however , were determined to stand on it while it should exist . If it fall-which , God in his mercy forbid ! - and if their interests be not protected , then they will have to seek a remedy without the limits of the Constitution , as their own hearts may direct . Before such a state of things should occur , he would invoke the interposition of the safeguard of the Constitution . What State ever sacrificed so much as Virginia ? She was the most powerful of all the States , in numbers , wealth , physical capacity , and political influence ; and yet she resigned many of her advantages for the protection of the weak . He asked that the North would measure out , in return , the measure of justice which she had meted out to them ; and let the South realize , in her experience , that national generosity is not simply unadulterated national folly . Some men will not permit , by their votes , slavery to exist in the territories ' ; and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ array . But the bills to which he had adverted buried the agitating question , and made up a new issue . He asked , that the judgment of the Court , as the lawyers say , be entered on a new record . He desired to sink the question of government for the territories , and entertain the proposition to admi , them , on an equal footing with the members of the confederacy , as States , with the rights and jurisdiction of States . We have no control over the international affairs of States . The proposition plants itself on the ground of common agreement , and asks all to come forward to its support . If this be ado*ed , the bond of our brotherhood will be more complete ; the heaving ocean which rises to our feet will sink back , as smooth as glass , and tranquil as a summer 's sea . Reject it , and you may open up a pit , horrible only as the home of the lost . As to the introduction of slavery into the territories , it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one particle to their present hardships . It adds strength , however , to the South , and this is in perfect accordance with the Constitution . It was a change of locality-nothing more . Instead of letting slavery drain off , there is a desire to hedge it in . Mr. McDowell then commenced an eloquent appeal to Massachusetts , but his hour had ex-28 1849. 425 // pired . There were cries of " Go on , go on , " and by common consent he proceeded . He said that Virginia and Massachusetts were twin sisters , and had shared the horrors and perils of the Revolution ; together resisted tyranny , and assisted in establishing a common government . It was their privilege to worship here , standing at a common altar , with clean hands and honest hearts , doing right to all and wrong to none . It is their hope to carry on a glorious national career , comforting , supporting , cheering one another through the trials of the day , and showing to mankind that nothing can corrupt , and only death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolution , and at the beginning of the Revolution ; they were associates in 1777 ; they were united and equal in 1787 , co-operating equally in every sense . Was Massachusetts agreed that they should still continue to be equal ? We are admonished that republics which lose their liberty never revive . Although the spirit never dies , it does not reanimate . Would that there were here the spirit of the elder Brutus , who gave his son to the axe of justice , because he loved his country better than his son ! Would that there were here the spirit of the younger Pitt or the elder Adams , who in the midst of suffering never forgot his country , and who in his dying hour prayed that God would remember the land of his birth ! Would there were the spirit of ithe enthusiastic Frenchman , who , while listening to Mirabean when vindicating human rights , saw him fall and dying for want of blood , and who ran to him , stripped his arm , and said : * Take it from me ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country may not perish . " Give us that spirit , and our difficulties will pass away like the summer cloud . Leave the subject of slavery to the consciences and the counsels of those on whom the providence of God and the Constitution leave it . Leave it there now and forever , and stop while stop is possible , and the land of Washington will still be ours an undivided heritage . The honorable gentleman 's remarks were so eloquent , and delivered in a strain of such deep pathos ; that many hoary statesmen , " whose eyes , Albeitunosed to the melting mood , Dropp 'd tears as fast as the Arabian trees Their medininal gem . " As we have said before , the foregoing is but a sketch , a mere skeleton of the speech , and conveys but a faint idea of its merits . When Mr. McDowell resumed his seat , there was a general cry for the committee to rise . The debate on this bill was resumed in the Senate on the 24th of February , and we give some extracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webster 's opinion as to the extending of the Constitution of the United States over a new territory . The amendments with regard to California were discussed , upon which Mr. Dayton modified his proposed amendment . Mr. Downs insisted that the Constitution does extend over the new territories ; that it is competent to admit them as States ; and that California must and will , perhaps within a year , be admitted as a State into the Union . Mr. Bell took occasion to make some remarks on a speech made by Mr. Berrien in answer to his arguments on the subject . Mr. Bell contended that the position he had taken was , that Congress may create a State without admitting it into the Union ; that the people of the territory may erect themselves into a State ; but that Congress alone can create a State of this Union . Mr. Berrien disavowed any intention of misrepresenting the remarks of the Senator from Tennessee . He objected to Mr. Dayton 's amendment , because it does not declare that the Constitution is extended as a panoply for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Underwood argued that the Constitution of itself extended over the territories of the United States , and referred to some point of Mr. Webster 's argument of Saturday , which he desired to answer . Mr. Webster explained that the Congress was subservient to the Constitution in their regulations for the territories ; that the Con* stitution applied to the governing power of Congreas , not to the territory itself . The discussion was then continued , when Mr. Butler having said that the Northern States have not observed , but have broken the compromise of the Constitution , which called up Mr. Webster , who said : If the honorable Senator from South Carolina is prepared to reduce what seemed to be a general charge to a particular charge , and if he shall undertake to specify or particularize any case in which the Legislature of the State whose representative I am here has forborne to observe , or has broken , or attempted to break or violate the compromises of the Constitution , it will be my duty to meet that question , and defend the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into that , sir , at all at present . Other States can answer for themselves . It is of some importance that we should seek to have clear ideas and correct notions of the question which this amendment of the honorable Senator from Wisconsin presents to us ; and especially that we should seek to get some conception of what is meant by a proposition of law to extend the Constitution of the United States to a territory . Why , the thing is utterly impossible . All the legislatures in the world , in this general fori*n , could not accomplish it . There is no congruity ; there is no case for the action of legislative power in such a regard as that . The Constitution-why , what is it ? We ex 426 March , // tend the Constitution of the United States , by law , to a territory . Well , what is the first principle of the Constitution ? Why , is it not that all within its influence and comprehension shall he represented in the legislature which it establishes ; shall have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vote ; that all shall have representation in both houses of Legislature ? Is not that the fundamental principle of the Constitution ? Does it not all rest upon that ? Can we , by law , extend that to a territory of the United States ? Everybody will see that it is altogether impracticable . Well , the amendment goes on in the same way , and says further , that the revenue laws shall , as far as they are suitable , be applied to this case . Now , I should like to know whether that qualification of the honorable member , as he understands it , applies , as far as it is suitable , to the Constitution itself ? or whether he understands that qualification as applicable only to the revenue laws of the United States , which he proposes to establish in the territory ? Mr. Walker-I would say this , sir , that whatever may have been said in the discussion of that point , it certainly was not my meaning to frame the amendment to extend the Constitution to this territory in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only those in which it may be applicable . Mr. Webster. - Then it comes to this , that the Constitution , as far as practicable , is to be extended to the territory , and how far it is practicable is to be left to the President of the United States ; and therefore the President of the United States , after it is a territory , is an absolute despot over that territory . He is the judge of what is suitable and what is unsuitable , and what he thinks suitable he applies , and what he thinks unsuitable he refuses to apply . He is omnes in hoc . It is to say in general terms that the President of the United States shall govern this territory as he sees fit until Congress makes further provision . If that be it , it is leaving the territory exactly under the military rule which now subsists over it In its general sense there is no such thing as extending the Constitution of the United States over a territory . The Constitution of the United States is established over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be established over nothing else than the existing States , and over new States that shall come in hereafter ; when they do come in then , they come under the Constitution . The debate was continued for several hours , in which Mr. Calhoun , with his usual eloquence and ability , argued that the adoption of this proposition , that the Constitution of the United States does not extend to the territories , will have the effect of narrowing the controversy in a very great degree between the North and South on the slave question ; but contended , in opposition to Mr. Webster , that the Constitution of the United States extended over all its territories . We are sorry that our want of space precludes us from giving even a slight sketch of the many interesting debates which occupied the time of the House in regard to this subject , until the very last hour of the session ; indeed , so as to jeopardize the passage of the Civil and Diplomatic Appropriation Bill altogether , when , at 5 o'clock on Sunday morning , Mr. Bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House , and recede from their own amendment , thus clearing the bill of the last obstruction . The question was put , and the motion was carried , 38 to 7-sweeping everything out of the bill relating to a temporary government for California and New Mexico ; and thus , at a quarter past five , was the bill for the Civil and Diplomatic Appropriations finally passed . The House bill , for extending the revenue laws to California , was then , on motion of Mr. Dix , taken up and passed . The following is the bill , the sole result of all the arguments and discussions which engrossed the attention of Congress during so many weeks . THE BILL RELATING TO cALIFORNIA . An act to extend the revenue laws of the United States over the territory and waters of Upper California , and to create a collection district therein . Be it enacted , by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of Amcrica , in Congress assembled , that the revenue laws of the United States be and are hereby extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that portion of territory ceded to the United States by the " treaty of peace , friendship , and limits , between the United States of America and the Mexican Republic , " concluded on the 2nd day of February , in the year 1848 , heretofore designated and known as Upper California . Sec. 2 . And be it further enacted , that all the ports , harbors , bays , rivers , and waters of the main land of the t&amp;ritory of Upper California , shall constitute a collection district , by the name of Upper California ; and a port of entry shall be , and is hereby established for said district at San Francisco , on the bay of San Francisco ; and a collector of the customs shall be appointed by the President of the United States , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to reside at said port of entry . Sec. 3 . And be it further enacted , that ports of delivery shall be , . and are hereby established in the collection district aforesaid , at San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the territory of the United States , to be selected by the Secretary of the Treasury , as 1849. 427 // near as may be to the junction of the rivers Gila and Colorado , at the head of the Gulf of California . And the collector of said district of California is hereby authorized to appoint , with the approbation of the Secretary of the Treasury , three deputy collectors , to be stationed at the ports of delivery aforesaid . Sec. 4 . And be it further enacted , that the collector of said district shall be allowed a compensation of $1,600 per annum , and the fees and commissions allowed by law ; and the said deputy collectors shall each be allowed a compensation of $1000 per annum , and the fees and commissions allowed by law .

Sec. 6 . And be it further enacted , that this act shall take effect from and after the 10th of March next . INAUGURATION srEEcH . On the 5th of March , at 12 o'clock , General Zachary Taylor , President of the United States , delivered the following Inaugural Address to the Senate and Members of the House of Representatives of the United States , and a vast concourse of citizens assembled in front of the Capitol . INAUGURAL Annazss . Elected by the American people to the highest office known to our laws , I appear here to take the oath prescribed by the Constitution ; and , in compliance with a time-honored custom , to address those who are now assembled . The confidence and respect shown by my countrymen , in calling me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank among the nations of the earth , have inspired me with feelings of the most profound gratitude ; but when I reflect that the acceptance of the office which their partiality has bestowed , imposes the discharge of the most arduous duties , and involves the weightiest obligations , I am conscious that the position which I have been called to fill , though sufficient to satisfy the loftiest ambition , is surrounded by fearful responsibilities . Happily , however , in the performance of my new duties , I shall not be without able co-operation . The legislative and judicial branches of the government present prominent examples of distinguished civil attainments and matured experience ; and it shall be my endeavor to call to my assistance in the Executive departments individuals whose talents , integrity , and purity of character will furnish ample guaranties for the faithful and honorable performance of the trusts to be committed to their charge . With such aids , and an honest purpose to do whatever is right , I hope to execute diligently , impartially , and for the best interests of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the discharge of these duties , my guide will be the Constitution , which I this day swear to preserve , protect , and defend . For the interpretation of that instrument , I shall look to the decisions of the judicial tribunals established by its authority , and to the practice of the government under the earlier Presidents , who had so large a share in its formation . To the example of those illustrious patriots I shall always defer with reverence , and especially to his example who was , by so many titles , the Father of his country . To command the Army and Navy of the United States ; with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties and to appoint ambassadors and other officers ; to give to Congress information of the state of the Union , and recommend such measures as he shall judge to be necessary ; and to take care that the laws shall be faithfully executed-these are the most important functions entrusted to the President by the Constitution ; and it may be expected that I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution . Chosen by the body of the people , under the assurance that my administration would be devoted to the welfare of the whole country , and not to the support of any particular section or merely local interest , I this day renew the declarations I have heretofore made , arid proclaim my fixed determination to maintain , to the extent of my ability , the government in its original purity , and to adopt as the basis of my public policy , those great republican doctrines which constitute the strength of our national existence . In reference to the army and navy , lately employed with so much distinction in active service , care shall be taken to insure the highest condition of efficiency ; and in furtherance of that object , the military and naval schools sustained by the liberality of Congress . shall receive the special attention of the Executive . As American freemen , we can not but sympathize in all efforts to extend the blessings of civil and political liberty ; but , at the same time , we are warned by the adwionitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to abstain from entangling alliances with foreign nations . In all disputes between conflicting governments , it is our interest , not less than our duty , to remain strictly neutral , while our geographical position , the genius of our institutions and our people , the advancing spirit of civilization , and , above all , the dictates of religion , direct us to the cultivation of peaceful and friendly relations with all other powers . It is to be hoped that no international question can now arise which a government , confident in its own strength , and resolved to protect its own just rights , may not settle by wise negotiation , and it eminently becomes a government like our own , founded on the morality and intelligence of its citizens , and upheld by their affections , to exhaust every resort of honor-428 April , // 429 qwq great interests of Agriculture , Commerce , and Manufactures ; to improve our rivers and harbors ; to provide for the speedy extinguishment of the public debt ; to enforce a strict accountability on the part of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all public expenditures ; but it is for the wisdom of Congress itself , in which all legislative powers are vested by the Constitution , to regulate these and other matters of domestic policy . I shall look with confidence to the enlightened patriotism of that body , to adopt such measures of conciliation as may harmonize conflicting interests and tend to perpetuate that union which should be the paramount object of our hopes and affections . In any action calculated to promote an object so near to the heart of every one who truly loves his country , I will zealously unite with the co-ordinate branches of the government . In conclusion , I LiST OF THE NEW cABiNET . On the 6th of March a message was received from the President , after which the Senate went into Executive Session on the following nominations : JOHN M. CLAYTON , of Del. , Secretary of State . Win . M. MEREDITH , of Pa. , Secretary of the Treasury . THOMAS EWING , of Ohio , Secretary of the Home Department . Win .
