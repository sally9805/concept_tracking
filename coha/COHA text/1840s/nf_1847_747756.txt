" They were , indeed , men of renown ; remarkable in their day and generation for many " worthy deeds , " which it were well to remember and emulate . They " obtained a good report through faith , " so that the barrel of meal and cruise of oil failed not in the most trying times .

" * To drink deeply of the spirit of the Bible , is the surest pledge that we shall walk worthy of those who have preceded us in the ways of virtue and righteousness . Our fathers were remarkable for their longevity , and the extent of their literary attainments ; but , above all , for their spirit of enterprise ; their bold , persevering habits ; their independence of mind and character , irrespective of the popular will ; and for the similarity and purity of their religious faith . The united ages of the seventeen persons noticed in these sketches amount to 1,142 years , averaging 67 years to each ; the oldest being 82 , and the voun " ; est 50 years . Thev were not all , indeed , liberally educated men , nor did they all think precisely alike on religious and theological subjects ; but they evidently had a paramount regard to the claims of education . They manifested /z/ and imparted to others a sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherished a deep sense of the necessity of personal holiness . By these means , they exerted no inconsiderable influence on the minds and hearts of the community in which they lived , labored , and died . There seems to be a growing desire , on the part of many , to know more of their ancestors : the places where they lived ; their habits of life ; their trials and hardships ; and their modes of thinking and acting , not only upon the topics familiar to them , but especially upon such subjects as have come down to us , and now engross the public mind . If we find them differing from us , we immediately begin to look at the circumstances by which they were surrounded , and the influences which were likely to lead them to a given course of action . We believe this inclination to study the past , and especially to make genealogical researches , is productive of the most salutary results . A few years since , the author of this little work , ignorant of the biography of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of study ; and , pursuing his inquiries from time to time , found his interest deepening at every step of his course , and began to wonder tiiat no one had offered to the public the many interestingparticulars opened up to his view . He therefore solicited several persons to embody the facts.fand to prepare a volume for the press ; but , finding none willing to perform the task , he was compelled , in lieu of a more competent hand , to engage in it himself . The preparation of this volume was a pleasing task ; but , though the book itself is small in size , /z/ the labor of collecting and arranging its materials Mas of considerable magnitude , undergone amid the pressure of other duties , and often detracting from the necessary hours of repose . The author would here gratefully acknowledge his obligations to those gentlemen who not only lent him books , but gave him transcripts from their own memoranda . Among them , he would particularly mention the Rev. Jotham Sewall , of Maine , now eighty-four years of age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descendant of Rev. Samuel Moody , furnished much information respecting Samuel and Joseph Moody ; the Rev. Jonathan Greenleaf , for many years pastor of a church in " Wells , who rendered essential service in relation to the same individuals ; and the Rev. William Cogswell , D.D. , late of Gilmanton Theological Seminary ; the Rev. President Allen , now of Northampton ; and the Rev. T. H. Miller , of Portsmouth , each of whom afforded more or less assistance . The memoir of Paul Moody was written by the Rev. Dr. Edson , of Lowell , who was well acquainted with Mr. Moody . MR . WILLIAM MOODY , the principal progenitor of our name in New England , came , according to the best records we can obtain , from Wales , England , in 1G33 ; wintered in Ipswich in 1634 : and removed to Newbury , with the first settlers of that place , in 1635 . Tradition asserts that they landed on the north bank of the river , about one hundred rods below the spot where the bridge now stands. * Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant of ninety-two acres of land . His wife 's /z/ name was Sarah , by whom , according to uniform tradition , he had three children ,  --  Samuel , Joshua and Caleb . Joshua was born in 1632 , Caleb in 1 637 , and the date of Samuel 's birth we have not obtained , but it is generally supposed that he was born previous to his father 's emigration to this country . The indefatigable historian of " Ould Newbury , " Joshua Coffin , Esq. , asserts that Mr. Moody had a fourth son , William , and endeavors to prove this assertion by giving the date of his marriage , the names of his children , &c.; We regret to be compelled to dissent from so high an authority ; but Mr. Coffin himself has furnished us with the grounds of our doubt . He says that William was married in 1684 , at which time the three other brothers had been married between twenty-five and thirty years . Supposing him to have been born near the time of his father 's coming to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his marriage , about fifty years of age . Then , again , his death is put down as having occurred in 1730 , making him about one hundred years of age . His wife 's death is mentioned as having taken place in 1702 , aged 38 , rather a young woman to be united to a man of his years . Now we think all this may be very satisfactorily explained , by supposing that Mr. Coffin has identified William , first son of Samuel Moody , as a son of William , instead of a grandson . Taking this explanation to be the fact in the case , there will then appear no discrepancy in dates , or improbabilities as to age . Mr. Coffin 's assertion is also contradicted by various statements of the writer 's grandfather , Rev. Silas Moody , who was born more than one hundred years ago , in New- /z/ bury , and was probably well acquainted with the genealogy of his ancestors . William Moody , as well as his three sons , were of considerable note , both in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The names of " William , Samuel , and Caleb Moody often occur in the various committees of the church ; from which we may infer that they were not only pious men , but also possessed much practical wisdom and general intelligence . There is a tradition that William Moody was by trade a blacksmith , * and that he was the first derson in New England who adopted the practice of shoeing oxen , to enable them to walk on ice . Whether he ever acquired the enviable appellation of " the learned blacksmith , " is a matter of some doubt ; but that he was a generous patron of letters , seems evident from the fact that so large a number of his immediate descendants entered the learned professions . Indeed , almost all the early Moodys were distinguished by the maturity and activity of their minds , and their uncommon intelligence , having exhibited an enlightened and far-reaching observation quite in advance of the age in which they lived . There have been nearly forty persons of the name , who have graduated at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of William , and brother of the Rev. Joshua Moodv , was twice married , and had a large family . He was representative of Newbury in the General Court of * Coffin says that he was a saddler . It is not improbable that , when the saddle and the pillion served the purposes of the more comfortable carriage , the blacksmith and the saddler were united in one person , as we now not unfrequently see the blacksmith and the carriage maker . /z/ Massachusetts , for the years 1677-8 . During the tyrannical administration of Andros , Mr. Moody , in 1 688 , was imprisoned five weeks , for daring to speak and act like a freeman ; his account of which is graphically given in Coffin 's History of Newbury , p. 150 . The chief offence seemed to be his having in his possession a paper , the title of which was , " New England alarmed , To rise and be armed , Let not papist you charme , I mean you no harme , ' 1 &c.; The purport of the paper was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in , being under the sad circumstances of an arbitrary government .

There are several families of our name in the western part of Massachusetts , who are all supposed to have originated from a Mr. Samuel Moody , who , Coffin asserts , came to New England in 1635 , went to Hartford , and thence to Hadley , with the first settlers . He had three sons  --  John , Samuel , and Ebenezer  --  and three daughters . John had five children , and died in Hartford . Samuel died at eighty years of age , and Ebenezer at eighty-three . There is a tradition that Samuel Moody , of Hadley , was a brother of the William Moody who settled in Newbury ; but we have no facts to establish this tradition . It will be observed that the name of Joshua Moody is spelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which we have followed . /z/ Joshua Coffin , Esq. , in a letter to the author , remarks that  --  " Rev. Joshua Moodet was remarkable , even among the Puritans , for his decision of character , his indomitable and unflinching firmness under great and peculiar trials , and above all for his decided opposition to the delusion which , in the time of the Salem witchcraft , in 1692 , had , with few exceptions , deceived the whole population of Massachusetts , and which , in the death of nineteen persons , had so tragical a result . Had it not been for his boldness , the number would doubtless have been greater . The memory of such a man deserves to be honored , as exhibiting a beautiful combination of talents , piety , firmness , a conscientious adherence to the convictions of duty , with a singular exemption from the superstitions pecidiar to his age . The Rev. Samuel Moodt. of York , familiarly known even* where as ' Father Moody , * was distinguished in his day for his talents , his piety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anecdotes of him , illustrating each of these traits , are still told , which , if collected , Avould be exceedingly interesting , as exhibiting a character which , either in the ministry or out , is at any time rarely found .

Perhaps , from no academy in Xew England , has such a constellation of talent been sent to old Harvard , as were fitted for that venerable institution by good old Master Moody . There are still others of the name , of later date , who deserve a notice , particularly Mr. Paul Moody , whose history would be almost identified with the history of Waltham and Lowell . But I need not enlarge . I will only add , that there are still in Newbury several families of the name , some of whom occupy the same farms held by their ancestors , of the same name , more than two hundred years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been , and still is , one of high respectability . " ' /z/ Joshua Moodey , son of William Moodey , one of the original settlers of Newbury , was born in England , in the year 1633 , about one year before his father came to this country . He received the rudiments of his early education at Newbury , and was probably prepared for admission to college by the Rev. Thos . Parker of that town , who , besides discharging his ministerial duties , generally had twelve or fourteen scholars under his tuition . He was undoubtedly well fitted to enter college , especially if he enjoyed the instruction of this eminent classical scholar . He was graduated at Harvard College in 1653 , after which he commenced the study of divinity , and very early began to preach . He had , before leaving Cambridge , made a public profession of religion , and joined the church in that town . He commenced his ministerial labors , in Portsmouth , N. H. , early in the year 1658 , at which place he laid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Church in that place . He was then supported by eighty-six subscribers . In the year 1660 , the town passed a regular vote for his establishment in the pastoral office , but for some reason , he was not ordained until 1671 , at which time the first church was gathered , though it appears he preached there statedly from the time of his first coming. * That part of New England owed much to the talents , the example , fidelity and zeal of Mr. Moodey . He was one of the first clerical characters of the country , and showed a noble spirit of independence and faithfulness to his Master 's cause under uncommon trials . /z/ His account of gathering and carrying on the Church of Christ in Portsmouth , which is written in a fair hand , will , no doubt , be more acceptable than any abridgment of it which the writer of this sketch can offer . " We find it copied at large , from his records , in Alden 's Account of Religious Societies in Portsmouth , from which we transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the same source . " Portsmouth , N. E. , anno 1671 . After many serious endeavors , which had been used /z/ by the then minister of the place , since the pastor of the church there , in public and by several of the inhabitants in private , the Lord , without whose presence and blessing man builds in vain , was pleased at length to lay the foundation of an house for himself in this place , of the beginning and progress whereof here follows a brief but true account . " In the winter time of the foregoing year , viz. : 1670 , there were several meetings together of the minister with several of the inhabitants , who were members of other congregations in the country , and by providence settled inhabitants in Portsmouth , to discourse and confer about that great work and necessary duty of entering into church fellowship , that themselves might enjoy all the ordinances of the Lord 's house and their little ones might also be laid near God 's altars , and brought up under the instruction and discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other churches , any longer satisfy themselves to live without the enjoyment of these edifying and strengthening ordinances , that their souls had in some measure , formerly tasted the good of , though now , for some years been kept from . Others also w T ell aifected to the w T ork , professed their longings after those fat and marrowed things in God 's house , and their readiness to join with them in helping to build , if they should be found fit for the same . /z/ u Hereupon , several assembled in private , and sought the Lord by fasting # and prayer , that he would discover to us a right way , there being many fears and discouragements before us , for ourselves and our little ones , and we hope we may say he was entreated of us , as the event hath in some measure , blessed be his name , made manifest . " It was agreed that those , which were in full communion with other congregations abroad , should acquaint the respective churches , to which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire their advice , approbation , countenance , and . prayers therein , which was accordingly done . " There was a meeting appointed in a private house , wherein all , that had given their names for the work , were to assemble and read to each other , a reason of the hope that was in them , by giving account of their knowledge and experience , that so they might be satisfied one in another , and be capable of joining together as members of the same body . Several davs were spent in this exercise , to the mutual refreshing and endearing of the speaker , and to the awakening and warning of others of the neighbors that were , as they had liberty to be , present at these exercises . " In fine , there was another meeting to inquire whether all , that had made relations , /z/ were so satisfied one in another , as to their relations and conversations , as that they could with freedom of spirit join in a body together , and unite in the same society , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay upon the spirit of any , with reference to one or other of the forementioned company , was lovingly and plainly propounded , and satisfaction was ingenuously tendered on the one party and accepted by the other . Furthermore , wc did discourse of and discover our apprehensions and persuasions concerning the order and discipline of the house of God . And there was an unanimous consent unto what had been publicly delivered in many sermons in the latter end of the year 1670 , and the beginning of the vear 1 ( 371 , from Ezekiel 43 : 10 , 11 , 12 , about the laws , ordinances , and forms of the house , with the goings out thereof , and the coinings in thereof . Of such high concernment did and do we account it to be for peace and edification of the whole , that both pastor and people should in these matters , at least for the substance , and as near as may be in mere circumstantials also , speak the same things . " Hereupon there were some appointed to acquaint the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with what was thought on among - us , that by the good liking and encouragement of the same , we might make an orderly and comfortable procedure in the work be- /z/ fore us . Which being clone , several churches were sent to and entreated to send their elders and messengers upon the which was appointed for the gathering of the church and ordination of officers therein . The church of Cambridge was sent to , because the pastor did belong to that church . They brought his dismission . Also the church of Ipswich , Rowley , and Hampton . They met accordingly and Gov . Leverett came also . " He that was appointed pastor , preached in the morning out of Ezekiel 48 : 35. t The name of the city from that day shall be , The Lord is there . ' ' After sermon , some intermission was made , and on their meetins : again , the pastor , with all those who were to be the beginners of the new church , made their relations , and those who were members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations , whether members or non-members , and they were approved of by the messengers of churches , and embodied into a Church by an explicit covenant . Then the pastor was ordained , after the unanimous vote of the church for choice of him , and liberty given to all the congregation to object , if they had aught to say . He was ordained by several of the elders , at the desire of the church , Mr. Cabot giving him his charge , and Mr. " Wheelwright the right hand of fellowship . Then the pastor ordained Samuel Haines Deacon , with the imposition of hand and /z/ prayer . A psalm was sung , and the congregation dismissed by the pastor with a prayer and blessing . " The following is " The Church Covenant that those , who first embodied , did on that day publicly and solemnly enter into . " We do this day solemnly and publicly , in the presence of God and his people , avouch the one only living and true God , Father , Son , and Spirit , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be our rule , and do with ourselves give up our children to be the Lord 's . We do also professedly and heartily subject ourselves to Jesus Christ , as the Head of his Church , and do covenant and promise that we will submit ourselves to the government of Christ in this particular church , according to the laws of his house , that we will watch over our brethren and be watched over by them , according to rule , and that we will in all things so demean ourselves towards our pastor and fellow-members , as also towards all others , as becomes the gospel , that the Lord may dwell among us , and bless us , and we may be a peculiar people to his service and glory . And all this we promise by the help of Jesus Christ , and in his name , looking up to him for assistance , as being of ourselves capable of doingnothing . " " Subscribed by Joshua Moodey , John Cntt , Richard Cutt , Elias Stileman , Richard Martyn , Samuel Haines , James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ From this ancient and interesting document , from the fellowship of Mr. Moodey with the ministers of Massachusetts , and from his published works , it is pretty well known what were his religious sentiments . Thej were not the caricatures of Calvinism , which have been so often and so unfairly charged upon some of the early divines of New England ; but were substantially those sentiments which are embodied in the Shorter Catechism of the General Assembly of Divines , or in the doctrinal articles of the Church of England . As a minister , Mr. Moodey was zealous and faithful . For a series of vears the Church flourished under his pastoral care , during which time he distinguished himself by his independent and faithful manner of preaching , and the strictness of his church discipline . /z/ The connection which had been so happily formed and long preserved with the church at Portsmouth , was at length sundered by a transaction which illustrates his unbending integrity and fidelity as a man and as a pastor of a christian church . The Lieut . Governor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general influence of Mr. Moodey was the chief obstacle to the accomplishment of his own schemes of self-aggrandizement . Failing of success in /z/ his favorite plans , he resolved to inflict upon the unyielding pastor some memorable marks of his unjustifiable resentment . At this time , ( 1684 , ) an occurrence took place which served to excite in the bosom of the Lieut . Governor a more definite purpose of persecution . A Scotch ketch that had been seized by the Collector , was carried out of the harbor in the night , the owner of which , George J , a member of the church , swore , upon trial , that he had not had a hand in sending her away , and that he knew nothing about it ; but , the circumstances were such , that there were strong suspicions he had perjured himself . He found means , however , to settle the matter with Cranfield and the Collector ; but Mr. Moodey judged it necessary , notwithstanding what the Governor had done , to do something to vindicate the honor of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence , for the purpose of instituting an ecclesiastical examination . Mr. Cranfield ordered the minister to desist from his attempt , and threatened him with severe consequences in case of a refusal . Mr. Moodey was not to be thus intimidated . With admirable firmness he resolved to do his duty , at any hazard . He preached a sermon " upon swearing and the evil of false swearing , " and had several church meetings , called the offender to an account , and , at length , brought him to a public confession . This pro- /z/ ceeding on the part of Mr. Moodey , irritated Cranfield to the highest degree . In order to have an opportunity to wreak his vengeance upon the persevering and conscientious pastor , he was determined to put the uniformity act into operation . By a statute then in force , or perhaps by an arbitrary construction of the statute , ministers were required to admit to the Lord 's Supper all persons who should desire it , who were " of suitable years , and not vicious , " according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice to Mr. Moodey , that he , with Robert Mason and John Hincks , intended , on the following Sunday , to partake thus of the sacrament . His demand was not complied with . The consequence was , Mr. Moodey was indicted , Feb. 5th , 1684 , and imprisoned for thirteen weeks . See Belknap 's History N. H. vol. 1 . In the complaint against Mr. Moodey , he was contemptuously set forth as having the semblance and appearance of a minister , who had refused to administer the sacrament to the ' honble Edward Cranfield , esq . governor of his majesty 's province of New-Hampshire , Robert Mason , esq. , proprietor , and John Hincks , esq . of the said province . " The following is the order issued to the Sheriff , by which he was taken to prison :  --  " In His Majesty 's name you are hereby required forthwith to take and apprehend the body and person of Joshua Moodey , of Portsmouth , in the said /z/ province , dark , and carry him to the prison of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Richard Abbot , is hereby required to receive him the said Joshua Moodey and keep him in safe custody in the said prison , he having bin convicted of administering the sacraments contrary to the laws and statutes of England , and refusing to administer the sacraments according to the rites and ceremonies of the church of England , and the form enjoined in the said statutes . There to remain for the space of six months next ensuing , without bail or mainprize . Fail not . "  --  Belknap 's Hist . N. Hampshire , vol. i. p. 321 . The following account of this transaction is in Mr. Moodey 's own language : " The Pastor was indicted by Governor Cranfield , for refusing to administer the sacrament of the Lord 's Supper unto him , after the way of the Church of England , and because he had often administered it another way . He pleaded liberty of conscience , allowed by the commission , but was impleaded by Joseph Raynes , King 's Attorney , and was sent to prison , where he continued thirteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , was dismissed , with a charge to preach no more , on pain of further imprisonment . The persecution being personal , and his mouth utterly stopped , while the other ministers in the Province were undisturbed , and there being a door opened to preach elsewhere , it was thought advisable for him to take up with a call to the Old Church in Boston , where he continued preaching till the year 1692 , and /z/ of the word , what ignoranse , profanes and misery must needes ensue !

Let this good work for the house of God be done by you , that you may be blessed of God , for good , according to all you have done for his house , and that at such a time when it was so laid waste . You will thereby not only visit me in prison , but feed a great multitude of the hungry and thirsty little ones of Christ , which will be accounted for at that day . But why do I plead more ? Thinks I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stop ; I am more ready to grant than you to ask ; and when you ask two , I intend three or four days .

Now pray for line that I may have an humble heart , and that nay whole soul , body and spirit , may be sanctified , and kept blameless to that day ; that my p lace of prisonment may be as at Patmos , a pla.ce wherein I may be in the Spirit not only on the Lord 's day but every day ; that I m &y; so demean myself as that God 's glory , &nd; my own edification and salvation , may he the fruit of my confinement .

I am , more than ever , /z/ We may well remark here , in the language of the devout Baxter , that " God seldom gives his people so sweet a foretaste of their future rest , as in their deep afflictions . He keeps his most precious cordials for the time of our greatest faintings and dangers . He gives them when he knows they are needed and will /z/ be valued , and when lie is sure to be thanked for them , and that his people will be rejoiced bj them . Especially when our sufferings arc more directly for his cause , then he seldom fails to sweeten the bitter cup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ preach such comforts to his disciples , as when i their hearts were sorrowful ' at his departure ? When did he appear among them , and say , ' Peace be unto you , ' but when they were shut up for fear of the Jev s ? When did Stephen see heaven opened , but when he was giving up his life for the testimony of Jesus ? Is not that our best state , wherein we have most of God ? " /z/ On several occasions Mr. Moodey made very commendable efforts in behalf of the interests of literature . In 1669 , when he was minister at Portsmouth , and there was a proposal for a general collection throughout the colony of Massachusetts , for the purpose of erecting a new brick building at Harvard College , the old wooden one being small and decayed , Mr. Moodey , by his exertions at Portsmouth , and by his influence , aided by other friends of learning , obtained the subscription for that object of per annum for sevQn years . The address to the General Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by Mr. Moodey . The following is a copy of it , found in the Colony Records of Massachusetts :  --  " To the much honored General Court , of the Massachusetts Colony , assembled at Boston , 20th May , 1669 . The humble address of the inhabitants of the town of Portsmouth , humbly shewefh , That seeing by your means , under God , we enjoy much peace and quietness , and very worthy deeds are done to us , by the favorable aspect of the government of this colony upon us , we accept it always in all places with all thankfulness ; and though we have articled with yourselves for exemption from public charges , yet we never articled with God and our own consciences , for exemption from gratitude , which to demonstrate , while we were studying , the loud groans of the sinking college in its present low estate , came to our ears ; the relieving of which we account a good work for the house of our God , and needful for the perpetuating of knowledge , both religious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore grateful to yourselves whose care and study is to seek the welfare of our Israel . " The premises considered , we have made a collection in our town of sixty pounds per annum , ( and hope to make it more. ) which said sum is to be paid annuallv , for these seven years ensuimr , to be improved at the discretion of the Honored Overseers of the College , for the behoof of the same and the advancement of good literature there , hoping withal that the example of ourselves ( which have been accounted no people ) will provoke the rest of the country to jealousy , ( we mean an holy emulation in so good a work , ) and that this Honored Court will in their wisdom see meet vigorouslv to act for diverting the sad omen to poor New England , of a College begun and completely upheld while we were little , should sink now we are grown great , especially after /z/ so large and profitable an harvest that this country and other places have reaped from the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oblige us to endeavor the approving ourselves to be Your thankful and humble servants , John Cutt , Richard Cutt , Joshua Moodey , u . In the name and behalf of the rest of the Subscribers in the town of Portsmouth . " This address was presented to the court by the last two , on the twentieth of May , 1669 , when it was gratefully accepted , " and the governor , in the name of the whole court met together , returned the thanks of the court for their pious and liberal gift in the college herein mentioned . " /z/ As before related , after his persecution in Portsmouth , he fled to Boston , where he was received with open arms by the members of the First Church , and on the third of May , 1684 , an arrangement was happily effected for him to cooperate with Rev. Mr. Allen , as assistant preacher to that church . The following extracts from the church records , will show how Mr. Moodey was introduced to the situation he there held . " 11 , 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church in Boston : " Q. Brethren , the Providence of God having brought Mr. Joshua Moodey unto the town under such circumstances , as you know , whether you be /z/ willing , that , in the name of the church , he be desired , during his abode and residence here , to be constantly helpful to our teacher . Mr. James Allen , in preaching the word of God among us ? Voted , affirmatively . " The providence of God having cast Rev. Mr. Joshua Moodey among us , by shutting the door of liberty for his ministry in his own Church , at Portsmouth , we do earnestly desire that he would constantly exercise ministry with our teacher among us , until he hath free and open liberty to return to them again , which we express as an explanation of our former vote by our mind therein . u Voted unanimously , as attest , James Allen , John Wiswall . " Here lie commenced his labors under flattering circumstances . The congregation were pleased with him , as a man , as a scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his literary and scientific attainments , that on the death of President Rogers , July 2 , 1684 , he was elected his successor , as President of Harvard College . But he modestly declined the honor of that station , preferring his situation as assistant minister in the First Church . Mr. Moodey had distinguished himself as an ardent friend of that independent ecclesiastical action promulgated by the Puritans , and adopted and sustained by the Congregationalists . Mr. Allen , his associate in Boston , had felt the iron hand of persecution in England : thus they were fit companions to sustain and comfort each other under the peculiar trials they were called to endure . At this /z/ time ( 1686 ) efforts were made grossly to infringe upon the rights of the independent churches , and to subvert some of their most cherished privileges . The author of the History of the First Church , in Boston , in commenting upon these matters , says , " Mr. Allen was one of the two thousand ministers who , in 1662 , had , in a manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , with its growth , had acquired a respectable degree of independence and hardihood ; and the designs and manners of Englishmen , arriving from the parent country , as they were not altogether calculated to secure confidence , began to awaken unpleasant suspicions . The presence of the excellent Moodey reminded every one of the imperious and abominable conduct of Cranfield , who had insisted that the Lord 's Supper should be administered conformably to the English Liturgy , and in no other way ; and the behaviour of Randolph and Andros wore a similar aspect . In this state of things a meeting was held at Mr. Allen 's , at which all the ministers , and four of each congregation were present . They had the same impression respecting the intention of the governor . They believed that he purposed making use of a meeting house for the celebration of public worship according to the liturgy ; and they were agreed in opinion , that they ought to frustrate his purpose .  - -  Their counsels , however , were ineffectual . /z/ After viewing the three meeting houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonging to the Third , or Old South Society . It was in vain that the measure was deplored by a number of the most respectable proprietors ; that they urged their right to the edifice , and the land on which it stood , and the cruelty of infringing on their religious immunities.  - -  The governor caballed with two or three busy bodies , and ordered the sexton of the church to open the doors and ring the bell . The fellow durst not refuse obedience to the first magistrate of the colony , and the service was per formed in the meeting house agreeably to his wishes . This infraction on the rights of Congregationalists was perhaps never repeated ; for immediately afterwards the first Episcopal Society in Boston was instituted , and a church consecrated to the English establishment . " /z/ " Among the enlightened , bold , and faithful ecclesiastics of New England , in her infantile state , Joshua Moocley , who now for several years had adorned the pulpit of the First Church , will ever stand in a conspicuous station . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his worth , should , on the prospect of losing him , make a formal effort to detain him as a permanent associate with their present pastor . " Consequently the church voted , 22d July , 1691 , " to inquire of the deacons about the /z/ way to pay for the rent of Mr. Moodey 's house , " and to see " what is given and fit to be settled on our teaching officer , to be uithout variation . " /z/ While Mr. Moodey was a resident of Boston , he evinced the enlargement and independence of his mind , by stemming the swollen tide of excitement which the subject of witchcraft had called forth . Unlike some of the ministers of the age , he declined giving any countenance to the severe measures which the popular will loudly demanded . His usefulness in Boston was seriously abridged by the anathemas which his manly resistance to a popular and spreading delusion , drew upon him . It was chiefly by his moral courage , that a gentleman and his wife , who had been lodged in jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws in those days awarded to persons suspected of witchcraft . An account of this is particularly narrated in the following letter , by Rev. William Bently , of Salem , published in the 10th vol . Coll . Mass . Hist . Soc . : " In the times of the witchcraft in Salem village , no person , distinguished for property , and known in the commercial world , was accused , but Philip English . He came while young into America , from the island of Jersey ; lived /z/ in the family of Mr. Holling worth , a rich inhabitant of Salem , and afterwards married his only daughter and child , Susanna . The wife had received a better education than is common , even at this day , as proofs I hold sufficiently discover . " " From some prejudices , as early as 21st April , 1692 , she was accused of witchcraft , examined , and committed to prison in Salem . Her firmness is memorable . Six weeks she was confined ; but being visted by a fond husband , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison . By the intercession of friends , and by a plea that the prison was crowded , they were removed to Arnold 's jail , in Boston , till the time of trial . " In Boston , upon giving bail , they had the liberty of the town , only lodging in prison . Upon their arrival , Messrs . Willard and Moodey visited them , and discovered every disposition to console them in their distress . On the day before they were to return to Salem , Mr. Moodey waited upon them in the prison , and invited them to the public worship . On the occasion , he chose for the text , ' If they jiersecute you in one city , flee to another . ' ' In the discourse , with a manly freedom , he justified every attempt to escape from the forms of justice , when justice was violated in them . After service , Mr. Moodey visited the prisoners in the jail , and asked Mr. English whether he took notice of his discourse ? Mr. /z/ English said he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wished some conversation upon the subject . Mr. Moodey then frankly told him that his life was in danger , and he ought by all means provide for an escape . ' Many/ said he , i have suffered . ' Mr. English then replied , ' God will not suffer them to hurt me . ' Upon this reply , Mrs. English said to her husband , ' do you not think that they who have suffered already , are innocent V He said , ' Yes . ' ; Why , then , may not we suffer also ? Take Mr. Moodey 's advice . ' Mr. Moodey then told Mr. English that if he would not carry his wife away , he would . He then informed him that he had persuaded several worthy persons in Boston to make provision for their conveyance out of the colony , and that a conveyance had been obtained , encouraged by the Governor , jailor , &c,; which would come at midnight ; and that proper recommendations had been obtained to Governor Fletcher , of New York ; so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the journey ; that all things were amply provided . The Governor also gave letters to Governor Fletcher , and , at the time appointed , Mr. English , his wife and daughter , were taken and conveyed to New York . He found , before his arrival , that Mr. Moodey had despatched letters ; and the Governor , with many private gentlemen , came out to meet him ; and the Governor entertained /z/ him at his own house , and paid him every attention , while he remained in the city . On the next year , he returned . " In all this business , Mr. Moodey openly justified Mr. English , and , in defiance of all the prejudices which prevailed , expressed his abhorrence of these measures , which had obliged a useful citizen to flee from the executioners . Mr. Moodey was commended by all discerning men , but he felt the angry resentment of the deluded multitude of his own times , among whom some of high rank were included . He soon after left Boston and returned to Portsmouth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , in consequence of the ungenerous treatment she had received . Her husband died at 86 years of age , in 1784 . " This is the substance of the communication made to me at different times from Madam Susanna Hartshorne , his great-grand-daughter , who died in Salem , 28th August , 1802 , at the age of 80 years , who received the account from the descendants of Mr. English , who dwelt upon his obligations to Mr. Moodey with great pleasure . " During Mr. Moodey 's nine years ' residence in Boston , as assistant minister of the First Church , he often visited the church in Portsmouth , and kept their private meetings and fasts , and so that bereaved church ' held together , though some removed , and others were taken away by death . ' /z/ After the departure of Lieutenant-Governor Cranfield , who had shown himself worthy of a mitre under Archbishop Laud , messengers were several times sent from Portsmouth to Boston , to treat with Mr. Moodey about his return . Copies of the letters , which passed between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserved in the town records of Portsmouth , from which it appears that the affection between him and the people of his former charge , was mutually retained . In 1691 , the people of Portsmouth , having invited Rev. John Cotton , afterwards of Hampton , to settle there , Mr. Moodey wrote to the town on the 29th of May , informing them that he would return , if it were their wish ; and at the same time expressed his opinion that they had been hasty in giving a call to Mr. Cotton . He had previously written to the church , stating his willingness to return and renew his pastoral relation with them , if it were thought best , and proposed that a council should be called to advise them how to proceed . The selectmen did not think proper to call a town-meeting , to lay this letter before the town , but wrote to Mr. Moodey , that they had consulted many individuals respecting it ; that they did not see the necessity of a council ; that his leaving them destitute so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return , was evidence of his intention of quitting them altogether ; and that since the ' town had given a call to Mr. Cotton , they were not at liberty to act until they had received his answer . Mr. Cotton advised them to make another application to Mr. Moodey , and if he did not accept this invitation , " they might honestly provide for themselves such person as they judge fittest to supply the place of the ministry here . " The town accordingly voted on the 8th of October , to send another messenger to Mr. Moodey , and request his return , and to inform him " that in consequence of his absence , part of the town had withdrawn and provided themselves with a minister , and that they were not able to maintain a minister as they had formerly done . Notwithstanding which , they engage , provided he return forthwith , to pay him eighty pounds a year , and let him have the use of the glebe and parsonage house . But if he do not take up with the above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves no further with Mr. Moodey , but look upon ourselves clear from him and he from us . " Mr. Mooclev /z/ thought the intervention of a council of sreat importance , and was unwilling to return without the advice of one . The town and church being of a contrary opinion , a council was not called , and Mr. Moodey concluded to remain at Boston . Whether he made any further overtures to the town is uncertain , but /z/ they relaxed from their determination to have no further connection - with him . On the 18th of January , they voted , " That whereas our reverend pastor , Mr. Joshua Moodey , was for a long time agone driven from us , and the troublesomeness of the times having hitherto hindered his return , the town doth now invite him to return and supply his place as formerly ; and on that condition , the town doth engage to make good his salary in every respect as formerly , so long as said Mr. Moodey doth supply the place of the ministry here . " * At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the earnest entreaties of his congregation , he returned to Portsmouth sometime in 1692 , and was welcomed back by the people with warm interest . Here he spent the remainder of his days , with his affectionate flock , in usefulness , harmony and love . The number of communicants which had been admitted into the church at Portsmouth , previous to 1697 , was one hundred and sixty . /z/ He was naturally of a very robust and hardy constitution ; but from too close application to his studies , and to the discbarge of his parochial duties , he contracted some disor- /z/ ders which obliged him to repair to Boston for medical aid . He had been there but a short time , before he fell a victim to his disease . He died on the Sabbath , 4th July , 1697 , in the 65th year of his age , and was " interred in the tomb of the worshipful John Hull . " His days had been checkered , but their conclusion was serene . Great harmony subsisted between him and his parish before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after his return , until his death . AVhen he was confined by his last sickness at Boston , his church and people observed a season of fasting and prayer for his recoverv . Doctor Cotton Mather preached his funeral sermon , from these words : " Looking steadfastly on him , they saw his face , as it had been the face of an angel " He calls him that man of G-od , and has left on record a full testimony to his usefulness in life , and to his happiness in death . " All the churches in New England considered him as a person whom an eminency , both in sense and grace , had made considerable . All the churches of Boston enjoyed and admired his accomplishments for the evangelical ministry , many years together . The church in Portsmouth , ( a part of the country that very much owes its life unto him ! ) crys out of a deadly wound in his death , and is ready to cry out , ' Our breach is great like the sea : who can heal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent and fervent , whereof the press has given some lasting , as the pulpit gave many lively testimonies . Yea , if it were counted one of the most memorable things in St. Francis de Sales , that he made four thousand sermons to the people , I can relate as memorable a thing of our Moodey . Before he died he had numbered some hundreds more than four thousand of them . And unto his cares to edify his flock by sermons , he added more than ordinary cares to do it by visits ,  --  no man , perhaps , being a kinder visitant . He was not only ready to do good , but also to suffer for doing it ; and as he was exemplarily zealous for a scriptural purity in the worship of our Lord Jesus Christ , so he cheerfully submitted unto an imprisonment for that cause of God and of his country : wherein , like Stephen , he had the honor to be the first that suffered in that way for that cause , in these parts of the world . Briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the main interests of our churches , all that knew him , and know the worth of these things , wish that among the survivors he may have many followers . " To a minister who visited him on his death-bed , he declared , " that he was rejoicing in the hope of the glory of God ; that he was longing to go to the precious Christ whom he had chosen and served ; that the spirit of Christ had comfortably taken away from him the fear of death . " When that minister urged /z/ him to leave with Lira any special desire that he should judge proper to he mentioned , he said , " The Life of the churches  --  the Life of the churches , and the dying power of godliness in them . I beseech you to look after that . " The minister at last said , " The Lord Jesus Christ is now , sir , going to do for you as once for Joshua , ( your name-sake . ) He is just going to take from you your old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and clothe you with a change of raiment , with the garments of heavenly glory , and give you a place among his angels . " Whereto he replied , with some transport , u I believe it ! 1 believe it ! " After this , he said hut little , but lay in an uneasy drowsiness until the afternoon of the day following , which was the Lord 's day ; and then , even on the day whereon he had so often been in the spirit , he went unto the blessed world of spirits ; on the day which he had so often sanctified in a sacred rest , he went unto his eternal rest "  --  Fun . Semi , in Magnalia. /z/ One work of which Mr. Moodey was the author , was printed at Boston , by Richard Pierce , in 1685 , 12mo. pp. 109 . It is entitled , " A Practical Discourse concerning the Choice Benefit of Communion with God in his house , witnessed unto by the experience of saints as the best improvement of time , being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preached at Boston , on Lecture Days . " This little volume is accompanied by a prefatory address to the reader , by Rev. James Allen , which gives it a handsome and just encomium . Another edition of this work was published in 1746 , accompanied by a preface from Rev. Messrs . Joseph Sewall , Thos . Prince , and John Webb , in which they say , " These Lectures were delivered by a man of God whose praise is , and the purity of his worship . " In 1691 he published a sermon on the " Sin of Formality in God 's Worship , or the Formal Worshipper proved a liar and deceiver , preached on the weekly lecture in Boston , from Hos. 2 : 12 . " He also preached and published the Artillery Election Sermon , 1674 , from the text , 1 Cor. ix . 26 , 4to pp. 48 ; and the Court Election Sermon in 1692 . John Dunton says he was well known for his practical treatises . He is supposed to be the writer of the epitaphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of Watertown. /z/ Mr. Moodey wrote more sermons , perhaps , in the same number of years , than any other man of whom we have any account . The ninety-third volume of his manuscript sermons /z/ is in the library of the Mass . Hist . Society , the last of which is numbered 4070 , and dated 30th September , 1688 , which will average more than two and a half sermons a week for a period of thirty years , beginning at the time when he commenced his ministry at Portsmouth , in 1658 . Dr. Mather says that the number of his sermons had attained to several hundreds over four thousand at the time of his death , in 1697 . In Alden 's account of this man , mention is made of " a very solemn exhortation , delivered by this noted divine , March 6 , 1686 , before the execution of a malefactor who had been convicted of murder . " /z/ Mr. Moodey was twice married , and had several children . It is probable , from Gov . Hutchinson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Cambridge , and sister of Rev. John Collins , of London . His second wife was widow Ann Jacobs , of Ipswich , who survived him . One of his daughters , named Martha , married Rev. Jonathan Russell , of Barnstable , grandfather of Eleazer Russell , Esq. , of Portsmouth . Another , Sarah , the second daughter , married Rev. John Pike , of Dover , N. H. , several of whose children were baptized by their grandfather . Mr. Pike was a classmate of Mr. Russell 's . The other daughter was Hannah . We do not /z/ learn that he had more than one son , Samuel , who was for several years a preacher at NewCastle , ( Great Island. ) /z/ In his last will and testament , Mr. Moodey directs , " If I die in Portsmouth , my body shall be laid in the burying-place there , under the great stone , by the side of the oak , where I buried my first wife and the deceased children I had by her ;  --  hereby strictly inhibiting those profuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at funerals . " To his children , he gives the following charge : " I do all also lay the solemn injunctions of a tender and dying father upon all my children , that they love one another dearly , and that there be no difference between them about any thing I shall leave them . And in order to the preventing any difference , I advise them to meet as soon as they may after my decease , and discourse and share matters between them , while the remembrance of a dead father is fresh and warm upon their souls . " /z/ Samuel Moody , son of Rev. Joshua Moody , of Portsmouth , was probably a native of Portsmouth . We have not been able to learn the year of his birth , but find he was graduated at Harvard College in 1689 , and was for several years a preacher at New Castle . In 1695 , he married Esther , daughter of Nathaniel Green , of Boston , by whom he had two sons ; Joshua , born 31st Oct. 1697 , and baptized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Harvard College , 1716 ; Samuel , born 29th Oct. 1699 , studied physic , was a magistrate , and died at Brunswick , 1758 , aged 59 ; they also had one daughter , Mary , born Nov. 16 , 1701 , who was married to Edward Mountfort . It is said that about the first of the last century , he preached several years at the Isle of Shoals . His hearers were mostly fishermen , and he endeavored , as all ministers should , to adapt his discourses to the capacity and understanding of his people . Addressing them once on the occasion of a shipwreck , he inquired ,  --  " Supposing , my brethren , any of you should be taken short in the bay , in a North East storm  --  your hearts trembling with fear  --  and nothing but death before you  --  whither would your thoughts turn ? /z/  --  what would you do ?

"  --  Farmer and Moore 's Coll . After a while , he seems to have laid aside his calling as a preacher , and to have assumed that of a military commander . Whether this step was taken in consequence of the paucity of warriors , or the continued and malignant outrages of the Indians , or whether it was because of the peculiar fitness and meetness of the man to deal with the wily , Jesuitical foe , history doth not inform us . He was a sort of spiritual Gideon , and felt , no doubt , that he was called upon to wield " the sword of the Lord , and of Gideon . " He took command of a body of men in an expedition against the Indians at the eastward , and not unfrequently held a " talk " with them upon the matters in dispute . In Farmer and Moore 's Collection , vol. i. pp. 58  --  61 , is a long letter of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of these interviews . Mr. Moody eventually located himself with the new settlers in Falmouth , and has always been regarded as one of the principal persons of " standing and worth ' who assisted in building up that colony . While at Falmouth , Mr. Moody performed /z/ many important services for the town . He took active and early measures for the establishment of a preached gospel . His house was the resort for the minister and the school-master . He was the principal committee-man who invited Rev. Thos . Smith to settle in the town ; and when " the first church that ever was settled to the eastward of Wells " was constituted , " Major Samuel Moody was desired to entertain the messengers and ministers upon ordination day , " on which occasion he had the pleasure of receiving , among others , his cousin , Rev. Samuel Moody , of York , who made the first prayer at the ordination of Mr. Smith . The following further sketch is found in Willis 's History of Portland . " Major Samuel Moody may justly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1705 , he had the command of forty men , stationed at St. John 's fort , Newfoundland ; in 1709 he commanded the fort at Casco . While here he had some correspondence with father Ralle , French missionary at Norridgewock , and he became the organ of communication repeatedly during the war between the Indians and our government . After the fort was dismantled , having had opportunities to become acquainted with the favorable localities of Falmouth , he concluded to fix his residence upon the Neck , to which he moved his family in 1716 . His son Joshua graduated at Harvard College the same year , and his second /z/ son was then pursuing his studies at that institution . They both became active inhabitants of the town . The acquisition of this respectable family was of great importance to the prosperity of the infant settlement . It gave strength to its hopes , and afforded encouragement to others to select this as their place of residence . The confidence reposed in him by his townsmen and the government , may be inferred from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and placed in other responsible places in town ; he was also appointed by the government justice of the peace , at a time when that was truly a mark of distinction , bestowed as such , and not for a fee , and one of the justices of the court of common pleas for the county ; this office he held at the time of his death , which took place April 5 , 1729 , * in the 52d year of his age . " /z/ The subject of this memoir was the fourth son of Caleb Moody , of Newbury , and grandson of William Moody , who came from England . He was born at Newbury , Jan. 4th , 1675 , and was nephew of Rev. Joshua Moody , whose memoirs are given in the preceding pages . His father held a very respectable rank in society , and was the representative of Newbury in the General Court of Massachusetts , in the years 1677 and 1678 . Of his early life we know nothing , but find that at the age of twenty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduated with the honors of that institution in the year 1697 . In May , 1698 , he commenced preaching in York , and was regularly ordained and settled over the firstparish in that place , in December , 1700 , as successor of Rev. Shubael Dummer , where he continued an eminently useful and successful minister of the gospel for near fifty years. * 1 * He was a man of remarkable piety , and waff greatly beloved and no less feared by the people of his charge , and to this day his praise is in all the churches . He was distinguished alike for his eccentricities , his zeal as a man of God , his remarkable faith and /z/ fervency in prayer , and his uncommon benevolence . Hon. Mr. Sewall , in his topographical account of York , says that he was a man " whose fame equalled any gentleman of the clergy of that day . " Rev. Dr. Chauncy names him as among the principal men of New England . Rev. Jothain Sewall , of Maine , in a letter published in the Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Hannah Sewall , the only daughter of John Sewall , of Newbury , my great-grandfather . So that she was first cousin to Dr. Sewall , of the Old South Church , in Boston , and great-aunt to me . It is stated on her grave-stone , that she died , in sweet assurance , on January 29 , 1728 , aged 51 years . Her monumental stone is large , and all filled up with commendations of her virtues and graces . I presume it was done by her husband . " They had three children , viz : Rev. Joseph Moody , Pastor of the Second Church in York ; Mary , who became the wife of Rev. Joseph Emerson , of Maiden ; and Lucy , who died at an early age . About eight years before Mr. Moody 's settlement at York , the place had received a terrible visitation from the Indians . Rev. Mr. Dummer was shot as he was mounting his horse at his own door , and his wife taken captive . Nearly the whole town was destroyed on the same clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captive . The /z/ little settlement was well nigh disheartened , and were about abandoning the place , but finding a support from the government , the 7 were encouraged to continue their possessions ; and after being without preaching for several years , finally settled Mr. Moody , in the latter part of the year 1700 . Mr. Moody preached m York for about two years previous to his settlement there ; during which time he also performed the services of Chaplain to the garrison in that place . We find the following petition among the records of this Commonwealth , which go to show his pious care for the people , and that their temporal circumstances were not such as greatly to heighten his hope of worldly prosperity : " To his Excellency Richard , Earle of Bellomont , Captain General and Gov ernor-in- Chief in and over his Majesty 's Province of the Massachusetts Bay in yew - England , and to the Honorable the Council and Representatives of the said Province , convened in General Assembly , June , 1699 , " The petition of* Samuel Moody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the County of York , within the Province above said , /z/ " Whereas , this Honorable Court Lath so far considered the desolation and distress of the said town of York as to order an augmentation towards upholding the worship of God there , which is gratefully acknowledged bv the inhabitants : " And whereas , ' t is certain the said town is unable to afford a competent maintenance , and that there is as much need of help as ever , having no house for the ministry , and many remaining still destitute of habitations for themselves ; /z/ " Your petitioner , therefore , humbly prays in behalf of said town , and for the relief of himself and family , that you will please to order your petitioner such allowance for the last year , beginning the 18th of May , 1G98 , as to your wisdom and justice shall seem fit .

" The following is the certificate of his chaplaincy , found in the archives of this State : " To the Jion'ble ye Commissioners for Warr . " These may certify that Mr. Sam'l Moody hath served as a chaplain to the Garrison at York , from the 18th of May last unto the day of the date hereof . York , Ap . 20 , 1699 . " Signed by the Selectmen . It is related in Sullivan 's History of Maine , from which some of the preceding facts are gathered , that as late as 1746 , only one year before Mr. Moody 's death , the people used to attend public worship with their arms in their hands . For nearly the whole period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either from the incursions of the Indians or the interference of the French , so that it required the faithful servants of God , who would labor for their divine Master in the /z/ thin and sparsely populated places , almost literally to take their lives in their hands and go forth trusting in the God of Jacob . It is wonderful , in contemplating the ways of God , to see how he has ordered the arrangements of his providence , in raising up and adapting men to the times in which they live . The age in which Mr. Moody lived , and the circumstances by which he was surrounded , were not such as invited tame inactivity , or assisted in the production of philosophical and finely polished sermons . He had the boldness of Isaiah , as well as the fervor and directness of Paul , striking at once into the most stirring themes of the gospel , making the sinner feel its power and cower under its awful truths . Though he was modest and humble , it is said that he feared the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wickedness , wherever he discovered it . He was absolute in his mode of government , and no one dared to disobey him in his family or congregation . /z/ He was a man of prayer , and was remarkable for his importunity at the throne of grace . Several anecdotes are related , to show that like a wrestling Jacob , he often wonderfully prevailed . " He stormed the gates of Heaven by fervent prayer , And brought forth triumph out of man 's despair . " His prayer against the French fleet in 1746 , is of this character . A large force was fitted /z/ out in France , with the intention of destroying the British Colonies for their daring work in taking Cape Breton the year before . It was heard of in this country ; help could not be expected from England , and consternation was depicted on almost every countenance . Rev. Jotham Sewall , in communicating this fact , says : " I was glad to have my early recollections confirmed , several years since , in a conversation with Col. Dummer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninety-two years of age . He was born and trained in York . I asked him if he remembered anything about the Chebucto fleet . He said " Yes , I recollect it , though I was quite young . I remember the consternation that was depicted on almost every one 's countenance . But we had recourse to prayer . The church in York appointed a day for the purpose , and on that occasion Father Moody , in praying against this fleet , brought to view the expressions made use of in the Scripture against Senacherib . " Put a hook in his nose , and a bridle in his lips ; turn him back again by the way that he came , that he shall not shoot an arrow here nor cast up a bank ; but by the way that he came , cause him to return . " By and by the old gentleman waxed warm , and raised his hands and his voice and cried out , " Good Lord , if there is no other way of defeating their enterprise , send a storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was found after- /z/ wards , that not far from that time a tremendous tempest burst upon that fleet , which scattered and shattered them , and foundered numbers of them . A remnant of the fleet got into Chebucto , ( the Indian name of the harbor of Halifax . ) The commander-in-chief was so disheartened , supposing all the rest was lost , that he put an end to his own life . The second in command did the same . The third in command was not competent to the undertaking . A mortal sickness prevailed among the troops , and great numbers of them laid their bones in Chebucto . They finally packed up their all , and went back to France without striking a blow . " Never , " says an able and pious writer , " was the hand of Divine Providence more visible than on this occasion ; never a disappointment more severe on the side of the enemy ; never deliverance in favor of this country more complete , without human help . " The troops on board the fleet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eight thousand , with arms and ammunition to arm four thousand Indians . Their intention was to destroy the British colonies ; and so confident were they of success , that the Admiral carried a broom at his mast-head , intimating that he would sweep all before him ; and if God had not interfered , in answer to prayer , it seems as if they would have accomplished their object , for England had enough to do that year to quell the Scotch rebellion . A Christian community as- /z/ cribed the praise of their success and salvation to that Almighty Being , who caused the stars in their courses to fight against Sisera , and ever controls the destinies of man ; and many regarded this remarkable prayer of Father Moody as the prayer of the righteous man that availeth much with God. * /z/ His faith was most extraordinary . In a number of instances , when entirely destitute of some of the necessaries of life , Mr. Moody has retired to his closet to look to Him who provides for every living thing , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundantly afforded , from quarters and under circumstances totally unexpected . His faith was often tried , but it was blessed . His wife told him , one morning , that they had nothing for dinner . He replied that this was nothing to her ; what she had to do was to set the table , as usual , when the dinner hour came . Accordingly , when the hour came , she set the table , spread the cloth , and put on the plates ; and just then a neighbor brought in a good dinner all cooked . On another occasion , Mrs. Moody told him , one Saturday morning , that they had no wood . " Well , " he replied , " I must go into my /z/ study , and God will provide for us . " During the day , a Quaker called in , and asked for Mr. Moody . Mr. Moody appeared , and the Quaker said to him , " Friend Moody , I was carrying a load of wood to neighbor A. B. , and just as I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if thee will accept of the wood , I will leave it here . " Mr. Moody told him that it was very seasonable , and would be very acceptable , for he was then entirely out of wood . These instances were reported by Mrs. Emerson , of Maiden , daughter of Father Moody , to the wife of a clergyman . And Mrs. Emerson confirmed the remarkable accounts of her father 's faith. * At a certain time great ravages were made by the canker worm , which well nigh destroyed every green thing . In the general distress a day of fasting was observed to implore the removal of the scourge ; and on that day Mr. Moody officiated for his son-in-law , Rev. J. Emerson , of Maiden . The late Deacon Samuel " Waitt , of M.j used to tell the story as he had often heard it from his own father , who was an eye-witness of the affair . A very aged lady yet living , tells it as she received it from her grandmother . Dea . Waitt 's father said that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so numerous that you could scarce set down the foot with- /z/ out crushing them by the score . The lady referred to not only alluded to the same circumstance , but said that as she crossed the stone walls on her way , she saw them hanging on the bushes , as she was wont to phrase it , " in pecks . " Mr. Moody 's text was from Mai . iii . 11 : " I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes . " As he became warmed with his subject , he seemed filled with a sort of prophetic fire , and at last appealed to his hearers in terms like the following :  --  " Brethren , here is the promise of God ! Do you believe it ? Will you repose full confidence in it ? I believe it , and feel an assurance in my soul that God will bring it to pass . " It was given to him according to his faith : for when the somewhat protracted service was done , the destroyer had disappeared at the rebuke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been so multitudinous , was to be seen alive . The father of Dea . Waitt said that he saw them lying dead in " little windrows " on the shores of the creek which runs through the town . These were probably left by the receding of the tidewater which had been draining from the meadows . It were too much to regard this as a modern miracle , or as the fruit of a miracle-working faith . That the facts took place as stated , is a uniform " tradition of the elders " in that pleasant village . The Christian view of the /z/ subject would seem to be , that it was one of those cases in which God answers prayer by means of natural agencies , as in the ordinary course of his providential government of the world . We know that many of the insect tribes pass through their organic changes , all of them nearly at once : and some such change may have occurred just at that particular juncture . The local tradition is , that the phenomenon of the sudden disappearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the weather . This cause might well account for the effect , so as to take away the preternatural aspect of the story . But it ought not to be forgotten , that such atmospheric changes may be wrought by the providence of God , as his special answer to believing prayer ; and this is the explanation which a devout and Christian philosophy would give . /z/ When he was settled in York , he refused to receive a stipulated salary , but chose to live on the voluntary contributions of the people , though it has been said he would not advise others to do so . But as he had settled in that way , he chose to see it through , for he preferred to live by faith . The parish built him a house , appropriated a spot for a parsonage , and hired a man to manage it , while Mr. Moody literally knew not any thing that he /z/ possessed . m In one of his sermons , he mentions that he had been supported twenty years in a way most pleasing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hour in a week in care for the world . Yet , he was sometimes reduced almost to want , though his confidence in the kind Providence of God never failed him . When he had gotten to be old , an article was inserted in a warrant for a parish meeting , " to see if the Parish would settle a salary upon Mr. Moody . " He heard of it , and attended the meeting . When that article was called up to be acted upon , he opposed it ! His friends remarked that he had gotten to be old , and had but a poor support , and what little he did get came from his best friends , and that it operated very unequally in the parish . He replied , " Who are my best friends ? " Without waiting for an answer , he enumerated a number of persons himself , and then said , " Are not these my best friends ? " It was admitted . " Well , are they not the best livers in town ? " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He replied , " Yea , and they always will be so , as long as they lay themselves out for the support of the gospel . f /z/ His benevolence was unbounded . His wife , as well as others , thought he was too lavish of his little , when any one applied to him for assistance in distress . To put a check upon his liberality , and give him time to consider , she made him a new purse , and when she had shifted the change into it , she tied the strings in several knots , so that he might have time for reflection while untying them . Not long after , a poor person asked alms of him . He took out his purse , and attempted to untie the strings ; but finding it difficult , he told the person he believed the Lord intended he should give the whole ! and so gave purse and change together ; so that Madam Moody 's contrivance to save a little , proved to be rather a losing experiment. * " VYe understand a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apostle to the Indians . On one occasion , when he was going to Boston to attend a great Convention or Conference , accompanied by Elder Seward as a delegate , he saw a poor man in the hands of the officers , who were taking him to jail for debt . Father Moody inquired the amount for which he was to be imprisoned , and found he had sufficient to defray the debt , which he immediately did , and the poor man was liberated . " Elder Seward , " said he to his companion , /z/ " I must depend upon you to bear the expenses of my journey , for I have nothing left . " The Elder ventured respectfully to question the propriety and prudence of his conduct in thus rendering himself so dependent ; hut the old clergyman replied , " Elder Seward , does not the Bible say , 6 cast thy bread upon the waters , and thou shalt find it after many days ? ' " Towards evening he reached the city ; and the good people of the city , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent and piety , came out upon Boston Common , to see the famous Father Moody . Elder Seward did not fail to relate the morning 's adventure , and after they had retired to their lodgings , a waiter brought Father Moody a sealed packet . He opened it , and found it contained the precise sum which he had given to the poor man in the morning . Whether it was the benefaction of some one benevolent individual , or the proceeds of a subscription , the deponent saith not ; but the old man turned to his companion exclaiming , " Elder Seward ! I cast my bread upon the waters in the morning , and behold ! it is returned to me in the evening . "  --  Lowell Offering , Vol. ii . No. 1 . It is related , that on a cold , frosty morning , a poor woman came into his house without any shoes on her feet . Learning , on inquiry , that she was destitute of those necessary articles , he went to the bedside and took his wife 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor woman . " When his wife arose she made diligent search for her shoes , but on Father Moody 's coming into the room he told her he had given them away to a poor woman . " Dear Mr. Moody , " said she , " how could you do so , when you knew they were all the shoes I had in the world ? " He replied , " Oh never mind it , dear wife , the Lord will send in another pair before night , I doubt not . " In the course of the forenoon a neighbor brought- in a pair of new shoes , stating that they were too small for his wife , and he thought he would bring them over to give to Mrs. Moody , if she would like them . Of course they were received . /z/ His aptness at quoting and applying scripture was known to be proverbial . One of his parishioners observing that he was in the habit , when performing table services , of quoting some passage of scripture descriptive of the food provided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible to suit shell-fish . He provided a dinner of clams , and invited Mr. Moody to dine with him . In returning thanks after the refreshment , he blessed the Lord , that he not only furnished supplies from the produce of the fields , and flocks and herds ; but permitted them to " suck of the abundance of the seas , and of the treasures hid in the sand . 11 /z/ His eccentricities were very striking , and under this head we might place nearly his whole memoir . Rev. Joseph Emerson , of Maiden , married Father Moody 's only daughter , Mary . When he took his wife to see her father , he usually spent the Sabbath , and preached for him . He wrote his sermons out accurately , pretty much in full , before delivering them . Numbers of Mr. Moody 's hearers were very much taken up with Mr. Emerson 's sermons , and ever ready to say , " Oh ! what instructive sermons !  --  we can learn something from them . " Father Moody found it out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a sermon in full , it may be that I shall do good to these people , that I can not benefit in my rambling way of preaching , " for he wrote but little , and often nothing , for his pulpit preparations . So , for a variety , he wrote a sermon out in full , and began his meeting on the Sabbath , calculating to read it to his people . He proceeded on a while , and then stopped and looked around upon his hearers , and said , " Emerson must be Emerson , and Moody must be Moody . I feel as if my head was in a bag . You call Moody a rambling preacher , and it is true enough ; but he is just fit to catch up rambling sinners . You are all run away from the Lord . " And on he went in his old way , re- /z/ solved not to be trammeled at that rate . It was like the coat of mail to David ; he had not proved it . At a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At a church meeting , finding it difficult to get along with their business , they concluded , by his advice , to adjourn for a season , and pray for light and direction . On the next Sabbath , Mr. Moody preached from the following text : 2 Chron. 20 : 12 , * ' Neither know we what to do ; but our eyes are upon thee . " After some introductory remarks , he stated this for his doctrine : " When a person or people are in such a situation that they know not what to do , they should not do they know not what ; but their eyes should be unto the Lord for direction . " He was remarkable for back-handed strokes , and odd expressions in preaching . He , at one time , had a hired man , by the name of John Pike . John could sing . He attended a lecture , on some occasion , at a private house . There was no one present that could tune the psalm , but John . So after he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to John to set the psalm . He obeyed . After they had got through with the singing , he addressed his chorister in this manner : " John , you never shall set the psalm again in the world ; you are ready to burst with pride . " At a time when a number of his brethren in the ministry were together at his house , on /z/ some occasion , they undertook to call him to an account for his odd expressions in preaching , and told him they did not think he did right . " Why , what have I done ? " said he . They told him what expressions they had heard of his using , and then said , " Father Moody , you know whether it is so or not ; if it is so , we do think you ought to be more careful , lest you bring reproach upon the profession , and injure the good cause you advocate . " He made no reply , but went up into his study , and was gone a few minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or thirty instances of hopeful conversion that had taken place under preaching , in which he used just such expressions as they objected against . He read sermons over to them , with the expressions , names , and dates , &c.; They looked on one another with silent astonishment , for a little while , and then one of them observed , " If the Lord owns Father Moody 's oddities , I believe we must let him take his own way . " So the storm blew over . When Mr. Moody was on a journey , I think in the western part of Massachusetts , he called on a brother in the ministry , on Saturday , thinking to spend the Sabbath with him , if agreeable . The man appeared very glad to see him , and said , " I should be very glad to have you stop and preach for me to-morrow ; but I feel almost ashamed to ask you . " " Why , what is the matter ? " said Mr. Moody . " Why , /z/ our people have got into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it seems to be an imposition upon a stranger . " " If that is all , I must and ivill stop and preach for you , " was Mr. Moody 's reply . When the Sabbath day came , and Mr. Moody had opened the meeting and named his text , he looked round on the assembly , and said , " My hearers , I am going to speak to two sorts of folks to-day , saints and sinners . Sinners , I am going to give you your portion first , and I would have you give good attention . " When he had preached to them as long as he thought best , he paused , and said , " There , sinners , I have done with you now ; you may take your hats and go out of the meeting-house as soon as you please ! " But all tarried and heard him through .  --  Sewall. /z/ With all Mr. Moody 's oddities , he was eminent for piety , and was a remarkably useful minister of the gospel . Says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-opening and dedication of the meeting-house of the First Congregational Parish in York : " Powerful revivals were witnessed in this place during Mr. Moody 's ministry , and large additions made to the church , which is said to have contained between three hundred and four hundred members before he left it . He fear- /z/ lessly preached what are termed the humbling doctrines of the cross . The church records having been consumed when the parsonage house was burned , in the spring of 1742 , it is impossible to present so definite an account of Mr. Moody 's success in the ministry , as otherwise could be done . Hence I will simply add , that after forty-seven years of faithful labor , he fell asleep in Jesus , leaving one of the most flourishing societies , and the largest church in the State , to mourn his loss . " The records of the church at York say : " As a zealous and faithful man of God , he was extensively known . He was looked upon in his day with uncommon respect , both for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read . His ardent piety , as well as his eccentricities , will be long remembered , and his memory devoutly cherished , by generations yet to come . The ministry of Mr. Moody was singularly blessed to the people . During his ministry , religion was very prosperous in this place . About the year 1741 , a general revival of religion commenced , and many were hopefully converted and gathered into the church ; but the present number can not now be ascertained . While he was pastor , it was the practice to choose and ordain elders . At his death , this church had arrived at its height of prosperity , and contained three hundred and seventeen members , in full communion . " In his younger years he often preached be- /z/ yond the limits of his own parish , and wherever he went the people hung upon his lips . In one of his excursions , he went as far as Providence , where his exertions were the means of laying the foundation of a Congregational church , and the town voted , May 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annually to assist Mr. Moody . So long a journey , at that early day , and with the limited means of conveyance then at hand , must have been regarded as quite a missionary tour . He was a zealous friend to the revival of religion which occurred throughout the country a short time before his death . And though his ministry had been singularly blessed , yet it seems that it was reserved to some of his later years to see among his people some of the most wonderful displays of saving mercy . It was about the year 1741 that he received a visit from the Rev. George Whitefield , a celebrated young itinerant minister , whose fine talents and fervent piety drew from his auditory the strongest expressions of praise in all the churches . " His imagination was luminous and lively , and his heart full of religious sensibilities . The tones of his clear and musical voice he could strikingly adapt to the sentiment , and his gestures , frequent and forcible , were above all rules of art ; for they were the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes , and used plain language , yet , by a happy choice of words and figures of /z/ speech , he enforced and illustrated his discourses with wonderful effect . In general his doctrines were in conformity to the sentiments of the Episcopal Church ; he preached the remission of sins through the atoning merits of a Redeemer ; and in his supplications a spirit of grace seemed to take possession of his whole soul , and carry him and all who heard him to the mercy-seat and the throne . Mr. Whitefield visited York , Wells , and Biddeford , where he preached to crowded assemblies , that were both captivated and melted with the life and copiousness of his sermons . Churches were refreshed , souls were converted , and the settled ministers  --  Messrs . Moody , Jefferds , Smith , Willard , and Elvens  --  who were at that time all " burning and shining lights " at the altar , partook largely of the thrill and influences with which the preacher himself was animated .  --  Williamson 's Maine . To give " attestations " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England , Mr. Moody met in Convention with a company of ninety ministers , in Boston , July 7 , 1743 . He favored the revival , and the preaching of Whitefield , but gave no countenance to separations or disorders of any kind . Mr. Whitefield returned to New England in 1744 , and landed at York on the 19th of October . It is recorded that the good Mr. Moody called on him , and said , " Sir , you are , first , welcome to America ; secondly , to New /z/ England ; thirdly , to all faithful ministers in New England ; fourthly , to all the good people of New England ; fifthly , to all the good people of York ; and sixthly and lastly , to me , dear sir , less than the least of all . " At Mr. Moody 's earnest request , after some hesitation he preached , and immediately went to Portsmouth. * /z/ In 1745 , only two years before Mr. Moody 's death , and when he had arrived at the advanced age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the celebrated Cape Breton expedition . He must have possessed a very strong constitution , to have retained a vigor sufficient to have enabled him to perform this fatiguing voyage of six or seven hundred miles . The American army was triumphant . An uncommon series of providential interpositions , gave the strongest fortress in America into the hands of the Provincial and British naval forces . And it was at a dinner given by Sir William Pepperell , after the surrender of Louisburg , and in commemoration of that event , that Mr. Moody craved that remarkable blessing , at the table , which was at once concise and to the admiration as well as disappointment of all present . Sir William , and others , knowing Mr. Moody 's /z/ prolixity on such occasions , - were fearful lest the dinner might get cold , or the British officers offended , or both ; yet knowing Mr. Moody 's arbitrary and independent disposition , no one could take the liberty to suggest to him , that brevity in his address to the Throne of Grace , in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief in command spoke to Mr. Moody that dinner was ready . He , all unconscious of their feelings , approached the table , and lifting up his hands , disappointed them very agreeably by expressing himself in this apt and laconic manner :  --  " Lord , we have so many things to thank thee for , that time will be infinitely too short to do it ; we must therefore leave it for the work of Eternity . Bless our food and fellowship on this joyful occasion , for Christ 's sake . Amen . " His anxious friends were so agreeably disappointed , they took it down in writing , and brought it home , and by that means , ( says a letter from Rev. Jotham Sewall ) I obtained a correct account of this short and comprehensive blessing . It is worthy of remark , that while the father was on this eventful and trying expedition , his son , Rev. Joseph Moody , was at home in his own church , making one of those wrestling , overcoming , conquering prayers , which only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Mr. Moody was solicited by Sir Wil- /z/ liam Pepperell to go as chaplain upon this expedition , it is said he entered upon it with great zeal , and predicted that Louisburg would be taken , and that he should cut down the cross and images , the objects of Papal worship . Some of his friends undertook to dissuade him from his purpose ; but he said , " No , there never was a bullet made to hurt him . " On stepping on board the vessel at Boston , he seized an axe exclaiming , the Sword of the Lord and of Gideon ; and after the place was taken , he shouldered his axe and went up to the images , and actually cut them down with his own hands , as he had predicted. * And in the Mass House there , he preached the first Protestant sermon ever heard on the Island , from these words : " Enter into his gates with thanksgiving , and into his courts with praise : be thankful unto him , and bless his name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and his truth endureth to all generations . "  --  Ps. 100 : 4 , 5. /z/ There are many anecdotes of Mr. Moody still in circulation , some of them are of a very interesting nature , and may well serve as illustrations of his character . For some of the following we are indebted to the Lowell Offer- /z/ ing of 1842 , the Editress of which claims to be a descendant of this famous old divine . A young clergyman was once visiting him , and on the morning of the Sabbath , he asked him if he would not preach . " Oh , no , Father Moody , " was the young gentleman 's reply ; " I am travelling for my health , and wish to be entirely relieved from clerical duties . Besides , you , sir , are a distinguished father in Israel , and one whom I have long wished to have an opportunity of hearing , and I hope to day for that gratification . " " Well , " said the old man , as they wended their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in the pulpit ? " It was perfectly immaterial , the young minister replied : he could sit in the pulpit or the pew , as Father Moody preferred . So when they entered the meeting house , Father Moody stalked on , turned his companion up the pulpit stairs , and went himself into the parsonage pew . The young man looked rather blank when he found himself alone , and waited a long while for his host to " come to the rescue . " But there Father Moody sat before him as straight and stiff as a stake or statue , and finding there was to be no reprieve for him , he opened the Bible , and went through with the exercises . Perhaps the excitement caused by this strange treatment might have enlivened his brain ; at all events , he preached remarka- /z/ bly well . After the conclusion of the services Father Moody arose in his pew , and said to the congregation , " My friends , we have had an excellent discourse this morning , from our young brother ; hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps it was the same young clergyman , ( and we should not wonder if it were the very night after this clerical joke , ) of whom the following anecdote is related . He requested his guest to lead the evening household service , but was answered by a request to be excused . " But you will pray with us , " exclaimed the old man . " No , Father Moody , I wish to be excused . " " But you must pray . " " No , sir , I must be excused. " * " But you shall pray . " u No , sir , I shall be excused . " " But I command you to pray . " " Mr. Moody ! " replied the young man , in a determined voice , " you need not attempt to browbeat me , for I wonH pray . " " Well , well , " exclaimed the old gentleman , in a discomfited tone , " I believe you have more brass in your face , than grace in your heart . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon a visit . " I shall remember you in my public prayers this morning , " said he to her one Sabbath as they started for the meeting . " No ! oh , no ! Father Moody , I beg of you not to do so . I entreat of you not to do it . " But in his morning service , he did pray for the young lady who was then an /z/ inmate of his family , the daughter of one of the most distinguished divines ; and while all eyes were probably directed to the parsonage pew , he continued , " she begged me not to mention her in my prayers , but I told her / would " Father Moody was very direct and fearless in his rebukes to the evil-doers ; and he wished always to see them shrink and cower beneath his reproof and frown ; but in one instance at least , he was not gratified . Col. Ingrahame , a wealthy parishioner , had retained his large stock of corn , in a time of great scarcity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , and resolved upon a public attack upon the transgressor . So he arose in his pulpit , one Sabbath , and named as his text , Prov. 11 , 26 , " He that withholdeth corn , the people shall curse him ; but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it . " Col. Ingrahame could not but know to whom reference was made ; but he held up his head and faced his pastor , with a look of stolid indifference . Father Moody went on with some very applicable remarks , but Col. Ingrahame still pretended not to understand the allusion . Father Moody grew very warm , and became still more direct in his remarks upon matters and things . But Col. Ingrahame still held up his head , as high , and perhaps a little higher than ever , and would not put on the coat so aptly prepared for him . Father Moody at /z/ length lost all patience , " Col. Ingrahame ! ' said he , " Col. Ingrahame ! you knoiv that I mean you ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Colonel 's lady , was very fond of fine dress , and sometimes appeared at meeting in a style not exactly accordant with her Pastor 's ideas of christian female propriety . One morning she came sweeping into church , in a new hooped dress , which was then very fashionable . " Here she comes , " said Father Moody , from the pulpit ; " here she comes , top and topgallant , rigged most beautifully , and sailing most majestically ; but she has a leak that icill sink he ? ' to hell " One day seeing two wild geese passing over , he hastily took down his gun , and made a sort of ejaculatory prayer and promise , that if the Lord would give him both of them , he would give the best one to his poor neighbor . He fired and brought them both down . One of them was a nice , fat , large bird ; while the other was very inferior in quality . He took them both in to his wife , and requested her to dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His wife objected , and wished him to reserve that one for their own use . " No , no , Mrs. Moody , " replied her husband , " the Lord shall have the best , according to promise , " and he carried it to the poor woman , as an offering to the Lord , in defiance of his wife 's objections . /z/ He was a spiritual monarch among his people , and his church was so large that this circumstance alone , gave him a high distinction . He once made an exchange with the minister of Rye , and it was noised around in the latter place , that a minister would preach for them who had so many hundred members in Ms church . This caused the meeting house to be filled to overflowing , and among others was a young lady , the belle of the town , greatly addicted to dress and finery . Under the influence of Father Moody 's eloquence , she was entirely changed . She renounced all her frippery , and became eminent for sobriety , meekness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a certain man who did not pray in his family . He immediately ordered his horse , and forthwith was on his way to the man 's house . When he arrived it was late , and the family had all retired for the night . Mr. Moody soon roused them , and told the man what he had heard . The poor culprit acknowledged the truth of the allegation . " Well , " said Father Moody , " you are living in a great sin : you must do it no longer ! " The man replied that he could not pray ; he did not possess the gift of prayer ; but Father Moody told him he could pray and he should pray . " I will not leave the house , " continued he , " until I hear you pray . " He pressed , and urged the affair , until the man in agony of spirit exclaimed , " Lord ! teach /z/ me to pray ! " " Well done , " responded Father M. , " that is a good prayer ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ahead , and as the purpose of my visit is accomplished , I will bid you good night . ' ' * Father Moody , when returning from one of his parochial visits , fell in with a stranger . Religious conversation was soon introduced , and he , without reluctance , joined in it . He demurred to many of Father Moody 's propositions . He denied that many of the doctrines then , as now , considered the very pith and cream of orthodoxy , were true . He declared that the Bible did not teach them , and supported his declarations by a whole array of passages from the Holy Scriptures . Our good minister was amazed and perplexed . He had never before engaged so bold and stiff an antagonist . He could not defeat the man , and with much difficulty escaped being defeated by him . " And who , " thought he , " can this creature be ? He can not be a son of New England , or of Old England , or of any part of Christian Europe ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this persuasion , he returned home and told Madam Moody that he had been disputing with the devil . " And what , " inquired she , " did the old fellow say ? " " Why , " replied Father M. , " he said that the doctrines of original sin , and effectual calling , and an eternal hell , are not contained in the Bible ; and he quoted abundance of Scripture /z/ to support his blasphemy . " " But did the devil quote Scripture ? " said Madam , who partook of the common notion that the Evil One could not frame his mouth to utter such sacred words . u Yes , yes , " answered the old man , " and enough of it too . But mind you ! he quoted it in a devilish way . " The following additional anecdotes have recently come to our knowledge : In the time of the revival , as he was going to one of the meetings which he had appointed , he overtook a poor lame woman , oppressed with a sense of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same place . He reined up his horse , and told her to get up on the fence and jump on the pillion behind him . She thanked him , but modestly declined the civility . " Yes , yes , " said he , " jump on ; the time has now come when the lame shall leap for joy . " So she rode behind Father Moody to meeting , and in a few days her heart did leap for the spiritual joy it found in believing in Jesus . Father Moody was very thorough in searching out any cases of disagreement or disaffection among the members of his church or people . One day , he heard of three families , living in one house , in a distant part of his parish , who did not speak with or visit each other . He said it must not be , and called for his horse and started off . When he arrived at the house , he met with a most welcome reception by one of the families , and was invited /z/ in . After tarrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was invited to pray . " Oh ! yes , " said he , " I am never too much in a hurry to pray ; but you have other folks in the house ; please call them in . " " No , they do n't come in here . " " Do n't they ? well , then , I will go in and see them . " In the second family he found the same difficulty existins ; as in the first . He then went into the third , and after due conversation proposed for them to call in their neighbors , and engage in prayer . " Oh ! no , " said they , " we do n't visit each other . " " Well , then , " said the persevering minister , " I ' 11 take the devil 's stand in the entry , and all of you come to your doors while I pray . " They all did so , and , ever after that , they were good friends . He once owned a very fine horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to no purpose ; he was determined not to part with him . All at once his horse became a great affliction to him , and he sent for one of his neighbors , and entreated him to take him away . " Why , what ' s the matter , Father Moody , with your horse ? I thought he was perfectly gentle and kind , and you would not part with him . " " Oh ! he goes right up with me into the pulpit , and I can not have him there  --  I will not have him there . " The school-house was hard by the parsonage , and the boys one summer began to make too free use of his apples . This annoyed Mrs. Moody exceedingly . She told Mr. Moody of /z/ the trouble , and how dreadfully wicked it was for the boys to steal . " Well , well , " said he , " I ' 11 put a stop to that . " So off he went to the school-house , and gave the boys a lecture on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , boys , whenever you want any apples , go right into my orchard , and get just as many as you wish ; you need not steal them . " He came back , and told Mrs. Moody the boys would not steal any more apples . He was an irritable man , though he was constantly watchful against this infirmity , and was ever ready to confess it even to children and servants . On one occasion when he had been led to say some ill-advised things , after a moment 's reflection , the tears started from his eyes , and he began to bewail his folly , and exexclaimed , " Oh ! if it was not for the example of the Jewish Prophet Jonah , left on sacred record , I should have no hope of myself/ " He once went into a tavern , and among a number of gamblers found a member of his church . In his indignation , he seized hold of him , and cast him out at the door . On the occasion of a certain ordination at Portsmouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed to preach ; but from some cause he was unexpectedly detained on the road , and did not appear at the appointed time . The Council delayed the ordination as long as they could , and then proceeded to the church without him . Father Moody was present , and they called on him as /z/ a substitute . He was requested to make the introductory prayer , immediately before the sermon . In that part of it in which it was proper for him to allude to the exercises of the day , he besought the Lord that they might be suitably humbled under the frown of his providence , in not being permitted to hear , as they had all fondly expected , a discourse from " that eminent servant of God , the Rev. Mr. Edwards of Northampton ; " and proceeded to thank God for raising him up , to be such a burning and shining light , for his uncommon piety , for his great excellence as a preacher , for the remarkable success which had attended his ministry , and for the superior talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &c.; &c.; Mr. Edwards arrived at the church a short time after the commencement of the exercises , and entered the door just after Mr. Moody began his prayer . Being remarkably still in all his movements , and particularly in the house of God , Mr. Edwards ascended the stairs , and entered the pulpit so silently , that Mr. Moodv did not hear him ; and of course was necessitated , before a very numerous audience , to listen to the very hio ; h character given of himself by Mr. Moody . As soon as the prayer was closed , Mr. M. turned round , and saw Mr. Edwards behind him ; and , without leaving his place , gave him his right hand , and addressed him as follows , " Brother Edwards , we are all of us much rejoiced to see you here to-day , and nobody , probably , as much /z/ so as myself ; but I wish that you might have got in a little sooner , or a little later , or else that I might have heard you when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did ' nt intend to natter you to your face ; but there 's one thing I 'll tell you : They say that your wife is going to heaven , by a shorter road than yourself . " Mr. Edwards bowed , and , after reading the Psalm , went on with the Sermon . /z/ He published several books : " The Doleful State of the Damned , especially such as go to Hell from under the Gospel , " 1710 ; Election Sermon , 1721 ; and a Summary Account of the Life and Death of Joseph Quasson , an Indian . The first two of these books are now in the Library of the Massachusetts Historical Society . He also published " Judas the Traitor hung up in chains , to give warning to Professors , that they beware of Worldly mindedness and Hypocrisy : a Discourse , concluding with a Dialogue ; " also , " A Sermon , preached to Children , after Catechising , in the town of York ( Me . ) , July 25 , 1721 ; " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Way to Keep out of Debt , " a subject which we are inclined to think would be well for some persons to revolve at the present day . His writings would compare well with those of Baxter . He always seems deeply impressed with a sense of his one great object  --  to /z/ lead sinners to the knowledge and acknowledgment of the truth as it is in Jesus . His talents as a preacher and writer were certainly of no common cast . His imagination was fruitful and lively . The following similitude is from his pen , and was copied from his manuscript only a few years since . It bears no date . It is a comparison of the Christian with the Bee ; and . were it put in John Bunyan 's rhyme , it would rank with similar effusions from his rare pen : 1 . A Bee is a laborious , diligent creature . So is a Christian . His life , under God , depends on his diligence . Nothing is to be got in Christianity but by labor . " In all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips tended to penury , " if that be all . 2 . A Bee is a provident creature : is continually laying up in store for futurity . So is a Christian every day laying up in store for eternity . He looks not at the things that are seen and temporal , but at the things which are not seen and eternal . 3 . A Bee feeds on the sweetest and choicest food . So does the Christian . He lives on the word of God , which is sweeter than the honey-comb . He feasts on Christ , who is the bread of life which came down from heaven . He feasts on the love and favor of God , and so man does eat angels ' food . 4 . A Bee puts all into common stock . So the Christian is of a generous , communicative temper , and desires that others as well as himself may partake of his spiritual gains and increase . 5 . A Bee will suck honev out of every flower : yea , they say out of a dunghill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the increase of grace ; yea , he will even improve the sins of others for advancing of grace in himself . It stirs up his gratitude to God for restraining grace . It makes him the more watchful and prayerful . It increases /z/ his holy mourning and godly sorrow . Rivers of waters run down his eyes , because men keep not God 's law . 6 . A Bee keeps to her own hive , and never goes about , for its necessary food . So a Christian , a daughter of Sarah especially , is most in her element when she is in her own tent . She is a chaste keeper at home , and when she goes abroad , if to the house of God , or to the private meetings of the upright , or to visit her friends , still is gathering food for her soul . 7 . A Bee is always ready armed , and quick and expert in the use of its weapons . So is a Christian with respect to his spiritual armor , particularly the sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wherewith he fights his spiritual enemies , and overcomes all their temptations . The " Word ' s a sword , faith puts it on , And on occasion draws ; The enemies of the soul fall down Before God 's holy laws . 8 . The Bee is an ingenious creature , very nice and accurate in its work . So is the Christian ; he walks and works by rule , he squares all his actions by the exact direction of the word of God , and the unerring pattern his Saviour has set him . 9 . Bees are a sort of commonwealth , and are under strict order and government . Every one keeps to his place and work . So are Christians like to a city compact together , and they each mind and keep to his own particular station and employment , and abide with God in the calling wherein he is placed . 10 . Bees keep their heat during the cold season , by keeping together . So do Christians keep up their spiritual warmth and liveliness by associating together . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but how can one be warm alone ? " 11 . The Bee , when its sight is obstructed by dirt , &c,; got over its eyes , is very restless and uneasy , and never leaves rubbing till it has got it off . So the /z/ Christian , if he has lost his bright views of spiritual things , will never rest until he gets a renewed clear discovery of them . w 12 . The Bee , as it has always a bag of rank poison , as much in proportion to its bulk as a rattle-snake ; so the Christian , together with the precious grace of God , has also a body of sin and corruption , the remainder of the poison of the Old Serpent . 13 . The Bee jets all her living bv flving . If her wings fail , she necessarily dies . So " the just shall live by faith , " which has been compared to flying in the air . 14 . The Bee is a long-lived creature . Some say a swarm of Bees have been known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , vea , everlasting . 15 . The Bee is a creature of a plain mien , untoward appearance , not gay and gaudy like the butterfly . Its excellencies are intrinsic . So the Christian does not affect to make fair show in the flesh , but is all glorious within . /z/ Rev. Jonathan Greenleaf , in a communication to the Christian Mirror , in March , 1842 , savs that Madam Lyman , the widow of Rev. Isaac Lyman , the successor of Rev. Samuel Moody , related to him many interesting facts , both in regard to Samuel and Joseph Moody . " She was brought up in the family of Rev. Samuel Moody , and perhaps was a relative , and was about twelve years old when he died . I have spent many hours in her company . She was an agreeable , intelligent , and pious woman . She died at the age of about ninety , something more than twenty years ago . She /z/ related to me , some years since , a circumstance which took place at the death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ; she being in the room at the time . The old gentleman was in great distress of body ; and Joseph his son sat behind him on the bed , holding him up in his arms . When he ceased to breathe , and the people began to remark that he was gone , his son exclaimed with a loud voice , u And Joseph shall put his hands upon thine eyes . " He then put his hands around , closed his eyes , and laid the lifeless body back on the bed . " His remains lie buried in the common burying place , near the meeting-house , in York , with the following inscription on a stone placed over them : " Here lies the body of the Rev 'd /z/ The zealous , faithful , and successful Pastor of the First Church of Christ in York . Was born in Newbury , January 4th , 1675 . Graduated 1697 . Came hither May 16th , 1698 . Ordained in Dec , 1700 , and died here Nov. 1 3th , 1 74 7 . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter , and first six verses . " The memory of Mr. Moody is still precious , and will no doubt be devoutly cherished by coming generations . He was truly an extraordinary man : strong in faith ; of fervent /z/ piety ; of great zeal , courage , resolution , and exertion in the ministerial labors . His name ma j still be found engraved upon the cornerstone of the meeting-house - where he labored . The following is the inscription on the gravestone of Mr. Moody 's wife , alluded to in the former part of this memoir : " Mrs. HANNAH MOODY , Consort of ye Rev 'd Mr. Samuel Moody , An early and thorough convert , eminent for holiness , prayerfulness , watchfulness , zeal , prudence , sincerity , meekness , patience , weanedness from the world , self-denial , public spiritedness , diligence , faithfulness , and charity , departed this life in sweet assurance of a better , July 29 , 1727-8 , aged 51 .

He was the minister of Star Island , or Gosport , N. H. , from the year 1706 to 1733 . He was a man of piety , and a pathetic and useful preacher . After leaving the Shoals , he settled as a schoolmaster at Hampton , and afterwards removed to Newbury , Mass. , where he died of apoplexy , 17th April , 178:2 , aged 82.  --  Coll . Mass . Hist . Soc. vii . 255 . REV . JOSEPn MOODY . 95 /z/ This excellent man was the only son of the celebrated Samuel Moody , Pastor of the First Church in York . He was born in the year 1700 , the same year of his father 's settlement . At the age of eighteen he received the honors of Harvard College , and for fourteen years he was a very useful and active man in civil life . For some years he was Clerk of the town of York , and Register of Deeds for the County , in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care , industry , and correctness . He was also a Judge of the County Court , when he was but thirty years of age . His father was very desirous that he should be a preacher of the gospel , as he was possessed of superior talents , and was considered a man of eminent piety . The importunity of the father prevailed with the son . The Second Parish in York was incorporated in the year 1730 . It was settled originally by Scotch people , and was always known by the name of Scotland . In 1732 , a church was gathered ; and Mr. Moody , being warmly solicited to take the pastoral charge of the same , resigned all his civil offices , and was accordingly ordained . But the importance of this new /z/ trust proved too much for his great sensibility ; . and after about six years , falling into a gloomy and singularly disordered state of mind , he relinquished his public labors. /z/ Mr. Moody 's disorder was of the nervous kind . He supposed that the guilt of some unforgiven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only unworthy the sacred office he held , but unfit for the company of other people . He chose to eat alone , and kept his face always covered with a handkerchief when in company . His judgment of men and things , excepting what related to himself , was in no manner impaired . He visited and frequently prajed with the sick and in private families , and he also prayed at times in public , with great fervency , pertinency , and devotion ; but always insisted that he was only the voice of others on these occasions. ! He was remarkable for his mild , amiable temper , his piety , his gift in prayer , and his faith . * In the former part of his life he accidentally killed a youth for whom he had great affection , and it was supposed that this melancholy affair had a very sensible effect upon his mind . Having been the cause of his young friend 's death , as a token of his grief , he was determined to wear a veil the remainder of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handkerchief drawn over his face , and was generally known , in the way of distinction , by the name of Handkerchief Moody . f Greenleafs Ecclesiastical Sketches of Maine . /z/ Not long before he relinquished his public ministerial labors , he buried his wife , who had relieved him of much of the pressure of worldly cares . Thi3 event no doubt greatly increased his nervous difficulty . He ceased to preach in the year 1738 , and for about three years the people of his charge waited patiently for his recovery ; but , seeing no prospect of it , a council was called in August , 1741 , and the pastoral relation dissolved . /z/ After this , through the importunity of his friends , he occasionally preached a public discourse , and often led in devotional exercises . They , knowing his ready , copious gift in prayer , and his spirituality and solemnity , were very desirous of enjoying the privilege of uniting with him , and would often invite him ; but he would as often excuse himself by saying he was unable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a shadow . At last one of his friends suggested , that , if he was nothing but a shadow , he might do for a mouth for his friends to express their desires through to God . The thought struck him agreeably . He did not know but he might be as much as that , and from that time he commenced praying with others as their mouth ! He would sometimes make five or six calls in the morning in a neighborhood , before it was too late for fami- /z/ ly prayer . When he called on a family , he would tell them he came to bring their mouth to them . They were glad of the privilege .  - -  He would sometimes pertinently particularize persons in family prayer . Says the Rev. J. Sewall , at a certain time , " My grandmother , when she was a widow , with her youngest daughter ( a little girl ) , was on a visit in Dea . Bragdon 's neighborhood . In the morning , Mr. Moody came in , to be the mouth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prayed for her and hers ; and among other things , he had this sentence : ' Lord , thou knowest she has laid awake many an hour , in the silent watches of the night , meditating upon the signification of her name J  --  Mehitable  --  how good is God . Although my aunt was so young when this took place , it was so engraven upon the tablet of her memory , that she detailed it to me , with the circumstances , when she was a widowed old lady . She was grandmother to the late Rev. Daniel Crosby , of Charlestown , Mass . " It has been said that sometimes , when he officiated in his father 's pulpit , he would remark , h naming his text , that , " If Mr. Moody were present , he would preach from the following text " ( naming it ) . And through the different periods of his discourse , he would often say , " If Mr. Moody were present , he would say , " &c.; &c,; carrying out the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke to the people . He was a man of a tender spirit , and of the deepest piety ; and though he labored under this singularity of mind , yet , when he did not feel particularly gloomy , his conversation was commonly very cheerful and edifying. /z/ Like his father , he possessed a remarkably strong faith , as is shown in the extraordinary instance of his prayer respecting the taking of Louisburg , on the island of Cape Breton , from the Roman Catholic French , by the people of New England , on the 17th of June , 1745 . He had been supplying his father 's pulpit , while he went as chaplain to the army . By information from Louisburg , it was found that the place was not taken . It was suggested that a day of fasting and prayer should be held in York . Neighboring ministers attended and assisted . Joseph Moody offered one of the prayers , which it was thought was nearly two hours long . He went on a long time , using all manner of arguments and pleas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place , that the enterprise might be prospered ; then turned in his prayer , and gave thanks that it was done , it was delivered up , it was ours . Then he went on a long time , praising God for his unmerited mercy . He closed his /z/ prayer with statements of this kind : " Lord , we are not better than those who possessed the land before us ; and it would be righteous if the land should spue out its inhabitants a second time . " After the troops returned , and they and others compared dates , it was found that the place was taken on the very day that the fast was held , and that the capitulation was closed while he was praying ! About two years afterwards , when peace was concluded between France and England , the place was given back to France ; so the land spued out its inhabitants a second time ; and it afterwards became a common remark , by many who heard that prayer , that " Mr. Moody took Cape Breton in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In relation to this remarkable prayer , " says an aged minister now living , " how he came to the knowledge of the fact , I must leave ; but of the fact I have no kind of doubt . My parents , and a number of old people that I have conversed with , heard the prayer . The coincidence of the facts with the prayer is matter of history . " . /z/ After the death of his wife , he boarded with Deacon Bragclon , who was naturally a man of a hasty temper . The Deacon had been out one morning , and had had some difficulty with one of his neighbors , about bad fences and /z/ breachy cattle . He made out to keep his temper tolerably well , while conversing with his neighbor ; but after he had left him , reflecting on some circumstance , old Adam got up to a pretty high pitch by the time he got home . As soon as he had entered his own house , in great perturbation of spirit , he called out to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my poor neighbor ; he has got terribly out of the way . " Mr. Moody replied , u And does not Deacon Bragdon need a few prayers too ? May not he be some out of the way , as well as his neighbor ? " " Oh ! no , no ; if I thought I was to blame , I would take my horse and ride fifty miles on-end ! " " Ah ! Deacon Bragdon , I believe it would take a pretty good horse to outride the Devil ! " This last reply of Mr. Moody , it is supposed , calmed the good Deacon . After Mr. Moody had worn his handkerchief over his face for some years , while living with Deacon Bragdon , he ascertained that the Rev. Daniel Little , of Kennebunk , was to supply on the annual fast day , and that he put up the night before , not a mile from Dea . Bragdon 's . Mr. Moody rose quite early on fastday morning , and went to Mr. Little 's bedroom window , and called out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and praising God , and you are here asleep . You have the sins of a whole nation to confess to-day , and yet asleep ! " He then hastily withdrew . Mr. /z/ Little stepped out of his bed , and raised his window to speak to him ; but he was gone . Mr. Little had not been preaching a great while then . Mr. Little acquired his theological education with Mr. Moodv , and married his niece , Miss Emerson , of Maiden . /z/ When he dined with others , he sat at a sidetable , with his face turned away from the company , toward the wall , when he removed the handkerchief from his face . He would sometimes let his friends see his face , by shutting his eyes when he raised his handkerchief . When he performed public services on the Sabbath , he would turn his back to the people and turn up his handkerchief , and then face them , turning it doivn when he prayed . When he attended meeting , and observed some looking about inattentively , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write on something they would be likely to see , " Where are your eyes now ? " " What has the minister said last ? " and to that effect . He took delight in having people attentive in time of worship . Mr. Lyman , his father 's successor , used to say , " He died a martyr to his own declaration , " viz. " that he could not preach ; " for in the latter part of his life , when over-persuaded to preach , he made the attempt , and died soon after . It has been a question whether it was not quite possible that his father made a /z/ mistake in urging him to undertake the work of the ministry ; that , if he had continued on in the course he was pursuing , he might have filled up a long life , with great usefulness to his fellow-creatures and comfort to himself and friends ; while , by turning aside from the path he chose , and which even Divine Providence seemed to mark out for him , he accomplished comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rev. William Allen , who had the perusal of his journal , which was kept for many years in short-hand and Latin , says , " It appears he had a strong attachment to Mary Hirst , of Boston ; but in May , 1722 , she was visited by Capt . Pepperell , who was more attractive in the eyes of the lady than the humble schoolmaster . She became the wife of Sir William JPeppereUi " A friend in York informs us that Mr. Moody married Miss Lucy White , daughter of Rev. John White , of Gloucester . He left three sons : Samuel , the first Preceptor of Dummer Academy , in Byfield , who never was married ; Joseph , who had a large family ; and Thomas , who also left descendants . /z/ The following letter from Rev. Jonathan Greenleaf was some years since published in the Christian Mirror , and possesses much interest , inasmuch as it gives the only account /z/ we have seen of the closing scene of Mr. Moody 's life :  --  " While I was settled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' was a complete desolation , no minister having been settled there for about twenty years , and but three persons were left in the church , and those three were females , and one of them more than one hundred years of age . Hence the neighboring ministers performed various ; missionary tours ' among that people . It was during some of these tours , that I learned the circumstances I will now relate . " Mr. Joseph Moody had preached but about six years , when the nervous disorder seized him , which laid him aside , or nearly so , for the remainder of his life . It was said , that , when he was a boy , an accidental discharge of a gun , in his hand , killed another boy . This circumstance deeply affected his mind ; and when the nervous disease attacked him , he thought he was a murderer , and this , among other things , gave him great distress . After the death of his wife , he ceased to keep house , and boarded with Deacon Bragdon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for many years he would not pray with others , nor hold any conversation , unless it was drawn out of him . The first time he was known to pray with others , was under very pressing circumstances . The person whose duty it was to lead the family clevo- /z/ tions , was , from some cause , quite out of humor , and the service was likely to be neglected , when Mr. Moody , who sat there in silence , with his face covered with a handkerchief , as usual , was appealed to , whether he would suffer family prayer to be neglected , because such a person was out of temper . ' Will not Mr. Moody be our mouth on this occasion ? ' Mr. Moody immediately kneeled down , and prayed with great fervency . From this time he caught hold of the idea of being the mouth of others in prayer , considering himself simply as the instrument through which the sound came . After this he spent much time in passing around the parish , entering every house , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold but very little , if any , conversation , but was praying continually . He still wore his handkerchief over his face , and kept himself secluded from the world . " I found with a family in that parish , a manuscript journal of Mr. Moody 's , extending from before his ordination to nearly the close of his life . The greater part of it was written in characters ; but , with the help of President Allen , I was able to decipher some part . I found many curious things , and many eccentric things , savoring of the peculiarly diseased state of his mind , yet mingled with the deepest devotion . I will give one or two specimens . At a certain date he makes the following record : ' This day , while engaged /z/ in player , I thought of a way to fasten my study door , and afterward found a better . ' He then went on to moralize on the impropriety of worldly thoughts , injected into the mind in the time of prayer . " At another time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made us a visit . The Elder , much engaged in religion , was greatly carried out in returning thanks at the table  --  was twenty minutes about it ? " The death of Mr. Moodv " was sudden , and attended with some remarkable circumstances . He had in early life been a great singer , but after his indisposition he laid it wholly aside ; and although he recovered so far as to pray , and sometimes to talk , and even at times laid aside his handkerchief , and appeared somewhat more cheerful , yet he would not sing . At length , one day , which he spent alone in his chamber , he was heard to break forth into singing , to the great astonishment of the family . Almost the whole afternoon , he was singing , with great animation , the 17th Hymn of the 1st Book of Watts ' Hymns : " Oh for an overcoming faith , To cheer my dying hours , " &c.; He did not come out of his chamber at night , and the next morning was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this good man .

He was ordained the first minister of Newmarket , N. H. , Nov. 25th , 1730 , and died in 1778 , aged 73 .

" /z/ Benjamin Moody was the second son of Caleb , son of the first Caleb . His father was brother to the Rev. Samuel Moody , of York . He was born in 1721 , and died on the 23d of February , 1802 , at the advanced age of 81 years . The inscription on his tombstone thus portrays his character :  --  " Though lowly in station , and unaspiring in mind , he attained the most exalted and venerable of human characters , that of an exemplary and eminent Christian . This sacred profession he substantiated and adorned by a humble , meek , and affectionate spirit , by simplicity and gentleness of manners , and by a conversation singularly uniform and irreproachable . His very soul seemed composed of love to God , and tender benevolence to man . In him , religion appeared at once dignified and amiable , commanding and attractive . He had a good report of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . Y " et he felt and lamented innumerable defects , and placed all his dependence on the merits of the divine Redeemer ; into whose hand , after a short illness , he resigned his soul in sweet submission and humble hope . " The Rev. Daniel Dana delivered a sermon , from Ps. 37 : 37 , which was published , on occasion of the death of Mr. Moody , who was a /z/ ruling elder in his church , from which the following passages are taken :  --  " Doubtless , if the delineation given of the perfect and upright is in any measure just , most of you have been applying it to that venerable man of God , whose recent departure has excited so extensive a grief through the town . Few , probably very few , there are , or have been , to whom it is equally applicable . On most occasions , I have been averse to public description and praise of the dead ; but , on the present , neither regard to the Providence of God , nor to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would permit me wholly to decline it . There is a peculiar pleasure , as well as propriety , in paying honor at death to those excellent men who through life shrunk and retired from their own praise . And if religion is the highest glory of our nature , and if to have much of the spirit of Christ is to be eminent in religion , I must confess I have known no man personally , who has appeared to me more worthy of honor and everlasting remembrance , than he whom we now lament . " The basis of his character seems to have been an habitual sense and reverence of Deity . He exhibited much of the fear of God ; a fear , which , far from being abject and servile , seemed constantly cherished by a filial , ardent , active love . Wherever he went , and however employed , his simple object was to do his /z/ Father 's business , and approve himself to his eye . A lively impression of his Providence in all events commanded his submission , and his fatherly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed God in all things , and all things in God . In an eminent sense , he walked with his Maker , and appeared habitually to converse less with his fellow-creatures , than with Him who is invisible . " The man who converses much with God , will be humble . This was a conspicuous trait in the character of our deceased friend . While all around him were convinced that he was eminent in grace , he seemed honestly to apprehend himself less than the least of all saints , and often felt oppressed in receiving that love and honor which , to others , appeared far less than was due . Indeed , humility , that cardinal virtue of the Christian , made up a great part of his character . He had deep and extensive views of human depravity , and of his own indwelling corruption , and went mourning under a sense of them . Hence he experimentally felt , and highly appreciated , the importance of a Saviour , of his atonement , his intercession , and the influences of the Holy Spirit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that they only laid a foundation , sufficiently broad and deep , for the salvation and the religion of a sinner . On these he ventured his soul and his eternal hopes . They not only supported him in death , /z/ but sweetened and adorned his life ; while his life recommended them , and demonstrated how superior is a religion , animated by the pure principles of the gospel , to every thing beside that bears the name . The very spirit of his Master breathed in his temper , and shone out in his life . Where shall we find a man of such an affectionate , uniting , healing spirit ; so ready to overleap those barriers which bigotry erects between Christians ; so free from that narrow , contentious , censorious spirit , which , I am grieved to say it , has done such infinite mischief in this place ; so ready to take to his arms and heart the friends of God , wherever found , and with whatever society connected ; so ready to throw the veil of candor and compassion over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as the truth and purity , of the gospel ; so distant from the affectation of pressing unhallowed human passion into the service of religion ; so ready to bear and forbear , to become any thing , every thing , or nothing , so that Christ might be honored , and his cause promoted ? Yet , when occasion and duty called , he was no unfaithful reprover ; and the evident reluctance with which this office was assumed , with the meekness and compassion which tempered his reproofs , gave them double weight and efficacy . " The sick and afflicted among us will long remember the Christian benevolence and sympathy with which he visited , counselled , and /z/ comforted them . On these occasions , and others , his prayers were remarkable . Never have I heard from the lips of a man , prayers which to me appeared more of a nature to solemnize and elevate the mind , to enkindle and cherish the spirit of devotion ; I might add , to instruct and to edify . With what a fulness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and variety of expression , have we often , in our religious meetings , heard him plead the cause of God and man , of his fellowcreatures and fellow-Christians , of his dear country and dearer Zion ? His prayers were far from study and formality , and literally the overflowings of a pious heart . Remarkably did they realize the sublime description : " Prayer ardent opens heaven ! lets down a stream Of glory on the consecrated hour Of man , in audience " with the Deity " He conversed with his God as a friend ; yet who ever perceived , in the prayers of this good man , any thing the most remotely bordering on unbecoming familiarity or irreverence ? " He loved the habitation of God 's house , and was never more in his element than when engaged in public worship . Did not his constant attendance in the sanctuary ,  --  not only on the Sabbath , but on all occasional meetings , if practicable , and this when he walked from so great a distance , though almost sinking under infirmities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be led by others ,  --  did /z/ not such an affecting spectacle forcibly reprove some of us , who live near the sanctuary , and have our strength and faculties unimpaired ? " He was universally conscientious and exemplary . The love of Christ , which constrained him , and the fear of God , in which he acted , imparted a complexion of dignity , amiableness , and uniformity , to his whole demeanor . And methinks the high esteem and reverence in which he was held by all classes and characters among us , afforded a pleasing demonstration how much may be done by living , breathing , and acting out the true spirit of Christianity , to commend it to the consciences of all , and to keep alive a general conviction that there is something great and excellent in real religion . " As he was held in general veneration , he was particularly valued and honored in this church and congregation , in which he sustained the office of ruling elder , if I mistake not , nearly thirty-four years . He ruled well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper the dignity and authority of Christian government with exemplary tenderness , moderation , and meekness of wisdom , can claim such a description . " His death was peaceful  --  remarkably free from every thing of terror and dismay . He manifested , indeed , in his last scene , his usual humility in speaking of himself . Nevertheless , in the clear consciousness of death 's ap- /z/ proach , he signified his cheerful resignation to the will of God , and declared that he was not afraid to die . Being asked if he did not think he was going to the enjoyment of his Saviour , ' Oh ! ' replied this humble man , ' if I might be so hapjjy ! ' Soon after , he fell asleep , and is doubtless now enjoying that happiness of which he had such exalted conceptions and such ardent desires . " /z/ Master Moody , as the subject of this article was generally called , was the son of that eminent man of God , the Rev. Joseph Moody , first minister of the Second Parish in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1746 and 1749 . He was distinguished for his critical and thorough knowledge of Latin and Greek . He early devoted his attention to theology , and became a preacher of repute in several places , in one of which he received an invitation to settle in the ministry . Like several of his relatives , he was at times afflicted with a nervous affection , which gave him a very humble opinion of himself and of all his performances . He was led to tremble at the thought of such an important undertaking . It appeared to him , especially in some /z/ of his gloomy turns , that he should never be able to honor his Redeemer in so solemn a work as the duties of the pastoral office involved ; and he finally relinquished the pulpit for the arduous labors of an instructor of youth . In this character he shone with an unrivalled reputation . The Preceptor of Dummer Academy , in the meridian and past the meridian of life , was the subject of greater veneration and applause , than the president of any college in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the university , for their accurate acquaintance with the classics ; and not a few of them have been numbered with the most eminent literati of New England . He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , and was honored with a magistrate 's commission . His presence , when free from his nervous complaint , always gave pleasure in the company of the learned . A fund of information , with his readiness to communicate , accompanied with an unusual ease and elegance of address , rendered him a welcome guest in every circle . He died , suddenly , at Exeter , in New Hampshire , while actively engaged in an object of benevolence , for the benefit of his native place . Alcle ? i #@# s Epitaphs . The Catalogue of Dummer Academy , printed in 1844 , thus notices this distinguished individual /z/ " He was a very celebrated and successful teacher in his native town , until called to take charge of Dummer Academy , in 1763 .

Upon the opening of the Academy , under his instruction , it at once attained a very high and unrivalled reputation . Youth from all parts of this State , and the neighboring States , collected to enjoy its privileges ; and , during its most palmy days , it was not only filled to overflowing , but frequently great numbers applied who could not be admitted . For over seven vears , the number of scholars averaged upwards of seventy . The fame of Master Moody was spread far and wide ; and no prouder memorial of his success as a teacher could be given , than the names on the catalogue , of those whom he educated .

He left no child to mourn his sudden death , ( for he died a bachelor , ) Yet his numerous pupils in the United States will ever retain a lively sense of the sociability , industry , integrity , and piety , he possessed in an uncommon degree ; as well as the disinterested , zealous , faithful , and useful manner he discharged the duties of the Academy for thirty years . He died at Exeter , Dec. 14 , 1795 , aged seventy . " If ( says a worthy pupil of Master Moody , who is now living ) there was ever a man of whom all this could be truly said , that man was Master Moody . " His eminent success as a teacher was owing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , and entire devotedness to the profession of his choice . Few men ever had that control over youth which he possessed . He was exceedingly beloved by his pupils , and at the same time highly respected . He never commanded , but to be obeyed . He did not deem it necessary at all times to preserve perfect silence in the school-room , and very frequently the scholars were permitted to study aloud , to leave their seats , and converse with /z/ each other during study hours ; yet so perfect was his government , that one rap on his desk invariably brought them into complete order . The rod was used but seldom , and he took pride in the fact that for thirty years , while teacher , he had never resorted to it . He devised many expedients to take its place . One , for example , which is often mentioned by his surviving pupils , was , if a scholar was found guilty of falsehood , to punish him by detaining him from his sports on Saturday afternoon until he had read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ; sketch of the character of Mr. Moody is from a Sermon at his funeral , Dec. 23 , 1795 , by one of his pupils :  --  " Samuel Moody , Esq. , son of that eminent man of God , the Rev. Joseph Moody , first beloved pastor of the North Church in York , and grandson of that godly and faithful man , the Rev. Samuel Moody , many years pastor of the South Church in that town , was born at York in April , 1726 , and received the honors of Harvard College in the year 1746 . Designed by his friends for the work of the ministry , and probably at that time inclined to it himself , he made divinity his study for some time . When he entered the desk , he appeared to good advantage , was a considerably popular preacher , and received an invitation to settle in the ministry ; but , considering the /z/ greatness of the work , and constitutionally prone to gloom at times , he trembled at the thought of so great and solemn an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and gave up the design . Mr. Moody seemed in many respects well calculated for the work of the ministry . He was what has been usually termed orthodox , i.e. Calvinistic , in sentiment ; yet catholic  - -  far from bigotry ; considered it unprofitable , and unbecoming gospel ministers , to dwell chiefly in their preaching upon the mysteries of the kingdom of Heaven , which are incomprehensible to all . He was easy of access , open and frank , friendly and communicative . Composition was easy to him ; no man had a greater fund of words at command , and no man seemed to possess a happier talent at arranging them properly , and bringing out of his treasure the best words to convey his ideas : consequently , his language was pure , and his style manly , easy , and elegant . Having ( notwithstanding he was possessed of such qualifications for the ministry ) laid aside all thoughts of engaging in the arduous work , he devoted himself to the service of the young and rising generation . The education of youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have especially designed him ; for this he was in many respects well qualified ; and in this sphere he long shone with distinguished lustre . He was an adept in those branches of liter- /z/ ature which are necessary to qualify youth for admission into colleges . He had little to do with mathematical studies , and discovered an aversion to them ; but the Latin and Greek languages were familiar to him , and he had considerable acquaintance with the French tougue . Being known as an instructor of youth , he was applied to from various parts of the country ; and , while he resided in his native town , he did his part to furnish the world with several very eminent scholars and eminently useful men . From York he was called to take charge of a school founded by Gov . Dummer , which the fame of Master Moody soon filled with students , and through his influence this seminary of learning was incorporated into an Academy . Here this learned preceptor presided with great respect and eminent usefulness near thirty years , till , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never implied any badness of heart ) , his friends advised him to resign his charge , and retire . This excellent man had a hand in forming the minds of many youth , who have risen to eminence in the world , and have shone with great lustre in the spheres in which they have acted . Witness the sacred desk , the bench , the bar , yea , every learned profession . He often reflected with great pleasure , that his sons ( as he termed his pupils ) were to be found figuring eminently in almost every de- /z/ partment ;  --  Judges of courts , Senators in Congress , in the Senate of the Commonwealth , and among the most shining characters at the bar ; yea , at the heads of schools and academies : and even the University of Cambridge was , at , the time of his death , indebted to him for their President , and for the Professors of Divinity , Mathematics , Philosophy , and Oriental Languages . Having taken this brief survey of the life of Mr. Moody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was his glory , his comfort , his happiness  --  viz. that he was godly and faithful in all . When the godly and faithful man is described to be a believer in God and in his Son Jesus Christ , conscientiously conformed to the will of his heavenly Father ,  --  a man of prayer ; zealous in the cause of God ; delighting in opportunities of communion with him , in attendance upon his public worship ; exercising himself to have always a conscience void of offence towards God and towards men ; sincere in all his professions toward God and men , and conscientious in his whole deportment , in every character , station and relation in life ,  --  I think it will be said by those who knew him , Such was the character of Master Moody . We may appeal to those best acquainted with him , whether they have known a man more conscientious in his regard to the great God , or more strictly just in his dealings with men . Was any per-il /z/ son , acquainted with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any man scruple taking his word ? It was sacred and inviolable as his oath . His tongue was unused to speak deceit  --  never given to slander and reproach . This maxim he inculcated upon his pupils : De mortuis et absentibus nil nisi bonum  --  concerning those that are dead and those that are absent , sav nothing but good : and never man more rigidly adhered to it than he . It has been frequently observed of Mr. Moody , that he spake evil of nobody ; that if he erred in giving characters , it was in speakin 2 ; too favorablv of those who did not take due care of their own reputation . Blessed with eminently pious connections , the best instructions and examples , by a Divine blessing on those means he was excited to remember his Creator in the days of his youth , and make a public profession of the religion of Jesus . And the inhabitants of his native town have been witnesses , and God also , how holily and justly and unblameably he has conducted ; how solicitous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great and good cause he had espoused ; how exemplary in his observance of divine institutions ; with what diligence , constancy , and solemnity , he attended the public worship and holy ordinances of God . No gloom on his mind , no weather , no travelling , prevented this . If it was possible to go to the house of prayer , his seat was never empty . /z/ This godly man was faithful in the discharge of every trust reposed in him . and punctual to an extreme . As a magistrate , from his known fidelity and sacred regard to an oath , it must be concluded that he was a terror to evildoers . As a preceptor , his pupils will testify his fidelity in inculcating upon them the importance of diligence , as they would not frustrate the expectations of their friends . Of this he was a remarkable example himself ,  --  ever punctual to his hours , and filling up the whole time with duty . By his instructions and constant example , he recommended to his pupils the pursuit of those things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely , and of good report . Master Moody was a sincere and faithful friend , and a man zealous and indefatigable in his endeavors to promote the honor of God and the good of mankind , in his lucid hours : at those periods he seemed always to be laying some plan to subserve those great ends . Though his plans ( in the opinion of his friends ) were not always the most judicious , when he was so exceedingly braced , and his ideas in a degree deranged ; yet there was always the same benevolent design : the liberal soul devising liberal things . Though he finished his public career some years before his death , yet his zeal for the general good was not in the least abated , when he felt himself capable of serving mankind in any respect . His friends will testify how anxious he was , in the last weeks of /z/ his life , after having been dead a year ( as he expressed it ) , and raised from the dead , to see harmony restored to his country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States and other faithful officers of government ; how solicitous for the preservation of peace , and the speedy resettlement of a pastor in the north parish in York ; with what zeal he aimed to carry into effect a plan laid for promoting useful knowledge in his native town , by establishing a social library : in the pursuit of this object , he suddenly finished his course . These hints have given an imperfect picture of this Israelite indeed , in whom was no guile . But , alas ! this godly man has ceased ; this faithful man hath failed from among the children of men . The pious , the learned , friendly , benevolent , generous and compassionate , industrious and faithful Moody is no more : not blotted out of being ; but , having bid adieu to this world , has taken possession of immortal life  --  a life worth enjoying ; the reward of a good and faithful servant . Let us go and do likewise ,  --  like him be faithful unto death , that with him we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wMch will never fade away . /z/ Silas Moody was born in Newbury , Mass. , May 9 , 1742 . He was in the fourth generation from his great ancestor , William Moody , who came from England . Samuel , his greatgrandfather , married Mary Cutting , Nov. 30 , 1657 . Their children were William , John , Samuel , Cutting , and probably others . Samuel , the third son , was born 1671 . He had but one son ,  --  William ,  --  whose sons were Samuel , William , Thomas , Silas , and Nicholas . Silas , the fourth son , is the subject of our sketch . He entered Cambridge College at the early age of fifteen , and , receiving the usual honors of that institution , graduated in 1761 .

Mr. Moody , in his answer to the invitation , replied , that " the unanimity which appears in the church and town with regard to my tarrying here , I can not but acknowledge , demands my serious consideration ; and did all other things appear equally encouraging , I should not have remained so long in suspense about complying with your invitation .

" The remainder of his reply related to the state of his health , which , he said , was " very weak , " and which unfitted him for enduring the hardships and fatigues which a strong constitution might bear with ; and the manner in which his salary was to be paid , if he accepted their invitation . His terms were not complied with immediately , but , after some delay , were accepted ; and Mr. Moody sent the parish the following letter : u To the Church of Christ in Arundel , and to the Inhabitants of said Town , greeting . " When I received an invitation from you , to settle in the work of the gospel ministry /z/ with you , the difficulties then subsisting were very discouraging to me .

She was an excellent woman , a true help-meet to her husband ; and was not only prepossessing in her personal appearance , but exhibited , in an eminent degree , the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit , and was greatly beloved , by all who knew her , for her tender sympathies and Christian virtues . She survived her husband twenty-six years , and died in 1842 , aged 85. /z/ It is recorded of Mr. Moody , that he was a man of undissembled religion and piety , conscientious and faithful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well acquainted , having studied them with care and advantage . His sermons were evangelical , plain , and spiritual ; not designed to lead his hearers into unfathomable mysteries , /z/ but to make them sound in the faith , and lead their hearts to Christ . His religious sentiments were Calvinistic ; not bigoted , but liberal . The Divinity of Christ was a precious doctrine , and he dwelt with peculiar pleasure on the great scheme of redemption . The author of the History of Kennebunkport says of him : " He was a man of fair talents ; but his health , which was always feeble , disqualified him for close application to his studies . Some of his occasional sermons evinced much research , and the one on the death of Washington was published by request of his society . He maintained a considerable degree of popularity , and was much respected during his long settlement in Arundel of more than forty-five years . " As a pastor he was very laborious , from a sense of duty and necessity ; his parish being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four wide . His ministry embraced the period of both the American wars ; and , consequently , he led his people through troublous times . On examining his sermons preached at these periods , it is observed that a most pious and tender solicitude is manifested , lest the corruptions of the times should prove hurtful to the Church of God , and thereby many be led away from the truth . About the time of the breaking out of the American Revolution , he preached a sermon from Isaiah xxvi. 20 , in /z/ which he notices the threatening aspect of the times , and urges the duty of greater watchfulness , prayerfulness , and devotion on the part of God 's people . Mr. Moody was eminently practical in all his discourses , as well as in his pastoral labors among the people ; taking great pains to promote not only a sound morality and a most strict regard to the outward observance of the ordinances of the gospel , but also an imvard , heartfelt piety . He was particularly anxious that all the people of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one of the largest and most flourishing con err e stations in the State , during a large period of his ministry . The catechizing of the children of the town , a practice then observed by most faithful ministers , was a constant and regular service with him , and one in which he took much delight ; his long experience teaching him the value of thus engrafting the Divine word into the young and tender mind . He was much interested in the children of the town ; and his faithful and affectionate instructions , and the good impressions made at these catechisings , were never effaced . There are many now living who say , " I never shall forget Mr. Moody 's pious conversations . " Rev. John Kelley , of Hampstead , N. H. , in a letter to the writer , dated September 16 , 1846 , when Mr. K. was eighty-three and a half years of age , says : /z/ " While I lived some time in the vicinity of Arundel , I saw and heard , several times , Rev. Silas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing of so serious and godly a man in the pulpit . And from the present state of society in that place , we may learn what a happy influence a good minister may have upon a people , lor many years to come . Arundel was originally called Cape Porpoise , but it now bears the name of Kennebunkport . In that place a church was established in the year 1730 , soon after a massacre was committed by the Indians , about the time my grandfather on my mother 's side fell a victim to their fury . On the 9th of January , 1771 , Rev. Silas Moody was ordained third * pastor of that church ; and the people have enjoyed a preached gospel most of the time ever since , and the Holy Ghost has often been sent down from heaven upon them . " The Rev. Jonathan Cogswell , who was for several years settled at Saco , thus writes :  --  " Mr. Moody 's ministerial labors ceased not long after my settlement at Saco . By his request I preached a lecture for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before his death . He was an amiable , mild , and prudent man ; a man of unblemished character , and esteemed by his people . The congregation , at the time /z/ of his death , was large and highly respectable , which is the most decisive proof of the salutary influence of his ministry . I suppose he considered himself a moderate Calvinist . He was , like the rest of the Moodys , sincere , upright , stable , consistent , not carried away with every wind of doctrine . On account of these traits of character , I have always highly regarded all the Moodvs I have known . " Mr. Moody never enjoyed good health , and much of the time in his later vears he was severely afflicted with tic-doloureaux and general prostration of the system ; but he would almost always contrive to perform his ministerial labors , oftentimes to the astonishment of his people . He was indefatigable in his efforts for their best welfare . In remote sections of the town , he would go from house to house , visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwellings could not be approached in any other way ; this , too , when he was in very feeble health , and much of the time suffering intense pain . He was fruitful in labors and in good works . He lived at a time when Bibles , and tracts , and religious books , were not so easy of access as now ; and in his parochial visits he was in the habit of distribtributing some useful books from his own wellchosen library . Consequently he had the satisfaction of seeing an intelligent , worthy , and religious people growing up around him . In theology , his sermons unequivocally /z/ declare that he was of that stamp now denominated orthodox congregationalist . The church still retains the same faith . When the new Theological Seminary at Andover began to send forth its ministers , Mr. Moody showed them a decided preference , and often invited them to his pulpit , to the no small prejudice and dislike of some of his less discriminating brethren in the ministry . He preached two sermons on the death of Washington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the neighboring towns . The performance was spoken of as peculiarly worthy of the occasion , and was published by direction of his society . This is his only published work of which we have any knowledge . /z/ He was a man of mild and even temper ; and , in his family and domestic relations , he was exceedingly regular and consistent in all his habits . He was the father of twelve children ,  --  seven sons and five daughters ; and , as a part of religion , he taught them to " honor their father and their mother ; " and few men , perhaps , ever received more honor and respect in his own household than he . In this particular he much resembled President Edwards . He pursued a regular and systematic course of religious instruction in the family , which con- /z/ tributed , no doubt , in producing those precise , orderly , and consistent habits for which they were very remarkable , so much so , that they were considered a model family by all who knew them . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his children with all the tenderness and assiduity possible ; he prayed much with and for his family ; and , when absent , his letters to them breathed the same ardent desire that they might be all the gospel required . His sons were Daniel , * William , Samuel , Asaph , Charles , Charles 2d , and Silas . His daughters , Mary , who married Dr. Deane , of Biddeford ; Sophia , Sally , Anna , and Hannah . Asaph , Sophia , and Sally , are now living . Though his salary was always very moderate , yet he was enabled , by economy and prudence , to bring up a large family in comparative comfort , enjoying a style and habit of living which betokened thrift rather than otherwise . " In the year 1777 , the town voted to give Mr. Moody for the year 1778 . In 1779 , the late emission of money having greatly depreciated , the town voted ' to pay the Rev. Mr. Moody 's salary , the present year , in produce and labor , the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . ' "  --  Hist . Kennebunhport. /z/ The first efforts for foreign missions in his parish were made in 1811 . Mr. Moody was much interested in the subject , and freely opened his pulpit to the agents of the society , and also did much to enlist the sympathies of his people , when neighboring ministers had failed to see the benefits that would result from well-timed efforts , and some were even opposed to the cause . Subsequently the " Female Mite Society " was formed in the parish ; and from their benefactions several heathen youth have been educated and reared up to usefulness at the Mission Seminary at Batticotta , Ceylon . One of the early beneficiaries of this society was a heathen child , who received the Christian name of Silas Moody , in honor of my grandfather . From this youth several letters have been received , through the several stages of his education . The following , though written some years since , contains so much of general interest , that I think no apology need be offered for inserting it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My ever-dear Benefactresses ,  --  I beg to acknowledge the receipt of two letters from you , dated July 12 , 1833 , written by Sarah Moody , to which I answered in September or October , 1834 ; and the other dated November 29 , 1834 , written by H. Moody , which I read with great joy . I am ready to send you letters at every opportunity , and so I hope you will also do . I believe you have a great desire to know of my present /z/ and past state . I was regularly dismissed from the seminary , Oct. 1st , 1834 , together with my classmates . In October I wished to attend Theology , and began that important and excellent study in order to understand the Bible better . Some of my classmates , who are members of the church , and myself , were taught for a year by the Rev. D. Poor , and by Professor James R. Eckard . The studies which I attended to are , Home 's Introduction to the Bible , Poux 's Theological Dictionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible , Robinson 's Ancient and Modern History , and also read several sermons . As I had not these books in my possession , I borrowed them from my superiors , and returned them back . I am in need of all these books , with Scott 's Commentary . In September , 1835 , I finished my course of studies , and went with Mr. Poor to Madura , which is in the southern part of Hindostan , where I found many people ignorant of Christ and of his religion . There heathenism prevails much more than in any other part of India . That place is celebrated for giving birth to the Tamul . There is a temple of a celebrated Goddess , named Menatchy , who is the wife of Siva , who is the Supreme God among the Tamulians . The structure of that temple is indeed magnificent and beautiful . People are wholly drowned in the ocean of vileness . Heathenism is in a ravins ; state there . I have been there for the space of three months , and distributed Tracts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time I spent there in teaching an English school , which contains more than eighty boys . When I spoke to any about Christ , many surrounded me and laughed , and sometimes stoned me ; but I patiently suffered all for the sake of Jesus Christ . The people are very peevish , proud , and selfish . I returned to my country , and there I was a teacher in the seminary for six months . I spent all my afternoons in distributing tracts . Now at present I am in Madras , under the kind care of the Rev. M. Winslow and Dr. Scudder . Here they opened an English school /z/ at the beginning of this month , and I am teaching that school . I spend my leisure hours in going among the people , and admonishing them . I wish to spend my lifetime to be a co-worker with the missionaries , in doing our Master 's work . I do not know how to recompense you . You supported me from my infancy , and enlightened my mind to do the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . I got all temporal and spiritual blessings suited to my body and soul by your aid . I thank you , my dear Madams , for all the favors which I received and receive from you . I am very glad that 1 have made so much progress in learning human sciences , by your liberality . But I am especially glad that I have found Jesus as my Saviour . I hope I shall continue to know more of him , and follow him closely ; for he has said in his Holy Word , " They that follow me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life . " All that believe in him have found him a precious Saviour . I trust in him at all times , and pray to him that I may have his grace to keep me from every temptation and sin . I received from you some books and clothing : the latter is not useful for me , and was given to the mission ; for our country 's dress is quite different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my age , original name , employment , food , dress , and many other things that will be interesting to you . In answer to these , my age is 19 . My original name is Sangarapully Cander , which is a heathen Deity 's name . My food is commonly rice , fish , vegetables , and fruits . I dress six cubits of cloth round my loins , and wear a shawl of eight cubits on my body , and wrap a handkerchief round my head , and wear earrings in my ears . You wished to know more of two others , named George Payson and J. P. Fessenden . G. Payson had been in school for some time , and was taken out by Mr. Woodward as a servant to him . He is a member of the church , and married to a Christian girl in the school at Odooville . I do not know about J. P. F. I hope God will continue to bless you and prosper /z/ you in doing charity to the heathen , who are dying the living water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and send it by the first opportunity . With sentiments of high respect , I have the honor , Dear Madams , to be your obedient and humble servant , Silas Moody . This pious young man is now employed by the missionaries as a catechist and assistant , in the work of propagating the gospel among the heathen . We have recently seen on record , at the " Missionary House " in this city , along " Catechist 's Report " from the Ceylon mission , for 1844 , in which Silas Moody is often mentioned as performing essentially the same service , in kind , that our most faithful tract distributors and colporteurs perform in this country  --  enlightening the ignorant , reclaiming the vile and wicked , strengthening the faith and hope of the humble and believing , and administering comfort and consolation to the sick and afflicted . The following extract from his report will show something of the nature of his work , as well as the character of the heathen mind :  --  " Visited a Siva priest . The high priest was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference between your religion and mine ? ' I repeated to him some of the commandments . He answered , ; Oh ! the Siva religion contains them , ' and quoted some verses on each point to prove it . I answered farther , ' Christianity presents the only worthy Mediator , Jesus Christ ' , by whom alone we can be reconciled to God . ' He answered , ' Our religion presents us with media- /z/ tors also . ' ' But they are great sinners ; we can not trust them . ' ' What you call their sins , were to them sacred amusements . ' " /z/ In 1815 he had become quite infirm , and his parish proposed settling a colleague with him . They accordingly invited Rev. Nathan Lord , of Berwick , now President of Dartmouth College , to settle with them in the ministry . Mr. Lord preached there a short time , but did not accept the call . In a letter addressed to the writer in 1846 , he says , " My residence in Kennebunkport was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , your grandfather was greatly debilitated , and incapable of much intercourse , even with his friends . I remember his venerable appearance , and his devout sentiments in view of his approaching decease ; but I never saw him out of his sick room . The impression I received of him , however , was highly favorable to the excellence of his character , and his standing as a preacher . " He died on the 4th of April , 1816 , aged 74 years . A few days before his death , Dea . Burnham called to see him , when he requested him to read that admirable hymn of Watts , entitled Christ 's presence makes death easy . Why should we start , and fear to die ? What timorous worms we mortals are ? Death is the gate of endless joy , And yet we dread to enter there . /z/ The pains , the groans , the dying strife , Fright our approaching souls away ; Still we shrink back again to life , Fond of our prison and our clay . Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should stretch her wings in haste ; Fly fearless through death 's iron gate , Nor feel the terrors as she passed . Jesus can make a dying bed Feel soft as downy pillows are ; " While on his breast I lean my head , And breathe my life out sweetly there . He then expressed himself refreshed in spirit , and that he still enjoyed a comfortable hope of acceptance Tith God , through the merits of the ever-blessed Redeemer . In one of his earliest sermons , he says , " The frail nature , perhaps , even of the best of Christians may be shocked at the thoughts of death , the dissolution of the soul and body , and the separation from the dear companions of life . But , if they realize that the dark road through the valley of the shadow of death will soon bring them to an open day , an eternal day that shall never end , it must greatly dispel their fears and renew their strength . St. John says he heard a voice from heaven , saying , Blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ henceforth ; yea , saith the Spirit , that they may rest from their labors , and their works do follow them . " It is believed that , during the whole of his protracted sickness , he enjoyed comfortable tokens of the Divine presence . He had hum- /z/ ble views of himself , as every one must have , who has exalted views of Christ ; and , as might be expected of a man of his temperament and solidity of character , he died in peace  --  his end w r as happy . He came to the close of life in a good old age , like a shock of corn fully ripe . " Mark the perfect man , and behold the upright ; for the end of that man is peace . Let me die the death of the righteous , and let my last end be like his . " /z/ Paul Moody , son of Paul Moody , of Byfield , was descended from Samuel Moody , the same from whom Rev. Silas Moody was descended , but was one generation farther down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 , 1779 , and was one of nine children , of the same family  --  seven brothers and two sisters - most of whom were older than himself . Two of his brothers received a college eclucation ; but Paul , who was more inclined to mechanical pursuits than to books , and somewhat disposed to have his own way , had only the benefit of common-school instruction , unless he was for a short time a member of Dumraer Academy . In early childhood , he would be- /z/ come so absorbed with his playthings , as sometimes to insist upon taking to bed with him such as were cumbersome ; and when some of the family remonstrated with the woman who had the care of him , for allowing him to do so , she significantly said that she found it much less trouble to let him have his own way in that matter . He often spoke of the first money he ever earned , as affording him a good lesson upon its value . A bricklayer , at work in his neighborhood , offered him a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bricks to him , on the staging . He undertook the job ; and , though he found it much more laborious than he expected , he persevered till he accomplished it . He remarked that he then first learned the value of money . At the age of twelve he made up his mind that farming was not the business for him , and deliberately resolved not to be dependent on his family , but to provide for himself by his own exertions . He long afterwards described to his sister the favorite and well-known spot , on their father 's farm , where he lay and revolved these thoughts in his mind . There was about that time a small factory in Byfield , where he determined to learn to weave . He made repeated applications to one of the weavers to teach him the art , but was constantly refused . At length , the weaver , returning one day to his work , found a difference in the working of his loom : and , upon very strict search , he discovered a small /z/ obstruction so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He immediately said , " Paul Moody is the only one who could have done it . " Paul soon found another workman in the same factory , ready to teach him what he was so eager to learn ; so that , at the age of sixteen , he was a practical weaver . He afterwards spoke of the information then obtained , as being of essential advantage to him in starting looms at Waltham and Lowell . Jacob Perkins , Esq . having invented a successful machine for cutting nails , put up a small nail factory in Byfield , wherein Moody found valuable instruction and satisfactory employment . He continued with Mr. Perkins several years , during which time the establishment was removed to Amesbury . Having made himself master of the Carding Machine , which was then about the ultimatum of improvements in the woollen manufacture in this country , he employed himself for a time in making machines , and was many months in Boscawin , N. H. , putting them in operation . He had also similar jobs in Maine , and other places . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , he was married to Miss Susan Morrill , daughter of Mr. Jonathan Morrill , of Amesbury , with whom he happily lived till the day of his death , and who yet survives . Soon after his marriage , he entered into a copartnership with Ezra Worthen and others , /z/ for erecting ; and running a cotton mill in Amesbury . In this business lie was successfully engaged about fourteen years ; a term which embraced the period of our troubles with France and England , resulting in the war of 1812 . It was a period in which the minds of the people were strongly turned to the subject of home productions , and especially to the manufacture of cotton and woollen goods . During this time , Mr. Moody had become a thorough , practical machinist , and fully acquainted with all that was then generally known of cotton-spinning and weaving . His business had been very profitable , and he was in a position to make his fortune equal to his enterprise . By this time , the attention of Boston capitalists began to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise of Francis Lowell , Esq . the Waltham . Company had been formed ; and their works were in a state of some forwardness , when they were looking for a man to superintend the machinery , and put the mill in operation . Application was made to Mr. Perkins , supposed to be the most competent person to fill the situation . But he , being then about to leave the country , declined the offer for himself , but recommended his friend Moody as the best man that he knew for the place ; whereupon he was engaged for Waltham , and in 1814 , he removed his family thither . /z/ His situation was now one of great responsibility , affording unlimited scope for his talents and energy . Just when an immense and unprecedented demand was made for cotton manufacture , and the machinery demanded improvement , he , having been endowed with a singular mechanical talent , cultured by twenty years ' practical training , was placed in a condition the most favorable in the world , for making those improvements . His success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was such as more than to sustain the expectations of his friends and employers . It is not easy to specify the improvements attributable to his agency . Some of his inventions , while at Waltham , are the dead spindle , the throstle filling frame , the governor , and the double speeder , warping and dressing frame ; all which are in use at the present time ( 1847 ) , not having been superseded by subsequent inventions . It is a remarkable fact , and illustrative of the strength and peculiarity of his mind , that most of his calculations were made in his head , with but little use of pen and paper . In the winter of 1821 , the gentlemen concerned in the Waltham enterprise , having already brought into use the available waterpower at that place , were looking out for some situation where they might extend their operations . From the position which Mr. Moody occupied , the confidence of his employers in his judgment and ability , and the fact that his /z/ interest was identified with their own , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience in seeking- a new location . He had two of his children at school in Bradford Academy . Taking Mrs. Moody in a chaise , he went to Bradford to see the children , with the expectation of meeting some of the leading Waltham proprietors , for the purpose of exploring . The day , however , proved rainy , and the gentlemen did not appear , as he expected . The next day he took his family and went down to Amesbury , where he saw his old friend and early partner , Mr. Worthen . The latter , having been given to understand the object of the excursion , said , " Why do n't you go up to Pawtucket Falls ? There is a power there worth ten times as much as you will find any where else . " An arrangement was soon made for them to visit the spot together . Mr. Worthen , in one chaise , and Mr. and Mrs. Moody and their daughter Susan , in another , set off from Amesbury in the morning . When they came to the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen left the chaises , and spent some time , walking , talking , and looking about . On returning to the carriages , they went on to the public house , where they dined . After dinner , they rode out again , and explored cautiously in the direction and neighborhood of Pawtucket Falls . The two friends then parted for their respective homes . Mr. Moody re- /z/ turned to Waltham , and reported to the gentlemen what he had seen , and his opinion in the case . Whereupon it was decided forthwith to secure that location . Mr. Thomas M. Clark , of Newburyport , was then , and had been for some years , the Clerk of the Proprietors of Locks and Canals on Merrimac River . The discharge of his office required him to be much in the neighborhood of the locks and falls , and well acquainted with the people in the vicinity . He was fixed upon as the most suitable person to secure the lands , and one whose movement in the matter would be least likely to awaken suspicion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very generous for the lands as farms . In like manner the shares in the Locks and Canals Company were secured through the agency of Mr. Clark and Judge Tyng , the President of the Corporation , who was early taken into confidence . These shares had greatly depreciated from their original cost , and the prices rose as the sales proceeded . But so little was generally understood of what was going on , and the water-power of Lowell was so much a matter of discovery , that when suspicions arose in Newburyport , and gentlemen were sent up to the Falls to see whether there was any available water-power at that place , they returned and reported that there was none . The removal of Mr. Moody from Waltham /z/ to Lowell followed as a matter of course , in carrying out the plan of the new enterprise . As soon as the machine shop was finished , in 1824 , the business and the men were transferred thither , with himself at the head , as superintendent . In Lowell , the sphere of his business was enlarged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made and put in operation under his supervision . A vast amount of building was requisite to be done by the Corporations ; and the superintendence of that part which belonged to the locks and canals , devolved on him . And when it is remembered how much of this work was done without the aid and advantage of precedents , and how permanent and satisfactory it has proved to be , the conclusion is forced upon us , that the closest vigilance of master-minds was engaged therein . The amount of such labor , scarcely appreciable by an unpractised judgment , known to have been sustained by him , in addition to cares more directly connected with the machine shop , show with what urgency he must have tasked his extraordinary powers , to the last week of his life . The part which he sustained in the rise and rearing of the new manufacturing establishment , strongly enlisted his affections in the welfare and prosperity of the community which was gathering together . His vigilant eye was ever intent upon whatever he deemed /z/ directly or remotely connected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ornament of the future city , and conduce to its healthfulness , even for generations to come ; to the manner in which its physical advantages might be made the most of , and its moral character elevated and secured , he promptly applied the strength of his judgment , and consistently gave the weight of his influence . To the cause of temperance he gave decided and efficient support . There were at that time many practices , among gangs of workmen in various departments of industry , which were not in exact accordance with strictly temperate habits . Machinists , as a class , were not an exception to this remark . Mr. Moody very early introduced an entire reform in regard to the practices alluded to among those whom he employed . His measures were quietly , yet effectually taken , and sustained by a very strict example . He was a decided friend of Common School education . He gave his influence steadfastly in favor of an ample supply of the means of instruction , and was ever ready to promote measures requisite to give to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing of popular education on free institutions , and appreciated fully the influence of good instruction upon the future interests of the community . Hence , he constantly showed /z/ himself favorable to the support and improvement of public schools . He was also a firm friend of Sunday Schools . The first Sunday School in Lowell was commenced about the time of the removal of his family from Waltham , and received his uniform and unequivocal encouragement . The nature and importance of these schools , which multitudes of good men at first misapprehended , he , with his accustomed sagacity , seemed to foresee at once ; and furnished both pupils and teachers from his own family . From a conviction , which he often expressed , of the important effect of proper Sunday School instruction on the present and future interests of society , he gave it his decided support . The manifest feeling of satisfaction with which he witnessed the conveniences , order , and exercises of the school alluded to , is still cherished among the pleasing recollections of him . He was exemplary in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seven years in Lowell , it is believed that he was not absent from his pew and seat in church on the stated Sunday services , more than two or three times . He was at church , as usual , both parts of the day , the very Sunday previous to his death . He was convinced of the importance of public worship , in its influence upon the interests of the community ; and he understood the power of example in sustaining it . He appreciated the weight of /z/ his own example , and his zeal for the public good made him willing to do something for example 's sake . Although he was ever ready to give encouragement to public worship in general , and though an advocate for the freedom of religious opinion , yet he never absented himself from his own place of worship to attend on any other . He foresaw that such vagrancy would lead directly to the neglect of all worship , and to the entire desecration of the day ; and no consideration could induce him to give countenance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the responsibility of giving that encouragement to Sabbath-breaking , and its attendant mischiefs , which a careless and irregular attendance on public worship might seem to lend . He knew too well the value of sacred associations , to weaken them for the gratification of an idle curiosity or love of change . To the liturgy of the Episcopal Church , he paid the tribute of his sound judgment , and his warm affections . He was an attendant at St. Anne 's Church . He was kind to the poor , and easily aifected by cases of actual suffering . His charity was not of the ostentatious kind , and the extent of it was not easily known . But widows were known , whose hearts had been gladdened by him , and fatherless children , who were ready to bless him . No person more fully than he appreciated the superiority of that charity which provides employment for the destitute , /z/ thereby encouraging their own laudable exertions and industry . Putting the industrious and deserving poor in a way to obtain a livelihood by their own endeavors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To indolence and vice he had a settled antipathy , and in his charity he was cautious of encouraging them . The habitual cheerfulness of his disposition , the stability of his friendship , the fidelity and constancy of his attachments , were felt in the relations of friend , of brother , and of husband ; as the affectionate tenderness of his fraternal character greatly endeared him to his children . But in the very vigor of his age and constitution , in the midst of prosperity , when the scene of life smiled sweetly around him , when blessed with such means of enjoyment as this world can afford , successful in all his pursuits , gratified in all his benevolent wishes , and sensible to all the advantages of his condition , in the full strength of his mind and in the full tide of his usefulness , he wa ? suddenly taken away . On Tuesday , the 5th of July , 1831 , he felt a slight illness in the morning , which he took to be an ordinary complaint of the bowels , common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from attention to his business , until about the middle of the day , when he returned home , and retired to his chamber . The disease /z/ increased rapidly in violence , and the night following was one of great suffering . The abatement of pain on Wednesday was succeeded by an alarming degree of exhaustion , which continued to increase through the afternoon and night , in spite of all the efforts that could be used to rally the energies of the system . He died on Thursday morning , at seven o'clock . His lamented departure produced in Lowell a greater sensation , more deep and general , than any single event that has transpired ; and it is hardly to be supposed , that any other individual can become so connected with the interests of this whole community as he was then felt to be . The public exercises at his funeral were held in St. Anne 's Church , on Friday , the 8th of July ; and his body was deposited in the family tomb , in Byfield . /z/ Stephen Moody was born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the sixth generation from William Moody , being descended through a line of four successive men by the name of Caleb Moody , the eldest of whom was William Moody 's third son , and the youngest , Stephen Moody 's father  --  most , if not all of them , having lived on the same farm /z/ in " West Newbury . His father , Caleb Moody , had a family of fifteen children , eight sons and seven daughters , of whom he was the fifth son . The following further notice of this upright and worthy man is from the sermon preached at his funeral , in Gilmanton , by Rev. Daniel Lancaster :  --  " Mr. Moody fitted for college with Rev. True Kimball , at that time minister of that part of Newbury now called West Newbury , and entered Harvard College at the Commencement in 1786 , and graduated in 1790 , in the class with the Hon. Josiah Quincy , President of Harvard University . He immediately commenced the study of law in the office of Pliny Merrick , Esq. , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He then entered the office of the late Hon. Levi Lincoln , of Worcester , where he finished his professional education . At the July term of the Court of Common Pleas for the county of Suffolk , holden in Boston , 1793 , he was admitted to the bar , and came directly to Lower Gilmanton , where he commenced his professional career . On the 6th of April , 1797 , he was married to Frances Coffin , daughter of William Coffin , and grand-daughter of Daniel Coffin , of Newburyport ; and in December , 1799 , removed to Gilmanton Centre , where he remained till the time of his death ; having been a resident in town more than forty-eight years , and lived with his family forty-five years , du- /z/ ring which time there was no death in his household . He had three children  --  Rebecca Marquand , wife of Hon. Nathan Crosby , of Lowell , Mass . ; Frances Susan , wife of Prof. Heman Rood , now of Haverhill , N. H. ; and Mary Jane , wife of Prof. Dixi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high stand as a jurist , and soon entered upon an extensive and lucrative practice in his profession , by which he accumulated a handsome fortune ; and by his thorough and accurate knowledge of law , and extensive business , he drew around him a succession of interesting and talented young men , who commenced their professional course in his office . His fellow-citizens from time to time committed their interests to his management , and , reposing in his wisdom and intelligence , occasionally elected him to offices of trust and confidence . " On the 1st of October , 1799 , he was appointed one of the trustees of Gilmanton Academy , which office he held forty years . Immediately after his election , he was chosen treasurer of the funds , and continued to hold this office until the age of seventy . He was an able and efficient member of the Board ; and to his efforts for many years as President of the Board , and Chairman of the Executive Committee , the institution owes much of its celebrity , success , and usefulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an active part /z/ in originating and urdng forward the Theological Seminar v now under the care of the Board , and contributed liberally towards its current expenses in its incipient state . " On the 16th of January , 1801 , he was appointed Deputy Postmaster , and continued to hold the office until September 4 , 1829 . On the 22d of May , 1804 , he was appointed Solicitor for the county of Strafford , which office he held fifteen years . In November , 1813 , he was appointed Justice of the Peace , and of the Quorum , for the county of Strafford ; and Nov. 10 , 1823 , he was appointed Justice of the Peace and of the Quorum throughout the State , and continued to hold the office until his death . " Thus has he served his generation , and , as we trust , also , ministered to the will of God . It is pleasing to add that in 1833 , during a season of religious interest in Gilmanton and vicinity , his mind became very seriously affected with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of anxietv of some weeks ' continuance , during which he laid aside worldly business , and gave his whole attention to the subject , he ventured to hope in the forgiving mercy of God , and found a peace of mind which he ever after retained . On the 4th of January , 1835 , he united with the Centre Congregational Church , of which he continued a worthy member till death . From the time of his embracing a hope of an interest in /z/ Christ , he shone as a pattern of family devotion . The cause and interests of religion he ever patronized , and manifested a sacred veneration for divine institutions . " Whether at home or abroad , he was the same constant attendant upon the public worship and ordinances of religion , notwithstanding the disadvantages under which he latterly labored , of hearing but a part of the services . The Sacred Scriptures he searched for himself , and did not hesitate to declare that the distinguished doctrines of grace revealed in the gospel met the approbation of his heart . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no bigot , but readily embraced , in the arms of Christian charity , the pious and good of every denomination , wherever found . " Mr. Moody was a man much beloved and endeared to his friends in Gilmanton , among whom he lived for almost half a century . Nature was kind and liberal in her endowments . Possessed of good intellectual powers , refined by education , of pleasing manners , of courtly address , and an amiable and benevolent disposition , he naturally ingratiated himself into the affections , and obtained the confidence , of his friends . And if , at any time , there have been those who have withheld their regard or kind feeling , it has generally been those who have been a party in the settlement of some legal question . But it is believed that the integrity , fidelity , and noble rectitude of heart , which /z/ marked his judicial proceedings , have at length won back their affections and obtained their confidence . Naturally active and diligent , whatever station he filled , he was attentive to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always rising at an early hour , he had time for the duties and calls of the day . " In his own house he used great hospitality . His dwelling was the home of the stranger ; and for many years , while the religious society was destitute of a stated minister , it was the place of entertainment for the occasional preacher . Those who went to him as a friend , he was ever ready to counsel and assist . His heart was alive to the tender sympathies of humanity . To stay the desolating progress of intemperance , he early opposed himself , though he received in return nothing but personal insult and reproach . Yet he had a heart to feel for another 's woe . Objects of distress , the widow 's sigh and the orphan 's tear , contained a rhetoric he could not resist , and he lived to see the temperance cause triumphant in the town ; the sale of ardent spirits within its limits having been prohibited by the unanimous consent of the legal voters . " Mr. Moody had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monuments of his efforts to benefit succeeding generations . Nor was he a brighter example of the public than of the private and domestic virtues . Who was ever a more affectionate husband , a kinder /z/ parent , or more studiously attentive to consult the convenience and promote the happiness of every branch of the family connection ? " Having filled up along life with intense application to business and usefulness , the load of years and decay began to admonish him of his approaching dissolution . About four years before his death , he had some premonitions of the disease under the repeated shocks of which he at length sunk . He immediately began to set his house in order , and to get ready to go . Feeling his situation as a dying man , and expressing a realizing apprehension of eternity just opening before him , he has seemed to stay himself upon his Saviour , and wait the time of his departure with great calmness . In answer to inquiries respecting the foundation of all his hopes , he has uniformly referred to the great Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The world was nothing  - -  its pomp and honors had passed away . Heaven was all  --  Religion all his support . Death , the king of terrors , and a terror to kings , had no terror to him . ' I have no will but God 's , ' said he . And though , in the latter days of his life , disease had locked up his senses to a great extent , and cut off communication , so that he could not express his feelings to his friends , yet we have reason to believe that , as he sunk down in the embrace of death , beams of glory opened on his soul , irradiated the dark valley , dispelled gloom from the /z/ grave , and brightened to the eye of his faith the coming world . " Thus lived and thus died Stephen Moody , Esq. , April 21 , 1842 , at the age of 75 years , i He has served his generation , and fallen asleep . ' ' /z/ Joseph Moody was a son of Joseph Moody , of York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Handkerchief Moody , pastor of the Second Church in that place . He lived many years in Kennebunk , and was highly respected . The following obituary notice of his character is copied from the Kennebunk Gazette , of July , 1839 :  --  " Died in this town , on Saturday evening last , Joseph Moody , Esq. , aged 76 years . Mr. Moody died very suddenly . He had visited the post office , about half a mile from his house , after tea ; and , while returning , was taken so severely ill as to cause him to fall down in the street . A neighbor took him home in a carriage , and he so far recovered as to encourage his friends that the attack would not be productive of any serious consequences . After being seated in his house a few moments , he died in his chair , without a struggle . /z/ " Mr. Moody was born in the town of York , in the county of York , Me . He removed to Kennebunk in 1780 , since which period he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was held by his fellow-citizens may be inferred from the facts , that he represented this town several years in the Legislature of Massachusetts , and also in that of this State . He held the office of President of the Kennebunk Bank , from its organization to its close ; and was repeatedly elected , by his townsmen , to the most important offices in their gift . The various public trusts confided to him were always discharged with the utmost fidelity , and in a manner satisfactory to his constituents . " The decease of Mr. Moody is deeply mourned by his friends and acquaintances . A good man has been taken from our society , and borne to his long home ,  --  a consistent Christian , a kind neighbor , a public citizen , and who filled all the great duties of life with exemplary uprightness . To us remains the memory of his worth and virtues . It is a wise ordinance of Divine Providence , that the eminently good and the mournfully vicious should live and die in all communities ,  --  the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the virtuous man , how peaceful it is !  --  of such , how pleasant are the recollections , in contemplating his character ; we feel the beauty and force of the language of inspiration , ' Let me die the death /z/ of the righteous , and let my last end be like his . ' " The following inscription is placed upon his tombstone :  --  /z/ Died July 20th , 1839 , aged 76 years . His life being " without reproach , ' none named him but to praise ; ' his conduct , ever conforming to the Christian morality , proved the sincerity of his profession . " /z/ Eli Moody was born in Granby , Mass. , in 1T89 . His father was also a native of that place , and there resided during the whole of a life of fourscore years . At the age of sixteen , he left his father 's house to learn the house-carpenter 's trade . At that business he continued to labor till he was more than twenty-three years of age . He then felt it his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gospel . He prosecuted his studies with that end in view , relying entirely on his own resources , ( that is , what he had obtained by his labor , and by teaching , ) till the autumn of 1817 , when he received license to preach the gospel . In August , 1818 , he was ordained pastor of the - Congregational Church in Weybridge , Addi- /z/ son county , Vt . At this place he continued to labor till December , 1823 , when he took a dismission , in consequence of the failure of his health . His health having been in a measure restored , he again settled in the ministry , in November , 1826 ? in Northfield , Mass . At this place he continued to labor till December , 1830 , when , having felt it his duty to accept a call which he had received from a church and society in Granby , his native place , he took a dismission from Northfield , and was installed at the latter place . At Granby , he continued to labor in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very severe and obstinate attack of the complaint denominated " the bronchitis , " that made it necessary for him to take a dismission from his people , and to suspend entirely the labors of the ministry . Since then , Mr. Moody has represented his native town for four years in the Legislature of Massachusetts . He is still living , and resides in Granby . There are several families of the name of Moody living in the western part of Massachusetts , who are descended from Samuel Moody , one of the early settlers of Hadley .
