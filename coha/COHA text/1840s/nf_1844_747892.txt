txt THIS tribe takes its name from the late MODS . Boursault , a distinguished French amateur horticulturist . They are the hardiest of the climbing roses easily known by their long flexible shoots , of a reddish-purple colour , and withstanding with impunity the severest of our winters , flowering profusely early in the season ; they may well be termed the harbingers of the rosary . They are well adapted for covering arbours or concealing outbuildings , walls , or any other disagreeable objects . They are also frequently cultivated for stocks , whereon to bud other roses of more rare character , which purpose they will answer very well ; though a plant thus formed renders its durability uncertain , being very liable to sucker , or throw out shoots from the ground , thereby taking away nourishment from the part of the plant which /z/ most requires it ; of course , all suckers or shoots below the bud or graft must be displaced . It was introduced in 1829-30 . The following sorts are most worthy of notice : Jlmadis or Elegans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent pyramid of rich purple crimson ; the flowers are produced in clusters , , are perfectly double , and of considerable Duration , " . tvtite . Boiirsaulf , Blush , Bengal Florida , Rose de Lisle , the same rose , known under all these , and even some other names ; the flowers are very large , of a blush colour , with a deep pink centre , pendulous , and very showy , but occasionally do not open well . Gracilis , is of slender growth , with bright pink flowers , not fully double , but very profuse . Inermis , has large bright pink flowers , in great profusion ; grows rapidly , and is rendered the more desirable by having a little fragrance , of which , with this exception , this group are entirely destitute . Purpurea , purple crimson flowers , little more than half double ; it is the most common of the tribe , and has been extensively cultivated and sold under the name of Purple Noisette , Maheka , Michigan &c.,; and is cultivated and sold from the flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several other names ; compared with the preceding sorts , it is not worth culture . Red or Pink is the oldest /z/ variety with flowers only semidouble ; the colour is pretty , and its profusion , at a distance , makes up for deficiency of petals . The species Rosa Alpina is a native of the Alps , where its scrubby habit has little affinity to the rampant growers now described . They should have , wherever planted , plenty of space allotted for them ; for after being one or two years established , they will make shoots ten to twelve feet long . In pruning , the oldest wood should be cut out , merely to keep the branches from being too crowded : the flowers are produced from the wood of the preceding year . They will grow freely in any soil or situation , and will bear with impunity the severest winters of the northern states . /z/ THIS rose anof its varieties , although very popular in France and England , lose much of the character implied by the name when cultivated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deciduous , losing their foliage on the approach of severe frost . But in the more favoured southern /z/ climes , they retain it during winter , and there grow and bloom in profuse wreaths or garlands , making them objects of great attraction in their season . They are in colour generally pale , making a decided contrast with the Boursault family . They grow rapidly , and are well adapted for arches , grottos , rockwork , pillars , or trellises . The foliage is of a peculiarly bright shining green . Adelaide d ? Orleans has flowers of a pale rosy blush , very double and perfectly formed , in large clusters , valuable for blooming later than any of what are termed June Roses . Donna Maria , and Princess Maria , appear to be the same , or so nearly alike , that a distinction can not be even faintly drawn . Flowers nearly white . Felicite Perpetuelle has been recognized under many names in Europe , but it is believed to be pure here : it is a very perfect rose , beautifully cupped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magnificent pyramid . Myrianthes is of the most regular form , being very double , and imbricated to the centre ; a plant covered with its delicate rosy coloured flowers is a charming object . It has been sftd ( as its name imports ) as a Noisette , blooming all the season , a character which it never merited , never had , and never will have . Sempervirens Pleno , a pure white , is our oldest variety , perfectly double , and a very desirable rose ; it is the parent of Noisette /z/ Aimee Vibert , an association which will long preserve it from oblivion . Triomphe de Bollwiller , is a superb blush-white rose , very large , very double , in great clusters , and agreeably fragrant ; in the south it is surprisingly fine , but with us it is rather tender . When this rose first made its appearance in France , it came out as the most beautiful of the " Teas ; " after its more general cultivation it was placed among the Noisettes ; it now falls back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now distinguished under the name of Sempervirens odorata . After fourteen years travel through the French catalogue it is now set down where it should have been placed at first , a situation given to it by me four years ago . There are several other varieties of Rosa Sempervirens , but none of sufficient interest or distinction from the above to claim any detailed notice . In the southern states , this family , associated with Rosa Laevigata or Georgia Evergreen Rose , would make a very splendid group for covering fences , embankments , or any other object where a continual foliage was desirable ; they require very little pruning , and would soon cover a large space . They could be propagated by layering to any extent ; any good soil will suit their growth . They could also be used for covering the naked stems of trees with great advantage , in an ornamental point of view ; if used for such a pur-/z/ pose they will require a portion of manure dug into the ground about their roots every winter . In pruning the wood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the young shoots their full length ; these shoots can be turned and twisted in any direction ; although it is decidedly best to lay them in straight and equal . /z/ WHEN this rose first made its appearance in the time of Sir Joseph Banks , it was hailed with the greatest rapture by every lover of the tribe , and it was instantly complimented with the name of his lady . It is the states south of this where it must be seen to be pronounced the most graceful , luxuriant , and beautiful of roses ; there it is a perfect evergreen , covering the ends , fronts , and , in some instances , the entire dwellings of many of the inhabitants , who name it the " Evergreen Multifloral To us , the beauty of the plant is nearly lost , being too tender for planting in the garden , and when grown in the greenhouse , its beauty and luxuriance almost disappear . This thornless rose /z/ is so perfectly double that it rarely produces seed . Although many European growers recognize and sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , in our opinion , that deserve attention ; the others are hybrids , mere misnomers . One catalogue offers twenty-one varieties , all beautifully named , our goodly city being complimented by Philadelphia having a place in the list . The flowers are produced on the small twigy branches , hence it is important to divest the plants of any long rampant growth , that it may set forth , unless it is required to lay in to fill up any vacancy . The White Banksian Rose has flowers little more than half an inch in diameter , which are of the purest white , with a delicate pink centre of a very delightful violet perfume , and are produced in a profusion of small clusters . The Yellow Banksian Rose has pale yellow , or straw-coloured flowers , in size rather larger than the white , being perfectly imbricated , and really gems of beauty , but without odour ; if either this or the white were to be seen apart from the plant , by the inexperienced , they would never be taken for a rose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Travellers inform us that these roses are cultivated in China , under the name of Wongmoue-heong , where a pink variety has been seen , for which as yet . we have longed in vain , but it may now be confidently expected from the many /z/ Horticultural expeditions at present engaged in exploring that hitherto sealed country . /z/ Is a native of Japan , and is consequently more hardy than the preceding family . Its name is as familiar to the ear as that of the rose itself . It was among the first that ever had any celebrity in this vicinity , and I have no doubt of its having been cultivated in this country thirty years ago . In dry soils it is tolerably hardy , and south of this perfectly so . The flowers are produced in such profusion that it has often received the cognomen of wreath-rose . The treatment and pruning may be the same as recommended for Rosa Sempervirens . Several varieties have been produced from it , which in some instances rivalled the original . JLlba is a blush white , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Multiflora is the name of the oldest cultivated sort . The flowers are perfectly double , cupped shape , produced in clusters of a pretty pink colour , about an inch in diameter . When first brought into notice about Philadelphia , /z/ it is said that twenty dollars were frequently given for a single plant . Floriculture has now more patronage , and thousands of admirers , so that the grower can afford to put every article at a very low rate ; indeed many roses , and even the one in question , can be purchased for as many cents , so that for this trifle every garden in the land may have a rose . Grevillia , or Seven Sisters , was at one period greatly esteemed and admired for its variety of character ; although its singularity is still the same , yet its former admirers have transferred their encomiums to other more beautiful sorts . It is a fine grower , producing its flowers in large clusters , not two of which are alike ; opening of every shade , from pure white to deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces its flowers single , semidouble , and double , and in such variety of shade and colour , that there are rarely two alike . An east or northeast situation suits it best ; otherwise the effect of its variety is greatly diminished by the direct rays of the sun . It requires a dry sheltered spot . Lcture Davoust is the climax of perfection in this family ; with all the aid of the imagination its beauty on a well grown plant can not be pictured . The flowers are of various shades of colour , from white to a lovely deep pink , perfect in form , the clusters are immense , and produced from almost every eye of the strong wood of the /z/ preceding year ; it is of very strong growth , making shoots of twenty feet in one season , with very luxuriant foliage , and is more hardy than the three former . For covering outbuildings , verandahs , columns , temples , &c.,; it has no superior . Russelliana , Scarlet Grevillia , Russell 's Cottage Rose , Cottage Rose , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is considerably hybridized , but not so as to lose its character as a pillar rose , of which it is one of the best . I have pillars of it twenty feet high , forming , during the month of June , a very attractive object , having a profusion of flowers of the richest shades of crimson ; many of them being striped with white . From the base to the pinnacle it is one mass of glowing beauty . Perfectly hardy in our coldest latitudes , it has large rich green foliage , very distinctly and deeply nerved , the shoots are strong and erect , and will grow freely in any soil or situation . The old shoots only should be thinned out ; the young wood ought never to be shortened unless locality demands it . The same style of pruning will apply to all the varieties of the Multiflora . This operation should be performed early in the spring , before the buds swell , but never when the wood is in a frozen state . In more southern climates pruning can be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle and eastern states it /z/ should be undertaken as soon as frost is out of the wood , in February or March , and the plants tied or nailed at once to their respective supports . /z/ UNDER this head I have to place several sorts that have made their appearance , partaking of the habits of other families , but which , notwithstanding , can not be properly classed with them . It is always a difficult point to decide on the connecting link between the various species and varieties of the rose ; they have now become so numerous by hybridization , sports , and other speculative features , that in many instances there is doubt where to place many choice sorts that are almost yearly brought to our notice . I will , however , in no instance , follow the path of others , merely because the track is made , but will , from observation , make all my own assertions , and give my own views , trusting that my readers will make allowances for soil , climate , and a difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , producing its flowers in clusters , containing frequently from seventy-five /z/ to one hundred , forming a conical corymb of about sixteen inches in diameter , the whole plant appearing in the distance like a pagoda of snow interspersed with foliage of the brightest green ; the growth is very rapid , making ten to twelve feet in a season . Madame d* Jlrblay , or Wells ' White Climber , has been highly extolled ; in growth it is the giant of climbers , for strength and rapidity excelling any that I have seen ; the foliage is also very strong , partaking , in that respect , of the Bourbon family . Its flowers are pure white , like the preceding , and produced in very large bunches . It is of a very hardy nature , and will withstand severe cold without being the least affected . For covering arches , arbours , or such erections , it has no equal : there is no doubt of its also being an excellent variety to propagate for stocks whereon to bud or graft the finer sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance of being liable to sucker from the root . Ruse Blanche , or Bengalensis Scandens , is apparently a hybrid between some of the Sempervirens and Tea family ; its very large flowers , about three and a half inches in diameter , perfectly double , of a waxy blush colour delicately suffused with white , are objects of great attraction , and admired wherever seen ; it is moreover a very early rose . Whoever has visited the celebrated /z/ Bartram Garden , near this city , about the end of May or first of June , must have been struck with its beauty there , spreading nearly over the whole side of the dwelling , and covered with thousands of pendulous blushing beauties . The variety of names under which it is cultivated ( even by individuals that ought to see better ) is really amusing . Rose and White Noisette , Striped Noisette , Indica Major , Walton Climber , a new rose from Natchez , and some others , of which I have no note . Ruga , or Tes* Scented Ayrshire , is evidently a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having the growth and habit of the latter , with a considerable portion of the delightful fragrance of the former ; it is of the most delicate blush colour , and tolerably double ; a profuse bloomer , and seeds freely . It does well as a pillar Rose , but has not wood nor foliage sufficient for covering walls or arbours . Astrolabe , Elegans , Hybrida , and some others of this class are not worth attention ; all these roses bloom only once in the season , but are of considerable duration , say six weeks in cool seasons , but tf in severe heat , their time of inflorescence will not exceed one month . The pruning and training recommended for Rosa Sempervirens will suit these . They are all fragrant , and a rosary can not be complete without them . To grow them in perfection they require /z/ rich ground on a dry bottom ; in such a situation , after being well established , they will make shoots twenty feet long in one season . /z/ THIS native is destined to convey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Rose , the acknowledged queen of flowers . Its constitution is such that it will bear without injury the icy breezes of the St. Lawrence , or the melting vapours of the Mississippi . It was in 1837 that we first saw a double variety of this rose , although such has been cultivated in Ohio and Kentucky for many years . The flowers are produced in large clusters of various shades of colour from blush to deep rose , blooming with us from the end of June to the end of July , being a period of the year when there are few others in a flowering state , thereby filling up a space between the first and second blooming of the Noisette , Tea , and Bourbon families . The foliage is rough , large , and generally of a dark green ; the wood is strong and flexible , and for rapidity of growth has no equal . /z/ I have no doubt that in good soil it would reach one hundred feet in a very few years .. It is admirably adapted for covering rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hid ; it also delights in a procumbent position , and can be used for covering naked spaces of rough ground , or even to make a flowery carpet of every shade of colour . For the following varieties we are indebted to Mr. Samuel Feast , Nurseryman , Baltimore , who raised them from seeds of the native Prairie Rose . There is not a rose fancier but will thank him for opening a field for the hybridizer , in which the rose is to be cultivated to admiration , and blooming six months of the year , throughout every state of the Union . These roses will form parents to be impregnated with the more fragrant blooming sorts , such as Bourbon , Tea , Bengal and Noisette . We may therefore expect from them a progeny perfectly hardy , and blooming at least three or four times during the season . In general , rose-growing is confined to latitudes south of 41 ; the Chinese varieties , and their hybrids , that bloom constantly , being too tender to bear winter exposure north of that line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosa Rubifolia , they will withstand every variety of climate , and perhaps may some day be seen covering the frozen hut of the Esquimaux . Baltimore Belle is a pale /z/ blush , fading to nearly white , produces a profusion of very compact and perfectly double flowers in clusters of six to twelve . Beauty of the Prairies , Queen-of the Prairies , or Madam Caradori Allan , or Mr. Feast 's No. 1 , is certainly the best of the group , having very large rose-coloured flowers three inches in diameter , frequently showing a stripe of white in the centre of each petal . They are produced in clusters , in which they always appear cup-shaped , and stand for several days without being affected by our scorching sun . Its foliage is very large , of a dark green , wood strong and of luxuriant growth ; its blooming succeeds to that of the Garden or June Rose , and is the link connecting its congeners with that family . Pallida , very pale blush , nearly white , perfectly double ; this rose appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position it forms a solid mass of flowers and pale green foliage . Perpetual Michigan , very double , rosy purple flower , quite flat ; this variety is said to bloom in the autumn . I have grown it two years , but it has not shown that tendency with me ; but I have no doubt that old well established plants will be found to give freely a secondary bloom . Superba appears to be the best of the pale varieties , is of very perfect cup-shape , blooming in fine clusters , and though very similar to Pallida , is /z/ distinguished from it , by being more perfept , and flowering , I think , a few days in advance of that variety . It makes an elegant pillar rose . The above sorts are so very double , that they " seldom produce seed even by artificial aid . The variety called Elegans , which is generally grown in Ohio and Kentucky , and in some places called Chillicot he Multiflorct ) has been cultivated here for five years ; it is not so ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when hybridized by the Perpetual and Chinese Roses , will give , no doubt , many varieties . I have now a few hundred plants , one and two years old , obtained in that manner , which exhibit in their growth great diversity of character , but have not yet bloomed . They are all very easily propagated by layering in July : give the shoot of the present year 's growth a twist , and then bury the twisted part six inches under ground ; in November it will be well rooted , and can then be cut oif and transplanted in any desired situation ; the tasteful husbandman may thus cover every unsightly fence rail . Having briefly disposed of the tribes of Climbing Roses that bloom only once in the season , a few hints on their general culture will be in place . They will grow luxuriantly on any aspect or situation , provided they are not entirely shaded by trees over head . The roots of trees and plants gene-s ' /z/ rally are of a growth proportionate to that of their branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find that roses of strong growth make strong roots , striking deep into the soil , and extending horizontally in quest of food to a surprising length ; they require a rich soil , which , before planting , should be well pulverized and freely broken ; it should be of a character inclining more to sand than clay ; if the latter predominate it must be well incorporated with sand and old manure until it becomes of a friable nature . With two feet depth of such a soil , they will grow many years , and bloom profusely . When any decline is observed , it will indicate that they are in want of nourishment , which can easily be supplied by digging in about their roots three or four inches thick of manure or rich compost . For such an operation the month of November to early in spring is the best period of the year . Wherever their situation may be , all the pruning they require is merely to thin out the wood where it is too crowded , and to keep it within bounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roses now described totally ruined for one year by the free use of the knife . Where manure can not be conveniently obtained , fresh soil from the woods or rich grounds will be of great service ; an occasional watering with soap suds is also very beneficial to the rose . In city /z/ gardens we have often seen a few inches of very common poor soil thrown over clay , old bricks , lime rubbish , &c.,; whereon roses were planted , and grew well the first season , but the following they made barely sufficient wood and foliage to keep them green ; the result was unsatisfactory , and the fault laid to the rose ; whereas the whole fault was in the preparation of the ground . " Any thing that is worth doing at all , is worth doing well/ ' is a maxim always to be kept in mind in all gardening operations . /z/ THE Eglantine has been the theme of poets and lovers for many centuries . It is to be found in some sort growing wild in many parts of both hemispheres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being a very simple looking single pink blossom . Although there may be great beauty in simplicity , yet to admirers of the rose , singleness is at once an objection . The odour emitted by the plant after a shower , or when fresh with the dews of evening and morning , is certainly very grateful , /z/ and even delicious . Wherever there is a hedge to be planted , it should have a few plants of the sweet brier interspersed ; it bears clipping well , and even a hedge of itself would prove a garden ornament rarely equalled , being of a lively green , and its many associations will make it always pleasing . To keep it within bounds , it can be freely clipped or sheared twice a year , and should not be allowed to get over four feet high . The plant grows in many of our woods , and is described by some American botanists , although others consider it to be an acclimated foreigner ; be that as it may , its fragrance and qualities are the same , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage either by hybridizing or natural appearance , and have introduced to our notice Double Yellow Sweet Briers , Double White Sweet Briers , Double Red Sweet Briers , Celestial Siueet Briers , Double Striped Sweet Briers , and what will come next can not be divined . Some of these are certainly well worth attention , and others are about as much like a raspberry bush as a sweet brier . However , the following may be cultivated , observing that they have none of the climbing character of the original . Celestial , very pale blush , approaching to white ; flowers small and double ; foliage small , and has a little of the spicy odour so agreeable in the original . It appears to /z/ be a hybrid , between the Eglantine and the Scotch Rose . Rose Jingle has bright rosy red flowers , quite double , grows freely ; foliage stronger than the preceding , and equally as fragrant . Double Ped , or Double Scarlet , has a stiff strong habit , with very large dark green foliage ; flowers of a dark rosy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit is quite dwarf and stiff . Double White Hip , or Siveet Brier ; this is too different from the original to be classed with it ; they are remotely connected . The growth is very strong ; we have plants seven feet high , making a very superb pillar ; the foliage is large , of a pale silvery green ; the flowers are very perfectly cupped , of a rose-white colour , pendulous , profuse and graceful . The Double Yellow Sweet Brier* will be nearly as difficult to find as the Yellow Moss ; all I have seen with that name are mere interlopers , being the Rosa Harrisonii , Williams ' Yellow Scotch , and some not even meriting the name of yellow . Strong shoots of the common sweet brier make very good stocks , to bud or graft upon , and are extensively used in England for that purpose . * The Austrian Brier , or , as it is called , Single Yellow Sweet Brier , is very common in many old gardens . The flowers are equally as bright as the Harrisonii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages , inclining to red . /z/ BOTANISTS do not appear to agree in considering Rosa Lutea and Rosa Sulphurea as distinct species . But we will proceed regarding them as one . There are hundreds , if not thousands , of varieties of the rose family cultivated ; among such a progeny it is rather remarkable that there are so few yellow , and none black ; yet there are no two colours more sought for . The Rosa Sulphurea , or Double Yellow of Lindley , has never been seen in a single state . It is a very old inhabitant of the gardens of Europe , though comparatively rare here . In Scotland , twenty-five years ago , I saw a plant of it , which was then considered a great curiosity , though it appeared to have been there a quarter of a century ; it always showed a profusion of buds , but rarely a well blown flower ; it never felt the priming knife , being left to nature . History first notices it as being cultivated in Turkey . Nothing of its origin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fertile soil of the Chinese empire . This fose has produced a great deal of money to the French venders , especially those /z/ charlatans who make their market in strange places , where they never intend to appear again under the same . name . This rose has travelled from east to west as the Double Yellow Provins , Double Yellow Moss , &c.; The foliage is small , of a pale yellowish-green , the wood rather slender and weak , studded with small thorns ; the branches spreading . There is a large plant of it that has been in the garden of the late Henry Pratt , Esq. , near this city , for perhaps thirty years , and has never been known to produce a perfect flower . It is said that the gardens of Florence , Leghorn , and other parts of Tuscany , produce this rose in perfection , which proves that it requires a dry rich soil and an even temperature to bring it to perfection . The New Double Yellow , Williams ' Double Yellow , and New Double Yellow Sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very pale sulphur colour , about an inch and a half in diameter ; a profuse bloomer , and of rather weak growth . It is said to have been grown from the Yellow Austrian , although I think it is more likely from a Scotch rose impregnated with that variety . It produces seed freely , and its capsule has more of the appearance of the Scotch than the Austrian Rose . Harrisonii , Hogg 's Yellow , Yellow Sweet Brier . This very beautiful yellow , and in fact the only yellow rose of this character that I have /z/ seen worth cultivating , was grown by a Mr. Harrison , near New York , about twenty years ago , and is evidently a seedling from the Yellow Austrian ; its growth , after being well established , is quite luxuriant , often making shoots six feet long in one season . The wood is of a dark reddish brown colour , with strong straight thorns , the foliage small , of a dark rich green ; the flowers open of a beautiful globular form , and appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about two inches in diameter , and nearly double , blooming very early in the season , and in great profusion ; it seeds rather sparingly , but will no doubt produce many fine varieties . It delights in a good deep loamy soil , although it may grow in any soil or exposure ; seeds saved from it should be sown and protected with the greatest care , and at no distant period we may anticipate , from this very plant , yellow roses possessing all the requisites of colour and form that the amateur can desire . The pruning must be done very sparingly ; if the plant gets crowded , thin out the branches ; the overgrown and straggling shoots can be shortened to any required length . /z/ THIS species of the rose takes its name from its being very thorny . It is in habit very much assimilated to the yellow roses , though of a more spiny or thorny nature . It has been found growing in many of the Alpine districts of Europe , though it is generally known as the Scotch Rose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it in a double state having been by the Messrs . Browns , nurserymen , of Perth , ( Scotland . ) As a stimulant to rose growers , I will relate what I have heard from the lips of Mr. Robert Brown , who is now living near this city , and is the very individual who planted the seeds and distributed thousands of this rose through the floricultural world . He says , that " in or about the year 1793 he introduced to his nursery , from a hill in the neighbourhood , seeds saved from this rose , which produced semi-double flowers , and by continuing a selection of seeds , and thus raising new plants every year , they in 1803 had eight good double varieties to dispose of ; being white , yellow , shades of blush , red and marbled ; from these the stock /z/ was increased , and hundreds of varieties obtained which have been diffused over all Europe . " Several of them are cultivated in this country . We may safely assert that this patriarch of horticulture was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a century ago . He still lives in the enjoyment of all his faculties , retaining at his advanced age much of his former originality of mind , and to him I am indebted for the communication of many practical facts , the result of his long and valuable experience . The original varieties of this rose are not esteemed by amateurs in this country . In my fifteen years practice as an American nurseryman I have not sold fifty plants of it ; but recent hybrids have given some of them a tendency to bloom three or four times during the season , causing them to be more admired , which will be noticed under the head of Perpetual Roses . In pruning , treat it as described for the Yellow Rose . /z/ THIS very celebrated and justly popular rose has been an inhabitant of English gardens for nearly /z/ three hundred years ; its native country is rather obscure , though vague tradition says it comes from the east , a term of great breadth and length ; however , Bieberstein asserts having seen it grow on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned by Pliny as being a great fa'vourite among the Romans . In this taste the modern world still agree , for it disputes the palm of beauty with its sisters of the present day ; although it has been crossed and amalgamated with many others , none of the progeny outvies the parent in size , beauty , perfection , and fragrance . In the humid air of Britain , it blooms , for two months in the summer , around almost every cottage ; but with us , two or three weeks in June display- every flower , and if the weather is very hot , they flower and fade in a day . I confess that there is great difficulty in deciding on the varieties that do belong to this species , but as we intend to describe only the finest , the specific character will not affect the quality . The Provins or Cabbage Rose takes its name from a town about twenty leagues from Paris , where it is extensively grown for distilling ; Cabbage , from the form of the rose , being of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that its name is Provence , from a province in the south of France , of which it is said to be a native ; the authority is rather vague , and /z/ not adopted by the scientific . The colour is a clear delicate pink , the wood strong , distantly studded with thorns . The Unique , or White Provins , is a sported branch from the old variety , differing in colour , and also in the shape of the flower , being weaker , having the petals more crumpled , and not so cupped ; the colour is pure white , though it is liable to sport , for I have seen it a pretty blush , and in some instances striped and margined . Belgic , or Dutch Provins , is even larger than the cabbage , being four to five inches in diameter ; colour red ; buds large and very splendid , and is the most common rose in the country called the Cabbage Rose , from which it differs very materially in the wood not having such strong prickles , though of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the cabbage never does . Duchesne is a large blush , and a good bloomer , with well formed flowers . Duchesse a " Orleans is perhaps a little hybridized , and is a very splendid variety , of a bright rosy pink colour , inclining to blush towards the edge . It is a good grower and free bloomer . Belle Ruineuse is a beautiful light blush pink , very double , and finely cupped . Cricks , or Yorkshire Provins , has very much the appearance of the old Cabbage Provins , though a shade darker , and opens its flowers more freely . Crested Provins , frequently , though erro- /z/ neously , called Crested Moss , is the very best of the group ; its striking peculiarity consists in the green silken mossy fringe surrounding the sepals of the calyx , as it were , half enveloping the bud a regular moustache , far more elegant and beautiful in the estimation of refined taste than any of those worn by the exquisites of the day . Its bright rosy pink buds are large , the bloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard , about two to four feet high , the beauty is improved . This very curious rose is said to be a sport from the Provins Cabbage , and when fully expanded it might be taken for a fine variety of such , though the foliage is stronger , and of a better colour than the original . Reine Caroline may be placed with the provins , and will vie in beauty with any . It is desirable from its being about two weeks later than any of the preceding ; the flower is large , colour deep pink , varying to blush . It grows freely , and is a great bloomer . Grand Bercam is among the darkest , being a deep rose colour ; flowers quite large , though not so perfect as some others . The Provins Rose has undergone so much hybridizing by cultivators , that it has , in many instances , been eclipsed in colour , growth , and habit , though few will say that it is excelled in beauty of form . The striped and hybrid varieties from it will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fully /z/ described . They require a free rich loamy soil ; close pruning , that is shortening the shoots of the preceding year to three or four eyes , keeps them in the best order ; choosing the month of February for the operation . ROSA CENTIFOLIA , var . MUSCOSA. /z/ THIS much admired rose is unquestionably a mere variety of the Provins ; although its origin remains in obscurity , it has been repeatedly proven to produce flowers , without any moss , on either buds , leaves , or branches . In 1836 a plant in my nursery had a large shoot on it that sported back to the Provins , and entirely destitute of its mossy coat . I believe that Sir James Smith mentions , in " Rees 's Cyclopaedia , " that in Italy it loses its mossiness almost immediately through the influence of climate . It was first noticed about the years 1720 * In very cold latitudes , where the thermometer falls frequently below zero , all the Moss Roses are better for being protected by dry leaves or a mat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am informed , stand our most rigorous winters . /z/ to 1724 , and is mentioned by Miller in 1727 . There is no rose that has been , and is still so highly esteemed as the Moss . It is figured and emblazoned in every quarter of the globe ; every rose that has the word moss attached to it increases in value , and this fact has brought many under this head having very little of its character ; and among them all it is questionable if there is one so very beautiful in bud as the common Moss Rose , generally known under the name of Red Moss , in contradistinction , I suppose , to white , for it is not red ; it is purely rose-colour , arid in bud is truly lovely , but when full blown it has no peculiar attraction . Blush Moss is in colour as its name indicates . The Crimson , Damask , or Tinwell Moss is , when opening , a shade deeper in colour than the common Moss , the foliage larger , wood stronger and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitor , it is in this , flngelique Quetier is a strong growing plant , with rather singular foliage ; the flowers are very double , of a cherry red colour . Louise Colet is quite a new variety , with a double flower , of a delicate rose colour . Rouge , Rouge de Luxembourg Ferrugineuse , Vieillard and Luxembourg Moss ; this brilliant Moss is known under all these names , and like all fine roses , it has many synonymes ; the flowers are bright red , imbricated , and perfectly double ; the whole plant is very mossy , /z/ and has a brown appearance ; it is a free grower , and appears to do better in this climate than any of the others ; it seeds profusely without artificial means . I have several plants from it without any mossy appearance , and others distinctly mossy . JMalvina is also a free seeder ; the flowers are pink , very compact , but it will never gratify the nasal organ . Prolifere , or Mottled Moss , is a very free bloomer , though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It grows freely , and forms a fine variety of a deep rose colour . Oscar Foulard is yet a rare variety , and sells in Paris at eight francs ; it is very pretty , with compact flowers of a rosy violet colour ; the plant is very mossy , and blooms profusely . Pompon Feit , a very expressive name for this bright red miniature rose . It is highly prized by the French , and is now ( 1843 ) the highest prized Moss on their catalogues . It appears to grow well with us , but will never be admired at a distance . Ponctuee is only a half double rose , but beautifully spotted with white , and if impregnated with others , will make an excellent variety from which to grow new sorts . Provins Moss , or Unique de Proving , is a fac simile of the old Unique , or White Provins Rose , only mossed ; its habit is similar , and equally robust , with large white flowers , blooming in the same magnificent clusters ; it is yet quite rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can not long remain so . Perpetual Red Moss ; this long dreamed of , and wished for rose , has at last made its appearance ; the wood appears of a very delicate growth , and quite short ; how far it is to meet our expectations , remains yet to be ascertained ; the French extol it very highly . My correspondent has sent me a few plants , at a very exorbitant price , one only of which appears to be alive . %/Hice Leroi is another of the very new sorts ; in growth it forms a great contrast to the Perpetual , being a very strong and free grower , and appears to suit our climate well ; the flowers are large and very double , of a rosy lilac colour , and frequently rose edged with lilac . Pompon , or Moss de Meaux , is very small , and is the earliest of roses , blooms in clusters , of a delicate pink colour ; the plant is very dwarf , and difficult of cultivation , unless in a sandy rich soil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Double White Striped Moss , has as yet produced flowers of pure white striped with pink , but it may be expected ( like many other striped roses ) to produce flowers pure white or pink . I have often seen the old White Moss have one half the flower white and the other half pink . Sablee is only half double , of a bright rose colour , frequently spotted with red . Sans Sepalea is flesh coloured , the /z/ edges of the petals pale rose , affording a very distinct variety . The White Bath , or Clifton Moss , is a pure white , of rather delicate growth , and rather deficient in the " mossy coat " so much admired in this tribe . If it had the beauty , while in bud , of the old moss , it would be an invaluable acquisition ; it is said to have originated from a sportive branch of the common Moss Rose . In England , about thirty-five years ago , when it first " came out , " it brought in the guineas at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the Quatre Saisons Mousseuse of the French , is pure white , and is very pretty when in bud , which it produces in clusters . The expanded rose has no attraction , but the profusion amply makes up for this ; if grown in rich free soil it produces flowers the whole season ; in such a soil I have a plant now ( August ) entirely covered with bunches of flowers . On paying a visit to a public sale last spring I saw it sold under the very enticing name of " The New White Cluster Moss . " Such christenings are an injury to both seller and purchaser . The Moss Rose in this country is a plant of very difficult culture if not in a rich sandy soil ; but if it is once fairly established in a rich deep loam , it will make shoots six feet long ; when such can be obtained its permanency is sure . To encourage their growth , fresh soil , well incorporated with manure , /z/ should be dug in about their roots every winter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are kept low they never do well , often dying off as soon as they have done blooming . I have lost three or four hundred in a single season by overdoing the operation ; but if they are kept in bushes four or five feet above ground they will grow admirably ; they also delight in an airy exposed situation . Moss Roses in variety are very scarce , even in Europe ; no establishment can supply them in any quantity . The new sorts ' are all budded on the French Eglantine , and form small trees , that require to be kept free from the suckers which push up from the roots , or the graft would be impoverished and die . Rose trees are quite fashionable , but they must in no case be allowed to put forth any shoots below the bud or head of the . plant . Standard or tree roses trained in parasol or umbrella shape make very interesting objects , and the flowers they produce are all fully exposed to the eye , and appear as if almost floating in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundance in hedges and other uncultivated grounds in France . Some writers consider it " evidently the hundred-leaved rose of Pliny , " so that it must have been long known in cultivation ; and it is rather curious that the French should call it Rose de Provins , while the English give it the name of French Rose . It is a very great seed-bearer , and has consequently been much used by florists in crossing with other varieties to produce new sorts ; the results have been , hundreds , in many instances , more astonishing for their exalted names than for any other merits ; yet there are many of the most perfect character , composed of numerous and regularly formed petals , with colours of almost every imaginable shade . The distinguishing features of this family are strong upright flower-stalks , want of large prickles , rigid leaves , and compact growth . The colours vary from pink to the deepest shades of crimson . Nearly all the striped , mottled , and variegated roses have originated in this group ; the recent varieties and improvements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may safely arrive at the conclusion that roses of every imaginable colour , except blue and black , will be in cultivation at no distant period ; and then it will be nothing remarkable to see white roses edged with crimson , and crimson edged with white ; even now I confess that to give even a faint description , is a task of considerable difficulty . It is a vast garland , every link of which shines out in harmonious variety ; but from this wreath I will cull only those of merit , and which will be always worthy of culture for some good quality . Jlfricaine , or Belle JJfricame , is one of the very darkest ; if seen as soon as open it approaches nearer black than any other , but soon fades to dark crimson . The flower is very double and compact . JluroKa is a bright pink , of the hundred-leaved style , grows and blooms freely . Jlmourin has an agreeable rosy blush colour in its imbricated and perfectly double flower . Baron de Stael blooms perfectly , and always gives satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large and perfectly formed . Belle amabile , dark shaded red , always large and attractive , with bold full petals , and contrasts well with the shaded pink flowers of Bishop . Champion is quite new , with very bright red flowers , full and perfect , blooming freely . Carmin Brilliant is well and expressively named ; it /z/ would facilitate the love of flowers to a great degree if their names were always expressive of colour or character ; but the title is often all the quality the article can boast of . Chardon Bleu , or , in other words , Blue Thistle ; such a name for a dark slatey shaded crimson rose is preposterous ; yet so it is . Coronation is very brilliant , nearly approaching scarlet , with bold full petals , a profuse bloomer , and perfectly formed . Due de Choiseul is a very distinct article ; flowers freely , double , and well formed , of a pale rose colour , with a deep carmine centre . Elemensie is another very distinct variety , with large expanded flowers of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a large blush , finely cupped , and a late bloomer . Eliza Leker is a beautiful pale rose , frequently a little marbled , but so very indistinctly that it must have been fancy in him who described it as such . Eclat des Roses ; there are several roses cultivated under this loud name ; the one before us is a large bright rose , with bold and perfect petals , and always very double . Fanny Bias , or Fanny Parissot , is a great favourite , and has few compeers . Every one admires it ; the colour is also scarce in the family , being pale blush shading to bright pink towards the centre ; it is extremely double , and is greatly to be admired for its symmetry ; it is a free bloomer. /z/ Gloire des Jardins is a large bright red , fully imbricated , and always perfectly double . Hortense JBeauharnais , though described as Rose vif Ponctuee , is not worthy of that distinction ; these faint spots seen in it after close inspection , are too faint to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another quality but its delicious fragrance , should be in every garden . Its flowers are large , and bright red , expanding freely and fully double . Isabel and Proliftre are the same ; very double pink , in clusters and in great profusion ; one mass of pretty pink flowers . Juliana is also a pretty perfectly double pinkish red , one of those colours that the eye delights to rest upon . King of Rome , Ponceau Parfait , and Theodore de Crose ; this very fine and perfect rose , like many others of first quality , has a plurality of names , and if it should have as many more they will not darken its bright red colour , nor disarrange its very perfect form . La Favorite is a bright cherry red , of good habit . La Negresse , not so black as its name implies , only a very superb double crimson , very large , expanded , and fully double . Madame Cottin , or Sophie Cottin , is a very large bright rose , and a free bloomer . Mohilida is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very pretty and profuse . Matilda is another very handsome pink , and greatly admired ; its closely imbricated petals and profusion are great /z/ attractions . Nonpareil is another imbricated pink , but several shades darker than the former . Narbonne is quite a new rose , of a beautiful cherry purple , perfectly imbricated , a profuse bloomer , and of good habit . Ornement de Parade , an abundant blooming large pink , of rapid growth and strong habit . Polivetis is a very bright crimson , of the crown form always admired . Philippe Quatte is a new pink rose , with very large flowers , having bold round petals ; though not so full as others , yet it is very desirable in a collection . Pourpre de Viennt blooms very early , of a distinct purplish blush colour , with perfectly double cupped flowers in great profusion . Queen of Violets is an old rose , but as scarce as if it only had originated last season . The form is of the most perfectly imbricated character , and the colour of a violet purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that flower ; it is a great and persistent bloomer , of very double form , showing a profusion of mottled rosy purple flowers all over the plant . Royal Bouquet is of a crown form admired by all ; the colour is a bright soft pink , and for profusion it is equal to the preceding , and of the same habits . Saint Francois is a bright rosy pink of very neat form . Susannah is a clear red , contrasting beautifully with the former . Souvenir de Navarino is a delicate expanded pink , finely /z/ double , and a certain bloomer . Tuscany ' , or Black Tuscany , is not black , but of a very dark rich crimson ; in richness of colour it has very few equals , and to behold it in its beauty it must be seen before the sun affects it . Its deficiency is want of petals , but it forms an excellent parent from which to procure seed ; for being profuse in pollen , you can always readily obtain it to impart to other sorts richness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and every year adds to the quantity ; they all do best grown on their own roots ; their growth is such as will require to be kept under with the knife , and they bear pruning much better than the Provins or Moss Rose . The best period for the operation is from November to early in the spring ; thin out the wood where it is thick , and cut back the young shoots to three or four eyes of the wood of the preceding year 's growth . When the pruning of a plant is finished , there should not be one shoot crossing another , and every shoot or branch should stand free and straight . The plants require manure or rich compost dug in among their roots once a year , unless the ground is of a very rich nature ; in that case once in two years will be sufficient . If some of the plants are pruned in November , and others in March , or after the foliage begins to appear , it will make about eight or ten days difference /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resorted to in Europe , which greatly retards their bloom in cool or moist climates ; but with us the results are not so decisive , yet they are quite perceptible . Many of the sorts sucker freely ; in such cases the superfluous ones should be removed in the spring , and planted where wanted , or destroyed . /z/ STRIPED , SPOTTED , AJfD MARBLED . To Rosa Gallica we are indebted for nearly all these curiously spotted , mottled , and striped roses recently brought into cultivation . The very old Swarf Rosa Mundi is a pure Gallica , and is frequently confounded with the true York and Lancaster Rose , which is a pure damask , and a strong grower ; the former is the type of what we are about to describe , and although many have been imported by us under this class , I must acknowledge that there are few distinct enough with other perfect characters to merit the attention of the rose growing amateur ; all parti-colouring in the rose is greatly defaced by exposure to the full rays of the sun in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to /z/ see them as soon as open , or on a cloudy day , when they are in all their variegated perfection , flndrb Tfiouin is purplish crimson , marbled , spotted with rose , tflrethusa is bright rose , distinctly spotted with blush . Berleze , or L'Mbe JBerleze , is a very double violet crimson , beautifully , though not very distinctly , mottled with rose . Bicolor is nearly scarlet , having a pure white stripe in each petal , and when half open is really very pretty ; though not fully double : it bears an abundance of seed/ and will produce , no doubt , many fine varieties . Camaieu is a pretty rosy lilac , distinctly striped with blush white , perfectly double , always opening well . Font ene lie is quite new , and a beautiful bright rose mottled with blush , perfectly double . Hersilie is a beautiful pink spotted with white , imbricated , and very double . La Nationals is of a bright rosy colour , striped or mottled with purplish crimson , but with a shower of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Monime is another very new sort , with very double bright rose coloured flowers , distinctly mottled with light purple . Malesherbes , or Melsherba , is more of a Chinese hybrid than a Gallica , and is the more desirable , as its growth is thereby improved ; the flowers are very double , rosy purple , spotted with white . Minos is a very double bright rose , suffused with numerous small white spots , very dis- /z/ tinct and perfectly double . Prince de Ckimay is of a rosy purple , very double , with large spots of rosy white . Panachee Pleine , as its name represents , is fully double , striped rose and white very distinctly , and the full length of the petals ; but it is so much like the Panachee Double that the two are not desirable in the same collection . Dona Sol is a very new variety , with large , very double red flowers , shaded with crimson , and spotted with rose , of strong growth , and will be very liable to run into one colour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelty in this family ; the flowers are almost as large as our old Perpetual Jeanne Hachette , but much darker in colour , being a red suffused with crimson spots . Oeillet Perfait has created quite a sensation in England , and is now advertised at the round price of one guinea . It is beautifully striped , like a Bizzare Carnation , with rose , red and white , is of a fine globular form , and considered one of the best of the group . Pourpre Striee de Blanc is a light purple , with numerous small stripes of white ; flowers fully double . Renoncule Ponctuee is very double , beautifully spotted and marbled with rose , crimson , and white ; nothing in the division like it . Tricolor Sitperba is a double crimson , with large petals , shaded and marked with rose and white . Panache Double , Village Maid , or Belle Rubine , /z/ was the first of the fine double striped roses , and has been cultivated and sold under these three names ; the flowers are perfectly double , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep rose , pink , and white , regularly over the petals , from the base to the apex . There have been introduced this season from France , several other roses of the striped kind , but they have not bloomed to enable us to give a description of them , and the characters generally received with them are so extravagant ( as well as the prices ) that they require to be seen in bloom before they are served up to the better taste of our American rose fanciers . From the above it will be seen that this class of roses are rapidly multiplying , and with perseverance and attention we may raise as fine kinds in this country as they do in France ; for they appear to seed in great abundance . The variegated varieties do not make such strong wood , generally speaking , as those of uniform colours , and we find that in strong and rich soils much of the diversity is lost ; it is therefore advisable to keep them in moderate soils inclining to a sandy nature , and their characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil every alternate year with manure or rich compost . The following sorts seed freely , arid can be impregnated with any /z/ other sort that fancy may dictate , selecting those that have regularly formed flowers without being crowded with petals , Andre Thouin , Arethusa , Bicolor , Village Maid , and Tricolor Superba . Seeds from these will produce every imaginable variety , from blush to crimson . /z/ THE white rose of the gardens has been cultivated from time immemorial . Although the original single white or blush has seldom been seen in cultivation , yet the double is very frequent , keeping ward at the door of the cottage , or towering by the window casements of our oldest homesteads . It is often called the white climbing rose . It must have been introduced by our pilgrim fathers a fit emblem of their purity , and smiling memorial of the land of their nativity . It is rather remarkable that among the many new varieties of the rose , there are so few whites ; and those I will introduceunder this head , belong perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am convinced they will be more in their place at the head of this /z/ article than in any other division . Globe Hip , White Globe , or Boule de Neige of the French , is an English rose raised from seeds of the common white , a very pure white , fully double and of globular form ; a few years ago it was considered " not to be surpassed , " but that prediction , like many others , has fallen to the ground , and now Madam Hardy is triumphant , being larger , fully as pure , more double , and an abundant bloomer ; the foliage and wood are also stronger . The French describe it " grande pleine , blanche , creusee : " or in other words , large very double pure white , and of a cup or bowl form . La Belle Augusta is a blush , changing to nearly white , fully double , a strong grower , and flowers profusely . Princesse Clementine is quite new , and very pure white , perfectly double , and has in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ des Beiges is a very pure and perfectly double variety , well deserving its name . There are several other whites inferior to these , and not worth cultivating when better can be obtained . In pruning they require to be treated in the same method as Gallic Roses ; but budded plants , about two or three feet high , are great beauties ; their beautiful soft white flowers are brought nearer the eye , contrasting agreeably on the foliage of the plant ; they are all free growers , and require the knife to keep them thin /z/ and in proper bounds ; they may in all other respects be treated as hardy roses . /z/ THE Damask Rose is frequently confounded with the Provins and Gallicas , which is not to be wondered at when the mixture of the various species by impregnation is indiscriminately practised every year , often producing plants and flowers , about whose family scarcely two judges could agree ; but I will point out a few that still possess all the marks and characters of the pure species . They all have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashioned Damask Rose , " and also produce their flowers in clusters ; they have a long succession of bloom , and by extra culture two or three of them have a tendency to bloom in the fall , and are called by the French " Rose des Quatre Saisons . " They are all distinguished by long spreading branches thickly set with prickles ; the foliage is strong , of a pale green , and deeply nerved . Belladonna is a delicate pink and a profuse bloomer . Grand Triomphe is also a light /z/ pink , very double , and crowded with bloom . Imperial , a large blush flower , rather loose , but a very distinct sort . La Folie de Corse , bright rose , large and perfectly double . Leda is perhaps not a true Damask , but a very distinct and pretty variety , with white flowers edged with pink , " blanche bordee de rose . " La Ville de . Bruxelles is very double , of a bright rose colour , with strong foliage . Mathilde de Mondeville is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blush , and blooms profusely . Painted Damask , in some soils may be such , but in my loamy soil it is always rose coloured , and not so well painted as the old York and Lancaster , which is often striped , and frequently one half pink and the other half white , carrying out the tradition , that on the extinction of the feud between the houses of York and Lancaster , this rose sprung up , with the one side pink and the other white . Monthly Damask is a bright pink , blooming in clusters and repeatedly during the season if in rich ground , and is a general favourite . White Monthly Damask is not such a free bloomer as the former ; these bear seed freely , and have been the parents of many of the roses known as Perpetuals . In pruning give them the same treatment as directed for the Provins and Gallica roses . /z/ UNTIL within a few years this division of the rose was entirely unknown . It has originated from seeds of the Bengal , Tea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Darnask , Centifolia , and other sorts that bloom only once in the season . The progeny is greatly improved in growth , foliage , colour , and form of flowers , but deficient in the ever blooming tendency of one of the parents ; this deficiency is , however , amply made up by the great beauty of the flower , its habit and diversity of brilliant colours ; they present a combination of the grand and beautiful , which must be seen to be fully realized ; for pillars and trellising they are not surpassed ; the wood of many of them is very luxuriant , growing six to ten feet in a season ; the foliage , too , is always agreeable , being generally of a rich glossy green . Others of them are dwarf and very compact in their habits ; in fact they offer every shade of colour ( none yellow , I believe , ) from white to almost black ; every variety of growth from one foot upward . Some of them seed abundantly , and there is no end to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty will be in choosing the best , and if the French growers would only extirpate from their seed-beds every plant that did not produce flowers of perfect distinction and symmetry , our perplexity would be greatly diminished ; but instead of retaining only such , they introduce to our notice some distinguished title with a rose not worth a name . The group is also being demolished , and ranking under " Hybride de Bengale , Hybride de Noisette , Hybride d* lie de Bourbon , 7 departing from the foundation of all these , which is Rosa Indica , or the Chinese Rose . To give a full description of the sorts ranking in the above characters would occupy more of these pages than is allotted for this group , and we will content ourselves with naming the best . J2 Fleurs Blanches , Blanchefleur , or White Climbing Globe Unique , pure white , as its name indicates , is a very free grower , flowers perfectly double and abundant . Beauty Bouquet , very similar to the former , but not of such rapid growth ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety , with bright rosy-purple flowers , perfectly double , and cup formed . Belle Parabere is one of the most magnificent roses for a pillar , making long flexible shoots , very luxuriant rich green foliage ; the flowers are very large , finely formed , of a violet shaded crimson , and fragrant . Belle Theresa pro- /z/ duces its rich dark crimson shaded flowers in clusters finely scented . Bon Ginneitre , very bright red , edged with violet , perfectly imbricated , an early and profuse bloomer , beautiful . Belle Marie , superb , large bright pink , very double , cupped , and sweet scented . Brennus , or St. Brenmis , is superb ; the flowers are extra large , of a glowing red , perfectly double ; it makes fine shoots , and is an excellent pillar plant ; it is the celebrated Queen Victoria Rose of Charleston , S. C. Blair ii is a very large blush , with a rose coloured edge ; the petals are very stiff and bold ; the buds and flowers are both magnificent ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the common Tea Rose . Catel is curiously shaded with red , crimson , and purple ; it is perfectly double , of dwarf habit , and makes a beautiful bush . Celicel is a rosy blush , a very abundant bloomer ; the flowers are large and in clusters ; it seeds freely , and promises to be one of the best for hybridizing with other sorts . Chatelaine and Lanzezure appear to be one ; shaded lilac , crimson , purple , and often very bright red , varying very much according to soil and situation ; the flowers are very double , large , and cupped ; a strong grower , and makes a fine pillar rose . Cesonie is a large rosy pink , perfectly double , and makes a splendid dwarf rose . Cerisette is a very pretty profuse flowering bright red , almost approaching a /z/ scarlet ; flowers rather small , but very double and profuse . Coupe d'Hebe , " Hebe 's Cup , " is a delicate blush when fully expanded , of perfect form , large , a fine grower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and makes a fine pillar plant . Coup d'Jlmour is very pretty and very perfect , a bright rose colour and a dwarf grower . Due de Cases is a large rosy lilac changing to purple , very double , of a strong habit . D ' flndigne , whether on its own roots or grafted , is a very distinct and curiously marked variety ; the colours are a violet shaded purple , approaching the blue more than any other rose I have seen ; the flowers are of the most perfect form , and very double ; it forms a handsome plant , either as a dwarf or standard . Delice de Flandres is a large delicate pink , very distinct , and perfectly double , of strong habit , and very fragrant . Egerie is a brilliant cherry red , perfectly double , of rather slender growth , and very distinct . Emmeline is of a delicate flesh colour fading to lilac , and quite double . Fulgens , or Mai I on , of the French , is a very bright red , or carmine , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoots must not be pruned very close , for in that case it will not show a bloom . Fabvier , or Col. Fabvier , is a splendid pink changing to red ; flowers imbricated , large , and very double ; the plant forms a splendid pillar , /z/ and is one of the strongest growing hybrids . Fleurette is a pretty pale coloured rose , very perfect , but perhaps too small for the general taste of growers . Gen 9 1 Lamarque , or Lamarque of Luxembourg , is a bronzed mottled crimson of curious shades , a large flower , always very distinct , perfectly double , and a strong grower . George the Fourth , or Rivers ' George the Fourth , is an old but splendid variety , of the richest crimson colour , always perfect and fully double , of cupped form , a free grower in rich soils , and makes a splendid pillar rose . Mr. Rivers , of England , a celebrated rose grower , raised this variety from seed , nearly thirty years ago ; according to his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed of seedlings , unexpected , and without any act on his part to produce it . This shows that superior varieties may be grown from seeds saved indiscriminately from choice sorts , without the aid of hybridizing , which I will prove still more clearly . However , through the manual hybridizing process great improvements have been , and are constantly being made . Georgia is an old distinct variety , being bright rose , with white edge , large and fine , but rather tender for a northern latitude . Grillony is a large and superb rose , of a slaty colour and strong growth . Hybride Blanche is a small neat white rose , with a profusion of flowers . Helvetius is of /z/ a rosy-violet colour , very large , and double to the centre . La Nayade is a perfectly formed rose , of a delicate rose colour , and a fine bloomer . L ' Ingenue is a shaded dark crimson , very double , cupped , fragrant , and is a free grower . La Tourterelle Parni , or the Dove Rose , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large and early flower , grows freely , and makes a fine pillar plant ; we have some of such fifteen feet high . Louis Philippe is a splendid new rose , of a dark rose colour , perfect form , blooms in great profusion , and appears to be well adapted for trellis work , or high columns , and has the fragrance of the Damask Rose . Lady Stuart is a delicate pink , of perfect globular form , very double , and apparently a free grower . Lord Nelson is quite a new variety , a strong grower , with flowers of a distinct dark brown velvety colour , very double , and perfectly formed . Manteau , dark purplish crimson , very perfect , and frequently striped . Pallagi , Malton , or Ne Plus Ultra , is a bright rosy purple , and a rapid grower . Petit Pierre is a large mottled purplish crimson , perfect in form , a splendid grower , and in spite of the diminutive attached to its name producing large flowers . Princess produces its flowers in large clusters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a good grower , but will not suit pillars . Prolijlre is very appropri- /z/ ately named , being very prolific indeed , one sheet of flowers , of a dark rose colour changing to violet , finely and perfectly formed , and very fragrant . Stadholder , or S fad holder Sinensis , of some , is a beautiful clear pink , very perfect in its form , and is , perhaps , more of a Hybrid Provins than Chinese ; it makes a beautiful standard or dwarf . Sandeur Panache , or King of Hybrids , is unique in this class , having all its flowers beautifully and distinctly spotted and striped ; they are perfectly double and finely cupped ; the plant makes a good pillar , but must not have its shoots cut short , or it will not produce a flower ; tie the strong ones the full length , and cut out the weak or old wood . Tuscany , or Tuscany Noisette , although the latter name would lead us to believe it a Noisette Rose , is purely a hybrid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in large clusters . Trio mp he dangers is a very large and perfectly double shaded purple crimson , an excellent grower and great bloomer . Vandael is a rosy purple changing to violet-crimson , having all these shades in the same flower , which is large , perfect , fragrant , and a free grower . Velours , or Violet Episcopal , is of a velvety crimson colour fading to purple , is perfectly formed , a free bloomer , fragrant , and makes a splendid pillar rose . Victor Hugo is a perfect picture when in bloom , of a cherry red /z/ changing to a rosy-violet colour , handsomely imbricated , fragrant and profuse , a strong grower , with rich green foliage . Violet de Belgiquc is one of those surprisingly large flowers that all like to look upon ; its colour is a very dark violet-crimson , although in very warm weather it will open bright red . It will grow to any height , and in one season will make shoots twelve feet long . Watts 9 Celestial is of a delicate rose colour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower ; it is an old variety that has flourished under several names , viz : Watts 9 Climbing China , Flora Perfect a , fiachel , and I believe some others . Wellington is also an old variety , but retains its fine globular character to the very last ; its rich crimson colour and dwarf habit makes it very desirable . The above have been selected from the many now cultivated , and we venture again to repeat that there is no plant to excel them for ornamenting lawns , grass plats , fences , arbours , outbuildings , or any other situation . Their diversity of form , habit , and colour , may be exhibited in many ways . Variegated pillars or columns may be formed by planting a pink , a red , and a crimson together , or a white and red ; the combinations can be formed to meet the views of any taste . When a strong growth is required the soil should be dug out two /z/ feet deep , and two to three feet in diameter for each plant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loam , decayed manure , and sand , in nearly equal proportions ; finish with the new soil six or eight inches above ground to allow for settling . For a variegated pillar choose plants of the same growth , and plant them in a rectangular form , allowing the pole or pillar to occupy the centre . The first season after planting they should be watered twice a week in dry weather ; if watering can not be attended to , cover the soil with three or four inches of manure . For pillars or trellising , plants on their own roots are the best . The pruning of these require to be performed in a very different manner from that usual for the generality of roses . Those plants that make very long shoots should have only about a foot or two of the tops cut off , the wood of three or four years old thinned out , and the short shoots or twigs cut in to within two eyes of the preceding year 's growth . They require to be tied to a strong post ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose ; in the country , where wood is plenty , any sapling can be taken ; if three or six inches of the branches are left on it , the effect will be improved . Although rich soil is strongly recommended for these roses , they will nevertheless do on any soil . I have seen them in the very poorest earth make fine bushes /z/ when they can be pruned as common garden roses , only the luxuriant beauty of the foliage , and the large size of the flowers will be lost It must be admitted that plants , trees , and shrubs , grown and protected by nature , are in their greatest beauty , and bring forth their flowers , fruits , and seeds to perfection ; yet while this is conceded , we say that those plants , brought up and nurtured by art , under every exciting cause , to produce the greatest amount of wood , foliage , flowers , and fruits , also require skilful assistance in depriving them of their superabundance , to keep them within bounds , and lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The period best adapted for pruning is subject to various opinions ; but extensive practice and sound judgment give the preference to the months of November and December . Pruning in the spring should be avoided , as the sap is then drawn towards the extremities of the shoots , and when these are shortened the lower buds will be found more dormant , and will require some time to move , whereas by fall pruning the sap in the spring flows instantly to the buds that are left on the plant , which are at once strengthened , and prepared to push out as early as the season will permit . The first season after roses are transplanted they should be watered once or twice a week in dry weather , or should have placed all round the plant , moss or /z/ manure , to prevent evaporation , or the sun from parching the earth and drying the young rootlets . It is lamentable to see the destruction of plants the first season , from mere carelessness and want of attention ; whereas a few judicious waterings would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December as the best period for pruning ; these are also the best months for planting all kinds of roses of the hardy sorts that bloom once a year , or what are termed " Hardy Garden Roses , " unless the soil be of a wet and retentive nature ; in such case the planting should be deferred till spring . The ground must be well prepared by deep digging , and well incorporated with old rotten manure , decayed leaves , or soil brought from the woods . I am aware that some of my southern and western friends will smile at this recommendation ; for their soils are from three to twelve feet deep , and will grow roses , without any artificial means , for the next century ; but these suggestions are only offered to those who need them . Before the operation is /z/ begun the mind should be made up on the proper disposition of the plants : avoid crowding , avoid formality , avoid hurry . Crowding plants together is injurious in every respect ; if space is limited choose the fewer sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fences , and put only the best that can be had where they are to form a permanent attraction ; formality of design attracts attention for a time , but the eye soon wearies of it . The most interesting disposition , and one that will offer the greatest variety , is to plant the whites , blushes , pinks , roses , reds , crimsons , and purples , each into separate clumps , figures , or patches ; and to carry out a grand arrangement let each division of the rose have its appropriate locality . This ROSARY can be formed on any piece of ground , from a quarter of an acre to any required extent , either on the lawn or any other spot for the purpose . Let the ground be laid down in grass , or if it is there already so much the better ; then cut out on the grass the various figures that may be required , giving every plant from two to four feet of room . With these few hints the reader will see that such an arrangement will form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not necessary to remove the old soil ; very decayed manure ( with an addition of road or river sand to /z/ heavy soils ) well incorporated with it , twelve to eighteen inches deep , is all that is required . /z/ To the amateur this opens a field of very interesting amusement ; it gives an object with which to fill up profitably every leisure moment , in impregnating , saving the seed , sowing and watching every movement of the plant till it develops its beauties of inflorescence , which , if it prove of new character , is an ample compensation for the time spent upon the process ; if not worthy , it is at least a good stock to be used in budding or grafting upon , and even then causes no loss . In the centre of many roses there is a number of thready filaments surmounted by what botanists term anthers ; these are small oval forms which , when ripe , contain a quantity of pollen or yellow dust , which can easily be perceived between the finger and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though to the naked eye a fine powder , and light enough to be wafted along by the ' air , is very curiously formed , and varies very much in different /z/ plants . Under the microscope each grain of it in the rose is a membranous round bag , which remains entire , and can be kept dry and perfect for days and weeks . On its application to the moist tip of the pistil ( which in the rose is a stiff protuberance in the very centre of the flower ) it bursts with great force . When flowers are designed to be operated upon , the one intended to produce the seed should be deprived of its anthers early in the morning , which can readily be done with a pair of fine scissors ; then during the day , or within two days , take a fine camel hair pencil , and obtain , about noon , the pollen or dust from the plant or plants with which you intend to make the cross , and apply this dust to the pistil of the roses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will require some practice before proficiency can be attained in the operation , but a little attention will insure some success . The organs are fit for the operation when the pistil has a glutinous appearance on its summit , and the pollen is dry and powdery . The flowers may be one or two days old ; rain is fatal to the operation dry weather , therefore , must be chosen . Patience and assiduity can accomplish wonders in this department of rose culture ; the persevering efforts of the French cultivators have been so very successful within the last ten years that we do not at all despair of /z/ seeing a yellow Moss , a yellow Provins Rose , or even striped roses , combining every shade from white to black , and there is no reason why there should not be produced a perpetual blooming climbing Moss Rose of any colour at present known in the family of the rose . Ten years ago we had no idea of a Noisette Rose of as fine a yellow as Harrisonii , and as large as Noisette Lamarque ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be ; perhaps ere this work is through the press the plants in my possession will be in bloom , to prove or disprove the assertion . The seeds will be ripe about the first of November , and can be retained in the capsule or fruit till the time of sowing , taking the precaution to bury them in sand , where they will be safe from the depredations of mice , who are very fond of them . Early in the spring choose a sheltered spot in the garden , free from the shade or drip of trees ; enrich and break up the soil very fine , make the surface quite smooth , take the hips from their winter quarters , break up the fruit , and sow the seeds thinly and evenly on the soil ; take the back of the spade , or a board , and press the seed level with the ground , then cover them with about one-fourth to one-half of an inch of sand ; if sand can not be obtained take leaf mould , or soil from the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather give occa- /z/ sional waterings . Many of the seeds will come up the first year , and the balance will make their appearance in the second ; the third year they can be transplanted to beds or rows to remain till they bloom , which will generally be the fourth or fifth year . It is truly astonishing to see the variety produced red and white , rose and pink , may all be seen springing from seeds of the same plant , and from single to the most double ; none but such as are of the finest form , very prolific , and possessing a good habit , should be reserved for culture . Our climate is so favourable to the maturing of seed that there is no reason why we should not only equal , but surpass , any European country in the cultivation of this " Queen of Flowers . " The blooming of seedlings can be readily hastened where time and convenience will admit . As soon as the young plants have made three or four leaves , lift them very carefully from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pots of rich light earth ; then place them in the shade and give a gentle watering and sprinkling over the leaves for a few weeks , when they may be planted into the ground to remain . I have in this way grown plants eighteen inches high the first season . They will , by this method , generally bloom the third year . The seeds are covered with a thick tough shell , which , if allowed to get perfectly dry , and /z/ kept in that state for a considerable period , will take two years to germinate , and perhaps not grow at all ; regular moisture appears to be indispensable for keeping the shell soft and exciting the embryo plant into growth . The seeds are on this account providentially furnished with a fleshy pericarp ( hip ) to prevent their becoming too dry for germination , while nearly all other seeds do not germinate well unless dried before sowing . /z/ THERE are three modes , within the reach of all , for the propagation of these roses , namely , by layering , budding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished , is preferable , and will produce the most permanent plants . There are two methods of performing the operation ; the one we prefer is as follows : In the month of July , or two first weeks of August , look over the plants required to be propagated , and take any of the young shoots that have made eighteen inches or two feet in length , bend them gently to the ground , and make fast by a peg , stone , or block ; they will in a few days take a set in this form ; then under the part /z/ that has come in contact with the soil make a hole four inches deep , and about the same width ; have a portion of prepared sandy rich loam ( if your soil is not naturally such ) at hand ; bend the shoot in the hole , and look for a bud so situated as to come about three inches under the surface ; then take a very sharp knife and commence by cutting oiF all the leaves that will be under ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upwards so as to cut about half-way through , and make a slit about two inches long , thereby forming what gardeners call a " tongue ; " this should be done at the side or back part of the shoot , and to prevent the tongue from closing introduce a portion of the soil , or a chip of any hard substance , which will keep it open , then lay it carefully in the space prepared , and fill up with the fresh compost , leaving the top of the shoot in as upright a position as possible ; to finish , make it fast to a small rod to prevent the wind from blowing it about . The tongue should not be in the very spot that forms the bow , as thereby the branch would be too much weakened ; the lower eye of the upright portion of the shoot is the most successful spot . When the whole is done place the stone or block on the surface , over the layer , which will prevent the sun from drying the earth , and greatly facilitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November /z/ the layers that are rooted may be taken off , and either potted as required , or planted out where they are to remain , heading down the shoot to within three or four eyes of the surface . Those that are not rooted will have to remain another year ; prune them the same as directed for the parent plant . If the operation by layering is not . performed in the summer it can be done in February , March , or April , before the plant has begun to grow , observing the same directions as given above . About Philadelphia we have pots made about four inches wide and deep , with a cut in the side wherein we place the layer , and either plunge the pot entirely under ground , set it on the surface , or elevate it as required ; if in the two latter positions we water it freely every evening , and cover it with moss or some other litter , to prevent , as much as possible , the sun from affecting it . We also make boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standard or Tree Roses . /z/ BUDDING , within these few years past , has greatly increased in nursery practice , and multi- /z/ plied the plants to a wonderful extent ; it is the favourite mode with the French growers , and on the stock which they use , plants will grow for half a century . I have seen them in the neighbourhood of Paris , like large trees , with stems six inches in diameter , and heads thirty feet in circumference . To cultivate them in such perfection they use every kind of enriching matter , which they freely apply every year . Almost every rose can he propagated by budding ; indeed , I may say that every variety can be multiplied in that way , and form handsome plants , when on strong stocks , in one year . For some of the kinds it is the only resort , as they are difficult to manage by either layering or grafting . Some of the Perpetual Roses rarely form roots when laid , but bud freely . Budding may be easily described so as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the unpractised hand that we pretend to give our feeble instructions , we will endeavour to omit no detail , even at the risk of being too minute . The operation may be performed with any sharp thin-bladed knife , though one for the purpose , called a " budding-knife , " with a thin ivory handle , is best for the purpose . It should be inserted about half an inch above the bud , and passing about one-third of the way through the wood of the shoot , come out again about the same distance below it , the cut being as /z/ clean as possible . The portion of the bark in the centre of which the bud is situate , is called the shield , and when removed it contains a portion of the wood , which is to be carefully removed with the point of the knife , as shown in figure 1 ; if the wood is dry and does not separate readily , it is a sign the bud is too old , and it should be rejected . When the wood is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken off only about one quarter of the Fig. 1 . Fig. 2 . Fig. 3. way through the shoot , and inserted into the stock without removing the portion of the wood it contains ; this method , particularly with very young shoots , is very successful . If it is necessary to transport the buds some distance this may be safely done by cutting a portion of the shoot , and after stripping off the foliage , wrap it up in damp moss , a few large leaves , or wet paper , and it may /z/ then be kept for three or four days . In applying the bud to the stock an incision is to be made lengthways through the bark , ( but not so as to injure the wood , ) about an inch in length , and this is to be diagonally crossed at the top by another incision , as shown in fig. 2 . The thin ivory handle , or back of the knife , should then be used to raise the bark , as shown in fig. 3 , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the perpendicular incision ; when it is properly placed , the portion of it above the diagonal cross should be cut oif as in fig. 4 , and great care should be taken that it is in close contact with the wood of the stock . When this is done bind it up with damp matting , or cotton twist , all except the bud , ( see fig. 5 , ) which must be left free to the air , but protected from the Fig. 4 . Fig. 5. /z/ powerful action of either the sun or wet , either of which would defeat the whole operation . In eight or ten days the success of the operation will be known , and in two or three weeks the bandages must be loosened , though not entirely taken away . From the end of July to the middle of September budding may be done , choosing always cloudy weather , or a few days after a heavy rain ; but for limited operations any evening may be chosen , always following the indication of the free parting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not rise with facility the buds are liable to perish for want of a due supply of nourishment . The buds should always be selected from vigorous young wood that has never flowered . About the end of October the plant should be cut down to within a foot of where the operation has been performed , which will greatly tend to strengthen both the tree and the buds that have taken . In the following spring all the stocks should be deprived of their superfluous wood ; observe , however , to leave one bud or eye above the inserted bud , which will greatly assist its growth till it has made a few leaves , and is fit to perform the functions of vegetable life , when the natural shoot must be cut off . As the new plant grows have it carefully supported , for one gust of wind , in a moment of time , will decapitate the most cherished object . /z/ THIS method of propagation with the rose is of recent introduction , but is now practised to a great extent by the nurseryman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the open air in March and April ; but in the southern states the out-door work will require to be done in February . - The mode now considered as the most eligible is what is termed " whip grafting/ ' without the slit or tongue , generally practised , which weakened the scion of the rose . The stock which is to be used may be of any thickness under one inch , but the nearer it approaches the size of the shoot that is to be used the better , as it will increase the chance of success . Cut off the head of the stock at the desired height , enter the knife at a smooth part about three inches from the top , and cut upwards at an acute angle . Having the scion prepared in lengths of about four inches , take one and slope the bottom of it so as to fit the stock , that the inner rinds of both may exactly correspond , especially on the outer side and bottom ; the union is formed first by the rind , or sap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood , and if they are not placed in contact failure is certain . Let the graft be carefully held in it &; due position , and secure it with cotton twist , Russia matting , or threads of worsted , whichever is most convenient ; then cover the bandage with well wrought clay , or grafting wax , which is made as follows : Two ounces beeswax , one ounce tallow , four ounces common pitch , twelve ounces Burgundy pitch , all melted together , and used when warm , with a brush . When the operation is performed close to the ground , or even under the surface ; after the graft is properly tied draw up earth all round , leaving one or two buds above ; this method is both convenient , and in many instances preferable , and more to be depended upon . There are also two other methods of grafting frequently practised , called cleft-grafting , and rindgrafting , ( the former once in high repute , ) but the high winds are very liable to break them off , and they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described . The grafts will have taken when they begin to grow freely ; the bandages may then be unloosed and tied over again , to allow for the swelling of the wood . Give them a stake for support , tying them thereto to prevent accidents from the wind . Do not allow any shoots to corne up from the stock . The best kinds of stocks to use /z/ are the Sweet Brier , Dog Rose , Madame d'Arblay , or Noisette Reuse Blanc . The Boursault Roses are very frequently worked upon , but they are short-lived and thin barked . A rose that has a strong bark is preferable . /z/ IF in Pliny 's time the beauty of the rose was conceded by all , and its praises sung in undying strains by Roman poets , how can we of the nineteenth century , who have seen this gem of nature brought to such perfection , and blooming in endless variety from the dawn of spring to the frosts of winter , sufficiently admire ? how can we adequately celebrate its merits ? The roses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the space of a month , and even during some of our warmest weather a plant will not be in perfection over one week , unless by extra care and protection . But through the ever fruitful and wonderfully supplying sources of nature , aided by art , we have " roses of all hue " from June to January , equally as rich in colour , and of as pleasing a fragrance as any of those of ancient times . This country has contributed her quota to the grand /z/ Floral Temple , in raising the first plant known under the name which heads this article . The original rose was grown in Charleston , South Carolina , by Mr. Noisette , about the year 1815 , and sent by him to his brother , then a nurseryman in Paris . It created a great excitement among the Parisian rose fanciers , and is supposed to have been a production of the common China Rose and White Musk Cluster . Since its introduction thousands have been raised and hybridized from it , till the progeny has become so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the division , I may say , is not to be recognized . We often see a new sort named Tea , which , after being fully tested proves to have the habit of a Noisette , of which the leading feature is the clustering of its buds and flowers ; it is also either always of a dwarf or a rampant habit . They are generally in this latitude perfectly hardy ; all are so in the south , and few or none hardy enough to bear the rigour of our Eastern or Northern States . The profusion and perpetual succession of their flowers produced in immense clusters , frequently from fifty to one hundred in each , makes them superbly ornamental objects , calculated for columns , pillars , fences , or trellis work . Although hardy here , they still are benefited by a light protection of straw , mats , litter , or branches , which should be gradually re- /z/ moved in the spring , after the frost is entirely out of the ground . In the south they require nothing but pruning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandy or poor they must have a regular annual dressing about their roots with very old manure , or some enriching matter . Among the many the following will embrace the best and most distinct . The flowers vary much in size , from one to four inches ; I will consider that two inches is the medium size , fllba is a pure white , of small size , but blooms most profusely ; it never exceeds three feet in height , and makes a beautiful dwarf bush , requiring very little support . *fllzand , pale pink , very double , with fine large petals , fragrant , and of medium growth , limee Fiber t , or Nevia , is a beautiful pure white , perfect in form , a profuse bloomer , but though quite hardy does not grow freely with us ; however , when budded on a strong stock it makes a magnificent standard , and blooms with a profusion not surpassed by any ; this very exquisite variety was grown from seed of a rose that blooms only once in the season ( Sempervirens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Paris , who has grown many very superb roses from seed . When I visited him , in 1839 , whilst discoursing upon roses , he directed my attention with great enthusiasm to this plant , and said , " Celle ci est si belle , que Je lui ai donne le nom de ma fille cherie /z/ Aimee Vibert . " This enthusiasm can be easily understood by those who , like myself , have been so fortunate as to see the two " Aimee Viberts " the rose and the young girl both in their full bloom , and both as lovely as their sweet name . In the southern states it grows freely , and is a profuse bloomer during the fall months . Belle Marseillaise is a very dark variety , approaching crimson , perfectly double and distinct . Boulogne is one of the darkest of the family , approaching a violet colour , though a small flower , yet is very perfect and a profuse bloomer . Belle D 1 Esquermes and Camellia Rouge are the same , and is an excellent pillar rose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rosy-purple colour ; flower above medium size , and though not perfectly double , yet a fine bloomer . Charles the Tenth is an old variety , but keeps its distinctive character of colour and fragrance , and is in great demand by the southern rose growers . It does not generally open well with us , but in a warm dry atmosphere , and during our summer months , it shows its large double rosy-purple flowers in great perfection . Champneyana , or Champntifs Pink Cluster , light pink , a rampant grower , profuse bloomer , quite hardy , even in cold latitudes ; it is universally cultivated , and well adapted either for pillars or arbours . Chromatella has charms of colour , which /z/ to the French and English growers make it very desirable ; plants have not yet bloomed with us , but will do so in March or April , 1844 . It is described as " grande double jaune , aussi fonce que notre ancienne rose jaune , couleur unique encore dans Pespece , " or , in other words , " large double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow rose ; colour as yet unique in the group of Noisettes . " The English advertise it under the name of " Cloth of Gold Noisette , with very large flowers and fine bold stiff petals , withstanding the effects of the sun , retaining its colour , a perfect yellow , equal to the Yellow Harrison Rose . " It is a seedling from Noisette Lamarque , and very much of the habit of its parent , with leaves more round , and growth more robust . It is very rare , and sells at twenty-five francs in France . Corymbosa was flatteringly represented to be a superb snowy white , of rampant growth , and a profuse bloomer . I have never seen it deserving such a character , being a shy bloomer , with twisted sickly looking foliage . Clara Wendel is another rose having a yellow shade to its flowers changing to white ; it is of a dwarf habit , though the flowers are of the largest size , and perfectly double . It first appeared under the name of " Thea Clara Wendell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a distinct rosy lilac colour , and is a very fine dwarf /z/ variety . Comtesse Orloff is a bright rosy pink , and makes a good plant for covering fences , pillars , &c.,; being a rapid grower and free bloomer ; the flowers are rather small in proportion to the growth of the plant . Conque de Venus is now an old variety , but not often excelled in fragrance and profusion ; the flowers are perfectly double , creamy white , and with a bright pink centre ; they are produced in large clusters and in great profusion . Cora L. Barton has no compeer , combining size and colour ; it is a seedling from Lamarque , grown by me a few years ago ; the flowers are of a clear rosy pink , very large , fragrant , double , and cup shaped ; a profuse bloomer , of strong habit , and makes a splendid pillar . Du Luxembourg is not hardy enough for this latitude , but bears full exposure in the south , where it shows its beautiful rosy purple flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good growth , a free bloomer , perfectly double , and very distinct . Euphrosine ; this new and very sweet scented rose was first introduced as a " Tea , " but after trial proves to be a Noisette of great excellence , both in its peculiar rosy buff coloured flowers , which it produces in extravagant profusion , arid in its peculiarly grateful fragrance ; the flowers are quite double , above medium size , and the plant grows freely . It is yet very scarce . Eugene Pirolle , or Admiral de /z/ Rigny , is a Noisette , of very perfect form ; its bright rose coloured flowers are produced in large clusters ; it is of a dwarf habit , and makes a fine border variety . Fellenberg , as a Noisette , has no equal for brilliancy of colour , during the autumnal months ; in the early part of the season , it is of a pale red , but in the fall its colour approaches a scarlet , with large flowers produced in clusters of thirty to fifty . It is perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be in every garden or rosary that has any pretensions to variety ; the foliage , when young , has also a peculiar red colour . Fleur de Jeune *flge is quite a new variety , and has the growth and habit of Jaune Desprcz , and no doubt is a seedling from that rose ; it is of a yellowish-white , with a delicate pink centre , quite fragrant , and has been classed among . the " Teas . " The Noisette Roses have become so much impregnated with the varieties of Rosa Odorata , that many of the sorts , when they bloorn for the first time , are denominated " Thea " . roses , but their farther growth and subsequent bloom brings them under the head of Noisettes , from their tendency to produce their flowers in large clusters . Jaime Desprez , Desprez D'rfrcole , and French Yellow Noisette , are the same . It has been cultivated about Philadelphia these ten years past , and is yet a scarce variety . It enjoys a celebrity which few /z/ of its tribe have attained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when well established , profusion of flowers , which it produces in large clusters . The colour is a rosy-buff inclining to orange , and perfectly double . It should always be planted where it will be under the eye , as its colour does not make it a remarkable object from a distance , a qualification which Fellenberg possesses in the most eminent degree . Julia , or Julia Dante , is a pretty pale sweet scented variety , though very like Conque de Venus ; it is yet quite distinct in habit , and the flowers have a little more of the blush in them . Julie de Loynes has been , and is still considered , by some as a Bourbon rose ; its foliage does incline a little to that family , but the flowers have all the character and habit of Noisette , to which I consider it to belong ; its colour is a delicate blush white ; flowers above medium size , double and finely scented ; the habit is very strong , ( though not of rapid growth , ) giving a profusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very profuse bloomer , and if in rich light ground will produce clusters of fifty to one hundred flowers in each , of a dark rose colour , and is a beautiful dwarf object during the months of autumn . La Biche is still a good rose when first open , of a pale flesh colour , though almost instantly changing to pure white , rather large and double , is an excellent /z/ pillar rose , of free growth , and is frequently sold for Lamarque. fcactans , as its name implies , is a milky white , so pure that I do not remember having seen any rose of so- delicate a white ; I received it two years ago as a Tea , but it now ranges with the Noisettes , and among the dwarf varieties , with very large and extremely double flowers , which it produces very freely . Lamarque ; this is a celebrated variety , now known over the whole country for its magnificent , large , perfectly double , yellowish-white , pendulous flowers , which it produces in clusters of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will grow twenty feet in a season , and in South Carolina , one of my correspondents informs me , that their plant , now eight years old , covers a verandah fifty feet long and twenty feet high , and is one mass of flowers from May to December . There is also a plant , in this city , that occupies twenty feet by eight , of a fence that faces north , where it is influenced by the morning and evening sun , but the sun , from November to March , never touches the plant , confirming the opinion that in winter the sun does more injury to delicate roses than the cold . This plant does much better on its own roots than when budded or grafted. - The plant that I imported of it in 1833 is budded on the French Dog Rose , and makes a very fine standard , but bears no comparison with the mag- /z/ nificent plants that have been grown from it , although cherished and nurtured in my city garden . Landreth 's Carmine , or Carmine Cluster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flowering profusely from July to late in the season ; its first buds do not open well , but it is well adapted for a southern climate ; it was grown from seed by the Messrs . Landreth nearly twenty years ago . Le Pactole , Thea Pactole , Thea Chrysanthime flora , and New Yellow Tea ; this distinct variety has only been known a few years , yet it is distinguished by all these names ; the flowers are of a pale sulphur yellow , changing to a yellowish- white , as soon as they are exposed to the full rays of the sun ; the plant is of a dwarf habit , and will make shoots two feet long , surmounted by twenty to forty flowers ; it is no doubt a seedling between the Yellow Tea and Lamarque . Lee , Monstrosa , Coelestis , Grandiflora , Triomphe des Noisettes , and Carassana ; this plant is shamefully circulated under all these names , and gives additional proof that names are more numerous than varieties ; it is a good old rose , of a blush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opening very well in warm dry weather , but in moist seasons it does not expand freely , and may be called hard-headed ; it is a strong grower , and is best appropriated for a fence or arbour . Ltitea , or /z/ Smithii , is a great favourite through the southern states , growing freely , and opening in great perfection , except iii time of rain ; the colour is of a pale lemon-yellow before the sun destroys it , and is delightfully fragrant , though entirely too tender for the open air in Pennsylvania ; it makes a splendid rose for forcing if kept in a high and rather dry atmosphere , but if syringed with water before the flowers are expanded , it glues the petals together , and they perish before opening . When I first introduced this rose I could not supply all the demands for it the first year , at five dollars each plant . Madam Byrne and Cora L. Barton were produced from the same hip of seed from Lamarque , and are roses very distinct both in habit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink centre , large , and very double ; the wood is very slender , but of free growth , and makes a beautiful pillar plant ; from the same seed I obtained also a bright scarlet rose , perfectly single , which shows that almost every variety of colour may be produced from the same rose , at the same time , and without artificial impregnation , but by the assistance of art , both character and colour may be greatly improved . Nankin , or Mutabilis , is of a yellowish-nankin colour in cloudy weather , but when fully expanded , with the sun in full blaze upon the flowers , they are nearly pure white . It /z/ is very fragrant , and rather a dwarf grower . Orloff is now an old rose , but for growing and producing a profusion of bright rose coloured flowers it has few equals ; they are of rather loose form , but very showy at a distance ; it is admirable for covering outbuildings or distant fences ; it is very distinct from Comtesse Orloff , and more hardy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during winter . Pompom is also a strong growing sort , with a dense foliage ; the flowers are rosypink , quite double , and delicately fragrant ; it is very well adapted for covering arbours or unsightly fences , being a very strong grower , and clothed with foliage from bottom to top . Prudence Roeser ; this rose appears to be a complete hybrid , and perhaps more properly belongs to ttie Bourbon family ; the flowers are finely cupped , perfectly double , and of a fine'rose colour ; it is of a stiff dwarf habit . Rotanger is a delicate coloured dwarf variety ; its flowers are pale rose , changing to a soft blush , produced in great abundance , and agreeably fragrant . Similor , or Le Similar , is a very distinct and changeable coloured Noisette ; it will at some periods , particularly in cloudy weather , open of the most beautiful bright orange colour , and on other occasions I have seen it a pale blush ; at all times perfectly double and - fragrant ; as yet scarce , it has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but appears to be very similar to Aimee Vibert , having a foliage partaking of the character of that , of the Tea Rose . Sir Walter Scott is very much like Orloff , with a few more shades of purple in it , and is more double and fragrant ; its growth is equally as strong , and makes a splendid pillar rose . Solfatare was sent to me , by its grower , two years ago , as a " superb Yellow Tea Rose , not equalled , " and when it first bloomed it fully maintained its Tea character , but as soon as I grew it on its own roots , it directly assumed the habit of our favourite Larnarque Noisette , with the young wood inclining more to yellow , and the foliage more pointed ; in colour it is a bright sulphur yellow ; very large and fully double , with an agreeable fragrance . In France it maintains its character and price , being still ( 1844 ) sold at fifteen francs per plant . When fully established it flowers freely , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most splendid of pillar roses ; it is equally well adapted for training against trellises . An eastern or northern aspect , where it will have a portion of sun , will suit it best , and fully preserve its beautiful colour . In addition to this rose holding its character , it appears also to retain , as yet , its name ( Solfatare ) unchanged ; few choice roses are so fortunate ; I say so fortunate , for it is truly a disgrace to any vender or amateur to change the /z/ name of any rose knowingly , merely to prevent his brethren in the trade from reaping at once any benefit by procuring the article from its original source , or to deprive a co-lover and acmitiet tff the rose from possessing the plant- immediately , , a4 from enjoying an equal pleasure With* - Ms ' weigh* bour . American growers are not so directly criminal in this respect , but they are frequently led into error by purchasing from some French importers , who , in many instances , have plants to suit any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submit to having the same dose of humbug so frequently administered to us . We are also occasionally caught by our English rose-growers , who in visiting France , pick up the surplus stock of any new and choice rose , take it home , advertise boldly under a new name , and sell it at a golden price . Super ba is one of our oldest Noisettes , and holds a rank among the first for profusion of bloom , of a pale pink colour , and in splendid clusters from the base to the top of the plant , forming a very excellent pillar variety ; it will not exceed seven feet in height with us . Victorieuse , Pictorium , or La Victorieuse , is perhaps more of a Tea than Noisette , being very like the former , except the clustering of its flowers , which are large pale blush , beautiful and fragrant , dwarf growing . Vitellina is strongly hybridized with the Tea Rose , and /z/ has been no doubt a seedling from Lamarque , to which the flowers bear a strong resemblance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwar'f it maks a very beautiful plant , when grafted or budded , about two feet high ; many of the dwarf growing Noisftes* are improved in appearance by this method , especially those that have large pendent flowers ; such as standards , are really elegant . The whole beauty of Noisette Roses ( which is very great ) can only be fully brought out where they are properly cultivated . It can not be expected that these plants will show their growth and elegant habit , when in flower , if they are merely deposited with their roots under ground , without any system of arrangement or culture . In the first place , the situation must not be subject to inundations of water , neither will they do well on a wet soil ; they require what is technically termed a " dry bottom , " either naturally so , or artificially made ; the soil deep and rich , having a considerable proportion of sand in it , and if not very rich , rendered so by thoroughly rotted manure , or black earth from the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to any required extent , according to the taste of the cultivator . A very agreeable method is to have them in groups , with the tallest in the centre , trained in a pyramidal or pillar form , and the dwarf sorts forming the base of the pyra- /z/ mid ; they may be thus disposed , keeping those of a colour together , or mixing the colours ; grouping those of a colour together is the most appropriate method ; the eye is then relieved in viewing the groups , by passing from white to crimson , and from crimson to white , whereas if the colours are blended together in each mass , the effect is that of confusion and monotony , without any interest after the first glance . The same system will apply to covering arbours , verandahs , &c.; In landscape gardening the rose is indispensable ; it can be made to accomplish any purpose in breadth or height , depth or lightness . For detached objects , they are also very appropriate , form most elegant pillars , and if placed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts used should be of red cedar , best sapling oak , locust , or yellow pine , and sunk at least three feet into the ground , from four to six inches thick , and from six to twelve feet high ; if higher , the heavy winds are very severe upon them . For those that grow only from three to six feet , small rods of any description will be suitable , painting them with a green or stone colour ; strong twine , willow , glycine , or lead wire , may be used for tying . In pruning , from the month of November to March , thin out the wood of three or four years old , and shorten all the shoots in proportion to their growth ; that is , shoots that have made only a growth of /z/ twelve to twenty inches , can be cut to within three or four eyes of the preceding year 's wood ; and those that have grown from three to ten feet should be shortened down to two to six feet . By this process they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole season . They must have every year a good supply of rich compost , or decayed offal of any description , incorporated among the soil in which they are growing ; never plant a rose in the same soil that a rose has been growing in before ; if it is required to be planted in the same spot , remove the old soil , and replace it with new , to the depth of one to two feet . They delight in a sandy rich loam , on a gravelly or dry bottom ; this is particularly requisite , where the soil is of a stiff clay and subject to crack during the summer months . If thus properly provided for when planted , they will grow in the greatest perfection and bloom profusely . It is necessary to cut off the flowering stems as soon as they begin to fade , thus preventing their going to seed except when required , as maturing the seed impoverishes the plant , and retards the reproduction of a succession of blossoms . If they are not wanted to grow to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two to four feet of the ground every season . The dwarf sorts make very pretty standard plants when budded , one or two feet /z/ above the ground , on the Dog Rose or French Eglantine ; but the strong growing kinds- should never be budded for standards ; they make straggling heads , and never come to such perfection as when on their own roots . To grow Noisette Roses from seed is a very easy process , and its failure or success can be ascertained in two years , generally in one . The best varieties for the purpose are Lamarque , Camellia Rouge , Cora L. Barton , Solfatare , and Fellenberg ; these planted together , and assisted by art , will produce many distinct varieties , and will fully repay all the trouble and patience bestowed upon them . If it is required to have them of a darker shade than any of these , pollen can be applied from any of the dark flowering Bengal or Bourbon Roses . Of the latter , Gloire de Rosamond will give great brilliancy of colour , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partakes of the Noisette habit . From these suggestions many others may arise to the mind of the operator , and if acted upon , the results may go beyond anticipation . /z/ IT is upwards of thirty years since this rose was introduced into Europe from China . At what period it was first brought to this country is to us unknown ; but it can not be less than twenty years since ; neither are we aware of any improvement being made upon it with us , or even with the French , who are the leading spirits in every thing connected with the rose . It is a free seed-bearer , and has been the parent of many varieties , many of which excel it in size , but few or none in fragrance . Few growers are very successful in its culture ; its growth at times is very luxuriant , and it sometimes makes a shoot three feet long ; but such instances rarely occur . The varieties from it , however , are magnificent ; many of them , of the most luxuriant character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The family are nearly all too tender for culture in this latitude without winter protection . To grow them perfectly ( and they are well worth extra care ) the ground should be prepared expressly for them . They delight in a rich light soil with a dry bottom , and in an elevated /z/ position . If the soil is naturally sandy , it will only require to be enriched by manure , or plenty of black decomposed leaves from the woods , in which they will grow in wild luxuriance ; but if the soil is heavy and clayey it should be thrown out to the depth of twenty inches ; six inches of the bottom should be filled up with rough rubbish , such as stones , brickbats , or branches of trees ; over these place sixteen inches of prepared soil , which will allow for settling . Two or three weeks after the bed is prepared the roses may be planted . In the southern states , this operation can be performed in February and March , but with us April and the early part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made in soil retentive of water it will require to have a drain laid from it to keep the bottom dry , or otherwise it would be providing a basin of water for the plants , which to them would prove a " bed of death " in winter . The only shelter necessary here is a covering of boards , glass , or straw ; the latter is a bad protection when exposed to rain and snow , which causes mouldiness about the plants , and even kills them ; where glass is not accessible all that is required is a temporary and movable frame or covering of boards , which must be removed as soon as spring appears . Treated thus they will not receive any material injury in this vicinity from our severest winters ; but to the /z/ eastward , when there is no green-house , they require to be kept in good substantial close frames ; this can readily be accomplished by lifting them from the various parts of the garden and planting them very compactly together in the frame provided for them about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frame will admit of , lay them in an inclining position , what the gardeners call " by the heels ; " they will require no water till spring . About the first week , or towards the middle of April , they must be taken out , in a cloudy day , pruned of all decayed or superfluous wood , and carefully planted into the place prepared for them . By adopting this method , which I have often practised , every lover of this celebrated rose in the eastern states can enjoy them in the greatest luxuriance from June to October . A substantial movable frame , seven feet wide and twelve feet long , which may be made of two inch rough plank , one foot high in front and two and a half feet high on the back , covered with three sash , can be completed for the small cost of thirteen to sixteen dollars , and will aiford ample protection for two hundred plants , which will embrace all the choicest Tea and Bengal Roses , and afford a floral gratification in roses worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed in a sheltered situation , and also used for propagating , from cuttings , all the /z/ varieties of the monthly roses in June , July , and August , without bottom heat . However , where there are only a few scattered plants , they will do very well covered with branches of cedar , a box , or barrel , perforated in several places , to allow the moisture to evaporate . In mild latitudes every flower garden should have a full and perfect collection of this lovely tribe . If my words could paint its beauties , or give any idea of its fragrance , I would not plead for it in vain. / But one fault they have , and that is , too much similarity among the generality of them ; although a difference can be discerned in all , yet I confess it requires , in many instances , a very discriminating eye to detect it . But the following will be found distinct in colour and character , and worthy of any culture requisite to bring them to perfection . JJntherose , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale pinkish-white shading to yellow in the centre , grows very strong , and blooms well in pot culture . Jlrchiduchesse Theresa Isabel , or Isabel , a very distinct dwarF growing white , requiring the shoots to be well thinned out in order to make it grow strong for flowering ; the flowers are double and very pure ; it might be dispensed with . *flrkinto , a distinct old variety , of a flesh colour , very double , cup form , grows and flowers freely ; the bottom of the petals is yellow . Burbot is a new and very /z/ strong growing rose , quite large , of a creamy-blush colour , and frequently deep pink , though the French describe it as " a yellow edged with rose ; " it is highly fragrant , and an indispensable variety . Belle Marguerite ; the distinctive character of this rose is easily perceived at a considerable distance , its strong upright habit producing its flowers on short stiff footstalks ; the colour from a pale rosylilac to a dark crimson , perfectly double ; when well grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Silene , is a very variable rose , with extremely large petals ; though not so double as some , yet it amply compensates for this deficiency in the size of the flowers , which are of a bright rose , changing to cherry red , with an agreeable fragrance . Bottgere has a great many admirers ; the flowers are extremely large , fully double , of a rosy-lilac colour , always cup-shaped , and even fading away in that form ; the buds are very large before they expand ; it is one of the strongest growers , and bears our winters with very slight protection . Boutrand is a noble rose , of a bright pink colour , perfectly formed , and a free grower . Caroline is a beautiful rose , of a bright rosy-pink colour , with finely formed flowers , always blooming perfect , and in great profusion , even five or six in a cluster ; it is one of the hardiest , and not excelled by any of the family , having every quality ROSES THAT BLOOM THE WHOLE SEASON . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large and perfectly formed pure white rose , a strong grower and an abundant bloomer ; one of the best of the whites , giving entire satisfaction wherever grown . Claudia is a beautiful creamy-blush , perfect in every character , but a very scarce variety . Comte de Paris is greatly esteemed in France , and has maintained its price there for several years ; it is yet very scarce in this country . There are at least ( that we have seen ) four distinct roses cultivated and sold for the veritable " Comte . " When once under the eye it can not be mistaken ; the plant is of a very strong habit , with large shining foliage , and the spines or thorns distantly set on the wood , but very strong ; the flowers generally perfectly double , are of a pale rose colour , the bottom of the petals inclining to yellow ; the buds are quite large , rather pointed , and like Caroline , always expanding freely in airy situations . Devoniensis is another new rose ; though at first represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such , it proves to be a creamy-white , but when just open , in cloudy weather , is of a canary colour ; when well cultivated it produces flowers of immense size , and in clusters ; it grows freely , with dark green foliage , possesses a delightful fragrance far surpassing the ancient Tea Rose , and is a very valuable variety for either pot or garden culture . It is supposed to /z/ be an English variety , but is now sold cheaper in America than in either France or England . Due d ' Orleans at first sight , much resembles Belle Marguerite , though it is rather brighter in colour , and the growth not so strong . Duchesse de Mecklenbourg is a perfectly formed double variety , of a creamy-yellow before it is deprived of its hue by the sun , whose brilliant rays rob nearly all roses of this shade of colour . Elisa Sauvage is another of that description of colour ; though very different in growth , which is not so strong , yet the flowers are very large , and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a delicate rose centre , very large flowers , and perfectly double , growing and blooming freely . Flavescens , or Yellow Tea , pale straw colour , extremely large bold petals ; it is very splendid when half expanded , but when full blown is loose and not fully double ; it bears an abundance of seed , but we have never produced a good rose from it . This plant was introduced into England from China , by Mr. Parks , about the year 1824 . In fresh sandy rich loamy soil it grows very strong , and flowers profusely , but does not thrive in heavy soils . My late partner , Mr. Hibbert , introduced this rose and the White China into this country in 1828 , and the first plants that were sold of them was in 1830 ; they are now found in thousands over every part /z/ of the United States . Flon is of a fleshy buff colour , a large double flower , much resembling Luxembourg , though not so strong a grower ; it is delightfully fragrant , growing freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower , deserves its name ; but deficiency in form detracts from that merit , yet its pale fleshy coloured flowers are very showy . Goubault is a large rosy blush inclining to yellow in the centre ; very double , distinct and fragrant ; it grows freely , and will occasionally produce seed , from which fine varieties will no doubt be obtained . Hamon is a delightful rose , with large flowers changing from blush to deep rose colour , a profuse bloomer , and appears to succeed best when budded upon a stronger growing variety . Hardy , or Gloire de Hardy , is a pretty variety , with pale pink flowers quite double , though not so large as the generality of Tea Roses . Hymbnke is a profuse blooming creamy wHite , perfectly double , growing freely in any situation , and quite hardy in this vicinity . Hippolyte is another of the same character , but has more of the yellow in it , and more fragrant . Jaime Panachi and Aurora are the same rose ; of a delicate straw colour changing to blush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of a spreading habit . Josephine . Malton is a new and elegant rose , of first rate character ; the flowers are large , retaining /z/ a cup shape to the last , of a creamy white colour ; the plant is strong growing , and apparently very hardy . Julie Mansais is another new variety , and though generally approaching a pure white , we have seen it quite yellow during cloudy weather in September and October ; the flower perfectly double , retaining its cup shape till faded . La Sylphide-j this new rose possesses every requisite for admiration ; it grows very luxuriantly ; the flowers are very large , of a rosy buff turning to a creamy-white colour , produced in great profusion , and in either bud or bloom is always admired ; does extremely well for pot culture , and is quite hardy for the garden . Lilicina is an old variety , but continues very distinct from any others ; the flowers are perfectly formed , of a lilac colour , and though under the medium size , make up for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink , often a fine blush , quite double , blooms freely , a strong grower , and is a very desirable variety . Madam Desprez is frequently seen in very great perfection ; in that state it is a fac simile of a Double White Camellia , with the most agreeable fragrance . It is rather delicate on its own roots , but when budded grows well ; in the south it is greatly admired . An amateur a few years ago presented me with a plant of this rose as something he had grown from seed , very mag- /z/ nificent , and under a new name ; I parted with two or three plants before the error was detected . Madam Galet approaches Elisa Sauvage in colour , but the growth is much stronger ; it is consequently more hardy , and will grow in a more northern latitude . Mansais is very distinct from Julie Mansais in both habit and colour ; the flower is quite large , of a buff colour , with a pink centre , perfectly double ; the buds are very pointed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardy . Melville requires only to be seen once to be recognized ever afterwards ; the plant will make shoots three or four feet long , crowned with very large dark blush flowers perfectly double ; the foliage is strong , dark green , and deeply serrated ; it is quite hardy , and very desirable . Mirabile is another of the newest sorts ; of a sulphury- yellow fading to rosy-blush , quite double , blooming and growing freely . Moir is a distinct globular variety , beautifully shaded with rose and blush , very perfect , but apparently a weak grower . Niphetos is a white , remarkable for its large taper formed flower bud , and till it is fully open is very splendid ; but like the Yellow Tea , when fully expanded , it is not at all attractive ; the wood is strong , and no doubt it is a hardy variety . Odorata , or Common Tea Rose ; few or none of the family possess the peculiar fragrance of this delightful rose ; its large rosy /z/ blush flower buds will ever be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as others , but will always be desirable for its agreeable odour , though perhaps one of the most difficult of the family to grow well . A liberal portion of leaf mould and sand appears to suit it . Odoratissitna is an old sort ; its name would seem to indicate that it has more odour than the former , but such is not the case ; its quality consists in growing and flowering freely , of a creamy blush colour , and in being equally as hardy as the common daily rose . Pauline Plantier ; this is among the many that have light flowers , nearly white shading to yellow , a character becoming too prevalent in the family , and growers should be cautious in putting forth so many of those whose colours are " so much alike , " though they may differ to a nice eye in a leaf , a shoot , or an imaginary shade . Prince cT Esterhazy is a beautiful blush variety , similar to Lyonnais , except being a few shades darker ; it retains its globular form till nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helene Luxembourg are nearly alike , though the latter has a little more of the yellowish colour than the former ; they are different in. growth , and both are fine fully double roses . Princesse Marie , when well grown , will be admired by all ; its large deep rose coloured waxy flowers , from four to five inches /z/ in diameter , of perfect cup form , which they retain till entirely faded , are not excelled by any of the family ; it is of a strong upright habit , and nearly as hardy as the common China rose . Reve du Bonheitr , or The Happy Dream , is a very distinct sort ; the buds , before they open , have the petals edged with bright red ; before expansion it appears striped , and when expanded is a creamy-blush ; though not perfectly double it is yet very desirable for its distinctive character , and being in bloom before any other of the group . Reine Victoria approaches Melville ; though not of so bright a colour it is fully as strong in habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the bud opens in the morning , is a fine saifron or dark orange colour , and is beautiful ; in the forenoon it is blush , and in the afternoon a very poor white not worth notice , and unless you see it pass through these " changes you could scarcely believe it to be the same rose . Soliman is a large rosy buff , with perfectly double flowers , which , in the cool days of autumn , are often bright rose ; it grows freely , and is rather hardy . Strombio can not be too well known ; though an old variety , it holds its place , with its large pendulous rose-white flowers , perfectly formed , of a cup shape , and in profusion ; it is also a luxuriant grower , and withstands our winters without protection . Taglioni is a large /z/ rose , of a fine white inclining to pink towards the centre ; a hardy strong variety . Theobaldine ; this new variety approaches the Noisettes in manner of flowering , though not in growth ; the flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fragrant and perfectly formed ; the foliage is of a pale yellowishgreen ; it is yet so scarce we can not say what its character in regard to growth and hardiness may be . Thebe , with every character of a Bengal rose , has the odour of the Tea very strong , and is put in this tribe on that account only ; it is of a bright rosy-red colour , of rather dwarf habit , flowers profusely , and quite double . Themistocle is a double white , of perfect form , with the centre of the flower inclining to blush . Triomphe du Luxembourg ; perhaps there is not a rose mentioned in this little volume that has been so universally distributed over the floral world in the space of eight or nine years , as this celebrated variety ; the flowers are often six inches in diameter , of a peculiar rosy-buff colour , and may be frequently seen of a yellowishwhite or deep rose , according to season and situation ; its growth is remarkably strong , in some soils producing shoots five feet long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possessed of considerable fragrance . Victoria Modeste , in southern latitudes , is very splendid , blooming perfectly the whole season , which it does not do here , except in /z/ the months of July or August ; the flowers are of a fine blush colour , very large and cup formed ; the growth of the strongest habit , and the shoots thickly studded with thorns . William Wallace is of a pale blush colour , an extra large flower , perfectly double , blooms and grows freely . There could be many others named , but their descriptions would merely be a repetition of those given ; there are others that pass under very exalted names , though roses of very inferior character . A choice bright red or crimson Tea Rose is still a desideratum ; there are several that approach that colour , but are not up to the standard of a connoisseur . From the cultivation of the many beautiful sorts here described we may hope to see ere long , this long expected treasure spring forth to delight our eyes . Bon Silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ des Cramoisis , a very fragrant rose , the results would , no doubt , give bright coloured and highly scented roses . The most successful grower of roses from seeds has been Mr. Hardy , of the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris , who annually raises thousands by that process ; and there is not a year passes that he does not send forth some article worthy of the name of the grower . The Tea Rose is well adapted for forcing , either in the hot-house or hot-beds prepared for them ; they require a temperature of from /z/ 60 to 70 , and will flower in six weeks from the time they have been subjected to the forcing process ; the atmosphere must be kept moist by syringing ; a good criterion to know the humidity of the air they are in , is by observing the dew upon the plants in the morning ; if they are lightly covered with it , showing the pearly drops from the - tip of the foliage , it is a good sign ; but if this is not seen every morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be freely syringed and kept well watered . Budded plants force finer than those on their own roots ; this can be done with great facility on any of the Boursault or other strong growing varieties . In July or August layer the young wood of these plants , ( the Boursault , ) and insert the bud at once about a foot from the ground ; these layers will be well rooted in October , when they can be lifted , potted , and put into a shady place in any frame or out-house till required for forcing . Mildew frequently attacks them when in artificial heat ; a few applications of sulphur water will keep it down ; but if the airing has been properly attended to , and the water judiciously given , that disease will not appear . Grafted plants stand out all winter perfectly well with us , if the top is pruned in November and covered with oiled paper , oil-cloth , matting , or any similar substitute , which we remove in March , arid frequently find the plants in as good /z/ order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precaution also with many of the Noisette and Bengal varieties ; this is so easily practised that it should not be omitted where there is the least danger . /z/ THIS and Rosa Semperflorens , although considered distinct species , have been so completely intermixed and amalgamated , that it is now impossible to define the difference between them . They have been , since their introduction fifty years ago , universally cultivated , and are admired by all . Not only the cottager and the great , but the poor inmate of the most cheerless abode , and the lonely widow whose domains extend not beyond the length and breadth of her window-sill all call in this favourite , to adorn the humble porch , to decorate the fanciful parterre , to throw a gleam of light in the desolate attic , and to speak of flowers that never fade . They are of a very hardy nature , and will endure almost every vicissitude of treatment , but can not /z/ very well bear the winter in the open air without protection , north of Philadelphia . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their roots , five or six inches thick , with dry leaves , and two feet all round ; distribute some earth over the leaves to prevent them being blown about by the wind . Give them rich sandy loamy soil of considerable depth ; plant in an airy situation , and never near a tree , or any other bush , which exhausts the soil and deteriorates the colour of the flower . The best season for pruning is as early in the spring as their buds show a disposition to swell ; in doing so cut out all the dead wood , shorten any of the young shoots that are irregular ; the old stinted wood should be cut as near to the ground as possible ; that the bush may stand free and regularly , thin all over ; dig in among their roots every season a good supply of rich compost or old manure , and stir and hoe them frequently during the summer . The remarks - we have made upon the culture of the Tea Rose will not be misapplied if practised on the Bengal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about one hundred varieties of them cultivated , but one half of that number will give every variety and character , compared with which most of the others will be found worth neither name nor culture , rfglae Loth , shaded rose fading to dark red , very double , and perfect /z/ form . Animated , is a bright pink , very beautiful when in bud ; it is a little fragrant , and of strong growth . Archduke Charles , is a noble variety , opening a bright rose colour and changing to crimson ; the points of the petals are frequently tipped with bright red . Jlrsenie , or Jlrsione , is of a delicate rose colour , very perfect in form , grows and blooms freely , quite distinct . Jlssuerus , is a new rose , deficient in petal and form , but very brilliant in colour . Beau Carmin , is of the Sanguinea habit , a very distinct variety , with dark crimsonpurple shaded flowers , quite double , and cup formed , is a free grower , and continually in bloom . Belle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds its distinctive character in producing a profusion of flowers , when first open , of a rosy colour changing gradually to very dark crimson , perfectly double ; the plant is a strong grower , and very hardy . Belle de Florence is a pale carmine variety with very perfect flowers under medium size , a profuse bloomer . Belle Isidore grows rampantly , even stronger than the common China , from which its flowers differ , being more double , and changing from pink to crimson . Belle Clarissima has much of the character of Belle de Florence , though darker in colour , and if any thing more perfect . Bisson a Odenr d'Jlnisette , is a delicate rosy pink , of upright growth , producing its flowers in loose clus- /z/ ters ; they are perfectly double , and have a peculiar odour . Boisnardj is quite a new variety , of a pale sulphur colour changing to nearly white , and appears to have all the characters of a Tea Rose except fragrance . JBuref , came out at first as a fine crimson Tea Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bengal ; its only redeeming quality being a little fragrant . Cameleon , is another of the changeable sorts , opening a fine rose colour , and then gradually changing to crimson ; is perfectly double , and a strong grower . Carmin jD ' Yebles , is very appropriately named , being of a bright carmine colour , very perfect , growing and blooming freely ; said to be " striped with white ; " many crimson roses have stripes of white , which in general , is more a fault than a beauty . Cels , or Multiflora Cels , ranks among the best of the blush roses ; indeed , for profusion of bloom it has not a rival ; every flower perfect , fully double , and cup shaped , growing freely in almost any soil or situation , and is an excellent variety to force into early bloom . Comble de Gloire is a very rich crimson , large and fully double ; a free grower and bloomer , possessing considerable fragrance ; is one of the best of the high coloured roses ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is universally admired for its brilliant crimson cup formed flowers , perfectly double ; it is a /z/ strong grower , and should be in every collection . Don Carlos , may be mentioned for being represented as a striped variety ; it closely resembles the common Sanguinea , though not so bright , and has about as many stripes as Sanguinea . Duchess of Kent , is a neat pale pink rose , of a dwarf habit , arid rather small sized flower . Etna , of Luxembourg and U Etna are the same , and like Belle Isidore has that changeable colour from rose to crimson ; the petals are often tipped with scarlet , making it very attractive . Fabvier , and Noisette JJgrippina , are the same , and admired for brilliancy of colour ( being near a scarlet ) and its seeding qualities . Gig an tea is an old strong growing sort , producing very large and fully double flowers , blooming perfectly , and quite hardy . Gros Charles is a magnificent variety , with large perfectly imbricated flowers of a shaded rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hibbertia is an American of fourteen years standing , and is one of the prettiest pink fully double roses we have ; though of weak growth it produces large flowers with considerable fragrance . Indica is the common variety , and generally known as the Daily Rose , from its frequency in blooming , and not from its blooming every day , as some suppose ; it is the type of the family . When we say large , we mean larger than this rose ( Daily ) , and when small , we /z/ mean smaller than this ; the flower is of a dark blush or rose colour , and about three inches in diameter ; it grows very strong , frequently making shoots five feet long in one season in rich sandy soil ; it is one of the best , for forcing , and thousands of it are sold in the Philadelphia market at from six to one hundred cents per plant . Plants two feet high are grown from small cuttings forced , and sold within twelve months . Such has been the rapidity of rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not one thousand rose plants in its vicinity , and now there are , at the lowest calculation , thirty-five to forty thousand disposed of in the course of a single year . Indica Jllba is the very popular White , Daily Rose first imported to this country in 1828 , and now spread through every town , village , and garden of the Union . It is very much like the old White Tea Rose , though the petals are not so thick and waxy as that variety ; the plant grows more freely and blooms more profusely ; it is also well adapted for early forcing . Icterose is a new creamy- white with yellow centre ; a very double variety , blooming and growing freely , and has much the appearance of being a variety of the Tea , though it has not much of its fragrance . Jacksonia , * is another American , grown from /z/ the same seed with Hibbertia , and is a first rate variety , producing a profusion of bright red flowers perfectly double ; the wood is strong and very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of Hundred Leaved Daily . La Ccemens is a beautiful rose , the flower being of the form of a White Camellia , but of a rosy-crimson colour ; it is very perfect , and greatly admired . Louis Philippe has not an equal for growth , in good soils frequently making a shoot six feet long in one season ; the flowers are large , perfectly double , of a globular form ; the circumference of the bloom is of a dark crimson colour , the centre a pale blush , making it altogether perfectly distinct from any other rose in cultivation ; it will give entire satisfaction . We have seen it passing under the new name of King of France . Madam Hersent , or Augustine Hersent , is a fine bright rose coloured variety , very large , and though not very perfect in form , makes an excellent display ; is of good growth , and tolerably hardy . Marjolin , ranks among the finest dark crimson roses ; it produces its flowers in great abundance ; they are large , globular , and perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Thea a Fleurs Jaime , has been cultivated here many years , and though numbers have originated since , yet none has its character for great profusion of bloom , luxuriance of growth , and hardiness ; /z/ the flowers are pure white , and produced in clusters . Miss Sergeant is a bright pink rose , of fine habit , profuse flowering , strong growth , and perfectly hardy ; it was grown from seed by Mr. Mackenzie , of this city . Mrs. Bosanquet is one of the very best of the pale roses ; the flowers are perfectly double , of cup form ; colour waxy blush ; the growth is strong , nearly approaching the Bourbon roses , to which it is related , and it may frequently be taken for the Queen of the Bourbons . Prince Charles is a fine new light crimson variety , very perfect in form , and , as well as many others of similar good qualities , is an offspring of the Luxembourg gardens . Prince Eugene , is a very rich crimson rose , being in colour between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hardy . Reine de Lombardie , is the queen of the bright rosy-red varieties ; it is of the most globular form , which it retains to its last hour . The flowers are perfectly double , and produced in profusion ; the plant grows rapidly , and is quite hardy . There is not a rose of the colour better adapted for forcing or growing in pots , for the parlour or green-house . Roi des Cramoisis was brought by me , in 1839 , from Paris , where I saw the original plant , around which there was a regularly trodden path made by its admirers , of which I was one , never before having seen a dark rich /z/ crimson rose with so much odour ; the flowers too were large , fully double , and cup formed ; the plant three or four feet high , and fully loaded with its gorgeous flowers . It has since appeared in several collections , having been imported under the name of Eugene Beauharnais , nor does the transmutation of names appear to have stopped there , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bourbon Beauharnais ; it grows freely , and is well worth cultivating . Rubens , or Ruban Pourpre , of the English , is a distinct rosy-violet coloured variety , with perfectly formed flowers , though not so strong in growth as many others . Semperflorens ; this is the far famed crimson Chinese , or San guinea Rose , the type of all the scarlet or crimson varieties of this division ; it is perfectly double , cup shaped , of a rich crimson colour , and is universally cultivated ; its nature is not so hardy as some others , but yet it withstands our winters with very simple protection , and though of humble growth gives a profusion of bloom throughout the entire season . Triomphant , or Bengal Triomphant , is a popular rose , very large and full , of a violet-crimson colour , and may be often seen of every shade , from rosy-lilac to violet-crimson ; the flowers are always perfect in form . The plarft has passed under several other names in Europe , such as La Superba , Grande et Belle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the two former names only . Triomph de Gand approaches the former , but the colours are not so varied , and the plant is more robust in habit . Vinella is a very old dark crimson rose , remarkable for its blooming perfectly , only when the weather is very hot ; it stands erect , when many others fade under the oppressive sun of the months of July and August . Washington , was one of our first American seedling roses , grown by the old house of D. and C. Landreth ; it is yet a distinct variety in both flowers and foliage ; the former are crimson , with white at the bottom of the petals , and frequently striped much more distinctly than Don Carlos ; the foliage is a pale peculiar green , with red nerves ; it grows and blooms freely . This tribe of the rose family is yet susceptible of great improvement ; we want some of pale rose and blush colours , with a few of dark rich crimson . For the former , we strongly urge the impregnating of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ des Cramoises with Marjolin ; the offspring of these will doubtless give some choice sorts . We have plants of one and two years growth from many of the finest Bengals , but they have i not yet arrived to such perfection of growth and inflorescence as to enable us to decide upon their respective merits . It now requires a very /z/ choice article to rank among first rate roses , and none shall ever , with our consent , be sent forth with a name , without merit . Standards , or rose trees of from one to three feet of the Bengal sorts , are very attractive , and should always be cultivated where variety , character , and ornament are desired . They can be very easily budded on any of the Boursaults , or varieties of the Prairie Rose ; on either of which they will grow freely for a few years , and with care may continue to flourish from ten to fifteen years , keeping their heads close pruned , and giving them plenty of enriching materials about their roots every winter . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger sorts ; the common daily rose makes an excellent stock , and it can be propagated with such facility that any quantity of strong plants may be got for the purpose . All the China roses can be propagated by cuttings taken from the plants as soon as they have done blooming , in June or August ; the shoots , about three or four inches long , that have produced flowers , are the best for the purpose ; cut them off close to the old wood , and reduce them to three inches in length , cutting off the top ; then insert them into sandy rich earth , in a shady spot , or on the north side of a fence , ot in a frame where they can be shaded from the sun ; it is necessary to make the cuttings /z/ firm in the soil , leaving about an inch of the top above ground , with one or two leaves thereon ; give them a sprinkling of water every evening for a few weeks , when they will be rooted , and may then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June they will form strong plants before winter ; but where they are only required to a limited extent , layering will be found the safest method , and will always produce a good strong plant . For this purpose , select a shoot in August , about a foot long ; cut and place it into the ground as directed for layering in a former part of this work . When fully rooted , about the end of October , they can be cut off and put away into winter quarters , either by the heels in a frame , or planted into pots . They must be shaded from the sun for a few days after removal , and will be greatly strengthened by ' having their tops cut off , only leaving one , or at most two , branches , six to eight inches long . Those of robust habit do not make handsome standards ; they shoot away into irregular forms , and require to be repeatedly trimmed into shape during the growing season . Summer pruning has been strongly urged upon the horticulturist by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humid climate to operate in ; but in this country , where growth is so rapid , it requires all the foliage a plant produces to convey to the roots the nourishment ( carbonic acid ) it derives /z/ from the atmosphere , to support their free growth during the months of July and August . Every leaf , young shoot , or branch that a tree or plant is deprived of , during the period of their growth , is merely withdrawing from them a portion of their daily food . I have rarely seen summer pruning attended with beneficial results , but the contrary . The proper method is to disbud , or merely take the tip from the extremity of a shoot . " The size of a plant is proportional to the surface of the organs which are destined to convey food to it . A plant gains another mouth and stomach with every new fibre of root and every new leaf . " When the Bengal , or any of the Tea roses , that have been planted in the open ground during the summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the fall or winter months , the best plan is , towards the middle of September , to cut the roots round each plant , leaving the ball of ground less than the pot you intend using . Cutting the roots will cause the plant to droop , but in about a fortnight they will make fresh rootlets , and will be ready for potting , which must be done with care , not to crumble the ball of earth or disturb the fresh roots . By this means the plants will look more handsome than if they had been grown in pots . /z/ THESE diminutive rases , were first introduced from China , where the greatest efforts of horticulture are directed towards dwarfing every tree , shrub , or plant . In this instance , however , it is no peculiar mode of treatment that has stunted the growth of the plant , or diminished the size of the flowers ; but these roses have been the produce of seeds saved from the smallest flowers of the kind , year after year , till they now have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a dozen varieties of these Lilliputians , varying in colour from nearly white to dark crimson . In this country , where almost every flower must be a Goliah , before it is admired , this family has been nearly lost sight of . Indeed , they are entirely buried , when planted among those gorgeous flowers we have already attempted faintly to describe . It is therefore necessary , in cultivating the miniature rose , to grow them in a spot by themselves ; for this purpose a slightly elevated position is the best , the ground having been prepared in the same manner as directed for Bengals or Teas . The fol- /z/ lowing are the most distinct varieties of European origin . La Miniature , a bright pink rose , perfect in character , with the flower about the size of half a dime , the plant about six inches high when full grown . Gloire , crimson , in size and growth rather larger than the former . Pompon , of the French , is our old Indica Minor , from which no doubt they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to the first named , but a few shades darker . There is also the Pretty American , a plant of low stature , never exceeding six or seven inches in height , grown by Mr. Boll , of New York . And last and least , we copy from the third volume of Hovey 's Magazine of Horticulture an account of the Prince of Dwarfs , which originated at Mr. S. Feasts , of Baltimore . When three years old , the Master Burke had fine full blown and very double flowers ; and the half of a common hen 's egg-shell would have covered the whole bush without touching it . This I saw and assert to be a fact . It is now seven or eight years old , flowers regularly every year , affording wood for propagation , and has never yet attained two inches in height , nor its whole top exceeded one , or one and a half inch in diameter ; the rose is about the size of a buckshot . " The article was written by a gentleman of high standing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do suppose , as he says it is , " a fact/ ' although I have not been able to get possession of the plant . /z/ IT is about six years since we predicted that this group of roses , in a few years , would be the most popular of the whole family of the " Queen of Flowers ; " that prediction is now literally fulfilled , in the great demand by all the admirers and cultivators of the rose , for the varieties of this family . Our readers will allow that the taste thus created within a few years is not to be wondered at , when we have held up to their admiration the choice bouquet of these flowers which we have now to present . As this family has become so very popular , its history , no doubt , will prove interesting to many , and is indeed worthy of some attention . The first of this rose is said to have been imported from the Isle of Bourbon to France in 1S22 , and is there known in the catalogue of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracted /z/ great attention by its peculiar habit and profusion of brilliant bright rose coloured flowers , blooming in June , with a slight tendency to flower again in autumn ; not being fully double , it produced an abundance of seed , from which varieties were obtained that bloomed freely the whole season . The only roses known on the island , were the common China , and the Red-four-seasons , till about the year 1816 , when a Monsieur Perichon was planting a hedge of these , and among his plants found one very different from the others in its shoots and leaves , which induced him to plant it in his garden , where it was discovered by a French botanist , and sent home in 1822 to Monsieur Jacques , then gardener at the Chateau de Neuilly ; this accounts for the name of " Bourbon Jacques , " frequently given by English growers to the common Bourbon rose . It was introduced to this country , in 1828 , by the late Mr. Thomas Hibbert , whose , name will always be associated in the memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , connected with a particular subject , often flashes on the mind with the vividness of a sunbeam . The first perfect specimen I ever saw of this rose , was in the possession of that cultivator , and although it is now fourteen years ago , the spot , the company , the remarks , the very words , all recur to me most forcibly whenever this rose is introduced ; " thus /z/ thought follows thought , according to the order in which objects and events are related to each other . " The perpetuity of bloom , and the hardy nature of the Bourbon Rose fills up a chasm that had long been deplored by amateurs and cultivators in northern latitudes . They are decidedly more robust , and withstand a greater degree of cold than either the Noisette , Tea , or Bengal roses . It is now our impression , that in a few years , these , with the " Remontante " family , will be the only roses cultivated in all the states north of Virginia ; and there is no reason why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specimens exhibiting all the distinctive varieties disseminated among other groups , such as mossy , striped , spotted , mottled , not excepting a yellow colour in its brightest shade . In those now described , every colour will be found , from nearly pure white to dark crimson purple . ftcidalie , has been in cultivation several years , but is only now coming into notice for its distinct pale rose-white colour ; the flower is perfect in form , large , and a little fragrant ; the plant is quite hardy , and grows well . Augustine Lelieur , possesses considerable fragrance , is of a rosy-purple colour , full , round , well formed , and is a strong grower , but does not open well in the early part of the season . Jlmourette , is a pale flesh-coloured /z/ variety , with flowers very perfect and distinct ; though smaller than many others it is very profuse . Jlsteroide , is of a bright rose colour , fully double , growing freely . Bizarine , is of the medium size , of a fine cup form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bouquet de Flore , is a great favourite , and though it has been cultivated some years , is yet quite scarce ; the flowers are very large , perfectly double , with large round firm petals , blooming very profusely ; it possesses considerable fragrance , is a strong grower , and quite hardy . Cardinal Fesch , is the reverse in growth ; the flowers are of a deep crimson colour , of medium size , but produced in profusion , quite double and distinct , and can not be mistaken . Celimene , grows with vigour ; the shoots are densely studded with strong prickles ; flowers of a delicate rose colour , medium size , and fully double . Ceres is a rosy lilac , perfectly double , but does not open well in the early part of the season ; it grows with rapidity , and opens fully after midsummer . Docteur Rogues , or Crimson Globe , of the English , is of robust habit , makes an elegant standard ; the flowers are globular , finely formed , of a rich dark crimson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen it can not be mistaken . D 1 Yebles grows very like the old Madam Desprez , but the flowers are of a much brighter colour , the /z/ foliage very large , and the plant quite strong . Emilie Courtier , does not appear to open freely till after July , when it shows its fine rose coloured fragrant flowers in great perfection . Fedora , is one of the new crimson varieties , perfectly double , a strong grower , and will yet prove to be a fine pillar rose . General Dubourg , when well grown , produces its large pale rose coloured flowers in great clusters , highly fragrant , giving a profuse autumnal blooming ; it is a strong grower , and makes a fine pillar variety . Gloire de Rosaniene , for profusion of bloom from June till severe frost , has not an equal ; the flowers are nearly bright scarlet , produced in large clusters , but are not fully double , of rampant growth , making a fine pillar plant , very conspicuous in the distance , clothed with large foliage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite an excitement among rose growers ; very few plants of it ever having as yet come to this country , it has given an opportunity to some to supply the demand with other varieties under this denomination , not thinking , with the poet , that there was " nothing in a name . " It is a bright crimson , perfectly double , globular form , foliage deeply serrated , wood of short firm growth , with few prickles . Hennequin , in growth , is much stronger than Madam Desprez , and very much of its habit , flowering in immense /z/ clusters of rosy crimson flowers . When on its own roots , in rich light ground , it will grow to any size . Hermosa , or rfrmosa , of some , has been cultivated these ten years , and is still a favourite ; the flowers are of the most exquisite form , perfectly cupped ; though under the medium size , the deficiency is made up in the profusion of pale rose coloured flowers . It is a dwarf grower , and makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green-house . Henry Plantier , is a popular variety , producing a profusion of deep rose coloured flowers of medium size ; it is a free grower , and will make a fine pillar variety . Le Phenix , is a bright red , with flowers beautifully imbricated to the very centre . Its habit is similar to Hermosa . Madam JLude , is a new bright rose coloured sort , with finely formed flowers ; it grows vigorously , and will make a good pillar plant . Madam Desprez ; it is eleven years since I first imported this rose , together with Aimee Vibert , Lamarque , Jaune Desprez , and some others of equal celebrity ; they will maintain their character for a quarter of a century to come , and should be in every garden between this and Nachitoches . This rose originated with Monsieur Desprez , a distinguished French amateur ; it is considerably hybridized with the Noisette , and like that rose produces its bright rose coloured flowers in immense clusters ; /z/ from thirty to seventy bloom in each when the plant is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong and handsome . Madam Neumann , Le Brun , Gloire de France , or the Monthly Cabbage , appear to be one and the same rose . I have repeatedly gone from plant to plant , and compared flower with flower , but could come to no other conclusion ; when Le Brun appeared with so fine a character , about three years ago , I tried to persuade myself it was a new rose , but in vain ; if they are not one and the same , they are at least perfectly similar , producing fine large deep rose coloured flowers of exquisite fragrance , but do not open well in the early part of the season , or during wet weather ; they are of strong growth , requiring very rich soil . Marechal de Villars is a very beautiful and distinct rose , with bright rosy - purple flowers , very compact , blooming profusely in either wet or dry soils ; it is a good grower , and wil always reward the care bestowed upon it ; it will grow either as a bush or pillar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep rosy purple variety , but never shows its character of free blooming till well established ; whereas many Bourbon Roses bloom when a few inches high . Paul Joseph , is quite a new variety , and of course is to eclipse all its predecessors ; the beauty of growth , symmetry of flower , brilliant crimson colour , rich large foli- /z/ age , are all charms which it really possesses , and it will some time enjoy its reputation , till another star has the ascendant ; every year brings with it some particular plant possessing beauties that outshine all others ; thus we have had Dr. Rogues , Grand Capitaine , now Paul Joseph , next I suppose will be the unequalled ( as yet unseen ) " Vicomtesse de Reseguire , " a large double pure white , edged with rose . Phillip ar , is a very distinct Bourbon , of a beautiful peach-blossom colour ; the plant grows rapidly when well established , producing very large clusters of flowers , rather under medium size , but in profusion , forming a handsome pillar plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any of the others ; the flowers are very perfectly formed ; they have been small with us , but no doubt will be much larger when once the plant becomes established ; it is yet quite new . Reine des lies de Bourbon , or the Queen of the Bourbons , has been admired ever since it made its appearance in the family ; at first it was thought to be a Bengal , the same as " Madam Bosanquet , " which is also classed by some among the Bourbons . The colour is a beautiful waxy blush , with petals perfectly formed , bold , and cup-shaped ; a half-blown rose from this plant is loveliness itself ; the plant is rather dwarf in habit , but in a proper climate and genial soil , will grow as high as de- /z/ sired . Therkse Margat , or Madam Mar gat approaches " Phoenix , " though perhaps not so bright ; the flowers are beautifully cupped , quite double , and fragrant ; it is of medium growth . Thrsita is of a bright rose colour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in its bushy growth and profusion of bloom . Triomphe de Plantier is another of the habit of Madam Desprez ; the flowers are much darker , being of a fine bright crimson colour , of the most perfect form , and produced in large clusters . Victoire flrgente is one of the very pale Bourbons , of cup form , opening of a very light rose colour , fading to a pale blush ; it is quite fragrant , growing and blooming freely . Violet de Belgique is one of the most fragrant of the family , having all the agreeable odour of the Damask Rose ; the flowers are of noble form , large , and perfectly double ; it is of good growth , and will prove to be one of the greatest favourites of the group ; it is yet quite scarce . Zulema , has much of the Noisette character and colour in its flowers , being a pale blush , produced in immense clusters of forty to severity in each when the plant is thoroughly grown ; the growth and foliage have all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable variety . There are several others in this most interesting family well deserving notice , and even very desira- /z/ ble where a full collection is grown , although it must be confessed that there exists , in this tribe , great confusion in regard to name , and there are many instances of the same article passing under different names in different collections . Some of these errors have originated in this country , unintentionally , I presume ; others have been committed in France , in sending out the article not true to name . It must also be conceded that our English brethren have their full share in these practices ; and with their host of synonymes ( to give them no harsher name ) completely blindfold us . Under their " Crimson Globe " we discovered our friend " Dr. Roques ; " and under their crimson " Madam Desprez , " or Splendens , " we think we see our " Hennequin ; " at all events , it is not the rose cultivated in France under the name of " Splendens . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the same , a very inferior variety , with bright pink flowers , not in the least deserving a name among the truly splendid ones of the present day . There are also some recent additions , only known by name , with whose colour and character we have yet to be acquainted . /The Bourbons , generally , make fine standard plants , either on low or high stems ; as they are nearly all of strong growth , and produce a constant succession of bloom the whole season , they require to be /z/ highly nourished , either with rich soils , or copious waterings with liquid manure . If on standards , the tops of them will be benefited if protected as advised for Tea and Bengal roses ; or the whole plant may be removed to a shaded situation , where , after sheltering them , lay them in by the heels , and cover them with boards ; when spring opens prune them close , and plant them where desired , in fresh prepared soil . This removal is even beneficial to them , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is improved by a change of soil , unless it be in those deep alluvial soils that have never been cultivated ; in such , the roots run yearly in quest of , and obtain , genial nourishment for any length of time . But in the eastern and northern states , it is absolutely necessary to lift the plants that are budded , and place them under protection . Those grown on their own roots may be well surrounded with dry leaves , which will protect them from the sudden changes of our winter seasons in latitudes north of this ; and even if their tops be destroyed , they will push vigorously from the roots , and produce their flowers in full perfection . They should not be allowed to go to seed ; remove the flower stems as soon as they are faded ; it increases the reproduction of bloom . /z/ THIS is a new tribe , that has originated within a few years , between the Perpetual and Bourbon Roses , possessing the beauty and fragrance of the former with the growth and foliage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to November ; they open a field of pleasure to the northern grower and amateur , which had hitherto , been reserved only to the rose fanciers of more favoured climes . They are equally as hardy as the common garden rose ; and by careful cultivation , good soil , frequent waterings in dry weather , depriving them of all faded flower-stems , they will show flowers the whole season till destroyed by frost . Their general habit is robust and vigorous to a remarkable degree ; their flowers large , perfect , fragrant , and of almost every colour . We can not give any idea of the beauty they may attain to in the southern states , where the soil is so genial to their culture , but they can not fail to grow and flower to the satisfaction of the most , fastidious taste . The varieties are yet limited , compared with many of the families we have described , but /z/ a few years will multiply them to a greater extent . We can not fully depend upon the very flattering , if not extravagant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every country . The beauties of the child are most evident to the parent ; so with the rose ; though its charms are sweet to all , yet they are sweeter to him whose fostering hand has raised it from seed . To obtain a new variety meriting extra notice , in this improving age , is no paltry affair ; and many , like " Queen Victoria , " are named before their merit has been fully tested , and sent out to the floricultural world , as it were , on trial . But we will mention only such in which there will be no fear of disappointment . Jlubernon , is an excellent bloomer , even to profusion , with perfect bright rosy carmine flowers . Of the same character is Augustine . Mouchelet , though more on the violet colour ; it is also a rampant grower . Clementine Duval has much of the character of a Bourbon , even to its dwarfriess ; the flowers are quite perfect , of a bright pink colour . Comte de Paris has magnificent large rosy-purple flowers , perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the fall months . Docteur Max is a new variety , not yet fully proven , but promises well , with flowers of a crimson-violet colour , large and perfect , growing freely . De , Neuilly is more dwarf than the former ; the flowers are of a beau- /z/ tiful clear rose , spotted with white , and highly fragrant ; it is a very perfect and distinct variety . Due d'tfturnale is a pale crimson rose , a strong grower and free bloomer . Duchesse de Sutherland is not so constant a bloomer as some others , but for rapid growth it has few equals among the tribe , and its very double flesh coloured flowers are quite beautiful . Edouard Jess has been a favourite with us these two years , and is still admired for the beautiful flowers , of a bright red circled by a pale tint , delightfully fragrant . Emma Dampiere , and Fidouline are both quite new varieties , just introduced from France as very superior varieties , of a delicate rose colour . Fulgorie is a noble rose , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing its flowers in clusters like the old monthly cabbage , but always opening handsomely ; the wood is very strong and thickly studded with prickles . Lady Fordwick , is truly superb , growing freely , and producing the whole season a profusion of large perfectly double ffowers , of a rosypink colour , with the odour of the Damask Rose . Louis Bonaparte , has immense rosy-lilac flowers , fully double , always perfect , growing with great luxuriance , and makes a splendid plant . Madam Laffay has as yet no equal in the group ; it stands unrivalled both in perfection of flower and fragrance ; the growth and foliage are luxuriant ; the /z/ flowers large , double , and exquisitely formed , of a rich rosy-crimson colour , with the delightful fragrance of the Cabbage Rose . It originated with Monsieur Laffay , a celebrated rose-grower near Paris , who dedicated it to his wife . Marechal Sou If is another charming variety , of a bright rosy-purple colour , very double , imbricated , and fragrant . Mistress Elliott 's charms consist in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrasting well with Prudence Roeser , which has a portion of the Noisette character in its disposition to cluster ; the flowers are a beautiful pink , perfectly formed ; though not so large as some others , it is a beautiful distinct variety . Prince Albert 's magnificent rich crimson flowers are very grand , being of the most perfect cup form , inclining to globular ; it grows strongly , and is very fragrant ; its only fault is in its not blooming so profusely in the fall as some of the others ; for constant profusion Rivers has greatly the preference ; for during the whole season it produces its extremely large flowers in clusters of brilliant , crimson inclining to scarlet ; it is very fragrant , and a great favourite , but quite scarce . These varieties , with two exceptions , have all flowered under our observation , and are great acquisitions to the lover of the rose . From these descriptions , it will be observed that this group is deficient in flowers of a /z/ a pale or white colour , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this fault will not be long attributed to them , for this year ( 1844 ) has brought to hand , in perfect order , a host of names with plants to suit ; and another season will prove their qualities ; then , with the great facilities for propagating , and the many hands applied to it , no rose can be , for any length of time , a rarity about Philadelphia . Among the recent sorts we may name those that are most esteemed in France , where they have all been grown . Comte d'Eu , La Reine , Lady Mice Peel , Docteur Marjolin , Reine de La Guillotiere , Sisley , Yoland d3rragon , Zelpha , with several others , all described as being beautiful in colour , from blush to crimsonviolet , and in form very superior . But no doubt there will be many discrepancies when tested by an eye that gives merit precedence over rarity . This very magnificent group of the rose family can not be too extensively cultivated ; they are nearly , without exception , free bloomers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprived of a great portion of their first blooming buds , and have a few of their shoots cut back . Indeed , the principal part of their first buds can easily be dispensed with ; for it is then the rosy season ; the great aim of the fancier and cultivator is to extend that season , which , with the above sacri- /z/ fice , is at once accomplished . These plants , whose luxuriance and immense flowers ( perhaps the largest known ) have been the result of hybridizing and exciting culture , deserve all the care that can be bestowed upon them . Every encouragement must be given to promote the growth of the plant , which is best done in the winter season by composts and manures , or in the summer by rich waterings ; these waterings should not be given oftener than once a week . As these roses are yet quite scarce on their own roots , we have introduced a standard rose , at page 87 , to show their beauty and the effect they have . When trained in that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a convenient distance to enjoy all their beauty and fragrance . When there are mossy , yellow , and striped roses in this family , rose culture will have approached its climax . /z/ FOURTEEN years ago , this division of the Rose was known only to a very limited extent , not going beyond the old Monthly Damask and the Portland the types of the group , which in that /z/ short period have become so extensive and varied in colour and character that the parentage of many is difficult to point out . But unfortunately there are those that pass for perpetual , which , with all our art we can not cause to produce even a second blooming in the season , except by demolishing all the buds they form in June to make them flower in September . Many of them have another feature of obstinacy , and this is , that in rooting by layers , they nearly all , take two years to form rootlets ; we have , in consequence , either to graft or bud them on other roses at any desired height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous Bourbon Roses , and were looked upon as the ne plus ultra of the Rosary . The perfection and beauty of many of their flowers can not even yet be outvied , and their stiffness of habit is not unpleasant when properly placed . The best form to grow them is on standards , from six inches to four feet high . They are perfectly hardy in all latitudes where the Damask Rose will grow . In bleak situations , where the thermometer falls frequently below zero , the stems are greatly benefited by a covering of straw or matting . The rods that support standards should be put on the south side of the plant ; the strong sun is thereby warded off the stem , which is beneficial , both in summer and winter . What we have said in regard to the rich /z/ culture required for Remontantes roses is equally applicable to the Perpetual . Among the many , we have selected those that are most distinct , and such as have the greatest tendency to give a succession of bloom . One of the darkest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of our old Gallica roses ; it is quite double , perfect , and fragrant . Bernard , or Perpetual Pompone , is a lovely pink rose , of exquisite form , all the petals being like so many beautiful shells neatly put together ; it is very similar to Josephine Antoinette , but they are distinct . Billiard , is larger than the former , and more of the rose colour , perfectly double , fragrant , and a profuse bloomer . Claire , du Chatelet , is a new bright rose coloured variety , - with very large perfect flowers , of very distinct habit , and a free grower . Dingers , though an old variety , still retains its character of a constant bloomer , with large flowers of a pale rose colour . Desdemona , for its delicate colour , and exquisite fragrance , is worthy of culture , though its tendency to autumnal blooming merely , is discouraging . Due d'Enghien proves very desirable , being distinct both in its pale fleshy colour , and in its character of growth , and a free bloomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about thirty years since this famous rose was grown from seed in the gardens of one of /z/ the royal palaces near Paris , remaining comparatively obscure , and was considered a rare article in England in 1831 , where I first saw it growing , carefully surrounded with rods to keep its admirers at a distance . In 1832 or 3 I imported it as the gem of the day , and it is still admitted to be the king of Perpetuals , blooming profusely and perfectly from June till Christmas ; the colour is bright red , ( not crimson , ) a perfectly formed flower , with all the . fragrance of the Damask Rose , and without any extra pruning never fails to bloom the whole season , richly deserving a place in every garden . De Trianon , is a pretty dwarf , of a rose colour , a profuse bloomer ; when budded about one foot high is quite a neat affair . Eblne , is just introduced to our notice as the darkest of the perpetuals , of a fine violet colour , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kind ; " another season will show us its true character . Feburier , has brilliant flowers , perfectly formed , quite double ; a strong growing variety , and will apparently succeed in any soil . Isaure Lablee , gives a beautiful succession of perfectly delicate pink flowers , very fragrant . Jeanne Hachette , if not the most constant , is the largest rose of the group ; I have measured it six inches in diameter , very double , fragrant , of a pale rose colour , and is a strong grower . Jenny Audio does well on its own roots , making a perfect /z/ dwarf , with very large flowers of a dark rose colour ; but when budded it grows much stronger . The favourite Josephine Antoinette , is a free bloomer , with flowers of the most perfect form , of a rosy pink colour , and delighfully fragrant . Lady Seymour , is quite a new variety , occasionally spotted with blush , on a bright rose ground ; quite fragrant , and of perfect form . La Gracieuse , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite thorny , and grows freely ; the flowers are perfectly double , of a pale rose colour . La Mienne , or Gloire des Perpetuelles , is a free bloomer throughout the Queen of Perpetuals , deserves its name ; its flowers open freely , of a pale rose colour , blooming freely all the season , holding its place with Du Roi in every character . Lodoiska Marin , has been long esteemed for its profusion of large pale flowers , blooming freely , quite double , and in clusters , showing well in the distance . Monstrueuse , or Grande Belle , at first sight would be taken for Jeanne Hatchette , but it is darker in colour , neither is it so large as that variety ; it is also a strong grower , and will train into any form as a standard . Noel , is a very pale pink , approaching blush , growing freely , and is a prolific variety , large and double . Palmire , or Blush Pe ? *petual , /z/ is still esteemed as a free bloomer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very deficient in light colours . Portland Blanc , however , is nearly white , a rose of large size , perfect in form , quite fragrant , and a good grower ; it is yet scarce , but a few seasons will make it nearly as plentiful as any other variety . Preval , is of a pale flesh colour , cup shaped , very perfect , a profuse bloomer , fragrant , and highly esteemed . Prud-homme , has been always a favourite for its brilliancy and fragrance , giving a succession of flowers of perfect form . Pule her ie , is one of the darkest varieties in the group , being only a shade lighter than flntinoits , and more perfect than that variety ; the wood is very spiny , and when not in bloom would be taken for Ferox , a very distinct variety , with large flowers , of a light pink colour . I may also mention Panache de Girardon , not for its beautifully striped character , but to speak of its self-coloured imperfect rosy-red flowers , called Striped Perpetual ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it have any pretensions to that distinction , and then it was more like a flower that had been exposed to a few drops of rain , than one naturally variegated ; no good Striped Perpetual Rose has yet appeared . Quatre Saisons , or Monthly Damask , has been long an inhabitant of our gardens , where , when well established , and well nourished , it gives a great pro-/z/ fusion of its delicate pink flowers , in clusters , the whole season ; its fragrance , also , is so agreeable , that it makes it a great favourite with all . The Qua t re Saisons Blanc , or White Monthly Damask , is not so constant a bloomer as the former , rarely putting forth a succession of flowers , unless in very rich light soil ; it is very like the White , Damask , which is often substituted for it , though it does not produce its bloom in close clusters , like the White Monthly . The Perpetual White Moss has already been noticed , but we may here say that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the White or Pink Monthly Damask ; plants of it having been known to assume the habit of those varieties . Requien , is a very distinct rose , the flowers expanding large and flat , very double , of a pale flesh colour , with very strong foliage and habit . Scotch Perpetual , does not bloom so constantly as we might expect from the name ; yet it gives occasional clusters of flowers of nearly a white colour , during the summer months ; its foliage , too , is very distinct from any of those named ; it has more of the brier character , and is very similar in growth to the old Scotch Rose . Stanwell , is an English variety ; a true Perpetual , blooming profusely and constantly the whole summer , till late in the season . Its habit is also like a Scotch Rose , though stronger in all its parts , with large double pale blush flowers of /z/ exquisite fragrance . Triomphe de Montmorency , is a beautiful pink cupped flower , quite double , very fragrant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this family , like the Bourbons and Remontantes , is very destitute of white flowers ; nor is there a genuine striped variety among either , so that the hybridizer and amateur have yet a large and new field open to their operations . We would suggest that Du Roi and the White Monthly Damask be fertilized ; the former seeds abundantly , and with the culture we have recommended , the seedlings will bloom in three years . Some have advanced that the finest roses from seed are always the longest in flowering ; when there is any tardiness observed , a few buds can be put into stocks , which will hasten their inflorescence. /z/ THERE is nothing in the whole family that we have been engaged upon , so distinctive in flower and character as this group . The plants of the /z/ true Microphylla Rose are very beautiful ; when in foliage , their small pinnated leaves are so unlike any other plant ( except perhaps a Locust tree in miniature ) that they are both interesting and agreeable . It has been known twenty years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some to have originated in that country from the old Macartney Rose . I consider it , however , a distinct species , in every particular , and this can be proven by any of my readers who may be fortunate enough to save seed from it . The produce ( if not intermixed with others ) will be pure Microphylla roses , retaining the character of foliage , spiny calyx , with single , half double , and perfectly double flowers , nearly all of a dark rose colour . The first of this rose , as we believe , was imported by us in 1830 , and it is now extensively cultivated in every section of the country . Recent importations , denominated Microphylla , can barely be recognized as such ; the popularity of the old variety has given circulation to many of the inferior new ones , which , after having been seen in bloom , are frequently thrown aside as worthless . They are generally hardy , in dry soils giving a succession of flowers throughout the season . They are adapted for training against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed into handsome bushes of any shape ; but a hedge of them is the /z/ beau ideal of the flower garden , which all may enjoy in any latitude south of this . The following sorts are worthy of all requisite culture , and will grow freely in any rich soil , avoiding low wet situations . Carnea , or Rosea , is the old variety known as the Microphylla Rose ; its character is unique , with small neat dark green foliage . The flowers are large and very double , of a rose colour , produced at the extremity of the young shoots , in twos or threes , according to the strength of the plant ; the calyx ( the green cup round the base of the flower ) is thick and prickly ; hence it is called the " Burr Rose . " Coccinea , and the beautiful dark variety JRubra , are in every particular the same , except the latter being darker in colour . Rubra Variegata , does not merit the variegated distinction ; the circumference of the flower is merely shaded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is of a purple-crimson colour , very large , with the growth and habit of all the former , except the calyx being destitute of the prickles so characteristic in the others . F'iolacea , has also a smooth calyx ; the flowers of a violet-purple colour , quite double . The plant is of upright growth , and quite luxuriant . The following varieties are all hybridized with other sorts , and do not form handsome plants for bushes or standards , but are well adapted for training to /z/ poles , columns , or trellising. *fllba Odorata , or the Double White Microphylla , grows very luxuriantly , frequently making shoots eight or ten feet long in one season ; and in warm soils , where the season extends from March to December , they will no doubt grow twenty feet . The flowers are very large and double , of a yellowish- white , very fragrant , and look beautiful among the dark green foliage . Hybrida , is also a strong grower , with double flowers of a rosy-purple colour . Luxembourg , appears to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character it greatly partakes ; the flowers are in clusters of a dull purple , very double , and a little fragrant . Maria Leonide has much of the Macartney Rose habit ; the foliage nearly round , quite dark green and shining , with a tinge of red on the young wood ; the flowers are sweet scented , of a creamy-white colour , with a delicate blush centre . There are several others classed among these , which , as far as known to us , are either entirely worthless , or are so like those described , that it is questioned if they are not the same ; this is not surprising , for we have grown many of them from seeds , and all were either entirely single , or so much like the parent , that they could not be distinguished from it ; with the exception of Rubra and Purpurea , which have originated with us . A pure white , bright scarlet , /z/ yellow , or striped variety , would be a great acquisition . We would therefore urge upon cultivators and amateurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results , till the object is accomplished . Lovers of the rose in the more northern states will find this family entirely too tender for out-door culture , unless surrounded with a quantity of dry leaves . They will not prosper if lifted every year from the ground and put away , as directed for Tea and Bengal roses ; but where a green-house , or even dry cellarage , is accessible , they will grow magnificently in large pots and tubs , making a superb ornamental plant for placing in summer in any conspicuous situation . /z/ THE Musk Cluster rose is an old inhabitant of our gardens . Botanists consider it a distinct species , and have named it from the peculiar and agreeable odour it exhales in the evening , and in the cool autumnal months , which is the season that it flowers most abundantly , in large clusters , of a yellowish-white colour . There are single , semi- /z/ double , and fully double varieties of it ; the latter is the variety generally cultivated . It is a native of India , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant the grand family of the Noisettes originated ; though it is more delicate than the generality of those plants , yet the same system of treatment recommended for them maybe adopted with the Musk Clusters . We have had several roses introduced to our notice , under the head of Musk Scented , but they have nearly all proved worthless , mere " cumberers of the ground . " However , a few deserve a passing remark before we close our descriptions of the rose . Pink Mask Cluster , has flowers of a pale pink colour , quite double , though the petals are rather loose ; the plant grows very strong , and partakes greatly of the Noisettes . Princesse de Nassau , is a pure Musk Rose , of a yellowish-white colour , very double , though not so profuse as some others . Ranunculus Musk Cluster , is a pure white , perfectly double ; so very much so , that it does not open well in moist weather ; the musky odour is not so strong in this as in the old variety . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or trellises . In the eastern states they must be well protected ill the winter season , covering their roots with a quantity of dry leaves . They delight in dry situations and rich soil . There is great room for im- /z/ provement in this group , and we call the attention of cultivators and amateurs to it , that they may yet bring to view flowers of more perfect character arid of more brilliant colours than any of the preceding , and even possessing , in a greater degree , the odour which appertains to the original species . It is true we have the Pink Musk Cluster , Red Musk Cluster , Frazerii , and some others , but as we have already said , they are worthless . /z/ FOR THE GHEENIIOUSE Oil ROOMS . A SELECTION , for this purpose , should be made from the Tea , Bengal , and Bourbon families , all on their own roots , or budded very low . Presuming that these roses are already in pots , or to be procured from the Nurserymen in the small* pot they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once be placed into those of six inches in diameter , carefully and freely watered , during /z/ July and August , cutting off all the flower buds they show in the latter month . About the middle of September , shorten the overgrown shoots , and thin out the slender ones , turn the plants out of the pots , depriving them of some of the soil , and repot in those of seven inches diameter , using a compost of sand , turfy loam , and manure in equal proportions ; they will also grow admirably in the black soil , from the woods , composed principally of decayed leaves ; put several pieces of broken crockery in the bottom of the pot , then a portion of soil ; place the plant so that its surface roots should be under the rim of the pot , and then fill all round with the soil ; put them in a situation partially shaded , water sparingly , till they begin to grow then expose them fully to the sun and water freely every day . There they may remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South till November , when they should be removed to the greenhouse or rooms , for flowering . Previous to their removal , the pots should be washed , and the plants neatly tied up . Thus treated they will mature all the buds they will then show , and produce a profusion of flowers again in January and February . Where there is the convenience of charcoal , it will be found of prime utility in rose pot-culture , broken to the size of nuts and about one-fifth mixed with the soil ; the roots will delight to ramble through it , /z/ and the foliage will be of a richer and darker green ; the surface of the soil must have frequent stirrings . The plants must be carefully examined , and whenever infested by the aphis , or green-fly , they should be destroyed , if in the greenhouse , by tobacco smoke . But , if in rooms , that method can not be well adopted , for the odour would penetrate into every part of the dwelling . They should in that case be brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan will be to make a strong tea of tobacco , fill a pail with it , and while in a tepid state invert the plant therein , holding the hand or a cloth over the surface of the pot to prevent the earth from tumbling out . Roses in pots are wonderfully benefited by a watering of manure water about once in two weeks . This water is very easily prepared either in town or country . The droppings from the horse or cow , stable put into a large tub or barrel , with water kept over it for a week or two , occasionally stirred up ; the water then poured or drawn off for use about the colour of good tea ; or one quart of POUDRETTE , put into three gallons of water stir it a few times , in two days it will be fit for use . A new species of manure from the Islands of the Pacific , called GUANO , the deposit of sea-fowls that has accumulated for centuries , is very valuable for making liquid manure . A quarter of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ before using , will be found very nourishing ; indeed one pound to sixteen gallons , will be strong enough to use by the inexperienced , for if used much stronger than I have stated , it would injure plants in pot culture . When required for the open ground , watering with any of these liquids may be made stronger , or used more frequently . /z/ THERE are several very destructive , and in some seasons their depredations almost overpower the operator . In the eastern states , the Slug nearly destroys every leaf . A remedy against its ravages , brought into notice by Mr. Haggerston , gardener to J. P. Gushing , Esq. , is to take two pounds of whale oil soap , dissolved in fifteen gallons of water , and to syringe the plants therewith in the evenings till the insects are destroyed . The plants must also be syringed with clean water in the mornings , or the cure would be almost as destructive and offensive* as the disease . After the plants are clean , stir up the soil to refresh it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed by tobacco water , applied with the syringe in the even- /z/ ing , and again with pure water in the morning . This insect is most troublesome in city gardens , where the birds can not feed upon it . The Rose Bug is another very destructive enemy , which can only be kept under by hand-picking ; they are found upon the flowers as soon as open . There is also the ivorm that destroys the bud before it opens . We seldom observe this in the country , but in some seasons it abounds in the city or town gardens , and must be extirpated by the hand . There is yet another ; a fly in the early part of June , deposits its egg near the surface of the ground , into a strong young shoot , and is riot discovered till July or August , when we see its effects from the dropping of the top of the young shoot . As soon as this is noticed , cut off about twelve inches of it , and the little grub will be found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out under a leaf , near the top , drop into the ground and live again to renew its depredations the following season . /z/ UNDER artificial culture , this disease is frequently observed ; or , as some writers term it the effects of /z/ the disease , very few agree as to its origin or character . From our observation it appears to be most common , where extremes of temperature prevail ; even in the open air this is plainly seen ; in July or August , we occasionally have a few cold nights , succeeded by rain and warm weather , and as certainly as that kind of weather occurs , as certainly does the mildew follow . It is rarely seen in our collection of roses , few of which are kept in high temperatures , and when it appears , a few syringes of sulphur water are applied , which destroys it . We prepare sulphur water , by placing in a small barrel a piece of unslacked lime , about the size of a double list , with five or six pounds of flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of boiling water , covering it up for an hour , when we stir it , till the whole of the sulphur has fallen to the bottom . After settling , we pour off the water for use , putting about a quart of it to the gallon for syringing . A recent writer says , he uses one ounce of nitre to one gallon of water , with which he syringes the plants once in ten days , and finds it an effectual cure . /z/ THESE may be propagated by budding , grafting , or layering , as directed for roses that bloom in June ; as we have before said , the latter method is preferable , and makes very permanent plants . They are also extensively propagated by cuttings , which is the plan that now calls for our special notice . There are two periods of the season , June and September , in which this mode can be adopted extensively and successfully , with the families of Bengal , Tea , Noisette , Bourbon , and Remontantes , Roses ; ( Perpetual succeed best by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the young shoots have shed their first flowers they will be in a proper state for use . The cuttings may be made from two to four inches long , having at least three joints or buds , from the lower end of which cut off the leaf and smooth the bottom end , with a sharp knife , directly under an eye , leaving the other leaves untouched ; the cuttings may then be inserted about one and a half or two inches into very sandy soil , either in pots or in the ground ; if in a frame , so much the better . Shade them from the sun during /z/ the day , and give them gentle sprinklings of water . They must also be protected from heavy drying winds , and fully exposed to the dews of the night , which are very genial to them . In about three or four weeks they will be rooted , and may either remain where planted till autumn , or be at once transplanted into pots , and placed in the shade till they have taken fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next season , and by extra culture may be made fine plants for blooming in the green-house during winter . Cuttings taken off in September , and planted in a very settled situation , will be well rooted in the following spring , and may then be transplanted into any part of the garden . The latter period will be the best for all the southern states , and the former for the eastern states . Indeed , cuttings can be taken off and may be propagated successfully , at any period of the season , when the plant has just ceased to bloom , which is the grand criterion for propagating the rose . In some soils , of a close sandy nature , all that is required is merely to put in a small piece of a shoot , in moist cloudy weather , where it is shaded from the direct rays of the sun , and it will root in a few weeks without any other care . Where there is the convenience of a forcing house , or hotbeds of manure , there is another period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propagated , which is practised to a very great extent by nurserymen who commence forcing roses in February . As soon as they show bloom the shoots are cut into cuttings of two eyes each , and planted into very small pots , of very sandy soil ; these are placed into a close warm hothouse , or hotbed , in a moist temperature of 70 to 80 , where they will root in from two to three weeks , and are frequently sold within six weeks from the time they were planted . The very scientific have resorted to another mode of multiplying , which , with many sorts , make strong plants in a very short time . They take the roots of common roses , that are about the size of a small quill , and cut them into lengths of two or three inches , whereon they graft a single eye from the youqg wood , ( by the method of whip grafting , ) plant them into pots , which they place into a close hotbed or house , as above stated , where they grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the time of planting . Single eyes are also planted up to the base of the leaf , partially covering the eye , in pots of fine sand , subjecting them to the same hotbed treatment ; these also root freely , but take some time before they make strong plants . When these tender cuttings are made they must be carefully shaded from the sun , and must be sprinkled with tepid water* every evening . When they have made a /z/ fresh growth they should be removed to another frame or house , with gentle heat , and have air every day to harden them ; in a week or two they will be fit for larger pots , to grow therein all the summer , or planted into the open ground in May . Amidst the lovely creation of the floral world , none combines so many attractions as the Rose , and we hope that our simple remarks on its propagation will enable all , who desire it , to increase any part of the family they happen to possess . If tried once , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewed , and an innocent pride indulged in increasing the power of ministering to one 's own taste , or of gratifying that of a friend . Many suffer a latent predilection for these fascinating pursuits to die away , from the idea of not possessing the skill requisite for cultivating plants ; others think of the expense they would be led into on an unwarrantable indulgence . If the more fortunate or more skilful amateur knows of such person , he will greatly promote both their mental and bodily welfare , by presenting them with a few plants of the easiest culture , to prove to them how easy it is , not only to nurture , but to multiply their sources of pleasure , as healthful as it is innocent . If any of our readers have a spark of this taste within them , we say cherish it as you would cherish a friend . To the ladies especially , a love /z/ of floriculture brings with it , in every period of life , a train of pure enjoyments . Whilst the city belle blushes her delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fair hand in the haunts of pleasure the face of the country maiden glows with still purer satisfaction as she presents to a parent the rose which her own care has brought to perfection . And the mother ! how many lessons of wisdom can she impart to her children whilst instilling into their young minds the love of this healthful pursuit , and teaching them to look up from the wonders spread around them , to Him who gave the rose its hue . To the time-stricken matron also , even after age has deprived her of the active enjoyments of this taste , many pleasures still remain ; under the shade of some far spreading tree she can , from her rustic seat , enjoy the sight of well planned arrangements , executed under her own superintendence , or surrounded by some favourite plants , inhale the fragrance which comes to her blended with sweet recollections of the pleasing toils which ensured their present luxuriance . But it is to those who have known sorrow and affliction ( and who has not ? ) that the love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shed its soothing influence upon the heart . In showering upon this earth such profusion of blossoms of every odour , /z/ God has permitted us to bask , as it were , in his visible smiles , and every Christian will love him better for loving the glowing proof of that goodness which disdains not to minister ' to every innocent pleasure of his creature man . We feel we . have perhaps digressed too far , but every lover of horticulture will understand how we have been led away ; and to others we can only , repeat , " Try to love flowers learn to cultivate them ; it will make you happier , it will make you better . "
