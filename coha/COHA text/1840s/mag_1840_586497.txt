txt IN a former Article , * by a brief historical review of the use of a paper currency in European countries , we placed before the reader such evidence as the experience of many countries affords , that such a currency has never , in any age or country , for any considerable period , formed a steady circulating medium ; that wherever either governments or mdi vi .. duals have had the power to create such a currency , it has been created in excess , and has resulted in a calamitous depreciation . We called the attention of the reader particularly to the fact that ultimate security of redemption will not preserve paper-money at par , unless it be immediately convertible into specie ; and that the promise of immediate convertibility , by any other banks than those of deposite , is fallacious and ineffectual . It was particularly intended in the former Article to fix attention upon the effects of an excess of currency , and to show that this condition has heretofore always attended the use of paper-money , except for short periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in the absence of the precious metals , the currency may be so inadequate to the wants of the community as to keep in circulation , for short periods , paper tokens wholly destitute of security or value . The reader who has accompanied us through that Article will , we think , be convinced that excess of issues is the great evil of paper-money ; and that it can not be safely used , no matter what basis it rests upon , except to a very limited extent not exceeding probably one-half the actual currency of any country . Neither perfect security of ultimate redemption , nor a pretended convertibility into specie on demand , has ever been sufficient to prevent depreciation . Public attention has been too much directed to these latter particulars as the means of reforming our paper circulation ; whereas , in fact , without an absolute and narrow limitation of the amount of issues , so that the * See Democratic Review , No .

The assignats of Russia were nominally convertible on demand into copper coin , and the credit of the Empire was pledged for their ultimate redemption . The bills of the banks of Vienna , Copenhagen , and Stockholm , purported to be payable on demand in specie . The public domain and the faith of the government were pledged for the redemption of the French assignats and mandats. the notes of the Bank of England are in fact secured by a pledge of the national wealth , as the capital of the bank is a part of the public debt . And in the United States , bank bills have generally professed to be payable in specie on demand , and in many instances their ultimate redemption has rested upon the most solid security . But in all these instances an excess of issues has hastened to great depreciation ; a result which can never be avoided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any promise to pay on demand , unless an equivalent amount of specie be held by the promiser . A mere promise to pay on demand , based , not on the actual ability to keep that promise , but on credit , and on a calculation of chances as to the demand being enforced , is not enough . Such a promise has been shown to be ineffectual repeatedly in England , several times in France , and times without number in Austria , Denmark , Sweden , Russia , and the United States . Before the establishment of the Bank of England no institution nad ventured to issue its bills , payable on demand , without possessing in its vaults the means of fulflhling the undeitaking . The Bank of England first made the experiment of loaning its credit , and of issuing promises to pay when it could not , by any possibility , redeem those promises . The promise is fallacious ; it is dishonest . The promiser knows it to be out of his power to fulfil it literally ; and the public perfectly well know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were an honest and faithful promise , based upon adequate means , the bills would never fall below par , for they would always in truth represent the same amount of specie ; but the inordinate cupidity of banks could not , on those conditions , be satisfied . Nor is mere security of ultimate redemption sufficient to keep papermoney at par . No credit security can be better than that of the Bank of England ; yet the notes of that Bank , as we have seen , were , within a very recent period , more than twenty-five per cent . below par . Hence real-estate banks have never been able to maintain the nominal value of their bills ; and the bills of the banks organized under the new law in the State of New York , though secured , beyond all question , by the pledge of State stocks , amid of bonds and mortgages at half estimates , are generally at a scale of depreciation belo*v the bills of the old banks . The post-notes of the Bank of the United States pay interest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted in so short a time // the whole amount of its capital ; yet these bonds have fallen eighteen per cent . below par . But a still stronger example may be shown in the bonds of the States , the ultimate security of which can be hardly called in question . Yet these bonds , paying six per cent . interest , have been sold as low as sixty-five cents on a dollar ! On the contrary , the wants of the community have sometimes given currency to a limited amount of paper-money which had neither ultimate security of payment nor convertibility . For the first eighteen years the paper-money issued by Catharine II . did not become depreciated ; it was needed for the purposes of barter , and the amount issued was within the hounds of that necessity . During a portion of the period in which the Bank of England suspended specie payments , its notes even bore a small premium , until by over-issues they were depreciated . The French assignats , after they assumed a form which had no security , and did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable time current at par , until they were issued beyond the wants of the public . So in the case of Law 's bank , after its promise to pay in the proper denomination was changed , its credit was not instantly impaired , but the bills continued current until they were issued in such profusion as to become valueless . And in the United States , in quiet times , when the currency is not redundant , a question seldom arises as to the real responsibility of a bank , or the amount of specie provided for the redemption of its bills . When the currency is crowded , and exchanges become adverse , the inquiry becomes very serious . In view of these facts , then , are we not right in expressing the opinion that public attention has been fixed too strongly on two points , to wit , ultimate security of redemption , and a fancied convertibility into specie , when in fact , for all practical purposes , the most important inquiry should be-what is the amount of issues ? So strongly have these views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone into the opposite extreme . Mr. Ricardo stated the theory , and it has been warmly espoused by Mr. McCulloch , that paper-money , made a le* , al tende* , and receivable for public dues , might be kept at par with gold and silver in any country , by the mere limitation of the amount issued , without any reference to its convertibility or security for its ultimate redemption. * The latter writer maintains that " it is not necessary , in order to sustain the value of such notes , that they should be payable at all ; the only thing which is required for that purpose is , that they should be limited in quantity . " The reasoning of these writers may be briefly thus stated : Every country has a certain number of exchanges to effect , and , so far as regards them , it is of no importance whether these are effected by a certain number of coins or by * Ricardo 's " Proposals for an Economical and Secure Currency , " published in 1817 . His Political Economy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nations ; vol . IV , p. 299 . Commercial Diutionary , p. 66. // an equal amount of paper-money . Notes are merely tickets or counters , used in computing values , as property is transferred from one individual to another . Their value depends wholly on the number in circulation , compared with the number of exc.hanges to be effected . If too large a proportion be issued , they sink below specie ; if too small amount , in proportion to the specie in circulation , their superior convenience will raise them to a small premium . The extensive circulation of valueless paper in the United States , in prosperous times , or when the currency is not redundant , seems to confirm these views . After the suspension of specie payments in May , 1837 , it is fresh in the memory of all that in the course of business almost every kind of certificate or piece of paper resembling a bank bill was freely circulated . Necessity required tokens ; specie could not be obtained , nor solvent bank bills ; and valueless tokens supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of any public calamity , becomes utterly worthless . Should the stability of the government be shaken , it would be mere waste paper . A French writer , of much vivacity , has compared Mr. Ricardo ' * paper currency to the mimic fortifications of the Chinese , and perhaps the illustration is better than any argument . " Admiral Anson. " be says , " in his voyage to China discovered that the fortifications placed along the river at Canton , and which were intended to inspire him with a respect for the power of the Chinese , although they presented an imposing appearance at a distance , were really made only of figured paper , and were mounted with nothing but cannons of pasteboard . " " The Chinese , " he continues , " have reasoned like Mr. Ricardo : the use of paper instead of copper for artillery supplies the place of a very expensive material by means of one more cheap ; and by exchanging all copper cannon for paper the entire value of the copper will be saved to the country . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " so long as pe* ce continued ; but on the first appearance of war or danger it would be seen that paper money and paper cannon would by no means equal the real metals they have displaced , and that public sccurity had been sacrificed to a mistaken economy. ** The convenience of a paper currency in large and distant transactions has never , we believe , been denied . But it appears to be established by the facts and reasonings which we have rapidly brought into view , that such a currency can not be permanently kept at par with gold and silver except on two conditions : first , that it be issued as a mere certificate actually representing an equal amount of specie deposited for its redemption ; second , if it depend at all on credit , the amount of issues must bear a very small proportion to the whole currency of a country , and must be absolutely and unrelaxingly limited at that point . The former condition deprives paper-money of the source of its chief profits , and is not likely to be soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nouveaux Prin ; D'Econ . Pout ; Vol. 11 , p. 106 , Ed . Paris , 1827. // ally to arrive . On the latter condition a moderate amount of paper currency may be safely used , if it be only possible to keep it down within such limits . Let us , then , with these principles in view , examine the question in a practical aspect , with reference to the United States . Our banks all promise to pay on demand ; and it would not be difficult to provide by the pledge of land or of State credit for the ultimate redemption of their bills . But both of these provisions , as experience has proved , are not enough to preserve a sound paper circulation . There is no limitation upon the amount of issues ; and , notwithstanding the checks above mentioned , we constantly see our currency expanding and contracting at short intervals , and these fluctuations are accompanied by commercial distress and manifold public injury , in a moral as well as economical point of view . It is vain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspension ; the interests of the banks become so closely interwoven with the interests of the community , that the enforcement of such penalties will ever be impossible . A remedy must be found which will guard against the recurrence of the evil , and we must look for relief to the natural laws of trade , which no positive legislation can safely attempt to control . No proposition can be established on stronger reasoning , a priori , than that if banking were thrown open to every member of the community , and each individual were allowed to issue his own notes without restraint , this branch of business , like every other , would regulate itself . But admitting this conclusion , it has , we fear , little practical value in the present condition of things ; for the community have so long been subjected to an artificial state , they have so long looked upon printed bank-notes as of more value than written promissory notes , and have been led into habits of confidence by the apparent secuvity thrown around the former by the magic of legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that before the illusion could be completely dissipated , and each individual could be brought to exercise an unprejudiced judgment upon the money he received , in the same way that he now does upon other articles of barter , a long course of fraud and deception would exhaust itself and losses , inconveniences , distrust , and hazard , might-it is not unlikely-drive the community back to the former evil system before proceeding through the troubles which would be incident to the introduction of a new one . Nor can we hope for the cooperation of twentysix legislatures in such a measure ; and a single State by adopting it would suffer the greatest inconveniences from the non-conformity of its neighbors , as has already been experienced in the attempt to suppress bills of a small denomination . We must , therefore , apply our remedies to the present conditio*-i of affairs ; and as the laws of trade have already been violated by positive legislation , we must resort to other legislation for the purpose of gradually restoring a healthy and natural condition . The great practical question then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States be restri*tcd within the limits necessary // to safety ? We do not ask , within what limits they can be used with advantage , for we do not regard them as attended with advantage in whatever proportions issued ; but taking the great existing pyramid of evil as it actually stands , the important practical question here considered is , how it may be modified and reduced within the limits of safety . One class of politicians will ans*ver-by a National Bank ; but th majority of the people are certainly not of this opinion ; for our history , . during the last half century , as well as European history , for four times that period , proves that a National Bank does not , in fact , secure that benefit . But if the people were convinced that such a bank would effect this object , they would still feel that the political dangers arising therefrom , through the strength conferred by it on the Federal Government , and above all the want of constitutional power in Congress to charter such a bank , are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages to be derived from it . Laying aside , then , the agency of a National Bank , what other restrictions can be invented for the limitation of paper issues ? Can the Federal Government assume the prerogative ? Clearly not , within its present delegated powers , as hitherto exercised . The right to authorize sacorporated banks to issue paper-money , which has so long been assumed by the State Legislatures , although it has in fact amounted to an usurpation of a prerogative conferred on the Federal Government by the Constitution* could not at present be controlled by Congress , without the express assent of the States . If the States would refrain from the further exercise of this power ; if they would give life to that dead clause of the Constitution which was doubtless designed to authorize Congress to regulate the currencv ,  --  the framers of that instrument being under the idea that gold end silver would constitute the currency of the country ,  --  and would consent not to tamper with the interests of the Union by local legislation on this subject of general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most direct and efficient . Convenience requires , and the Constitution provides , that the standard of metallic currency shall be kept uniform by the Federal Government , and an equal control over the substitutes actually used for specie would be no improper power to be vested in the same government . But this result must be produced , if it ever be , by a conviction of the public mind , the first seeds of which are practical measure at as yet scarcely sown . As a - , the present moment , we fear it is hardly to be taken into consideration . Can it be expected that the several States will unite in any common measure for restricting pa per issues ? Great di*culties would arise in attempting such conjoint lecislation . Who would determine the proper limit of issues ? In what proportion should those issues be distributed among the States ?

We think they may . We are not the advocates of a purely metallic currency , in the perverse sense which is ascribed to us by the advocates of the Credit System . We do not contend for the destruction of credit , or that in every act of commerce or barter , the difference or value of the property exchanged or sold , should be paid at the time in gold and silver . Credit and confidence will alxvays exist and perform important functions in every civilized community ; and a more groundless calumny was never uttered than that which charges on the advocates of a sound currency a design to destroy credit and confidence . Promissory notes , bills of exchange , drafts , checks , and all the various fertile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended or adjusted , or money transmitted or represented , will always be a part of the machinery of trade , and will largely mingle with every branch of business in all civilized communities . But these contracts or substitutes should always have reference to some unvarying standard . That standard our Constitution has made to be gold and silver . Tbis constitutional standard it has been the effbrt of the self-styled " friends of the Credit System " to banish and debase , and the Democracy have simply been struggling to maintain and restore it . Its preservation is essential to the preservation of national honor and faith , as well as of private integrity . Destroy it , and the right of property is destroyed ; all wealth becomes illusory and of uncertain value . Destroy it , and every motive for honest industry is removed . The upright man is confounded with the knave ; the honest dealer with the cheat .

For this standard the Administration , speaking the feelings of the people , are strongly contending ; while the Opposition with equal eagerness are attempting to effect its prostration . They are the friends of perpetual credit instead of payment , of paper instead of specie , of promises and devices instead of fulfilments . They would absorb all the wealth of the country to themselves , and have the rightful owners content with their paper promises to refund it on demand . They would have the States become the mortgagers of the public reven ues and domains* would draw , upon a pledge of the public faith , the luxuries of Europe to our shores for the gratification of their own extravaoanf tastes or of their a present short-sighted commercial avarice ; and would provide no resources to protect public credit from disgrace and secure the foreign creditor from being defrauded . Gold and silver they would banish . if possible , beyond the seas , and would send after it our very lands and the riches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exportation. in place of these substantial // riches they would give us stocks , post-notes and bank bills , payable in other promises to pay , and would forever banish all real money from the affairs of their improved community . These are the real agrarians , the true levellers , albeit disguised under the tinsel of the " Credit System . " These men , who , by destroying the standard of the currency , and banishing the only real test of value , set afloat the prices of labor , of land and of commodities , inflate the community with artificial wealth , palm off a baseless substitute in the place of money , and press their desperate and hollow theories , until the obligations of all contracts become futile , and men can neither know the value of that which they may appear to possess , nor the worth of that which necessity compels them to purchase .

The " Credit System* ' man is for a fallacy , a fraud , a lying promise , a shadow of real money . He dreads the cash standard . Its plain and unvarying marks and weights confine him to honesty and fairness . When he receives he must pay-which is no part of his intention . When he promises it compels him to fulfil-xvhich is the farthest possible from his real views . It cuts off the mystery of the broker , the banker and the moneychanger ; the magical transmutation of rags into wea th can not be effected in its presence . Stock companies , post-notes , ktes , memorandums , interest accounts , commissions , salaries , and all the dark inquisitions of the bank director 's parlor ; the intrigues , impo itions , frauds , extortions , double-dealing and favoritism of the " Credit System , " vanish before the bright face of the golden en0 le ; and misguided , oblique ingenuity can no longer over-reach the bluntest honesty . Honor to that far-sighted and firm statesman who was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the halls of the Capitol , against the corrupt paper-money system , and in favor of the stern specie standard ! To the circulation , diffusion and adoption of the prin iples of Mr. Benton , we look for relief from our present evils . Public opinion , in the absence of positive legislation , must curtail and restrict our paper issues . It must act upon legislatures , and first exterminate all bills of a small denomination . This is the first point of attack , the only immediate palliative which there seems any hope of applying . If legislation force paper money into use , legislation must be used to render that money as innocuous as possible . This is not a new restriction of free choice or action on the part of the community ; it is merely lopping off one branch of a more extensive and long established restriction . The restraint upon natural right takes its origin from that legislation which confines the right to use credit , in the shape of bills , to a favored few ; and to require those bills to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and silver , is but an abrogation of part of the original monopoly . If we had no paper-money under the denomination of one hundred dollars , the vacuum would be immediately supplied by gold and silver . By this means a large amount of specie would be introduced and diffused , and paper issues // would be exceedingly restricted . Bank bills would be confined to the uses of commerce in its larger transactions , like other evidences of debt . All that commerce required would be issued , and no doubt an excess would sometimes be put in motion . But the effects would be far less disastrous than our present fluctuations . If two hundred millions of dollars , in gold and silver , were dh used through the circulation of the country , we could bear the exportation of twenty millions with comparatively little inconvenience . The consequent curtailment of paper would chiefly affect commerce . so that the inconvenience would chiefly alight where it ought in justice to alight , upon those whose imprudence produces the evil ; and would not as at present be shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the farmer and laborer . With a paper currency never rising beyond half the amount of currency required by the business of the country , and the remainder of gold and silver , fluctuations of five or ten millions in the latter might not seriously affect the former , but would only produce those necessary a rid legitimate results which flow from the inevitable variations of foreign exchange . lATe hope the Democracy will keep constantly up to this standard , maugre the clamors of the money-changers , speculators , and bankers . Let the war upon small bills be unflinching , persevei-ing , exterminating ! We must look chiefly to the State Legislatures for this relief ; but the Federal Government niay aid much in the struggle . The Independent Treasury Bill bears strongly in favor of the specie standard , and although probably of no very potent effect itself ; will be , we trust , hut the precursor of the gradual extension of the same policy throughout all of the States . The rejection of paper-money in government transactions is of the first importance . Such measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious encouragement to the friends of an honest and substantial currency . The suppression of small hills is not merely a remedial measure for the currency ; it is a step towards the reformation of public morals . The notorious " Credit System " stops not at the point of substituting papermoney for gold and silver . It aims to postpone , evade , and defeat all real payments . Its theory is , that one credit may he substituted for another to an indefinite extmnt , and that the day of actual payment may be postponed for ever . Gold and silver , land , merchandize , houses , public property , canals and rail-roads , may , upon its principles , be sold or pledged , and the proceeds forthwith applird in luxury and enjoyment , and their places be represented by bank notes bonds and mortgages , and State stocks , upon the exchange and barter of which the community can thrive and grow richer and richer until the end of time . I-low different is the true principle of honest cash payments ; of giving value for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honesty , good faith and integrity , instead of obliquity , fraud and evasion ! Our readers we trust will have patience while we probe this matter * little further . Its full exposition is of vital importance at this crisis . // In this country the word " money , " ought not in strict propriety to be ever applied to bank bills . IVioney means the legal tender of the country . Bank bills are a mere substitute for money . Money is that which by the law of the land may be used in the payment of debts . By the Constitution of the United States , gold and silver only can effect that end , and they alone are money . La barter , which in an extended sense embraces all commerce , where the articles exchanged do not equal each other in value fractional differences must be adjusted in money . That which finally adjusts these differences and pays them , is money . Bank bills have insidiously usurped this function , and have practically violated the Constitution . They have in fact and in practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usage , become a legal tender in the payment of debts ; and if not objected to expressly at the time of presentation , the tender of bank bills is a legal tender of payment . But in fact they are only substitutions of one credit for another , and it is quite time that they should be stripped of their assumed and illegal character of money . If any number of persons had only one direct transaction , each with the other , there would be no bank notes , or bills of exchange , or other representations of money . But where a series of transactions is contemplated , the balance of any particular barter is not paid in money at the time , because it is expected that some future direct or indirect transaction will extinguish or modify that balance . A token or evidence of the balance is passed or made by the parties , and that token or evidence may be either a charge in account , a promissory note , a bill of exchange , or a bank bill . These are all contrivances to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct to call either of them money . They are no more money than the ticket brought home by the cook from the family grocer , or the tally-stick which the servant carries daily to the baker , and which serves to adjust his account at the end of the week . And bank bills have no more of the intrinsic qualities of money , than book debts or the tally-stick ; they are more convenient and perfect tokens , hut they are only tokens of indebtedness . Bool debts are not readily available except between the immediate parties ; they must be specially assigned to third parties . Bank bills have a convenience of denomination and form which enables them to be used as the token of money due in many successive transactions , without any actual payment . Promissory notes and bills of exchange hold an intermediate place , in point of convenience , between book debts and bank notes , being more convenient for transfer than the former , and less so than the latter . But it is said that bank hills are payable in specie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this is a fallacy . The book debt , the promissory note , and the bill of exchange are as much payable in gold and silver as the bank bill . No legislative power in the United States can make them otherwise . The holder of either of the former class of securities is as much entitled to have them paid in specie as is the bolder of a bank bill . The latter is more convenient in its properties and form , being payable to bearer , and requir // ing no endorsement in its transfer . But its nature is the same with that of other obligations , and it is no more convertible into specie . A book debt or a promissory note can only be discharged in gold and silver , if the holder require it ; and if it be not convertible into gold and silver , it is good for nothing except the nominal value of the paper . And this is also true of the bank bill . It is not money in any sense which will not equally apply to book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not its nature or the tenor of its obligation , makes it more convenient for transfer . It is a mere evidence of debt , and if not convertible into money , is worth nothing . An outlawed account current is as valuable as the note of a bank which is not convertible into specie on demand . It is desirable to disabuse the public mind on this subject , and to bring back all the evidences of debt , or acknowledgments of money due , whether book accounts , checks , bills of exchange , promissory notes or bank notes* into one distinct class , and to separate that class entirely from the idea of money . If a horse worth one hundred dollars be exchanged for another worth fifty , and fifty dollars in money be paid at the time of the exchange , the transaction is closed . It is an instance of money adjusting a balance where the articles exchanged do not exactly meet in value . If instead of the fifty dollars in money , a carriage worth fifty dollars be given , it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . If instead of the carriage . the fifty dollars be charged in account , the parties expecting to have further transactions , credit begins to intervene , and the transaction is not closed . The char*re in account is an evidence of money due . If instead of the charge in account current , a promissory note or bill of exchange be given , it is still an evidence of debt , more convenient for transfer than the charge in account , but credit is still an element in the transaction , and the balance is not paid in money . If instead of a promissory note or bill of exchange , a bank note be given , we have still a substitute for money ; a more convenient and available evidence of debt than either the account current or promissory note , but yet not a legal and actual payment of the balance . It differs not in its nature from either of the former evidences of debt ; it is in a more convenient form , but possesses the same qualities , performs the same functions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not money in any legitimate meaning of that word ; it is merely a representative of money ; an invention to delay and avoid the actual use of money . If this distinction be not correct , no line of distinction can be drawn between money and its substitutes , between cash and credit , between actual payment and an exchange of debts . Shall it be said that because bank notes are easily transferable and pass through many hands before they are converted into specie , they are , therefore , money ? Then it must be not on account of their nature , but their superior convenience . But many banker 's checks or drafts would pass as readily and remain as long in circulation as bank notes , if they were issued with equal formality , and made payable on demand . Does the fact that one evidence of debt is payable on demand , and the other is not payable on de // mand , make the former money ? Then accounts current , when the course of trade has not established a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , become money . The law , by giving days of grace on all notes but bank notes , and by forbidding individuals to issue notes payable on demand like bank notes , has prohibited all but the favored monopolists from putting their evidences of debt in a convenient form for easy use , and this interposition of the law , against natural right and the principles of free commerce , has conferred on bank notes an exclusive advantage , making them generally available instead of actual money . The consequence has been that these representatives of money have superseded and postponed the actual payment of the balances or differences in barter , to so great an extent that the adjustment of those balances in the legal tender has become embarrassing and indeed impossible . It is very desirable that this excessive substitution of credit for payment-of the representatives of money for money itself-should not continue to be so extensive and universal , and especially that it should not be allowed to enter into small transactions between parties who have no regular commercial intercourse . In other words , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should in general be actually paid , and that money be used for that purpose instead of any substitute . Hence may be derived a strong argument for the suppression of bills of a small denomination . These bills irresistibly supplant specie of the same denomination , and lead to the perpetual substitution of credit in the place of money . They should be banished from circulation , and the legal money of the country should be introduced in their stead , and made to perform its proper functions . We have for many years , in fact , had no actual payments ; the whole course of business has been the mere substitution or exchange of one credit for another ; and these credits have thus accumulated to so vast an extent , that any attempt to enforce payment bas resulted in extensive bankruptcy . It appears to have *vholly escaped our memory , that every man by the law of the land is bound to pay his debts in gold and silver , and not in the debts of other men , and that be is entitled to demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive a fresh credit in the place of an old one , and the demand of actual payment , even from banks , has come to be regarded as oppressive and odious . Even the banks which so plausibly promise to pay specie for their bills , hesitate not to visit with their indignation and vengeance the creditor who presumes very civilly to ask for a fulfilment of that promise . No merchant who has a bank account dares to demand specie for the bills they pay out to him ; he will sooner pay a premium to the broker for gold and silver than in*ur the hostility of the tyrannical incorporation which holds thousands of dollars to his credit in deposit . The banks , those lordling debtors to the whole world , have assumed a bold control over their timid and abject creditors ; they have virtually abrogated the constitutional provision against an illegal tender ; they have // impudently promised to pay on demand so long as they can , by their combined authority , prevent that demand from being enforced ; and the moment this prevention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , discarded all sense of moral obligation , and sheltered themselves behind legislative indulgences , extorted from the fears and distresses of the community , or purchased from corrupt representatives . The community must be brought back to a system of real payments . They must learn to distinguish money from false tokens . All ordinary transactions must be adjusted in something else than mere substituted credit . The banks must he taught obedience to the laws , and be so curtailed of power as no longer to terrify their creditors . They must be prevented from infusing their pernicious and deceptive tokens and promises into the various and innumerable transactions of the industrious classes . Their operations must be restricted to the larger transactions of commerce , and a sound currency of gold and silver must supplant at least one-half of the worthless paper trash which now constitutes the sole medium of exchange and barter . Until this he effected there can he no stability in commerce , nor in any department of industry and trade .

Public morals and national bood faith will continue to be degraded and impaired ; and the distribution of wealth will eventually become as unequal , in this association of republics , as it is in the most aristocratical and consolidated empires of Europe . Within these limits we boldly take our stand as the advocates of a prompt return to a purely metallic currency ; a currency which , by the provisions of the Federal Constitution , may be legally tendered in the payment of debts . And it is , in fact , against this provision of the Constitution that the noisy advocates of the " Credit System , ' the bankers , , speculators and money-changers , are struggling , under various pmtences and disguises . They ridicule the proposition of a specie currency . They pretend that cash payments will destroy commerce . They demand paper promises to the exclusion of gold and silver , and would compel us to receive for payment in all transactions that which is no payment , by the express provision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their real ends that they aim to confound the proper meaning and use of the word money . They manufacture and diffuse bank notes , which they dignify with the name of money , for the express purpose of excluding all real money , and thus constrain the community , in the absence of the precious metals , either to forego all barter and commerce , or to accept in exchange for substantial value a token which the Constitution does not recognize as payment . Thus , by the force of public legislation , indirect indeed , but repugnant in spirit to the Constitution , the community is placed under the necessity of receiving into universal use a paper substitute for money , which , by dint of losses , counterfeits , depreciation , failures and refusals to pay , lead // directly to the amassing of great estates by the privileged few at the expense of the sufferiag mass of the people . It is our wish to arouse the community against this conspir*cy ; to induce them firmly to take their stand in favor of real payments , real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement towards this desirable end , as we have already endeavored to show , is the suppression of all bank notes of a small denomination . We would proceed slowly and gradually , but steadily , and with firmness . We would not stop at the denomination of five dollars , or ten dollars , or twenty dollars . We would proceed , before stopping , at least as far as the example presented by France . Three-fourths of the actual money in use would thus , in all probability , be gold and silver , and the large bills of the banks would still afford every needful aid to the heavy transactions of commerce The fluctuations arising from foreign trade could then be easily adjusted out of the mass of the specie in the country , and we should escape those ruinous convulsions , panics , and suspensions , which have so frequently , within the last few years , wasted the accumulations of our industrious population . and exhausted the vast resources of our natural wealth . An absolute limitation of the amount of paper issues must , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of power in the Federal Government to effect this limitation , the next most efficient and practical measure is the suppression of bank notes of a small denomination by the Legislatures of the several States . The ground would then lie open for the safe and practical introduction of the true principle , which should govern this as every other branch of the business concerns of the country  --  the principle of absolute , unrestricted , universal freedom . We would even most cheerfully consent to its immediate introduction , were the public mind at all prepared for its reception ; satisfied that even the preliminary suffering which its first operation might probably cause , before the evil of paper currency should work out its own perfect cure by being left perfectly free to exhaust and destroy itself would fall far short in amount of that which we must still for a long period continue to endure before reaching the end of the same reform by the opposite process here indicated .

The public opinion is not now very far from the state of maturity requisite for the suppression of the smaller denominations of paper-money . This will be a great step , an immense good ; and we will not throw away its substantial benefit , in an impracticable pursuit after the shadow of a preferred theory , for the ultimate adoption of which the former will serve as an eflictive and necessary preparative.
