Hoffman , Charles Fenno , 1806-1884 : Love 's Requiem , from Love 's Requiem 1848 The crag - the steed - the bounding skiff ! Who fashioned out her spirit high To light them all with beauty ? if The foot - the form - the speaking eye , Belong not first to him who sees Them through all natures sympathies ? Who made her noble - fair - and free Of soaring thought ? if not for me ? For me - born but those plumes to grasp Which wing her mind , of bright unrest , And nerve them in affection 's clasp For flight unerring and all blest ! Bride of my soul ! am I so changed Since parting in some other sphere The fields of air our spirits ranged To meet again , half knowing here , Who filled thy soul with tenderness Some hungry soul like mine to bless ? Who sent me here on hollow quest If by my coming thou'rt unblest ? Leaving thee , rich in love , undone , A half a soul , on earth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as rich in love , come hither ! Alas ! I climb the crag no more - My failing steed is weak of limb - My boat lies broken on the shore - My spirit-vision waxeth dim - The foot - the eye - the form divine Must gladden other paths than mine The heart , with love for all Gods things , Claim fresher spirit 's ministerings - While I - a waif upon the strand Tossed from the current of life 's river - See the bright flower that mocks my hand Go by forever ; and forever !
