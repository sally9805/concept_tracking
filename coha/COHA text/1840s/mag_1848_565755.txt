txt It is an art , moreover , of the highest moral value . All true art , indeed , embodies a moral sentiment or idea . The inner life and spirit in every true aesthetic work , in every true aesthetic object or scene , is this moral idea which inhabits and animates it . But landscape is of all arts the most expressive of moral truth . Even the unthinking child feels its elevating , grace.inspirmg influence . The unfolding spirit under the constant power of expressive landscape , will mould itself into the forms of beauty and grace which are ever impressed upon it . Abstract rule , cold precept , arbitrary authority , necessary as they are , will yet yield , in power to form to virtuous sentiment , to the force of winning , subduing landscape , ever teaching , yet never obtruding , never irritating , drawing , not driving to the love and practice of what is pure and graceful and lovely .

If this be true in the delineation of the outer and material form , bow much more true // is it of all attempts to portray the female mind and heart ! If the words and ways , the style of thinking and the modes of acting , all that goes to make up biography , have a character sufficiently marked to individualize the subject , there is danger that , in the relating , she may seem to have overstepped the decoruin of her sex , and so forfeit the interest with which only true delicacy can invest the woman . It is strange that biography should ever succeed . To reproduce anything that was transient and is cone , not by repetition as in a strain of music , but by delineating the emotions it caused , is an achievement of high art . An added shade of coloring sbows you an enthusiast , and loses you the confidence and sympathy of your cooler listener . A shade subtracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in your own faded picture , and of course can not command that of another . Even an exact delineation , while it may convey accurately a part of the idea of a character , is not capable of transmitting the more volatile and subtle shades . You may mix your colors never so cunningly , and copy never so minutely every fold of every petal of the rose , and hang it so gracefully on its stem as to present its very port and bearin * , but where is its fragrance , its exquisite texture , and the dewy freshness which was its crowning grace ? So in biography , you may make an accurate and ample statement of facts ,  --  you may even join together in a brightly colored mosaic the fairest impressions that can be given of the mind of another-his own recorded thoughts and feelings-and yet they may fail to present the individual . They are stiff and glaring , wanting the softening transition of the intermediate parts and of attending circumstances . And yet biography does sometimes succeed , not merely in rais @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the friends of the departed the outlines of a character bright in their remembrance ; but in shaping forth to others a life-like semblunce of something good and fair , and distinct enough to live with us thenceforward , and be loved like a friend , though it be but a shadow . Such has been the feeling with which we have read and re-read the volume before us . We knew hut slightly her who is the subject of it , and are indebted to the memoir for anything like a conception of the character ; conseqa ntly , we can better judge of its probable effect upon other minds . XVe pronounce it a port* it successfully taken-a piece of uncommonly skillful biography . There is no gaudy exaggerations in it , no stiffness , no incompleteness . We see the individual character we are invited to see , and in contemplating it , we have all atong a feeling of personal acquisition . We have found rare treasure ; a true woman to be admired , a daughter whose worth surpasses estimation , a friend to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian to be admired and rejoiced over , and a self-sacrificing missionary to be held in reverential remembrance . Unlike most that is written to commemorate the dead , or that unveils the recesses of the human heart , this is a cheerful book . It breathes throughout the air of a spring morning . As we read it we inhale something as pure and fragrant as the wafted odor of " - old cherry-tree . Sheeted with blossoms . " We stand beneath a serene unclouded sky , and all around us is floating music as enlivening as the song of birds , yet solemn as the strains of the sanctuary . It is that of a life in unison from its childhood to its close ; rising indeed like " an unbroken hymn of praise to God . " // There is no austerity in its piety , no levity in its gladness . It shows that " virtue in herself is lovely , " but if " goodness " is ever awful , " it is not here in the company of this young happy Christian heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tendency to restrict the intellectual growth of lit e young , and to mar its grace and freedom . We have been told that it was not well that our sons and daughters should commit to memory texts and catechisms , lest the free play of their fancy should be checked , and they be rendered mechanical and constrained in their demeanor , and dwarfish in their intellectual stature . We see nothing of this exemplified in this memoir . One may look long to find an instance of more lady-like and graceful accomplishment , of more true refinement , of more liberal and varied cultivation , of more thorough mental discipline , of more pliable and available information , of a more winning and wise adaptation to persons and times and places , than the one presented in these pages . And yet this fair flower grew in a cleft of rugged Calvinism ; the gales which fanned it were of that " wind of doctrine " called rigid orthodoxy . We know the soil in which it had its root . We know the spirit of the teachings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that pulpit still linger in our ears , familiar as those of that good old bell , * and we are sure that there isno pulpit in all New England more uncompromising in its demands , more strictly and severely searching in its doctrines . But let us look more closely at the events of this history of a life , arid note their effect in passing , upon the character of its subject . Mary , daughter of the Rev. Dr. Ilawes , of Hartford , Conn. , was born in 1821 . The death of a sister a little older , and of two brothers younger than herself , left her the only daughter , and for some time the only child of the family . 1-Icr father says of her " It is a very pleasant remembrance to her parents , that from her earliest years she was a peculiarly affectionate and dutiful child . Her tender mind opened itself in docility and love ; and like a fresh flower of spring , shed forth the fragrance of its affections upon all around . To know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to engage a prompt and cheerful obedience . She was early tau5ht that she was a sinner , and needed the renewing grace of God to fit her for his service and kingdom ; and from the time she was eight years of age , she was the subject of more than usually deep religious impressions . She felt that her heart was not right with God ; that she needed what every human being , however young , and however amiable , needs , a new heart to be given her by the Holy Spirit . " On entering her tenth year , there was a marked change in her feelings . The scene was one never to be forgotten , either by herself or her parents . It was noticed , that , for some days , her mind was the subject of intense anti serious thought . Occasionally the unbidden tear would be seen trembling in the eye , or * " Our new and deep-toned bell rings this day for the first time , calling us to that church we love so well . I shall love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my childhood . That good old hell ! connected as it was with so many of the happiest seasons of my life-whose tones were the familiar ones of my earliest moments ; could I help loving it ? My father says , I shall not hear that bell in Smyrna . No , its tones will not reach me there . There will come a time , when I shall no more go up to that sanctuary , which has been my Sabbath home from toy earliest years ; when I shall no more join in its holy services . But 1 am not cast down ; through roy tears , I can look to a more glorious temple above , where God and the Lamb forever dwell . No , no ; this dear place of worship , that has nurtured many plants of piety , will be called mine no more , when I depart front the home of my youth ; but if I humbly walk in the ways of piety , and lean upon Jesus for strength , may I not hope that he will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and faithful in his service , and that he will cause the truths which I have here heard , to spring up in my heart , and bear fruit forever . ' - p. 147. 346 // stealing down the cheek , till , one evenhaving spent some time in retirement she was heard singing in a low , sweet voice , when on opening the door of her room , her delightful exclamation was , Oh , I am so happy ; I have found God ; I am so happy ; I can pray now . ' She had knelt , as at other times , with a burdened heart , and under a sense of separation from God , and he had met her and had blessed her . To use her own language ; it seemed like speaking to a dear , kind friend ; God seemed near to me ; and I felt that he heard me . ' From that time she gave us every pleasant evidence of being a child of God . Her youthful piety did not , as it often does , pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of celestial origin . It was rooted deep in the heart , and it grew and brought forth increasing fruit to God till the end of her life-pp. 361 , 362 . The following scene , which belongs to this period , or a little earlier in her childhood , has hardly a parallel for beauty and true pathos . " A little previous to the death of this brother , an incident occurred which drew out her strong powers of sympathy , and very strikingly illustrated her forgetfulness of self ; when she saw others in affliction , and also her very felicitous manner of imparting consolation . The disease had assumed a very alarming form , and the little sufferer was rent with convulsions , which it required no ordinary share of fortitude only to witness . The poor father , unable longer to endure the sight , turned away from the bed , arid sought his room . Mary followed him . He threw himself upon the sofa , exclaiming , I ca n't bear it , I ca n't bear it ; ' and he seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had already been bereaved of three children , and now a fourth was about to be taken , and in a very distressing manner . He again exclaimed , The hand of God is upon me ; I do n't know but I am to be written childless . ' Mary drew her seat closer to his , and laying her hand gently on his knee to gain his attention , she looked up in his face and said , Fattier , you told us thiat God always had a good reeson for every thing he did . And has lie not a good reason now ? and is it not right for him to make my little brother suffer so ? ' Finding her arguments unavailing as she supposed , to soothe him , hecause that now he wept more freely , she took down from the shelf a hymn-book , and opening it , said , Dear father , let me comfort you , let me read a hymn to ycu , shall I ? ' The father 's heart was too full to speak , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peace , t is the Lord Jehovah 's hand ' - When she came to the verse , Fair garlands of immortal bliss He weaves for every brow , And shall rebellious passions rise When he corrects us now ? ' Her countenance shone as if a beam from heaven had shed its light there , and her voice and manner were such as seemed better befitting an angel than a frail child . A relative of the family had followed Mary and her father to the study , and had been a silent , but almost unnoticed observer of the whole ; so absorbed was the father in his grief , and Mary in her attempts to soothe him . She said the scene was more touching , on account of the state of Mary at the time , who having just risen from a sick bed , was still weak and pale . She seemed also to be overwhelmed with the consciousness of her little brother 's sufferings , to whom she was tenderly attached , and to feel that she must not now lay her bursting heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and support himself . In the trying emergency , she looked away from human sympathy , and son *lit in God something which might meet the painful circumstances of the case ; and she thus , meekly , though unintentionally , taught a lesson of submission to his perfect will . " Her father , in speaking of it afterwards , remarked , that he had never before been so dealt with ; ' that she talked like an experienced Christian . - pp. 20-22 . Following her course as she ad* vanced in youth , we are no where surprised at the development of any remarkable powers of mind . She was prayerful and conscientious , diligent in acquiring know ledge , enthusiastic in her love of nature , evincing in everything a refined and feminine taste , and a quick perception of the beautiful in art , in literature , and in morals . But the charm of her character lay in her warmth of heart . Love was the element in which she lived . She loved God-she loved her parentsshe loved her companions-she loved every body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exalted by the influences of true piety . She seems never to have known what it was to be repelled by a sense of weakness or unworthiness in another , or to have had any 1848. 347 // of those dislikes and distastes and unchristian aversions , which keep so many of us apart . She had no need to " unlearn contempt . " This was partly the result of natural temperament , but not all . Such love is a Christian grace . He that " hath " it , has it because he " dwelleth in God and God in him . " It is the charity which Paul inculcated ; that which " thinketh no evil , " which " hopeth " and " believeth all things . " It has its root in humility ; it grows only by the uprooting of self . He who would cultivate it , must follow the injunction to " let nothing be done through strife or vain.glory , but in lowliness of heart esteem others better than himself . " As Jesus took a little child and set him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we place this young Christian woman in the assemblies of some who are " called of men , Rabbi , Rabbi , " that they may learn from her " which be the first principles " of the Christian life . But let no one suppose that there was any weakness or want of just discrimination in the subject of this memoir . It is true that the gentler elements predominated in her character , and her father probably knew what she needed , when he gave her the playful advice to " have more of Cato . " Without Christian principle , she might have been a victim of morbid sensitiveness , or ever at the mercy of fluctuating impulses ; but religion supplied the tonic she needed , and by the grace of God , aiding her own efforts , we see her possessed of firmness of purpose and moral courage enough to rebuke many of us who are made of sterner stuff . Mary ( we borrow the pleasant name by which her mother calls her , ) seems to have passed through two eras in her mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social nature . She speaks of a winter passed in the family of the Rev. Dr. Fitch of New Haven , under the immediate influence of his lamented lady , as one in which she seemed to have lived a lifetime , so many new thoughts and feelings had been awakened , and her views of life were all so changed . The folded bud , fully prepared , was brought into a peculiarly favorable position , and burst at once into full flower . The other was an equally marked advancement of her religious views during the revival of 1841 in Hartford . This was no transient impulse , but continued to brighten with new luster the remainder of her course . To illustrate this change , we place the following extract from a letter to an intimate friend , beside some passages taken from her subsequent journal and letters " Dear C. , the foundations of say soul , seem all breaking away . I never felt so entirely adrift in the universe , without compass or anchor , as I do at present . All that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shrink from the year , as bringing only new helplessness at a time when I need all my energies . Forgive me , my dear friend , for troubling you with these things . A letter on the eve of another great period which marks off the time of frail , perishing mortals , should be full of hope-of encouraae. ment ; and forgetting the past , should look towards the glorious future-the coining existence , when the strife with evil shall have ended . But thus I am little able to write now . The few long . in*s I have ever had for the strife , seem all quenched . If 1 thought this state of mind was to last , I should 1 ) 0 miserable . I a Perhaps have fallen into some *lou*h of despond , ' but if so , it must be a very different one from Christians , for there appears no helping hand . I am not jesting , my dear C. , neither am I indulging myself in a melancholy dream ; but a conviction of what I am , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so weighed upon me lately , as to drive almost every thing else froyn my mind . Do you know what I can do ? If you have any talisman to still the unquiet beatines of my heart , send it to me I pray you . " Why am i so selfish as to write thus to you ? I m sure I did not sit down to the unmerciful task of making you acquainted with my utter destitution , but it was with the laudable intention of wishing you a happy new year , ' - happy in the consciousness of a daily increase in all that is worthy of an immortal and re // deemed soul . 0 , my friend , press on that glorious path with renewed ardor . Our Savior has marked the way , and will ever be near , to guide and strengthen , and to bring you safe to the hills of light . I dare not think of those everlasting hills .

Evil habits so fixed in the deepest recesses of the heart - love of the world , with its poor perishing trifles , dragging the spirit down to earth . Will they drag it down forever ? Can no one break the strong fetters ? But this does not sound very much like the words of a believer in all the promises so glorious and precious , written on every page of God 's holy word . The very fact thit I im a believer in them , makes me still *sdder , for if I believed rightly , I should have no more discouragement5 op 67 68 .

It seems to us now , as though we can never go back t ( i the troubled streams of this world , having tasted of the streams which flow from the throne of God and the Lamb-pp. 7-2 , 73 . " Never did I feel my heart iCOn in joy as it does this morning . Oh , M. , is it not eleliglitful to live in the service of so good a being as our reconciled Father in Christ ?

If the few scattering joys which have entered our benighted hearts here , make us so happy , what must the full glory of that life be , where no sin can obstruct the gushings of peace and joy . I write unconnectedly , dear M. , for my heart is so full I can not give expression to what I would say . I never thought that I could be so peaceful in the service of God , nor have such a sweet , tranquil frame of mind , as I have enjoyed for a few days past . Now I give up every doubt and fear , and trustin* only in my Savior , am willing I humbly hope , to do all he appoints . Dear M. , I did not mean to occupy this note with my own feelings , but they would come out . Oh , to sing praises to our Savior !

These passing events bring with them many perplexities and trials , which would weigh me down , if I could not look to God and say , Thy will be done . ' I am pondering many things , and there is a ceaseless rush of thought , which sometimes makes my brain almost wild . And then I have so many duties , that my time is more than occupied  --  and I have sin and selfishness to subdue within , for roy heart is revealing its dreadful corruptions  --  and I have friends to pray for , whose condition weighs on my spirit  --  but in the midst of it all , I think I can trust in God , and leave all with him .

Probably the decision to which she had now come , to forsake all that was so dear to her , and devote her life to missionary labor , as seemed clearly to be her duty by the leadings of Providence , had much to do with the peace of mind which marks the whole of her history thenceforward ; but it is beautiful to contemplate it , and learn with what happiness child-like obedience can fill the Christian heart . The following record of her feelings during severe illness , is too beautiful to be omitted . It takes us into the green pastures and beside the still waters where the good Shepherd feeds his flock " I have been brought to the borders of the grave , from which it has pleased God to raise me , so that now I am fast recovering .

And oh , I thank God for the sweet thoughts he grants me . " I can look back on the whole scene , and view it only in the light of a blessing . I had very little suffering , principally weakness ; but I was so ill , that my parents gave up all hope , and my physicians felt there was scarcely a chance for my recovery . And yet , through the whole my mind was clear . I knew all which was going on around me , felt my danger , and thought that I should die . It pleased God to give me great calmness , without which it would have been impossible for my disease to have been checked ; for excitement was the thing most feared . I left the event entirely in my Savior 's hand . I trusted all to him , and knew that if it was his will , I should recover ; if not , I trusted he would not leave me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spared .

I can nut think of the kindness of all my friends , without the greatest wonder . It makes me very humble . I have had one overflowing stream of blessings , ever since the commencement of my illness . All my wants have been anticipated . The kindest friends have been around my bed side  --  the best care has been taken of me . Every thing that love could devise , has been done . My dear Mrs. Fitch came all the way from New Haven , and took care of me a night and a day . Oh , my cup has been full of blessings ! The loveliest flowers have bloomed on my table , and the choicest fruits , since I began to recover , have been before me . But this is not the half . " It has pleased my Heavenly Father to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have ever before enjoyed . I have the sweetest verses and hymns in my memory , and my communings on my bed , have been most precious .

I love my friends and every body , and every thing , ten thousand times more than I did before . The sun never shone so brightly , nor the moon so peacefully ; and yet I love God , and Jesus , and heaven as much better . The Bible never seemed half so precious .

Not to dwell too long on this part of her history , to us the most beautiful , which shows her to us the graceful ornament of her home , and the active sharer in every good work in her father 's congregation , we pass to the period of her departure from home . We should like to illustrate by copious extracts , the thorough preparation she was 350 July , // making for the field upon which she was entering , but they may all be condensed in this " I hare resoired to go no step alone . I consecrate to Jesus my time , my studies , my friends , my earthly store , and ask him to guide me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die for us , will he not give us all things necessary to enable us to live for him ?

In September , 1843 , Miss H. was married to the Rev. Henry I. Van Lennep , and in the following October , sailed with him for his home in Smyrna . She had the rare privilege of being accompanied on this voyage by her father , who went , in connexion with the Rev. Dr. Anderson , of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions , to visit the stations of the board in Turkey and Syria . A hasty note sent back by the pilot-boat to her mother , shews the cheerful spirit of a parting , which must have been only a little less severe than the final severing of soul and body . " Dear mother , my own dear mother , you are not sorry we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not for our own pleasure ; it is God who has appointed our way ; and I do think we go for Him , and shall live for Him in every thing .

Pray that we may never forget the object of our mission . Good bye , my precious mother , we are all in God 's hand , and He can sustain us . I have not a fear if God will only enable us to do right . " - pp. 192-193 . We place beside it her beautiful farewell to her father , written some months later , when he was about returning to America , leaving her at her post of labor . own precious father ,  --  God wilt take care of you on the great waters , and will bring you safely to your dear borne and people , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts with you ; and does time or distance separate us ?

It was a good meeting , and I wish we could keep heaven every moment in our mind . And now go home to dear mother , and comfort her heart , and train up dear E. to be a missionary , and tell all my young friends that there is a great and a blessed work to be done in this world , and they have but one life to do it in .

And , now dear father , I embrace you and kiss away all your tears , and I am your own affectionate Daughter-pp. 284 , 285 . We have said that her father left her at her post of labor . Had that been the case , her missionary life would have wanted its brightest act of self.sacrifice . At Smyrna , she was in the midst of her hus. band 's family circle , and surroundeL by many comforts which do not fall to the lot of most missionaries . She was yet to shew that she could forsake all for Christ . Let one or two 1848.1 351 // extracts introduce the reader to the refined domestic circle she was now called to leave . " I find myself in the midst of a warmhearted , affectionate , sincere circle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every thing I could wish , so far as their intercourse with me is concerned . Mrs. V.

" I have told you of the meeting with H 's friends , and to the time when I entered his mother 's room , all bewildered and weak , and found a resting place on the sofa . That first day of my Smyrna life was full of thoughts . * E * During the afternoon I slept , and when waking heard the clock , which stands in the corridor , striking five , and 1 had the half hewildered feeling which One has on *vaking in a strange place , after strange events .

Then I lay alone on the sofa , and while dozing heard the family singing their evening hymn after prayers . The voices all blended so perfectly , and tile music caine in such a deep rich strain , in half chanting style , that I lay spell bound , my whole frame thrilled . The words were Our days are as the grass , ' and though I could not distinguish them , they sang with so much expression I could almost tell the sentiments . * * * * * " The day after my arrival was the Sabbath , you know . The Sabbaths at Mrs. V. L. 's are very still . All go to the Dutch chapel at ten in the morning , and in the afternoon , mamma and several of the family attend the missionary service , which is also in the chapel . From roy room I heard no street sounds , for the house is in a court . Occasionally a camel bell , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twelve , and four , during the week , and every half hour on the Sabbath . These were almost all the sounds tilat came to my room . The bright blue sky looked in at the window the evening gun sounded at half past seven , tile partridaes made their voices heard on the terrace , for E. was taming some , and the favorite cat would jump on the window and mew to be admitted . Thus I had few sounds to remind me I was in Asia . Yet many strange things would come under my observation , and even in my room I gradually became acquainted with Smymna life , and Smaymna beings . July , As I was able to bear it , the relatives of the family would come one at a time and have a little pleasant chat with me . On Monday afternoon the Consul called . He had cailed before , hut I had not been able to see him , and when lie came the second time , mamma thought I had better receive him . I dreaded the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so patriarchal , that I quickly felt easy . " - pp. 241-243 . It was during the illness to which she alludes , that the plan of her bushand 's removal to Constantinople , rendered desirable by a proposed reorganization of the missions of the board , was comrnuntcated to her . This movement was some time itt suspense , and of it she says : " At first my heart died within me ; but I prayed much over it . You know how all my interests were in Smyrna , and then I had got the idea that H-s influence was necessary to his family . The plan seemed pleasant to H. , though the idea of icaving his home was trying to Ilim . 1-Jo felt that tile station in the high school was the place for him , and just suited his tastes ; and that so long as he was a missionary his great work must be on unevangeiized gronmi , and that however badly he and his family felt about separating , yet , if lie could do more good in any other field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie did , and became more and more reconciled to it . Sabbath was a precious day indeed ; we talked arid prayed over all our affairs , and felt comforted that God would order all things right-p. 245 . " How I long to lay aside the evil of my heart and the prejudices I have . You know I have always disliked a school , and a boarding school particularly , and I am distressed that 1 should feel this still . I mean to put it all down , for I am convinced it is foolish as well as sinful. " * * " Sometimes my heart died within meto be at the head of a seminary , and to have no home but in a hoarding school * * " I love a quiet way of living too well to make the idea of becoming a matron very pleasant . This causes me , I fear , to magnify tile difficulties ; and then my heart clings to Smyrna . The matter is all to be talked over  --  to be considered in all its lights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How much practical good sense there was in her views of her station and its duties , is shewn in the following passage . Memoir of Mrs. Mary E. Van Lennep. // " I believe it is a general fact , that the Orientals are regarded by us Americans as semi-barbarians , or at best as grown-up children . Nothing is more erroneous . The more we associate with them , the more we feel that they are entitled to respect and friendship , as much so as any polite , agreeable people in our own land , who are without true religion . With them we must observe the same strict rules of propriety , the same careful attention to win them to the truth without disgusting them . They have the same hopes , fears , affections that we have , but their views of ' religious truth are dark and cheerless . To pray long prayers , and to observe strictly the fasts , are the great things with them . They know no higher motive from which to act , than self-interest , and consequently are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do on first coming out , is to hire a house , engage a teacher of ' the language he wishes to learn , and strive as fast as possible to become acquainted with Oriental habits and modes of thinking , By degrees he gets introduced to one and another , as any person in coming into a new place does . He interests those whore he designs to benefit , in various ways , and gradually leads them to converse upon serious subjects . It has been found productive of much evil to attack their religions directly . You must strive to win their confidence , and have familiar talks upon religious subjects with thei . In this way you can gradually pour light into their minds , set them to inquiring , and sow some seeds of truth , which by God 's blessing may spring up and bear fruit . Patience and perseverance are exceedingly needed by a missionary . You will perhaps be surprised when I tell you , that the greatest trial of a missionary , is the effect upon his own spirit , of mingling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case here , where there are so many things to interest , and where there are not the helps to a Christian course which are found in a land of Bibles and Sabbaths . Another great trial is to see so many whose minds are full of error , and to know that you can do comparatively little to remove it . Oh , how often my heart has ached , when I have looked upon the crowds that throng these streets , and know that there is scarce one among them all , who knows anything about true religion . It is sad to look at their crowded burial places , beneath the cypress trees , and think how dark their end has been . " - 262- 264 . We should like to transcribe entire , some beautifully sketched scenes of her oriental life , but must content ourselves with a few passa ges , from which the reader may catch something of the naive and sprightly manner of the writer . " I have come to this charming place , ( Sedecui , ) at last , to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a boat to the opposite side of the city , beyond the barracks ; where we found the horses and donkeys waiting for us . The donkey driver , Y. , said lie meant to make a good rider of me , but 1 confess I had some fear of mounting even the meek little fellow , sure footed and good , which was allotted me . Y. walked by my side , and I gathered courage as I went . The country is beautiful , so wild are the mountains , so lovely are the plains . There is a picturesque air over every thing . We passed many loaded camels . Sometimes we were riding along green hedges , sometimes on the edge of high hills and looking off on plains , over which olives and cypresses and vineyards are scattered . The grass is as green , and the flowers as blooming and fresh , and the sun as warm as in New England in the month of May . The people are plowing and planting and arranging their vineyards . We reached Sedecui about twelve o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk among the mountains . I wish you could have seen our brothers . I laughed till I was tired at their curious hunting gear . The very gipseys themselves could not have looked more romantic , and their hands and faces quitri belied the rest of their appearance . I can not tell you as fully about Sedecui as I wish , but it is very beautiful . The houses are all near each other with very pleasant large gardens all around . " " March 6th . This morning H. took me into the large old house and garden where he and his brothers played when they were children . 0 , mamma , it is a place to dream of the past in . The old trees , now covered with ivy , could tell many a tale of those who have played beneath their shade , and grown old and passed away . We passed along the walks and talked of other days , and thought of the generations who have lived in these spots . Every thing was moss grown and ivy covered-pp. 268 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should form a party to the Tchiflick* on Wednesday , and so between four and five o'clock we were up , and our donkeys and donkey drivers were brought with the mules for our baggage .

L. 1848.3 353 // were on our way before six o'clock . But I must describe . Did you ever see a donkey in America ? I never did . But imagine a little animal something like a mule , only with a meeker and more silly face , so low in stature that when a tall person like father rides him , the feet almost touch the ground ; and it is sight worthy the brush of Hogarth . I have had so many donkey frolics that I have almost cease ( l laughing at donkey parties . Gentlemen generally ride horses , but at this season the horses are put to grass . Ladies look tolerably well upon these animals , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted of H. and three of his brothers , all in hunting dresses , some with guns , Some with pistols , and all together making quite a picturesque appearance , particularly as a hunting hum was slung over E. s shoulder . C. alone bestrode a horse , and he rode behind to keep the loiterers with the party . Our two cousins , Emily and Helen , rode on country saddles , and a Greek donkey driver walked by their side . It is useless attempting any such persuasion as influences other animals ; donkeys listen only to the voice and stick of their driver . L. and I wore broad straw hats which served in place of parasols , and which are convenient in riding . We all tipd , tipd along , waking up the villagers with our merry horn , and they came flocking to their gates , half dressed and half asleep .

There are now and then , * roves of olives , and many detached trees , such as the almond , ( like our peach , ) the willow , the pine , the platanus , wild pear , &amp;c. , and an endless variety of low shrubs and thorn trees ; but you would miss as 1 do , the tall thick forests of our land . You would look in vain for a rail fence , or a little farm house rising among the trees . If you saw any red roofs , there would be a red tiled village with a mosque and cypress trees clustering together . About an hour after starting we reached a caffeney at the end of a miserable village all in ruins , and dismounting we sat upon the stones by the well and took coffee . Tb n we entered upon a long , long plain , at the other end of which , just at the base of the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw their red roofs for a long time before reaching them , as they stand upon ground somewhat elevated . Now and then a few black tents of the wandsring Turkomans appeared , far to the right and left of our road , and camels which they had turned out to graze would lift their strange faces occasionally as we passed . The Tehiflick is the great hobby of our family , for besides being full of the most majestic scenery , it is a farm in which American and European improvements in agriculture are being made . Every improvement is so intonately connected with the missionary enterprise , that the Tehiflick can not but interest the friends of missions . Already the American plough is introduced , and they hope before long to establish a carriage road between Sedecul and the Tehiflick . It is a large estate , being six miles one way , and three the other , and it is a most charming spot . There is an immense garden of fruit trees and vegetables ; and the forest trees there are larger than any where else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gorge , I did not feel the want of the trees of America .

" A few months more , full of cheerful activity in preparation to live among a strange people , and to overcome the first difficulties of their language , and she has finished her course on earth . This was indeed a sudden and unexpected termination of her hopes and plans , and of those of the friends , who , in yielding . her up to the missionary work , felt that they had laid their choicest treasure upon God 's altar .

We have Thursday for you , because it is the evening of your lecture . These are our stated times ; but besides these , do not our hearts daily and continually ascend to God for you ? It is a great comfort to me that I remember with such minute distinctness , every thing about my home . There is a freshness about every thing in the past , a vividness at times overwhelming . I can call up day after day , hour after hour , with all its attending events , conversations , looks and emotions . Almost every time I lie down , some scene in Hartford rises to memory-either the chaise is just ready , and I ride down by the South church with you ; or I am sitting with my dear mother in her own room , talking of the future , which is now present .

Dear S. , this world is not to be our home . Let us rejoice in this . A few days of care will soon pass , and then we , and those we love , will begin a blessed existence in the presence of our Saviour , who will make all our hearts happy through all eternity . But how little we think of heaven , and how we start at the thou lit of dying . Yes , dying is a solemn thing . I shrink when I think of the hour of death .

He is the chief attraction in heaven , and he must have our highest love , if we would hope to have heaven attractive . If we meditate much upon the perfect character of our Almighty Savior , we shall sec how adapted he is to satisfy our hearts . Yes , dear S. , he can satisfy as no other being can ; and I trust you have long ere this found it out .

Christ has sources of comfort and happiness in himself which he is ready to impart to us , and of which we now little dream . Our minds are too dark to see his loveliness . Oh , when will these clouds be rolled away ? Dear S. , let us no longer think of him as a being far away , but as a kind and faithful friend , who loves us with so tender a love , that lie longs to draw us to his bosom , and make us forever happy . But you may think , dear S. , that I intend writing a sermon instead of a letter , and I will tell you frankly , that these thoughts have dwelt so much in my mind of late , that I could not refrain from writing them-pp. 325 , 326 .
