txt DR . CHALMERS was one of the persons appointed , under the will of the late Earl of Bridgewater , to write a treatise " On the Wisdom , Power , and Goodness of God , as manifested in the Creation . " This general subject being divided into eight branches , the portion of it allotted to our author was " The Adaptation of External Nature to the Moral and Intellectual Condition of Man . " The work which Dr. Chalmers published , in compliance with this call , has been for some years before the public , and we have had occasion in this Journal to express , incidentally , our opinion of its merits . The volumes now before us contain a republication of the Bridgewater Treatise , with some additional chapters on the argument for the being of a God , and on a few other subjects , designed so far to fill out the deficiences of the former publication , as to entitle the entire work to be called an exposition of the whole science of Natural Theology . These supplementary portions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very few words may suffice for a consideration of their merits and defects . Dr. Chalmers does not appear qualified in an eminent // degree , either by the peculiarities of his style , or his habits of study and thought , to become a scientific writer . With a great command of words , considerable power of amplifying a subject , and , at times , of expressing himself with much force and earnestness , he lacks precision of statement and definiteness of views . His style is often incorrect , and almost always verbose and tumid , and , amidst a wilderness of words , the reader is somet*imes at a loss how to find any meaning whatever . Such a style may be very effective in the pulpit , where familiar thoughts are to be handled , to be amplified and set forth under every variety of aspect . The constant rej ) etitions will enable the bearer to comprehend the general drift of the argument , and the swell and copiousness of language will fasten it upon his memory . But * inaccuracy and vagueness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One is often puzzled by contradictory statements , and loses sight of the chief object of inquiry , while the author is expatiating at great length on some mcidental topic . But these defects might be pardoned , if they did not proceed from much confusion of thought , and a hasty manner of prosecuting an abstract inquiry . Dr. Chalmers elaborates nothing , but gives out the first draft of his arguments and speculations , pretty much in the order in which they first occurred to him . Consequently , there is no proportion between the parts , but a crude mass of materials is presented , which , if duly worked over , might be found to contain many sound remarks , and some trains of reasoning and reflection , followed out with considerable success . The subject of his Bridgewater Treatise , forms but a small fraction of the whole science of Natural Theology . But , desirous of publishing something , that should appear to cover the whole ground , without revising or retrenching to any extent the original work , he annexes to it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body of the book , and then sends it forth as a new and complete treatise . Dr. Chalmers is not a learned writer ; at least , not in this department of science . Of hmny important contributions to Natural Theology , he makes no mention whatever , and thus many arguments and objections pass unnoticed by him , a full consideration of which is essential to any effective treatment of the subject at the present day . Dr. Thomas Brown is // about the only philosophical writer , with whose works he appears to be fully acquainted , though neither the general reputation , nor the completeness of this author 's speculations , make him a very safe guide in abstruse and difficult inquiries . Dr. Chalmers does not in himself possess sufficient acuteness and skill in treating metaphysical questions to make up for this lack of information , and the chapters in which he hazards any attempt at subtile and refined reasoning , as , for instance , in answering the objections of Hume , are among the least satisfactory portions of the hook . In spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these volumes . Dr. Chalmers has a full perception of the true nature of the question , and a clear insight into the principles on which it must be resolved . If he was not added much to the argument for the being of a God , he has not perplexed it with any extraneous matter . Good sense and a vigorous mind may he discerned through the cloudy envelope of words , in which his remarks are enclosed . The spirit in which he has conducted the inquiry , and the general tenor of his reasoning , may be inferred from the following remark . " We hold it with Paley greatly more judicious , instead of groping for the evidence of a Divinity among the transcendental generalities of time , and space , and matter , and spirit , and the grounds of a necessary and eternal existence for the one , while nought but modifications and contingency can be observed of the other , - we hold it more judicious , simply to open our eyes on the actual and peopled world around us , - or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and try if we can read , as in a book of palpable and illuminated characters , the traces or the forth-goings of a creative mind anterior to , or at least , distinct from matter , and which both arranged it in its present order and continues to overrule its processes . " - Vol.1. p. 113 . The expression here is a fair sample of that wordy manner , of which we have complained ; but the opinions , which are stated , respecting the proper character of the reasoning to be employed in Natural Theology , appear sound and judicious . They agree substantially with the views , which we attempted , in a very imperfect manner , to set forward and defend in the last number of this Journal . * As we propose // to resume the subject , with a view to correct some possible misconceptions of those views , and to consider more at length the inevitable consequences of encumbering the science of Natural Theology with metaphysical speculations , it may be worth while , for the benefit of those who have not perused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succinct manner , the ground which was therein taken . We endeavoured to show , that the great doctrine of Natural Theology does not belong to that class of abstract and mathematical truths , to which alone demonstrative reasoning is applicable ; - that the being of a God is a reality , and his existence a fact , to be proved like any other fact in natural science , by arguments of the same kind , though superior in number and force . An examination of all the forms of the a priori argument was intended to prove , not only that the reasoning itself was entirely inconclusive , but that it was founded on a misconception of the nature of the question at issue ; - that the proposers of it , by overlooking the distinction just mentioned between two classes of truth , which are wholly unlike , had fallen into the grave error of representing the Divine Being as a mere abstraction , and thereby , though unintentionally , had played into the hands of a set of metaphysical atheists of our day , who would fain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men , and substitute in his place a principle , - an idea , - a nothing , - without consciousness , personality , or intelligence . We sought to point out the true character of the argument a posteriori , or the proof from design , and to show its completeness and sufficiency ; - to prove , that the only objections to it were of a metaphysical character , and proceeded from the misconception noticed above ; - that , by exhibiting the unfitness and inapplicability of such abstract reasoning in this case , not only would the science of Natural Theology be freed from the rotten supports and profitless speculations , by which it had been encumbered , but also the only sound argument for the vital doctrine at issue would be relieved from all the cayils and objections , by which it has been attacked , and be placed on its true basis , alike unassailed and unassailable . A comparison between the truths which the theist seeks to establish , and the doctrines of all the inductive sciences was meant to prove , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which invalidates the one would be equally conclusive against the others ; - and that the reasoner had // accomplished enough both for faith and practice , when he had shown , that the great fact of religion can be attacked only by arguments , which would subvert the whole fabric of human knowledge , and render all belief and action alike unpossible . These views were very inadequately explained in the short space to which the limits of a single article confined us ; and much might now be said to elucidate and support them . But we do not intend to go over the same ground again , except for the sake of correcting some misconceptions , and of examining more fully a cognate subject , - the propriety of mingling the science of metaphysics with that of theology , or rather of uniting the two in a close and indissoluble union . A full and fair consideration of this question night be serviceable at any time and under all circumstances ; but the discussion of it appears particularly seasonable at the present day , when abstract speculation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ever assumed before . And here it may be remarked , once for all , that we are dealing with opinions , and not with persons . This is neither the time nor the place for impugning the motives of individuals , for throwing doubts upon the purity of their faith , or of charging upon them the consequences , that are fairly deducible from their Opinions . All abstract speculations may be considered as published anonymously ; there is a better chance of weighing them with candor and correctness , when the personal character of their authors or supporters is not allowed to bias the decision . It is possible to expose and reprobate in the plainest terms the sophistical character of an argument , or the degrading and pernicious effects of certain doctrines , and yet not " bate ajot " of the high respect due to men who may have used such reasoning , or entertained such sentiments , without examining with due care their purport and tendency . In showing that the a priori proof leads by necessary consequence to a doctrine , that can hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument ad invidiam , nor attempting to cast a reproach on the reputation or the principles of those who adopt and defend such reasoning . The name of the great champion of this argument stands too high in the English church to be tarnished by the slightest breath of suspicion or calumny . But the liability to gross abuse is in itself a consideration of weight against the // adoption of any class of speculations ; and a false and destructive doctrine , that is fairly deducible from them , constitutes a reducijo ad absurdum of the whole system . As such , it may properly be pointed out , and held up to public reprobation . In distinguishing the two modes of proving the being of a God , as the a priori and the a posteriori argument , we were fully aware , that there is an ambiguity in the use of the former term . But the usage of English writers has been so uniform in this respect , that a misconception was hardly possible , except by bringing in the different application of the phrase , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German philosophers . Yet , to avoid the cl ) ance even of this mismake , we stated , that , " if the meaning of the term be restricted to original and intuitive pe*ceptions , which are independent of experience , the distinction implied by the two phrases does not exist . These first principles of belief are implied in every act of ratiocination ; they are taken for granted in the argument from experience , and in every other proof . " These intuitive perceptions are called " principles of common sense " by Reid ; Stewart designates them as " fundamental laws of human belief " ; Kant calls them " a priori cognitions of pure reason . " Now , it is perfectly idle to adopt this Kantian phrase as the only legitimate one , and then to heap up authorities and arguments to show , that such intuitive elements of truth enter into every process of reasoning , and , therefore , we must argue a priori for the existence of a God , or not at all . No one , who is at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the admission of it makes nothing in favor of what is technically called the a priori argument in Natural Theology ; and to allege this fact in such a course of reasoning , and with such a purpose , is mere sophistry . According to its etymology , and its use in treatises of logic , an a priori argument is one in which the reasoning proceeds from cause to effect , and from principles to consequences . And that Dr. Clarke really intended to use it in this sense , appears from a passage in one of his letters to a correspondent , who had brought forward the objection , that such reasoning could not establish the existence of a First Cause . Dr. Clarke replies , by affirming that a First Cause could be dedticed from the antecedent principle of necessity , and by reasoning which should be strictly a priori . " For though // no thing , no being , can be prior to that Being which is the First Cause and original of all things , yet there must bc in nature a ground or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of the First Cause . Arguments may and must be drawn from the nature and consequences of that necessity , by which the First Cause exists . " It was quite pertinent , then , on our part , to restate the objection made by Clarke 's correspondent , and to show that the aiiswer to it was not satisfactory , because the reasoner had actually , though unwittingly , assumed an empirical datum , or a fact from experience , in his proof , and thereby had wholly destroyed its a priori character . He promised to lead us up to the great truth of all religion by a new path ,  --  to " nobly take the high priori road , and reason downwards " ; but , after a little digression , he conducts us back again to the old travelled way , where alone we can obtain firm footing . But , as neither mode of explaining the phrase " a priori " supplies a plain line of demarkation between the two classes of proofs , under all the forms in which they have been proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by considering the one as a professed demonstration of the object sought , and the other as laying claim only to moral certainty in the conclusion . This distinction is not incidental and unimportant , but it expresses the fundamental difference between the two modes of reasoning , and it covers the whole question , with which we have any thing to do . Dr. Clarke called his book a " Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of a God , " and repeatedly alludes with satisfaction to his favorite mode of reasoning , as producing absolute certainty , while the argument a posteriori afforded only moral proof . " The proof a priori is , " he remarks , " as I fully believe , strictly demonstrative " ; though he immediately admits , that " it is of use only against learned and metaphysical difficulties . " Descartes placed his ontological proof of tle Divine Existence at the very foundation of his philosophical system , which was to do away with all doubts and uncertainties in speculation , and supply an immovable basis of truth , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this great fact next after that of his own existence , at a time when he still professed to doubt the reality of the outward world , the deductions of experience , and the truth of every principle in philosophy and science . // Having secured this point , as he imagined , i naway that defied all scrutiny and doubt , he proceeded to erect upon it the whole fabric of human knowledge . Now , half the evil consists in the magnitude of these pretensions . It is plainly implied in them , that the other argument , which leads only to moral certainty , is insufficient , that mankind must either renounce the belief in a God , or accept the fine-spun reasoning and philosophical systems with which this doctrine has been connected . A technical distinction in logic between two kinds of evidence is set up , as if it affected our belief of the facts which they tend respectively to support . Practically , this is not true ; the two sorts of reasoning differ in kind , but not in degree . Everybody knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which all the demonstrations ever invenred could neither amend nor increase . As the logicians talk , not even death is certain , but what person 's hope or fear of that dread event would be quickened by a demonstration , that it must happen . The reader of this page is not , in logical phrase , absolutely certain that the black marks upon it were not produced by mere accident , - by upsetting an inkstand , for instance . It can not be demonstrated , that any human being ever designed to convey any meaning by them , or that , in pursuance of this purpose , a printer was employed to set up the types , and thus produce the requisite symbols of thought . But the reader 's conviction of this fact is firm , notwithstanding the alleged defect of evidence , and all the reasoning in Euclid could not increase his faith . In like manner , the sublime dogma of the existence of a God is written all over the face of creation ; but some philosophers would fain persuade men to shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forsooth , the truth is not demonstrated by them . An analysis of the celebrated argument of Descartes showed that this philosopher also , as well as Dr. Clarke , had deceived himself in respect to the true character of his reasoning , which really proceeded from the effect to the cause , though he fancied that it was strictly a priori . Having proved , as he thought , that the idea of God in his own mind did not come from the senses , nor from his own imagination and reflection , it followed that the Infinite Being himself must have placed it there , that it might bear evidence to its Creator . After exposing the fallacy of the supposition , that the // whole idea of Deity , as it exists in an educated and intelligent mind , is intuitive and innate , because some of its eleinents may possess this character , we remarked , that the argument , at best , was only a proof a posteriori , for it was " the same thing , whether we reason from the anatomy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure of each is the only ground for affirming , that it is the work of an intelligent Creator . " Descartes was guiltyof an inconsistency , moreover , in introducing the argument at such an early stage in his inquiries , when he had as yet proved only his own existence , and the presence of ideas to his mind ; for , although the reasoning did not appeal to the external world , it took for granted the law of causality , or the legitimacy of arguing from the effect to the cause , a principle which the philosopher had not yet demonstrated , but which , with all other principres , he had expressly called into doubt . It may be objected to this account , that Descartes proposed his argument in another form , in which . without resting on the law of causality , he argued directly , from the internal characteristics of the idea itself , that God must exist . But those who make this objection ought to know , that the form in which we stated the argument was the one originally adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Third Meditation , " where it supplies one link to the chain of principles and reasonings , which form his metaphysical system . Afterwards , when hard pressed by his opponents , and , as it appears to us , with a view of covering his retreat by logical artifice and a cloud of words , he restated the argument in a form , which may he found in his " Answers to Objections . " Very brief extracts will suffice to show , that Descartes really proposed the argument which we attributed to him . The following is from his " Third Meditation . " " Although the idea of substance is in me from the very reason that I am myself a substance , still , I , who am a finite being , could not have the idea of an infinite substance , if it had not been placed in me by some being , who was truly infinite . " And in the " Answers to Objections , " he expresses himself still more plainly , thus " The existence of God is demonstrated by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea is in us . " We were guilty , therefore , of no injustice toward this philosopher , in affirming that the argument , which was embodied in his system of philosophy , was wholly // a posteriori . The other statement of the proof , though it excited more discussion at the time , from the skill with which it was worded , which renders it difficult to detect the fallacy , is now admitted to he sophistical , and , as such , is generally abandoned . Precluded by our limits from following Descartes through all his discussions with his opponents , we considered only that form of the proof , which he originally proposed and incorporated into his system , and which is admitted to he sound so far as it goes , although it is not of an a priori character ; while we put aside the second statement of it , which was only an after thought , and is now universally acknowledged to possess no weight whatever . Certainly , the omission did no injustice to Descartes . This second manner of stating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nearly in the author 's own words , though sentences are brought together , which are not united in his " Answers to Objections . " The existence of God is known from the mere consideration of his nature ; for necessary existence is contained in his nature , or in the conception of God , as it is present to our minds . Possible existence is contained in the notion or idea of all things , which we conceive clearly and distinctly ; but necessary existence is contained only in the idea of God . Now , it is a greater perfection to be a real existence and to he in the understanding also , than to be only in the understanding . But my idea of God is that of an all-perfect being ; therefore he really exists . Or the argument may be still more briefly stated as follows ; In the idea of God are contained all the attributes of a perfect being ; hut necessary existence is one of those attributes ; therefore , he necessarily exists . We presume that any person , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it must be a sophism , or a mere play upon words , though he might not be able at once to detect the fallacy . It forcibly reminds one of the puzzles , that are often inserted in treatises of logic , as exercises for the learner , where the conclusion is at once perceived to be an absurdity , though it seems to rest on perfectly formal and legitimate reasoning . In this case , the whole fallacy consists in substituting the phrase " necessary existence " for the " idea of necessary existence . " It is perfectly correct to say , that the idea of necessary existence enters into our complex notion of a God . But the reality // does not follow from the idea , any more than the reality of a winged horse follows from my conception of such an animal , - of Pegasus , for instance ; or , still more pertinently , the reality in this case can no more be inferred from the idea , than the actual presence of a perfect circle on the paper before me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect , conception of such a circle , which exists in my mind . To say , that " necessary existence " is contained in the idea of God , is to talk nonsense ; for real existence is the direct opposite of ideal existence , and it is , therefore , a contradiction in terms to affirm , that the former is contained in the latter . But we are ashamed to offer a serious confutation of such sophistry . Descartes would scarcely have proposed it , if he had not thought to escape from the assaults of his opponents by a logical juggle . * It seems hardly necessary to allude again to Cousin 's argument , which that writer himself has reduced to an absurdity , by showing what is the only conception of a God , to which such reasoning can lead . But , as it is possible to modify so vague a statement materially , without losing any of its essence , and , by combining it with the Cartesian proof , to give the whole argument a plausible air , it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument , made up from the reasoning of Cousin and Descartes , may be explained as follows . Our internal recognition of ourselves as finite* limited , imperfect , and dependent beings , compels us to form the conception of a Being , who is infinite , unlimited , perfect , and independent . The reasoning , thus far explained , shows how the idea of God rises in the soul , but supplies no means of passing over from the idea of him to the conviction of his actual existence . It is said further , then , that the conviction which we have of our own dependent existence as realities , necessitates the belief in a being on whom we depend , as equally a reality , and not a mere idea . Dependence implies one who affords support , just as much as design implies a designer . The author of that support can not be another dependent being like ourselves , for then the question arises , on what does he depend ; and so on , until we arrive at a being , who is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered , that we have to ( 10 only with the assumed a priori character of this proof , - with the assertion , that it supplies a means whereby we can pass from // the idea of God in the soul to a knowledge of the reality , without having recourse to experience , - and with the consequent assertion , that , as the reasoning contains no empirical element , it supplies demonstrative proof of the Divine Existence . Then , the first question which arises , respects the original and intuitive character of these four characteristics of human nature and existence , as they exist in our idea . Does consciousness , previously to all experience , make us known to ourselves under all four of the attributes or qualities here enumerated ? Certainly we know , whether by a primitive intuition or not , that we are limited , imperfect , and , - in one sense of the word , at least , - finite . But how dependent ? This is the attribute , which is added to Cousin 's enumeration , and the whole force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by so doing , the reasoner takes few granted the very point at issue . We wholly deny the possibility of learning from consciousness , by a direct and spontaneous perception , that we are dependent heings . The feeling of dependence must he subsequent to a knowledge of the being or thing , on whom we rely for support , just as the feeling of gratitude is necessarily subsequent to our recognition of a benefactor . Gratitude and dependence are both ideas of relation ; both imply a subject and an object ; and it is absurd to suppose , that a relative idea can first suggest the knowledbe of one of its terms . If I am already aware of the existence of another being besides myself , I can have an idea of the relationship in which he stands to me , as father , brother , or friend ; but it is preposterous to suppose , that I can first have a general idea of relationship , and he guided hy that to a knowledge of the person to whom I am related . The argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either experience or the knowledge of a Cod , which teaches us the folly of entire self-reliance , and not the feeling of depending upon something , which teaches us what that something is . This knowledge of our condition as dependent beings does not come so early in the history of ideas . We soon learn the frailty , weakness , and imperfection of our nature , but only slowly and by degrees are we made aware of the fact , that there is one without and around us , whose constant providence sustains the weak structure , and prevents our frail nature momentarily from sinking into decay and ruin . A stone is a limited and imperfect thing , a dead and powerless // mass ; but it does not so readily appear , at first sight , a con tin gent and dependent substance , which was created and made what it is , and endowed even with the force of gravity , by which it is fastened to the earth . The hypothesis of the materialist and the atheist is at least a conceivable one , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by blind necessity and the nature of things . In like manner , animal , or even intelligent , life , small as its powers are , and limited as the sphere is , through which they act , does not appear immediately , and to the uninstructed understanding , as an existence supported by a power foreign to itself . The heart beats and the lungs play seemingly by the force of their own mechanism , and without interference ; and ideas come thronging into the mind in what appears a constant and necessary connexion , to which , at the first glance , we attribute neither limit nor end . But the understanding , enlightened by experience of interruption and decay , and instructed by analogy , learns the really frail and contingent constitution of this nature , and that it must be constantly upheld by a power external to itself , or it would sink into dissolution . And here we might leave the argument , as stripped of its undue pretensions and metaphysical character , and retaining whatever weight may be attributed to it among the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there is another fallacy in the original statement of it , which , as it shows the impropriety of representing it as only a modification of the Cartesian proof , may here be pointed out . We observe , then , that the force of the reasoning depends in no degree whatever on the idea of dependence , but only on the fact , as ascertained and verified by experience , or by any other means . The fact , that human nature is weak and incapable of supporting itself , compels us to believe in a creating and sustaining Deity . But the idea or thought of such dependence , so long as it is not corroborated by proof , does not accredit this doctrine , any more than the belief in the independence of human nature , which it is very possible some skeptics may entertain , vouches the truth of the atheistical hypothesis . And it can not be said , that this idea has a place among the primitive intuitions of the soul , and therefore deserves credit for its own sake , though destitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insuperable objections which we have already urged against such a classification , // it is violating all probability and all the rules of philosophy to assign an a priori origin to a cognition , which experience is perfectly competent to supply . And here one observation may be addressed to those , who are so much interested in opposing the doctrine of Condillac , that all our knowledge comes from the senses , or the less objectionahie one , which is commonly ascribed to Locke , that all knowledge is founded on experience . It is poor policy on their part , to multiply hastily and unnecessarily the number of those principles , to which they ascribe an intuitive and spontaneous origin . We believe , that there are other ideas , like that of cause , the genesis of which can not satisfactorily be explained , either by external or by mental experience . But their number is not fully a*ceriained , nor are their characteristics clearly defined ; and it behoves the phik*. sopher to proceed with the utmost caution in making additions to the list . To seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of an ultimate principle for the idea on which it rests , and branding all those , who oppose or doubt it , with a disposition to favor the Sensualist school , is merely to go on spinning one ideal cobweb after another , which the skeptic will sweep away with the first stroke of his besom . Such a procedure is the poor resource either of indolence , which will not attentively examine , or of sophistry , which would willingly deceive . A striking instance of this willingness to multiply ultimate principles , may he found in the speculations of some writers upon the argument from final causes . They aflirm , that destgn is an intuitive idea , a conception of pure reason , called out and developed , it is true , by experience , hut not growing out of that experience . We can hardly believe that they are serious in this assertion . If design be considered merely as synonymous with intention , or purpose , then it is evident , that we can have no knowledge of it until we have had experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended or designed to perform some act . The origin of the idea is in reflection , or the observation of what passes in our own minds . So we experience a certain emotion , and apply a name to it , in order to distinguish it from other emotions , that differ from it in kind , or are excited by a different class of objects . But it would be very strange to say , that love , or wonder , or pity , was an intuitive idea . // It is very true , that we mean something more than mere *ntention , in speaking of the argument from final causes . But the case here is still stronger against the assertion , which we are now considering . In this case , design is a very complex notion , nearly all the elements of it being drawn from mental experience . They are founded on our observation of ourselves , and are successively elaborated and united into the complex notion , which we call design . The idea rests originally on a perception of the relation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular event followed immediately after another , or several others , and connecting the consequent with these antecedents , by an intuitive application of the law of causality , and believing that the course of nature is uniform , or that like effects will follow like causes , and desiring that the consequent event may again occur , - we act ; t4at is , we exert our agency to bring about events similar to the former antecedent ones , doing this under the expectation , that a similar consequent event will follow . Thus design implies , - first , irttclligence , or a knowledge of the laws of causality and uniformity ; - secondly , particular experience of some one event , A , happening in immediate connexion with several others , B and C ; - thirdly , a will to reproduce the event A ; - fourthly , action , in order to bring about the events B and C , under - ( fifthly ) an expectation that A will immediately follow . Are these five elements all of a priori origin ? Is not action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea of it until we have acted ; that is , until we have had experience , and derived knowledge directly from that experience ? It is , indeed , in the complexity of this notion , that the irnportance of the argument from final causes almost wholly consists . Wherever we find indications of design , there is evidence , to an equal extent , of intelligence , will , activity , and foresight . The God there revealed , is an individual , self-conscious , and creative being , and not a mere vague principle , dimly inferred from transcendental musings , - aliquid immensum infinitum que , - but without personality , activity , or intelligence . And this difference between the conclusions , to which the two kinds of reasoning lead , is frankly acknowledged by the greatest advocate of the a priori scheme . Dr. Clarke expressly admits , that the intelligence of the Deity can not be established by the demonstrative method , but must be inferred from the evidences of design . // The same disposition to multiply the spontaneous elements of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the nature of the religious principle in the soul . They place it in the same class with the emotions of beauty and moral approbation , affirming that , in each case , there is not only a feeling or sentiment , which leads us to appreciate the beautiful , the virtuous , and the holy , but an idea on which this sentiment rests , a type of the object to which it relates ; so that the soul is originally endowed , not only with a feeling , to be called out and exercised by knowledge subsequently acquired , but with a primitive notion or pattern , by comparison with which we learn to correct whatever is afterwards afforded by experience , and to distinguish the real from the factitious , the true from the false . We have no room here to go over the broad field of discus* sion , that is opened by this theory . We can only point out a single , but insuperable objection to the whole scheme , and notice the fallacy of the theological argument , that is founded upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this argument leads . To begin with the theory of taste , it is urged , that we immediately pronounce an object to be beautiful or the opposite , and that this decision must proceed from a comparison of the object with the idea of beauty previously existing in our minds ; that this standard can not be the recollection of another beautiful object , previously seen , for the question then arises , what made us esteem this previous object beautiful we are driven back , therefore , to the theory of a primitive pattern or archetype of beauty , originally existing in the human soul , by a reference to which all the principles of taste are determined . We maintain , on the contrary , that man is so constituted , that the sight of peculiar objects immediately calls up an emotion of pleasure or disgust ; that this emotion , having characteristic features , and being distinguished thereby from all other emotions , receives its distinct name as the sentiment or feeling of the beautiful ; that its presence being agreeable to the mind , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that objects are immediately perceived to be beautiful or not , according as they call up this emotion or its opposite , and not in reference to any idea or standard whatever , whether founded on previous experience , or evolved by spontaneous intuition . // Now the question between these two theories must be determined , if at all , by known facts respecting the growth or cultivation of taste in the individual mind . The judgment of the child and the uninstructed person in matters of taste is grossly erroneous . A gaudy dress , a tumid style , a daub with bright colors , an unmeaning jingle of sounds , excite a pleasant emotion in him ; and his admiration of such objects for the moment is perhaps as hearty , as the delight which a cultivated mind experiences on surveying the wonders of ancient or modern art . But experience soon corrects the faulty decision . The full glow of wonder and delight at such perceptions passes off at the first view . If the objects are repeatedly seen , the emotion no longer arises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glaring sights gain on him as they are examined ; that the emotion rises as l*gh and continues longer , when the object calls up by association a greater number of kindred ideas ; when he is enabled to perceive a meaning and purpose in the disposition of the parts when colors are so disposed that they harmonize and pass into each other by imperceptible gradations ; when the drawing accurately represents known scenes and persons ; in fine , when the mind is longest occupied in tracing out resemblances , proportions , relations , and associated ideas . For during all the time that the attention is thus occupied , the pleasant emotion continues , while it rapidly passes off after the first view of the former objects , which afford no such prolonged occupation to the intellect . The individual may now , if he choose , return upon his steps , and form a theory respecting the elements common to those objects , which he found to afford him the greatest and most durable pleasure , and thus lay down principles of taste , and form an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgments . How do these facts accord with the two explanations given above ? All persons of cultivated minds agree with each other , so far as the emotion is concerned ; they all admire the same things . But when they come to discuss the principles of taste , to determine the idea of beauty , no two theories are alike . And the judgment in respect to pleasing objects is instantaneous . The beholder does not stop to compare the sight , either with a natural or artificial standard , but pronounces at once on its beauty or deformity . Mr. Alison did not wait to reckon up all the associated ideas , which // a landscape , a statue , or a painting , brought to his mind , before he determined , whether it was beautiful or not . He experienced the pleasure first , and afterwards labored to find its sources . Moreover , if there be an original idea of beauty in the mind , the judgment of the child must be more correct than that of the critical student of wsthetics , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less perverted and dimmed by experience . This discussion , introduced only to illustrate our main argument , has already carried us too far , though a multitude of other considerations might be adduced against the theory , which assigns to the idea of beauty a place among the primitive intuitions of reason . But enough has been said , perhaps , to leave no doubt in an unprejudiced mind . We come then to examine a perfectly similar instance , the nature of the re* ligious principle in the soul . We believe , that man was created with a capacity and inclination for worship , with a deep feeling of reverence and veneration , which finds no appropriate object on which to expend itself among the persons and things , with which it is associated on earth , but constantly seeks for such an object , and usually obtains it in the conception of some spiritual existence , higher and holier than itself . Benjamin Constant properly designates this principle as the religious sentiment , and with great learning and ingenuity has traced the history of its developement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained at different times among the inhabitants of the globe . The feeling itself , however powerful , is blind and instinctive ; its object is not given along with it , but is left to be traced out by the active intellect , questioning and interpreting the operations of nature . In this respect , it agrees with the feeling of moral approbation and the sentiment of taste , which are respectively a capacity of being deeply moved and affected by a view of right actions and beautiful scenes , but which remain dormant , until a perception of such objects calls them forth . The idea is not given along with them , for if it were , they would remain constantly in exercise . It is even a sign of a morbid , though excited state of the moral sentiment , when its energies are spent on the contemplation of some ideal and abstract pattern of virtue , instead of being applied practically in determining right actions , and directing conduct . So the religious emotion is unprofitably wasted , when it is turned from the con // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abstract principles , with which it can hold no communion . Its proper object is a person ; its proper expression is worship . And , unless prayer is a mockery , and the devout affection itself a feverish delusion , such a Person exists , and , by instilling this sentiment , has erected his own altar in the hearts of men . If we seek to go further , and to find ' by the side of this feeling , or beneath it , an innate idea of the object to which it relates , we are either drawn into the heated region of mysticism , or engage in a vain contest against accredited facts in psychology and history . The idea can not be found in the undisciplined mind , and , if it could , it would not prove the existence of its object . Every person would frame his own unreal and fantastic conception , to usurp the name and peerogative of this idea , and , resting on the fidelity of this assumed intuitive notion , he would not allow it to be corrected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The conception of the Divine nature would thus be corrupted by the crude and debasing notions of the illiterate understanding , or by the insane fancies of the mystagogue . But the doctrine , that the proper object of the religious feeling is to be sought in study and contemplation of the material and intellectual universe , which , if such a being exists , is his work , leaves our idea of his nature to be corrected and purified by the increasing fruits of such study and the natural growth of the intellect . It does not oblige us to shut our eyes on all ulterior sources of information , on all indications of his character afforded by his works , for fear of tarnishing or falsifying his primitive image in the soul . This doctrine creates the science of Natural Theology , the study of which , according to the other hypothesis , is a needless and unprofitable task . The existence of the religious feeling does not afford a direct argument for the reality of its proper object , but it creates an antecedent presumption , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which it first excited and stimulated . But the metaphysical theologians of our day are not content with the undoubted fact , that a religious sentiment exists , as a part of the original constitution of our nature , unless they can add to it an a priori conception of pure reason . Compelled by a multitude of unanswerable facts and argument // ments , for a plain summary of which we may refer to the first hook of Locke 's " Essay , " to relinquish the position , that there is an innate and distinct idea of God in the soul , they have recourse to the vague and inappreciable conception of the Infinite , sometimes hoidly identifying it , as Cousin does , with the Divine nature , and herehy reducing the Deity to an abstract idea , and sometimes avoiding this conclusion only by generalities and unmeaning phrases . Were this theory introduced , not in connexion with the theological argument , as a resting-point for religious faith , but as a part of a metaphysical system , as pure speculation , its vagueness and uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of philosophical language . But in such a connexion as this , hearing on the most momentous of all facts to the human race , we feel constrained to ask for an explicit account of th' idea , on which the whole religious fabric is made to rest . What is this conception of the infinite ? Is it of a person , or thing , which can be made an object of worship ? Or is it merely an attribute of being , like intelligence , justice , or holiness ? Or is it rather an attribute of an attribute , a word expressive of the degree , in which certain qualities exist , as when we speak of " infinite goodness , mercy , and truth ' ? Does it exist as a clear conception in the mind , or is it a word that merely expresses the incapacity of the human intellect to comprehend the extent of certain attributes ? Does it merely teach , that certain qualities go beyond the reach of human understanding , hut how much beyond we can not tell ? Natural Theology is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truths which are intended to exert a direct influence over the conduct of men , and we have a right , therefore , to demand that the terms used in it should be clearly defined . This predetermination to find an instinctive religious idea in every human soul has led to much profitless discussion of the question , whether any real atheist ever existed . At least , apart from this theory , we see no good cause for disputing , whether one philosopher or another can properly be called by this name or not . The appellation implies reproach ; it is a contumelious one , and some may desire to relieve a favorite author from the opprobrium , which it conveys . There is some Quixotism , perhaps , in contending with great earnestness to free from this accusation a writer // who has long since passed off the stage , and has left none behind him , that have an immediate interest in his reputation . With his memory , be it good or bad , we have nothing to do . The real question is , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to atheism , or constitute atheism itself . And this question can be very easily resolved , if we do not allow ourselves to be blinded by a most arbitrary abuse of terms . The doctrine that only one substance exists , and that this substance is material , has existed from all eternity , and is governed only by necessary laws inherent in itself , we suppose all will admit to be atheism . The common name given to this substance and its inherent attributes is . N'ature . But let a writer strenuously nphold this same doctrine , only changing the name of the substance , and calling it God instead of Nature , and great offence is given , if he is pronounced an atheist . In like manner , some of the ancients , denying the existence of any other gods , believed in one infinite and omnipresent principle , which , though without foresight , intelligence , or personality , directed all events by its irresistible agency ; and this opinion , if not atheism , is admitted to be something very like it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naming this principle God instead of Fate , and they , forsooth , are good theists . Again we say , Do not let these remarks be misconstrued , or tortured into a charge against the good name of any particular writer . Our only purpose is , to illustrate the mischief and folly of introducing metaphysical theories into the domain of natural or revealed religion . Nor do we seek , in any manner , to depreciate the study of that science , which , as in some sense the head and fountain of most other sciences , assumes to itself , par excellence , the name of Philosophy . We attempt only to ascertain its proper limits , and to maintain its authority within those limits . And here we do but follow the admirable precept of Bacon , whose authority in this question , both as a philosopher and a believer , is surely entitled to respect . " Tantoque rnag*s heec vartitas inhibenda venit , et co*ircenda , quia ex divinorum et Itumartorum malesana admixtione , non solthm educitur philosophia pharttastica , sed etiarn religio ha3retica . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an innate idea , on which religion is founded , we observe , that it is contradicted // by the endless variety of religious systems , which have obtained in the world , and which still exist among men . This variety is precisely what might be expected , if the human race , feeling an irresistible impulse to reverence and adoration of something higher and holier than themselves , but having no primitive and common idea of the object of universal worship , should proceed to search for it with that degree of the light of nature and reason , which can be attained in different stages of refinement and mental cultivation . The savage makes his idol of a block or stone , and in many cases worships it with a fervor and self-sacrifice , that shame the colder homage offered by a civilized race to a nobler God . The half-enlightened barbarian finds a Divinity all around him , and peoples the mountains , the streams , and the forests with their attendant deities . More cultivated still , his thirst * for knowledge leads him to study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars become the gods of a religious system , which seems by comparison almost spiritual . Finally , whether by the last triumph of the unaided intellect , or by special revelation , the sublime doctrine of monotheism is preached to the world , and calls for the purest form and highest degree of reverence , of which the human heart is capable . How comprehensive and vague must be that universal idea , which is realized alike in the Fetish of the savage , the Olympic council of Grecian deities , the heavenly bodies , and the God of Christianity . No wonder , that the philosophers have chosen the most vague and ill-defined word in the language , - the " Infinite , " to express this common idea . We have discussed nearly all the forms , in which the a priori or demonstrative argument has presented itself , and our readers can decide for themselves on the justice of the extravagant pretensions , that have been advanced in its favor . The question about its amounting to a perfect demonstration of the point at issue is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any truth in logic , no question about real existence , nothing but general truths and pure abstractions , can be established by demonstrative reasoning . And with respect to these , the moment that the problem is solved , of finding the proper media of proof , and the chain of argument is complete , no doubt can be entertained for a moment of the reasoner 5 success . The mere existence of the question , therefore , is sufficient proof , that in this case he has failed . // No one doubts that the reasoning in Euclid is demonstrative , that the equality of the three angles of a triangle to two right angles is established with absolute certainty . But in this case , there are not only the atheists , who deny that the point is proved at all , but many believers , who can see nothing but a bundle of assumptions and sophistries in the argument , which , according to some persons , is apodictical . There is no escaping the force of this consideration , unless some one has the impudence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ validity of the a priori argument , there is not one who is capable of understanding it . We will not stoop to notice this allegation , further than by adverting to the fact , that in no form of this argument does the conclusion lie more than a step or two from the premises . The reasoning either of Descartes , Clarke , or Cousin , can be frilly stated , in three sentences . There are many persons , who are not able to read the Principic , or the JJkcanique Cc*lestc ; but very few , who can not put together the first three propositions in geometry . The question , whether it be good policy to expose the inconclusiveness of any argument adduced in favor of this greut doctrine , will not detain us long . Truth can stand on its own basis , and needs no support from sophistry . We do not hold to cheating people into the belief of any thing , - not even of the existence of a God . But , in respect to the good intentions of those who bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every prop on which the tottering faith of a single individual can by any possibility find support , this consideration should not be so summarily put aside . We affirm , then , that the question does not relate to the entire validity , but to the proper character of certain pioofs . It has been shown , that the reasoning both of Descartes and Clarke involves an element a posteriori , that the whole force of it rests upon this element , and consequently , that , when the argument is properly stated , it is perfectly legitimate and conclusive . We feel no scruple in combating the reasoning of Cousin , in the precise form in which he stated it , for that philosopher himself has unwittingly exposed its atheistical tendency . * But the other forms of the a priori argument , when stripped of the metaphysical abstractions and sophistries , by // which they are encumbered and rendered unintelligible to many minds , and of the pretension to absolute certainty , which serves only to discredit the other proofs , when placed beside them , may all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tending , with more or less force , to substantiate the truth , which all minds are interested in supporting . We remark , further , that this anxiety to preserve every argument , so that the question may be decided by their cumulative weight , appears rather inconsistent on the part of those reasoners , who affirm that several of these proofs amount to a perfect demonstration . The mathematician is quite satisfied , when he has found one mode of demonstrating a proposition , and never thinks of searching for another , except as a matter of pure curiosity . But an unwillingness is manifested to reduce the great doctrine of the Divine existence to the class of contingent truths ; and it is openly asserted , that , in the endless series of years , which we are here obliged to contemplate , an argument founded only on probabilities gradually wastes away , and finally disappears entirely . Ii ere is the very mistake , which we have already commented upon , of supposing that moral and demonstrative reasoning differ not only in kind , but in degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which rests upon moral certainty is equally conclusive and satisfactory with a principle which is established with absolute certainty and we appeal to the convictions and conduct of the whole human race in support of this assertion . If it were no more possible to doubt the being of a God , than for any individual to doubt , that his own death must happen some time within a century , atheism and skepticism would be practically impossible . But there are a multitude of contingent truths , in comparison with which even the probability of death appears faint and uncertain . Human intellect is made up from them man 's life is guided by them from the cradle to the grave . To affect anxiety , lest men should have no more evidence for believing the great doctrine of theology , than they have for thinking that food will nourish , fire burn , or water drown them ; that any city exists , which they have not visited ; that any person lives , with whom they have not conversed ; or that any one intelligent being exists except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by supposing , that the faith which they have in these things , whatever it may be , can be // increased and strengthened by a metaphysical argument made up of pure abstractions , which the greater part of mankind can not understand at all , and would pay no attention to it , even if it were intelligible . The assertion which we are now considering goes the whole length of affirming , that merely probable evidence in this inquiry is not satisfactory , and ought to be rejected altogether . Let those who make it remember , that the ablest supporters of the argument a priori frankly admit , - what appears , indeed , on the very face of their proof ,  --  that the intelligence of the Deity can not be substantiated by their reasoning , and must be accepted , if at all , on the ground of moral conviction . Are they prepared to maintain , that , while the being of a God is demonstrated , his intelligence is not satisfactorily proved , and ought not to be admittej ? Are they willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed an absurdity , but that any faith in his wisdom and providence is fallacious ; that we have no good grounds for supposing him to be any thing else than an unconscious principle , acting from blind necessity , without intention or foresight ? No ; they are not ready to defend or believe this monstrous proposition . Though the philosophers , to whose guidance they have unwisely committed themselves , really contemplated this consequence of their reasoning , and wished to inculcate it , their Christian disciples , at least , rather than accept such a corollary , will gladly renounce the demonstration . In arguing against the sufficiency of moral evidence for the being of an Infinite Creator , by alluding to the endless lapse of years , which , according to some reasoners , it is necessary to consider in the reasoning , there is a want of fullness and precision in stating the difficulty . At the first view , the objection does not appear pertinent , for what has eternity to do with the question ? The lapse of time does not affect truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will possess the same value and degree countless ages hence , as it did centuries ago ; for then , even as now , " the heavens declared the glory of God , and the firmament showed his handy-work . " The circumstances or phenomena , on which the argument is founded , remaining the same , or being constantly reproduced , the conclusion must follow with equal certainty through all time . We admit , that // if the argument from design inferred the being of a God only from an act of creation , which took place six thousand years ago , or more , the difficulty alleged assumes meaning and pertinency , though it has little value . It is founded on the noted atheistical assumption , as old , at least , as Lucretius , that a fortuitous concourse of atoms in an infinite series of years may take the appearance of regularity and adaptation ; - that the chance of order is at least one out of an infinite number of chances of disorder , and therefore must* occur at least once during an eternity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , - that an infinite series of ages has passed , we can only infer from the phenomena around us , that we live at the particular epoch in eternity 's history , when chance has assumed the appearance of order and design . Thus , by the anxiety to invalidate or throw a suspicion on the argument from final causes , which encourages us to look for proof , not in abstract propositions , but over the whole face of nature , the objector unwittingly gives in to that low theory of materialism , which represents the universe as a great machine , that was wound up at the time of creation , and has continued to go on mechanically ever since , without interference , oversight , or support from its Maker . He forgets , that the difficulty alleged has neither force nor pertinency , when the argument from design is so stated as to prove , not merely that a God did exist , when the world was created , but that he exists now , and is continually manifesting himself in fresh works of wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building a world . It continues and acts , and creation is constantly going on around us . The argument from design , properly applied , gives proof of intelligence and activity from the continuance , and not merely from the beginning , of things . It proceeds not only from the creation of the race , but from the birth of the individual . In the seed which swelled under the last night 's rain , in the shoot which appeared under this morning 's sun , it finds proof of ever present and ever acting power . To the reflecting theist , " The world 's unwithered countenance Is bright as at creation 's day , " and reflects as clearly its Maker 's image . Having already glanced at this aspect of the argument in a former article , our // limits will not permit us now to enter the broad field of remark and illustration which it opens . But a single view may be taken of it , from a point which lies so near the metaphysical argument , that it may be acceptable to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning . Admitting , for a moment , the general principle , which we regard as wholly indefensible and unphilosophical , that in the material universe the argument from the effect to the cause finds place only at the beginning of a succession of beings , and not at any one link in that succession , in the world of mind we have irrefragable evidence at every step , which leads us up from the created directly to the Creator . This evidence appears in the essential unity of personality , in our recognition of the indivisible Ego in consciousness . I am one . The living , sentient , thinking being , which I call set , possesses a separate and indivisible existence . It is necessarily one , for we can not conceive of it as many , or as separable , or divisible in any sense . Such a supposition is an absurdity . But I began to be ; for time was when I was not . Then whence came I ? The theory , - which we are here taking for granted in respect to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an individual 's existence to the first creation of the race to which he belongs , which considers intelligent life as continuous through a succession of beings , one springing out of another , and then giving birth to a third , by virtue of principles infused or machinery contrived in the race , when the original progenitor of it was formed , - this theory , we say , will not hold in the present case . It is contradicted by the great fact of my existence as an indivisible unit . Complexity of parts , according to the materialist 's hypothesis , is essential to the propagation of existence . The seed exists in the fruit ; the germ exists in the seed . It is afterwards taken from the fruit and the seed , and begins to exist as a distinct plant . But this is the commencement of its separate , not of its total being . It existed before ; it was in the parent plant , as a part of it , and its birth was not a creation , but a division of existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a flower , an animal , is not the creation of any thing new , hut the developement of a germ , which existed ages before , - which has lived ever since the world was . But the beginning of intellectual life , the essential unity of which is attested by consciousness , can not be ex // plained by mere separation . It can not give birth to another by division of itself . In fine , the materialist affirms , that birth is but a separation , and growth but an accretion and assimilation , of parts that previously existed , though in an inorganic state ; for it is a necessary part of this hypothesis , that the number of primary particles in the universe is neither more nor less than it was at the creation . Meeting him on his own ground , we reply , that his own personal existence is certain proof , that at least one unit has been added to the mass of being , since the formation of the universe . Of course , we have every reason from analogy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , even animal and vegetable , is the addition of a unit to the sum of being , and therefore a direct act of creation , as much as the building of a world or a system . But only in intellectual life have we positive evidence of this fact from consciousness . Fully to expose the erroneousness of that grovelling theory of materialism , which deprives this fair universe of the present and continuous agency of the Creative Mind , would carry us far beyond our present limits . Returning , therefore , to a *consideration of the course , which is likely to afford most support to the doctrines of Natural Religion , it may be remarked , that the only effectual answer to the objections of the metaphysical skeptics consists in showing , that their reasoning is wholly inapplicable and impertinent . Of course , the atheist must be met wherever he is to be found ; but he can be successfully met as well by showing that his arguments have no bearing upon the point at issue , as by exposing the fallacy and inconclusiveness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the skeptical objections to the doctrine of the Divine existence are of a metaphysical character , and are directed solely against the unwise assertion , that the reasoning of the theist is demonstrative . The two most formidable opponents of the doctrine , Hume and Kant , reasoned entirely in this manner . Probably neither of them wholly disbelieved the doctrine itself , but , with all the perverse ingenuity of a skeptical turn of mind , and the pride of a subtile intellect in detecting and exposing the assumptions and sophistries of the metaphysicians , they labored to create an apparent opposition between the faith of the heart and the deductions of the understanding . They attacked , not the Christian believer , but the philosophical dogmatist . They // showed triumphantly the inconclusiveness of the demonstration , hut left untouched the overwhelming probability arising from the moral argument . Kant expressly admitted , that the proof from final causes , if not set forward as a demonstration , is sound and legitimate . Arriving at the same conclusion by a different road , Hume attacked the necessary reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both in his writings and conduct , that we must believe in a causal connexion ; and some passages in his later writings are construed , not without reason , to imply that he himself , on this ground , admitted the being of a God . He was a better reasoner and a more acute thinker than most of his opponents , for he perceived the exact reach and application of his own a1*guments . Both of these philosophers were guilty of a want of ingenuousness , perhaps also of a direct intention to deceive , by not constantly avowing that their objections reached the theistical argument , so far only as it claimed to be a demonstration of the point at issue , and thereby leaving it to be inferred that they invalidated the whole proof . And this erroneous inference has been confirmed by the course adopted by many Writers on the opposite side , who , more anxious to defend metaphysics than to support Natural Theology , have unwisely joined issue on the point as presented by the skeptics , and failing , - where , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have expected failure , - to establish the proof as a demonstration , they have allowed their own ill-success to be imputed to the weakness of their cause . And yet they turn round on one who advises the abandonment of this point , which nobody but a metaphysician cares any thing about , and accuse him of withdrawing the props of theological science , and weakening the position of the theist . If Natural Theology be placed on the same level with the other inductive sciences , the great truths which it involves are for ever secured against the assaults of general skepticism and atheistical philosophy . No reasoning can touch it , which does not in a still greater degree affect the certainty of every proposition in human science . The irrelevancy of nearly every atheistical argument , which can he found in the books , will appear at the first glance ; and the skeptic must either abandon the discussion altogether , or find some mode of attacking religious truth , without making at the same time the insane attempt to crush the whole fabric of man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be taken , unless the defender of theism will give up his pride in metaphysics , and his undue pretensions . He can not deny to his opponent the use of such weapons as he wields himself . He can not reject in one part of the argument the issue which he offers in another . While one party reasons with Descartes and Clarke , the other will reply with Hume , Spinoza , and Kant ; and , where entire victory is not possible on either side , the advantage will always remain with the skeptic . It is very true , that the doctrine of the being of a God would be set aside by the establishment of universal skepticism , - by a system of philosophy which destroys all belief , tears up all the sciences by the roots , and leaves mankind incapable of knowledge , action , or hope . But in such a general calamity , who cares what single plank is saved from the wreck ? Why is Natural Theology singled out as the only science that is to he burdened with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy all , and in warding off which , of course , all the sciences are equally interested ? The geologist , the chemist , the astronomer , do not deem it necessary to commence their labors with a demonstration of the fundamental principles of belief , and the sufficiency of the human faculties for the pursuit of truth . They leave this task for the metaphysician , as falling wholly within his province . Let him go on with his proper work of erecting intrenchments along the whole borders of human belief , and making incursions into the ground of skepticism , and we hid him God speed in the enterprise . But do not let him fasten on the one fact which is dearest of all to man , as if that alone were interested in his success , and thereby make it alone responsible for all his mistakes and failures . Let him , at least , give some plausible reasons for such a course ; let him show some ground of distinction between Natural Theology and Natural Philosophy , which compels the proficient to adopt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be laughed at for using in regard to the latter . The being of a God is a truth of practical and vital importance . The defence of philosophy against the assaults of general skepticism is a purely speculative contest . Whichever way determined , it never affected the actions of any sane person since the world began . Hume ate his dinner , not doubting that the effect of the food would be to nourish and strengthen his body ; and // he wrote and published his books , fully believing that intelligent people would read them , though he had no grounds to believe that any such persons existed , except by arguing from experience , - from the indications of intelligence and design . And yet he sought to deter men from believing in the existence of a God , by arguments that ought to have prevented him from swallowing food , or from writing a line . No ! we do him wrong ; he expected no such thing . He proposed a logical puzzle for the philosophers to solve , and they strangely supposed that all religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Natural Religion only were at stake , - if the evil stopped with the injudicious treatment of the argument for the being of a God , - this protest against the introduction of purely speculative metaphysics might seem to be ? too warmly expressed . Unhappily , the mischief does not end here . No one , who has watched the progress of speculation of late years , can be ignorant of the use made of the intimate connexion between religion and philosophy , to set up a claim of precedence and authority for the latter , which is wholly of human origin , and to reduce the former to a mere province to be governed , modified , and altered at will . That ominous phrase , " the philosophy of religion " is constantly dinned into our ears , even by theologians , while we seek in vain for any evidence of the religious character of the popular philosophy . The effect thus far has been , to give to all the doctrines of faith something of the wavering and unsettled air , which belongs to the fluctuations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems . The question is not like one between different theological sects , which acknowledge a common rule and guide , but it concerns the establishment of a new standard , by which all forms of religion are to be tried . In fine , the question is , whether we are to have a religious faith with something fixed , with the God of nature and the Scriptures to rest upon , or whether we are to take such a one as the philosophers will make for us , which shall be one thing under the system of Kant , and another tinder that of Cousin . If it were not for the serious character of the subject , one might even be amused at the extravagance of the claims put forward by speculative metaphysicians , and their assumption of perfect authority to decide on all matters of religious belief . // They ground their theories on the supposed intuitive ideas and convictions of the soul , which are multiplied and characterized at random , and which it is sensualism , or atheism , or something worse , to question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they call a structure of demonstrative reasoning , they arrive at results that are necessary , - which mankind must believe . To these results , all preconceived notions , all matters of mere religious faith , all revelations grounded on testimony , or other sources of what is only moral evidence , must either give way or conform . Take an instance in what is commonly termed the Transcendental Philosophy , or the system of Kant . By a critical survey of the human understanding , he undertook to separate what is contingent , empirical , and uncertain in man 's belief , from what is absolute , original , and imperative . Confining the term knowledge , to those elements which present these latter characteristics , he attempted to determine and classify them all under the name of the " a priori conceptions of pure reason , " and thus to supply an immovable basis for all future systems of philosophy . In this undertaking he followed the example of Descartes , who , as we have seen , propounded his theory in order to do away with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a foundation with absolute certainty for future effort . As the scheme , in both instances , covered the whole field of human knowledge , the dogma of the Divine existence came naturally to he examined , and its claims to be discussed , by both writers . But in this portion of the task the Frenchman was more fortunate than his German successor . Descartes fancied , that he had found a demonstrative proof of the being of a God , and this doctrine was accordingly built into his theory , as a component part of it . Kant was not so happy . He tried all the proofs that had been offered , and found them all defective ; and he completed his work by proving to a demonstration , that no proof could be offered , that the subject lay entirely beyond the reach of the human faculties , that the arguments for and against , must always balance each other , and , consequently , that no decision xxas possible . But , as it appeared that men were not very willing to give up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the " Critique of Practical Reason , " or the survey of the moral faculty , Kant found occasion to admit the // doctrine in question , not as substantiated by any process of reasoning , - for this he expressly disclaims , - but as an assumption , a postulate , a proposition which men must believe , though they can show no reason for it . At this point , the theory was taken up by a zealous disciple , and carried forward to the criticism of revealed religion on the same principles , which had settled so satisfactorily the claims of Natural Theology . Fichte 's " Critique of all Revelation " was only the anticipation of a work subsequently performed by Kant himself ; the same results , substantially , being obtained , that were afterwards developed in Kant 's treatise , entitled " Religion within the Limits of mere Reason . " Fichte proposed to establish a " Critique , " that is , a fundamental examination on the principles of the Critical , or Transcendental , philosophy , not of that revelation in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular , but of all possible revelations . In other words , supposing the existence of a God , and of a race of beings constituted and situated as we are , he proposes to determine whether it he possible , that he should make a special communication to his creatures , and , if so , in what way it is possible . The inquiry is to be carried on , not as a mere speculation , but like a piece of mathematical reasoning , and the results , if any are obtained , are to be as little susceptible of doubt , as any theorem in Euclid . And what are the results , at which the inquirer arrives in this bold attempt to settle the bounds of human belief , and prescribe laws to Omnipotence , as to the manner in which he shall make known his will to mankind ? Why , that any revelation is unnecessary and impossible , at least , that it can never be recognised as such , though we may wish to believe in it ; - that the revealed doctrine can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - that , if it contains any thing more than the law written in our own hearts , it can not be of divine origin ; and , if it be perfectly coincident with that law , it is useless , and can in no proper sense be called a revelation ; - that , although the conception of a miracle is possible , a miraculous event can never be known as such , from the want of a sufficient test ; - and that a revelation by means of such events could not be addressed to any persons but those who had lost even the desire to comply with the demands of conscience , and its usefulness even to them would cease , // when the moral sense was once awakened . Such is the result of a system of philosophy , that sets up the entire supremacy of the " a priori conceptions of pure reason , " and of demonstrative reasoning founded upon them , - thus erecting a metaphysical tribunal , before which all faith in God , in the Scriptures , in *mny revelation , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected at will . The sophism in respect to revealed religion is precisely the same with that which we have attempted to expose in the province of Natural Theology . Beginning with the assumption , that moral evidence in such a case is wholly unsatisfactory and deceptive ; and , seeking for demonstration where , from the nature of the case and the laws of the human mind , it can not be obtained , they find it not , and consequently declare , that man 's faith is vain , and all religious belief properly so called , is a mere delusion . Of course , a revelation attested by miracles is an external fact , and must be proved , if at all , by testimony and experience . But these are sources only of moral reasoning ; and , as such a proof , even when carried to the highest extent , is declared to be insufficient to establish the belief in a God , so it can not confirm our faith in a revelation of God to men . In the latter case , unfortunately , demonstration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , nothing remains but to renounce our faith in revelation altogether . This is but a single specimen of the arrogant manner in which the claims of religious faith are treated by those writers , who assume that all theology is but a province of philosophy , but one speculation among many others , all of which must be brought to their tribunal , and judged by the standard of their metaphysical theory . In the flood of philosophical systems in Germany , the publication of which followed the daring innovations of Kant , many other exaniples might be found of an equally summary and destructive treatment of the doctrines both of natural and revealed religion . The infidel movement in that country , hardly second in extent and importance to that which the Encyclopedists commenced in France , if it did not take its rise among the philosophers , certainly borrowed from them its arms , its general aspect , and its influence . The infidel publications are saturated with the terminology , the forms , and the doctrines of the modern schools of metaphysics , to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has not a previous knowledge of this new philosophical jargon . We know that an attempt is made , to trace the commencement of these infidel speculations in Germany , beyond the philosophers of that country , to the influence of the English deists , as the5r are termed , - to the writings of Collins , Tindal , Chubb , and Morgan . Those who can find in the speculations referred to , any of the characteristics of the English tone of thought , any traces of similarity in argument and doctrine between the two classes of writers , must be gifted with greater powers of perception than are usual , or , what is far more likely , - with a predisposition to find or see nothing to the prejudice of German metaphysics . The purpose of such a strange assertion , is to trace the root of the evil , not to its home among those modern speculations in which it took its rise and its peculiar aspect , but to another country , and to a class of unbelievers , whose errors may with some show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the singular fate of this last-mentioned philosopher , whose writings , more than any others of the class to which they belong , are pervaded with the Christian spirit , and devoted to a defence of the Christian faith , to be made accountable for nearly all the speculative errors and infidel opinions , which have been broached since his time . It is not enough , that the skepticism of Hume , and the sensualism of Condillac are laid to his charge , but he must be made accountable also , by implication at least , for the extravaganzas of a set of German infidels in our own day ; though it would be difficult to find a stronger contrast , in point of thought , expression , and doctrine , than that which exists between their speculations and the writings of the father of English philosophy . The idle calumny , which imputes to him the origin of the debasing theory , entertained by the French sensual school of the last century , has been refuted a hundred times , and deserves no further notice . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if understood to mean that the philosophy of the latter especially favors the skepticism of the former , or leads to it by necessary implication , so that Hume became an infidel only because he studied Locke , and not in spite of such study , is wholly untrue . The subtile and wary skeptic , whose enterprise was not to build , but to destroy , - who intended to confute // the philosophers on their own ground , founded his reasonings on what was the popular philosophy of his day . He horrowed his principles from the " Essay on the Human Understanding , " just as he would have borrowed them , if he had lived in our times , from the speculations of Kant and Cousin . A skeptic hy nature and temperament , and not by education or by consequence of opinions imbibed from others , his writings were intended to be , not a continuation or a developement of Locke 's philosophy , but a refutation of it . He was not half so much indebted to his English predecessor , as Spinoza was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father of French philosophy the atheism or pantheism of the infidel Jew ? But we protest against mingling the doctrines of theology with any metaphysical speculations , - against identifying the cause of religious truth with the defence of any human system . It matters not whether Locke or Descartes , Spinoza or Kant , Cousin or Schelling , be the individual selected , through whose theories we are to attack , defend , or modify man 's faith in things which are not of this world . The mixture is of two incongruous things , and nothing can result from it but a bastard compound , which will have all the defects , but none of the excellences , of either ingredient . In calling for a separation , nothing more is claimed for theology , than is granted by universal consent to the other sciences . Why is the theologian only to be followed with the constant accusation of being deluded by the sensual system , when he simply opens his eyes upon the universe around him , and reasons upon the information afforded by the senses ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same thing ? These provinces of science are kept as distinct as possible from theory and pure speculation , and are made to consist of observed facts , and immediate deductions from those facts . Metaphysical systems are contrived from time to time , with a view to cover the whole field of knowledge but the authors of them do not attempt directly to change the methods , modify the principles , or do away with the results of the inductive sciences . They are known to carry with them the habits of mind peculiar to their profession , - what Bacon expressly calls , " the smoke and tarnish of the furnace " ; the tendency to generalize rapidly , to make sweeping innovations , to form new and entire theories , unchecked // by the presence of determinate and admitted facts , which in other branches of knowledge oppose an effectual barrier to the license of innovation and system-making . Theology has its facts , also , the most real and momentous of all . The beacon light of religious truth burns clear and steadily in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical speculation are glancing about through brake , morass , and thicket , too often indicating the presenc* of miasmata from swan ) ps , or poisonous exhalations from graveyards . Those who talk so much of the philosophy of religion , and of the necessity that it should keep pace with the constant advancement of the human mind , either use words without any meaning attached to them , or else they confound two perfectly distiuct things , - religious progress in the individual soul , and the improvement of theology as a science . The former is possible to an unlimited extent . The whole of human life is a probation , the law of which is progress . But the only rational conception of Christian Theology is that of something more fixed and durable than the everlasting hills . The great truth of the being of a God , the great law of the Scriptures , lie there as standards , as ultimate points , beyond which there is no advancement , and from which there is no appeal . An individual may come to have a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deity though even here the improvement is rather of the heart , than of the intellect . But there are no discoveries to be made respecting the Divine nature , in the same sense as we speak of discoveries in human science . " Who can by searching find out God ? Or who can understand the Almighty to perfection ? " We can take away the conception of a God , and substitute an abstract idea , or a block of wood , it matters not which , - in its place ; but we can not amend or enlarge that conception , as it exists in a mind of ordinary powers and cultivation . There is no progress possible beyond monotheism , just as there was a progress from Fetichism to polytheism , and from that to the true doctrine of one God . In like manner , the Scriptures form an ultimate tribunal in Christian Theology . Questions about their interpretation may arise , but the sense , when ascertained , is admitted to be absolute and decisive . Some persons may reject their authority ; they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Christianity is " as old as the creation . " // But it does not follow from such a discovery , that they have made any progress in theology ; they have simply ceased to he Christians . To unite theology with metaphysics is to break away from the two great anchors of religious faith , and then to drift about at random with a science , that acknowledges no restraint , has no fixed principles , and has never found a stay or a resting-place . Not all the authority ascribed to intuitive conceptions not all the pride of demonstrative reasoning founded upon them , will he sufficient to check the frequency of errors and fluctuations , or to afford a fixed basis for future inquiry . The subject of investigation is too vast , the method of procedure too ill-determined , the idea of the results to he gained is too vague , to allow us to hope , that speculative philosophy will ever advance with a firmer step , or to a better purpose , than it has done through all past time . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found to prove one thing with a Descartes , and directly the opposite thing with a Kant . The attempt is equally absurd and impious to break down the landmarks of religious faith , and to involve the dearest hopes of mankind in the uncertain and shifting fortunes of such an enterprise . Some persons are not content with the proposed union between the two subjects of contemplation , but claim entire supremacy for human science . According to their theory , there are many stages of progress for the human intellect , and men pass on from religion to philosophy , as they do from barbarism to civilization . The spontaneous but rude developement of the religious principle is followed by the more vigorous and sure growth of reflection , and philosophy becomes " the highest and last developement of human nature , the final accomplishment of human thought . " But not to appear too presumptuous , not to shock the feelings of mankind too much , philosophy is represented as tolerant and liberal ; as superseding religion , it is true , in the minds of the cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an imperfect likeness of itself , in the hulk of mankind . These views may be best illustrated by a quotation from Cousin , in whose lectures they are ably and eloquently set forth . The extract is a choice one , and we commend it to the particular attention of the Christian admirers of the great Eclectic . Philosophy , in the great body of the people , exists under // the primitive , profoundly impressive , and venerable form of religion and of worship . Christianity is the philosophy of the people . He who now addresses you sprang from the people and from Christianity ; and I trust you will always recognise this , in my profound and tender respect for all that is of the people and of Ch.ristianity . Philosophy is patient ; she knows what was the course of events in former generations , and she is full of confidence in the future ; happy , in seeing the great bulk of mankind in the arms of Christianity , she offers , WITH MODEST KINDNESS , her hand to Christianity , to assist her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admirable condescension ! M. Cousin stands forth as the self-appointed representative of all philosophy , and kindly patronizes Christianity . But we must save our feelings by speaking in a straight-forward way . If the absurdity and egregious self-conceit , which are so conspicuous in this passage , did not throw a strong light on the real value and probable influence of this writer 's speculations , it might be necessary to call attention to their infidel character . But they may now be left to find their own level . The cause of re ligious truth has nothing to fear or to hope from such patrons , or from such assailants . In France , the popularity of Cousin 's philosophy has superseded that of Condillac , and many imagine , that under its influence , a reaction has taken place in favor of religion , against the materialism and the infidelity of the last age . Even if we were ignorant of the facts , there would be good reason to suspect the reality , and the pure character , of a religious movement produced by such a cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tali auxilio , nec defensori bus istis . " But we are able to offer soni*e direct testimony respecting the true nature of this religious reaction . A recent number of the Journal des D*bats , the ablest and most influential newspaper in France , contains an interesting letter from one of the editors to the Bishop of Chartres , in reply to a severe censure which that prelate had passed upon an article on the state of the French church . From this letter , dated the 20th of December last , we translate a few paragraphs , which were written , it is true , for the meridian of Paris ; but they may not be wholly inapplicable further west . Elle se contente de lui tendre doucement Ia main , et de I'aider *t ver plus haut encore . ( . /lttention marqucie dan , s lauditoire. ) " - Cours de l'Histoire de La Philosophic : Deuxilme Le*on. // 395 CC For some years past , we have heard much talk about the religious reaction . It is proclaimed from the house-tops ; it is announced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when we begin to search after this strange phenomenon , what do we find ? We enter pretty little churches , with gilded ceilings , well warmed and ca*rpeted , where one finds himself too comfortably placed on earth to be able to spend a thought on heaven . We hear the Credo sung with a waltz accompaniment , and dancing tunes played at the elevation of the Host . If a sermon is preached , the speaker feels obliged to disguise the objects of worship before presenting them to us , - to cover them up under all the frippery required by the taste of the age ; and how can it be expected , that preachers should prove the divine character of that , which they themselves are striving to render common and secular . Think you , that they talk to us about the Gospel , and about Christian morals ? No ; no such thing . They preach about Pythagoras , and Epicurus , and Spinoza ; or they have something to say about the invasion of the Goths , borrowing prosy remarks from writers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church asking ourselves , what we have to do with Epicurus , and whether this is what is meant by a religious reaction . in " We find a new class of Christians springing up around us the fashionable and literary world , who make a parade of their melancholy and their religious faith in halting verses , and prate about the Bhagavad Gita and the Zendavista , and the other topics of those lectures on philosophy , which are designed for people who wish to talk about every thing in general and nothing in particular . And these insipid persons , incapable . alike of skepticism or belief , are constantly wearying us with harangues about the religious reaction . " You will not suspect me , Sir , of the presumption and bad taste of wishing to read the clergy a lecture on theology . I do but give you the impression of those who live in this secular world , when I say , that perhaps the church was never in a more dangerous situation than it is at present . The greatest proof of the strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an assault , not a war , but the peace , the conciliatory measures , the universal toleration , with which it is surrounded . We ask only for faith of one kind or another ; we accept every thing , and we would invent a religion , rather than be without one altogether . It behoves the members of the church to organize and turn to profit this necessity of believing something , which is now appearing amongst us , and , above all , to arrest it in its almost irresistible inclination towards mysticism . " The priests have not understood this condition of things . // They have mistaken this readiness to accept any faith for a religious reaction . The misfortune of Christianity is , that they no longer fight against it ; it is embalmed , it is sanctified ; it is canonized like a saint . But you know better than I , Sir , that saints are only canonized after their death . It is dangerous to allow one 's self to be made a relic of . The priests have gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped from the terrible attack of Voltaire , they hailed what was only disgust and *veariness at materialism as a disposition to return to religion . In their eyes , every one who was a spiritualist became a religious man ; every one who repudiated the Encyclop&amp;iie , became a Christian . In their eagerness to rescue all minds from the philosophy of the last century , they accepted professions of faith , without being at all rigid in respect to rites and doctrines . They opened the gates to religious liberalism . They made a breach , and through this breach have entered pell-mell , pietism , sentimentalism , symbolism , and all sorts of Germanism . They no longer preach upon morals and doctrines , but upon Christian philosophy , and all kinds of historical and msthetical generalities . At the present time , we want nothing better than religious belief ; but , if we must accept , as articles of faith , all that we hear from the pulpit , and as words of the Gospel , all the pitiable rhapsodies and contemptible contests about words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no wonder that our faith wavers and our hearts incline to doubt . " This is a lively picture of the confusion that results , when an erratic speculative philosophy assumes the name and garb of religion , without any of its spirit , and substitutes its own vague and unmeaning generalities in place of the vital truths of Natural Theology , and the doctrines of the Gospel . It remains to be seen , whether the study of the same writers and the prevalence of ' the same tastes will ever produce a counterpart to this state of things on our side of the Atlantic . One security against such an evil consists in the fact , that the antecedent circumstances in the two cases are different . We are not recovering from the prolonged torpor of materialism and infidelity , in order to be thrown by a reaction into the wilds of a mystical philosophy , and a heated , vague , and unsettled faith . It is an idle task to preach against sensualismn and the empirical philosophy to the descendants of the Puritans ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French declaimers , whose words have no // applicability or meaning for the western world . There are no admirers of Condillac among us ; and , if there are a few imitators of the Baron d ' Holbach , their errors were not caused by the prevalence of one system of philosophy , nor will they be converted by the introduction of another . Metaphysical arguments will not cure that blindness and insensibility of heart and intellect , of which ignorance and heedlessness are the primary and the sustaining causes . Instead of calling upon such men to close their eyes and ears , and distrust the information given by their senses , for fear 4hey should be deluded by empiricism , or some other philosophical bughear , rather bid them open their minds and hearts to the sights and sounds of creation , and hear and see everywhere proofs of the being of a God . Preach the Gospel to them instead of metaphysical speculations , - remembering the pregnant aphorism of Bacon ; " As to seek philosophy in divinity is to seek the dead amongst the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living amongst the dead .
