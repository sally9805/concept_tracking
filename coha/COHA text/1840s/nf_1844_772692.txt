TO MY CLASSMATES IN THEOLOGY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives can be called to mind with so much ease and distinctness , as the years which we spent together in theological studies . The events of that short season , and the sentiments we then indulged , are clothed with a freshness and interest which the lapse of time can not efface . Among the questions that occupied our thoughts , no one perhaps was so absorbing , or attended with such deep and anxious feeling , as that which respected the field of labor to which each should devote his life . And many of us then , I remember , made a mutual engagement , that if spared and permitted for years to labor in different portions of the vineyard of the Lord , we would communicate to each other our mature views in regard to the claims of different fields . Thirteen years have elapsed ; and I propose to fulfil my engagement , by expressing , in the form of the present little volume , the views which I now entertain in regard to the claims of foreign lands . To you , my beloved classmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a frankness and freedom , which might possibly be construed into presumption , if I were addressing strangers and elder brethren , I am sure that I shall fall under no such imputation when communicating my thoughts to you . I wish to express my thoughts familiarly , as we used to do to each other , and at the same time with the earnestness and solemnity which one ought always to feel when pleading for the perishing heathen . A free , full , and earnest discussion of such sentiments as those contained in this book , had no small influence , under God , in preparing the way for that extensive work of grace at these islands , which has been denominated the Great Revival . At the General meetings of the mission in the month of May of 1836 and 1837 , the main doctrines of this volume were thoroughly canvassed , and with deep effect upon every member present . Our feelings were enlisted , our hearts were warmed , and our thoughts were absorbed by the great topic of the world 's conversion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was allowed to take possession of our souls . It gave importunity to prayer , earnestness and unction to our conversation and sermons , and zeal , energy , and perseverance to every department of our work ; and the result was soon apparent in the wide-spread and glorious revival . It can almost be said , therefore , that the main sentiments of this volume have received the impress of the Divine approbation . In the fall of 1837 , I was constrained by family afflictions and the failure of my own health , to embark for the United States . As I began to breathe the bracing air of Cape Horn , my strength in a measure revived , and having no other employment on board ship , I sketched the outlines of most of the chapters of this little volume . My heart was full of the theme in the discussion of which I had taken part before my embarkation , and I penned my thoughts freely , amidst the tossings of the ship and the care of two motherless children . On my arrival in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had sketched , and delivered them , in connection with various historical lectures , at several places , as Providence gave me opportunity . Now , having returned to these islands , I have thought best to give the chapters a second revision , to dedicate the whole to you , and with the help of the press to send you each a copy , accompanying it with my prayers and my most affectionate salutations . And may I not expect , beloved classmates , that you will read the book with candor , weigh well its arguments , admit its entreaties to your hearts , as those of your former associate , and act in accordance with the convictions of duty ? Among the considerations that have prompted me to the train of thought contained in this book , as well as to the views interwoven in my history of the Sandwich Islands , I may mention , as not the least weighty and prominent , a dutiful respect and filial obedience to the instructions delivered to me , in connection with others , by the wise and devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign field . The delivery of those instructions was his last effort of the kind , and they may therefore be regarded as the parental accents of his departing spirit . On that occasion of interest , to which memory can never be treacherous , a part of the charge to us was in the following words : " From the very commencement of your missionary life , cultivate a spirit of enterprise . Without such a spirit , nothing great will be achieved in any human pursuit ; and this is an age of enterprise , to a remarkable and unprecedented extent . In manufactures , in the mechanic arts , in agriculture , in education , in the science of government , men are awake and active ; their minds are all on the alert ; their ingenuity is tasked ; and they are making improvements with the greatest zeal . Shall not the same enterprise be seen in moral and religious things ? Shall not missionaries , especially , aim at making discoveries and improvements in the noblest of all practical sciences  --  that of applying the means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world ? " There are many problems yet to be solved before it can be said , that the best mode of administering missionary concerns has been discovered . What degree of expense shall be incurred in the support of missionary families , so as to secure the greatest possible efficiency with a given amount of money ; how to dispose of the children of missionaries , in a manner most grateful to their parents , and most creditable to the cause ; in what proportion to spend money and time upon the education of the heathen , as a distinct thing from preaching the Gospel ; how far the press should be employed ; by what means the attention of the heathen can be best gained at the beginning ; how their wayward practices and habits can be best restrained and corrected ; how the intercourse between missionaries and the Christian world can be conducted in the best manner , so as to secure the highest responsibility , and the most entire confidence ; and how the suitable proportion between ministers of the Gospel retained at home , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as in principle : all these things present questions yet to be solved . There is room for boundless enterprise , therefore , in the great missionary field , which is the world . " I have not attempted to discuss all the topics here named , but have endeavored to cultivate in some degree , as enjoined in the paragraph , a spirit of enterprising inquiry . If this book shall impart any light on the interesting topic of Christian duty to the heathen , and be owned by the Saviour , in the great day , as having contributed , though but in a small degree , towards that glorious consummation of which the prophets speak , and to which we all look forward , I shall be richly rewarded . Your affectionate classmate , SHELDON DIBBLE . LAHAINALUNA , Feb. 17 , 1844 . THOUGHTS ON MISSIONS . CHAPTER I. THE TRUE SPIRIT OF MISSIONS . The apostles , under the guidance of the Holy Spirit , uniformly enforce their exhortations by tender appeals to the example , sufferings , and death of their ascended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ " humbled himself and became obedient unto death , even the death of the cross . " Is purity of life enjoined ? the plea is , Christ " gave himself for us , that he might redeem us from all iniquity , and purify unto himself a peculiar people . " Is liberality required ? we are pointed to Christ , who , " though he was rich , yet for our sakes became poor , that we through his poverty might be rich . " Is entire consecration to Christ enjoined ? the appeal is , " he died for all , that they who live should not henceforth live unto themselves , but unto him who died for them and rose again . " In like manner , in gaining a true idea of the spirit of missions , the proper course evidently is , to look at once at the missionary character of the Lord Jesus Christ . He was indeed a missionary . He came to save the lost . He was a missionary to us . He came to save us . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were in a state of despair . Nothing within the compass of human means could avail in the least to avert the impending wrath of God . All wisdom became foolishness . All resource was futile . Not a ray of hope remained  --  not the least flickering gleam . Whichever way the eye turned , there was darkness  --  horror  --  despair . But Christ came , and hope again visited the earth . It was when we were helpless  --  hopeless  --  justly exposed to the horrors and agonies of the world of woe , that Jesus undertook his mission , and appeared for our relief . This truth can not be too deeply impressed upon us , here , at the very threshold of our inquiries in regard to the spirit of missions ; and to spread it out distinctly before our minds , let us take a simple illustration . You are a captive in a foreign land , and have long been immured in a deep , damp , and gloomy dungeon . Sorrow , sighing , and tears have been your meat day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for of death , combined with hunger , cold , and a bed of straw , have induced disease , wasted your flesh , destroyed every energy , and entirely drank up your spirits . Sentence of death is pronounced against you , and the day fixed for your execution . The massive walls and iron grating look down sternly upon you , and rebuke at once all hope of escape . Entreaties , tears , and the offer of gold and silver have been tried , but in vain . Effort and means have given place to horror and despair . The prospect before you is the scaffold , the block , a yawning grave , and a dread eternity . In this extremity a friend appears , and offers to be substituted in your place . The offer is accepted . You , pale , emaciated , and horror-stricken , are brought from your dungeon to behold once more the light of day . The irons are knocked off from your hands and feet  --  your tattered garments exchanged for cleanly apparel  --  and a ship is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the bosom of your friends . The vital current of your soul , so long chilled and wasted , now flows again with warmth and vigor ; your eyes are lighted up , and tears of joy burst forth like a flood . But , in the midst of your joy , you are told of your deliverer . You turn , and behold ! the irons that were upon you are fastened upon him  --  he is clothed in your tattered garments  --  is about to be led to your gloomy dungeon  --  lie on your bed of straw , and thence to be taken in your stead to the scaffold or the block . You throw yourself at his feet , and entreat him to desist ; but when you find his purpose fixed , you finally wish you had a thousand hearts to feel the gratitude you owe , and ten thousand tongues to give it utterance . The Lord Jesus Christ has done for us all this , and unspeakably more . We were under condemnation . The sentence of God 's righteous law was against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All above and around us were the dark frowns of the Almighty and the red lightnings of his wrath . Beneath us was not merely a damp dungeon , but the bottomless pit yawning to receive us , and its flames ascending to envelope our guilty souls . There was no escape . The prospect was weeping , wailing , and gnashing of teeth  --  the agony of Jehovah 's frown forever . In this extremity the Saviour appeared  --  substituted himself in our stead  --  bare our sins in his own body on the tree  --  received upon his own agonized soul what was our due , and thus delivered us from the untold horrors of eternal death , and opened before us the gate of heaven . To save the lost , then , was the spirit of Christ . The apostles imbibed this spirit . It is the spirit of missions . The heathen are in a lost condition . If we have the spirit of Christ we shall do what we can to save them . The spirit of missions is not something different from , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply , essentially , and emphatically the spirit of Christ . It is compassion for the perishing ; and such compassion as leads the possessor to put forth strenuous efforts , and to undergo , if need be , the severest sufferings . As we shall look somewhat in detail at the manifestations of the spirit of Christ , we shall see very evidently the great outlines of what alone is worthy to be called the true spirit of missions . Look at the condescension of Christ , and learn a lesson of duty towards the destitute and degraded of our race . The Son of God , by whom were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth , whether they be thrones or dominions , principalities or powers ; who upholdeth all things by the word of his power ; before whom ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands prostrate themselves , ascribing power , and riches , and wisdom , and strength , and honor , and glory , and blessing ; of whom it is said , " Every knee shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in earth , and things under the earth "  --  the King eternal , immortal , invisible , the only wise God : this Infinite Being empties himself of his glory , and comes down to toil , suffer and die  --  and for whom ? For us worms of the dust , insects that are crushed before the moth . If the Saviour had come to our relief , clothed with the glory of heaven and surrounded by his holy angels , even that would have been a stoop of amazing condescension . But look at the babe of Bethlehem , born in a stable , and cradled in a manger ; follow him to Egypt , and then back to Nazareth . What humility , lowliness , and condescension ! Look at the Saviour in his public ministry . You find him oftenest among the poor , and always so demeaning himself as to be the one that was " meek and lowly in heart . " His chosen walk was such , that it could be said with emphasis , " to the poor the Gospel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such his condescension ! Such was the spirit of the apostles . They took much notice of the poor , and charged Paul and Barnabas , when going forth on their mission , especially to remember them . What else , I ask , is a missionary spirit , but to be willing to labor with self-denial and perseverance to elevate and save the low and the vile ? Natural men , in the pride of their hearts , are inclined to look down upon the wretched  --  to regard them with that kind of loathing and disgust which disinclines them to make sacrifices in their behalf . This dislike is such that I have often thought it to be a favor to the heathen , that they are far off and out of sight ; for if they were near and directly around many professed Christians , with all their defilement and ugliness in full view , much of the apparent sympathy for them which now exists , would be turned into contempt and cold neglect . But if such had been the superficial and ill-founded character of Christ 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour ? There is not a wretch now wallowing in the deepest mire of sin , who is so vile and low in our eyes , as we all were in the eyes of infinite purity . Yet the more wretched we were , the more deeply did Christ feel for us . This spirit of Christ is the only true spirit of missions  --  the only spirit that will make self-denying , continued , and persevering efforts to save the heathen . There is no romance in the practical and every-day duties of a missionary . The work is of a humble form , and emphatically toilsome . There is but little true missionary spirit in the world . It is not the sympathy of an hour , nor an enthusiasm awakened by romance , but the pure love of Christ in the soul , constraining the possessor to pray earnestly , and to labor cheerfully without notice or applause , for the lowest human objects ; and which finds a rich and sufficient reward for a life of toil in leading one ignorant slave , one degraded outcast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation . My observation in the field for thirteen years testifies to the fact , that no sympathy or enthusiasm will come down to the arduous details of missionary work , and persevere in it for years , that does not flow from such genuine and permanent love as our Saviour manifested when here upon earth . The more we become like Christ , the more shall we possess of the true missionary character . How slow we are to make real sacrifices for the good of others ! It was not so with Christ . He chose , for our good , to become a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief  --  to be rejected , despised and hated  --  to become a mark for the bitterest rage and the finger of scorn . Go to the garden of Gethsemane . There behold , what even the pencil of the angel Gabriel can not fully portray . There , in the stillness of the night , the Saviour retires to give vent to the bursting emotions of his soul . Deep sorrow , keen anguish , and excruciating agony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . His strength fails . Low he lies on the cold earth , and the drops from his pale and agonized features , like the clammy sweat of death  --  no , " like drops of blood "  --  fall to the ground . But the agony of his spirit does not perturb the submission of his soul , nor shake the steadfastness of his purpose . The furious mob arrive , and he calmly yields himself to their disposal . See him in the judgment-hall  --  meek under insults , forgiving under buffetings and abuse , submissive and quiet under the agonizing scourge . Then behold him , as faint from his gashes and his pains , and sinking under a heavy cross , he slowly moves towards Calvary . Look on , if your eyes can bear the sight . The rough spikes are driven through his feet and his hands  --  the cross is erected  --  the Lord of glory hangs between two thieves :  --  there , his torn , bleeding , writhing and excruciated body is to wear out its vitality in protracted agony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of anguish . O the deep  --  fathomless , untold agony of his soul , when under the hidings of his Father 's face he exclaimed , " My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ! " All this suffering and agony the Infinite Son of God endured , that we might be saved . He had a vivid and perfect view of all this , and yet voluntarily assumed it that we might live . In view of such an example , what shall we say ? If the Lord of glory shrunk not from ignominy and scorn , untold agony , exquisite torture and the most cruel death , can any one possess much of his spirit , and yet consider it too much to forego some of the comforts and delights of this fleeting life , and to labor and toil with perseverance and self-denial on a foreign shore , to instruct the destitute and the dying  --  to enlighten the millions and hundreds of millions of heathen , who have never heard the precious name of Jesus , and are entirely ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , even to expose one 's self to an early grave in a sultry clime , if necessary , that some ray of hope may break in upon the gloom of the benighted and perishing nations ? God be praised , that the prospect of death did not daunt the spirit of the self-denying Jesus ! O , how has a feeling of shame and deep humiliation come over my spirit , as I have heard the objection , that " Missionaries and missionaries ' wives especially go forth to die ! " Thanks to the continued grace of God , that some of this spirit of Jesus  --  the self-sacrificing spirit , the spirit of devotement , even unto death  --  still exists on earth . Let the objector inquire seriously , whether much of it reigns in his own bosom ; and whether in proportion as he is destitute of it , he be not lacking not only in the spirit of missions , but in the spirit of Christ , without which it is impossible to be a disciple . For it is true not only of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not their own  --  that they are bought with a price ; and are under obligations of entire consecration , each in his appropriate sphere , that are as high as heaven and as affecting as the scenes of Gethsemane and Calvary . And we are bound , equally with the early disciples , to count it not only a duty , but " all joy " to labor , suffer and die , if necessary , for Christ 's sake , and in the good work which he has given us to do . Did we become sensible of our lost condition ? Did we with one accord lift up our penitent and broken-hearted cries to the God of mercy , that he would provide a way for our salvation ? Did the angels intercede in our behalf that the Saviour would come ? No : self-moved he appeared for our relief . He beheld us wedded to our sinful courses ; unwilling to be taken from the pit into which we had plunged ourselves , and clinging with unyielding grasp to the very instruments of our ruin  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our souls . The more disinclined we were to sue for mercy , the more the Saviour pitied us ; for our very unwillingness to supplicate showed the depth of our ruin . In like manner , the more indisposed any heathen nation may be to receive us to their shores , admit the light of the Gospel and partake of its blessings , the more deeply should we feel for them , and the more zealously labor for their salvation . That a nation has not called for our aid , but is resolutely determined to keep us at a distance , is a strong argument for being deeply interested in their behalf . Their very blindness and maniac disposition should call forth the deep commiseration of our souls . Such was the spirit of Christ . Such is the true spirit of missions . It is but a small measure of compassion to aid those who supplicate our assistance . The very blindness , guilt , madness and vile degradation of a people , should be to us a sufficient voice of entreaty . They were so to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have undertaken the work of our redemption . O , when shall it be , that Christians and ministers of the Gospel shall arise self-moved , or rather moved by the spirit of Christ within them , and exert all their powers for the good of the perishing ? when they shall not need appeal upon appeal , entreaty upon entreaty , and the visit of one agent after another , to remind them of duty , and to persuade them to do it ? It was not a world of penitents that the Saviour pitied , but a world of rebels  --  proud and stubborn rebels , ready to spurn every offer of reconciliation . He saw us , not on our knees pleading for mercy , but scorning the humble attitude of suppliants , and raising our puny arms against the authority of Heaven . He beheld us , not as the Ninevites once were , in sackcloth and ashes , but recklessly violating all his holy laws . It was in view of all the deformity , bitterness , rage and heaven-daring impiety of our naked hearts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cross . It was for such beings that he voluntarily endured humiliation , toil , self-denial and death . He toiled and died for the ungodly . He came , though men despised his aid . He died even for his crucifiers . Are the heathen guilty  --  covered with blood and black with crime ? Do they exhibit many traits that are repulsive and horrid ? Would our visit to them fill them with rage and bitterness , and tempt them to crucify us ? What then ? are we to relax our efforts for them , because they are ungodly ? So did not Jesus Christ . Let us learn from his example , and imbibe his spirit . That man , who may be called a missionary , and yet is capable of being alienated in his feelings by ill-treatment , contempt , abuse and rage from the heathen , is not worthy of the name . That professed Christian , in whatever land he may reside , who loves a sinner less on account of the personal abuse he may suffer from him , has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the spirit of Christ . And here I would repeat the remark with emphasis , in accordance with all that I have said , that there is nothing peculiar in the spirit of missions , except what peculiarity there may be in the spirit of Christ  --  that it is what all must possess to be disciples , and without which no one can enter heaven . It is a spirit humble yet elevating , self-sacrificing yet joyful , intensely fervent yet reasonable , meek and yet resolute . It is all this indeed , but yet nothing more than what is required of every Christian ; and therefore no excuse can be more absurd and contradictory in terms , than that sometimes made , " It is not my duty to go to the heathen , for I never had a missionary spirit ; " for one professes to be a Christian , and yet excuses himself , on the ground of not having a missionary spirit , or in other words , of not being a Christian  --  of not being in possession of a fair title to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least desire to be excused shows a deplorable lack of the spirit of Christ . CHAPTER II . CHRISTIAN STEWARDSHIP . On account of heavy domestic afflictions , and the failure of my own health , I was induced , a few years since , to visit the United States . Full well I remember my feelings when returning to my native land . I had been laboring among a heathen people , and impressions by the eye are deep and affecting . I had seen degradation and vileness , destitution and woe . I had a vivid impression of the urgent claim of the destitute and the dying ; and I had formed some conception of the greatness of the work , if we would put forth the instrumentality needed to elevate and save them . And during a long voyage , I had time , not only to think of the Sandwich Islanders , but to cast my thoughts abroad over the wide world . The millions and hundreds of millions of our race often came up fresh before me , sunk in untold vileness , covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the beating of my pulse  --  twenty millions a year  --  into the world of woe . Painful as it was , I could not avoid the deep and certain conviction , that such was their end . Then I thought of the greatness of the task , if we would be the means , under God , of saving them from perdition : that we have idol gods without number to destroy  --  a veil of superstition forty centuries thick to rend  --  a horrible darkness to dispel  --  hearts of stone to break  --  a gulf of pollution to purify  --  nations , in God 's strength , to reform and regenerate . With such thoughts the conviction forced itself upon me , that the work could not be done without an immense amount of means , and a host of laborers . Think , then , how chilling and soul-sickening the intelligence that met me as I landed on my native shores , ( in the spring of 1838 , ) that Christians were disheartened by the pressure of the times , and were receding from ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue from the press , though millions were famishing for lack of it ; that thirty heralds of salvation then standing on our shores must not embark , though the woes and agonies of dying souls were coming peal after peal on every wave of the ocean ; that they must be turned aside from the perilous yet fond enterprise to which the love of Christ had constrained them , and that future applicants must be thereby discouraged  --  that missionaries abroad must be trammelled in their operations for want of means ; and that multitudes of children and youth , the hope of the missions , gathered with much care , and partially instructed and trained with much expense of time , strength and money ; the centre of solicitude , love , and interest ; the adopted sons and daughters of the missionaries , must be sent back  --  in Ceylon three thousand in a day  --  to wallow again in pollution , bow down to gods of wood and stone , and wander , stumble and fall on the dark mountains of heathen superstition ; a prey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the territory of Satan . Surely , thought I , ( and had I not grounds for the thought ? ) Christians in America must be destitute of the common comforts of life : nothing but the direst necessity can induce them thus to surrender back to Satan the ground already taken and the trophies already gathered , and to put far off the hope of the latter day glory . I looked abroad and made inquiries . I found indeed a derangement of currency and a stagnation of business . But did I find , think you , that Christians were destitute of the ordinary comforts of life ? that they were in a distressing emergency for food and clothing ? that their retrenchments had been made first in personal expenditures , and last in efforts to save souls ? Alas ! it was evident that the principal cause of the retraced movement was not found in the reverse of the times . It was found to lie deeper ; and to consist in wrong views and wrong practice on the great subject of Christian stewardship . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were much directed , and I tried to look at it in view of a dying world , and a coming judgment . The subject , I perceived , lay at the foundation of all missionary effort ; and my position and circumstances were perhaps advantageous for contemplating it in a just and proper light . Be entreated , therefore , Christian reader , to look at the subject in the spirit of candor and self-application. * * * * * A little heathen child was inquired of by her teacher , if there was anything which she could call her own . She hesitated a moment , and looking up , very humbly replied , " I think there is . " " What is it ? " asked the teacher . " I think , " said she , " that my sins are my own . " Yes , we may claim our sins  --  they are our own ; but everything else belongs to God . We are stewards ; and a steward is one who is employed to manage the concerns of another  --  his household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God has intrusted to each one of us a charge of greater or less importance . To some he has intrusted five talents , to others two , and to others one . The talents are physical strength , property , intellect , learning , influence  --  all the means in our possession for doing good and glorifying God . We can lay claim to nothing as strictly our own . Even the angel Gabriel can not claim the smallest particle of dust as strictly his own . The rightful owner of all things , great and small , is God . To be faithful stewards , then , we must fully occupy for God all the talents in our possession . A surrender , however , of all to God  --  of time , strength , mind and property , does not imply a neglect of our own real wants . A proper care of ourselves and families enters into God 's arrangement . This is not only allowed , it is required of us ; and if done properly and with a right spirit , it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we say , that all our talents must be occupied for God . With this understanding , there must be no reserve . Reserve is robbery . No less than all the heart and all our powers can be required of us  --  no less can be required of angels . It is our reasonable service . We require the same of the agents we employ . Suppose a steward , agent or clerk , in the management of your money , your estate or your goods , devotes only a part to your benefit and uses the rest for himself , how long would you retain him in your employment ? Let us beware , then , that we rob not God . Let us be faithful in his business , and fully occupy for him the talents intrusted to us . God has an indisputable right to everything in our possession ; to all our strength , all our influence , every moment of our time , and demands that everything be held loosely by us , in perfect obedience to him . For us or for angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For God to require anything less , would be admitting a principle that would demolish his throne . No less engagedness certainly can be required of God 's stewards , than worldly men exhibit in the pursuit of wealth and honor . Let us , then , look at their conduct and learn a lesson . They are intent upon their object . They rise early and sit up late . Constant toil and vigorous exertion fill up the day , and on their beds at night they meditate plans for the morrow . Their hearts are set on their object , and entirely engrossed in it . They show a determination to attain it , if it be within the compass of human means . Enter a Merchants ' Exchange , and see with what fixed application they study the best plans of conducting their business . They keep their eyes and ears open , and their thoughts active . Such , too , must be the wakefulness of an agent , or they will not employ him . Notice also the physician who aspires to eminence . He tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon the ambitious attorney . He applies his mind closely to his cause that he may manage it in the best possible way . Now , I ask , shall not the same intense and active state of mind be required of us , as God 's agents or stewards ? Can we be faithful stewards , and not contrive , study , and devise the best ways of using the talents that God has intrusted to us , so that they may turn to the greatest account in his service ? Is not the glory of God and the eternal salvation of our ruined race , an object worthy of as much engagedness , as much engrossment of soul and determination of purpose , as a little property which must soon be wrapped in flames , or the flickering breath of empty fame ? Be assured , we can not satisfy our Maker by offering a sluggish service , or by putting forth a little effort , and pretending that it is the extent of our ability . We have shown what we are capable of doing , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , angels have seen , and we ourselves know , that our ability is not small , when brought fully into exercise . It is now too late to indulge the thought of deceiving either our Maker or our fellow men on this point . We can lay claim to the character of faithful stewards , only as we embark all our powers in serving God , as worldly men do in seeking riches , or a name . Then , too , to be faithful , we must be as enterprising in the work that God has given us to do , as worldly men are in their affairs . By enterprising , I mean , bold , adventurous , resolute to undertake . Worldly men exhibit enterprise in their readiness to engage in large projects  --  in digging canals , in laying railroads , and in sending their ships around the globe . No port seems too distant , no depth too deep , no height too high , no difficulty too great , and no obstacle too formidable . They scarcely shrink from any business on account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A man is no longer famous for circumnavigating the globe . To sail round the world is a common trading voyage , and ships now visit almost every port of the whole earth . A business is no longer called great , where merely thousands of dollars are adventured ; but in great undertakings , money is counted by millions . Such is the spirit of enterprise in worldly matters . Now , I ask , are we not capable of as much enterprise in using the means ordained by Christ for rescuing souls from eternal burnings , and raising them to a seat at his right hand ? Had the same enterprise been required of men in some former century , they might have plead incapacity . But it is too late now to plead incapacity . Unless we choose to keep back from God a very important talent , we must put forth this enterprise to its full extent in the great work of the world 's conversion . Such enterprise is needed . If the latter day glory is to take place through human instrumentality , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the church ? Can a work of such inconceivable magnitude be effected , till every redeemed sinner shall lay himself out in the enterprise , as worldly men do in their projects ? If the promises of God are to be fulfilled through the efforts of men , what hope can there be of the glorious day , till men are resolute to undertake great things  --  not for themselves merely , but for God , their Maker and Redeemer . Is it not a fact that will strike us dumb in the judgment , that it is the love of money , and not zeal for God , that digs canals , lays railroads , runs steamboats and packets , and , in short , is the main spring of every great undertaking ? The love of money has explored the land and the seas , traced rivers in all their windings , found an entrance to almost every port , Christian or heathen , studied the character of almost every people , ascertained the products of every clime and the treasures of the deep , stationed agents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports , a hemisphere distant , erected shops , factories , and even sumptuous palaces . Men exhibit no such enterprise in serving God . How many ships sail the ocean to carry the Gospel of Christ ? And in ports where one magnificent Exchange after another is reared , stretching out its capacious arms , and towering towards heaven , how difficult it is to sustain a few humble boarding-houses for wandering seamen . Worldly enterprise is bold and active , and presses onward with railroad speed . Shall , then , Christian enterprise be dull and sluggish , deal in cents and mills , and move along at a very slow pace ? The thought is too humiliating to be endured . Suppose angels to be placed in our stead , would they , think you , be outdone by the seekers of wealth in deeds of enterprise ? No : their cars would be the first in motion , and their ships the first on the wing . They would be the first to announce new islands , and the first to project improvements , and for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorified . Enterprise and action would then be exhibited , worthy of our gaze and admiration . " O ! if the ransom of those who fell from heaven like stars to eternal night , could only be paid , and the inquiry of the Lord were heard among the unfallen , ' Whom shall we send , and who will go for us ? ' hold they back ? No : they fly like lightning to every province of hell ; the echo of salvation rolls in the outskirts as in the centre ; a light shines in the darkest dungeon ; the heaviest chains are knocked off , and they rest not till all is done that angels can do , to restore them to their former vacated seats in the realms of the blest . " But if angels would act thus , we too , as the stewards of God , ought to be the first in enterprise . God 's work is infinitely more important than wealth or honor . And how shall we , in the judgment , be found faithful , if the seekers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstrip us on every side . It is not faithfulness for any one to consume on himself or his children more of God 's property than he really needs . Suppose you hold in your hand an amount of property . It is not yours you remember , for you are merely a steward . God requires that it be used to produce the greatest possible good . The greatest possible good , is the promotion of holiness in yourself and in others . Luxury , pride and vanity can lay no claim . Speculative knowledge , taste , and refinement must receive a due share of attention , but be kept in their place . Our real wants , of course , must be supplied . But what are our real wants  --  our wants , not our desires  --  our real wants , not those that are artificial and imaginary ? We really need for ourselves and families what is necessary to preserve life and health ; we need a mental cultivation answerable to our profession or employment ; need the means of maintaining a neat , sober and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spiritual improvement . Things of mere habit , fashion , and fancy may be dispensed with . Luxuries may be denied . Many things , which are called conveniences , we do not really need . If provision is to be made for all things that are convenient and pleasant , what room will remain for self-denial ? Things deemed comfortable and convenient may be multiplied without limit  --  consume all of God 's wealth , and leave the world in ruins . If the world were not in ruins , then it might be proper to seek not only the comforts , but even the elegancies of life . Take a simple illustration : In the midst of the wide ocean I fall in with a crew floating on the few shattered planks of a hopeless wreck . I have a supply of water and a cask of bread , but the poor wrecked mariners are entirely destitute . Shall I keep my provisions for my own comfort , and leave these sufferers to pine away with hunger and thirst ? But suppose I have not only bread and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wreck are perishing for the want of a morsel of bread and a drop of water ? And then , suppose I have casks of bread and other provisions to dispose of , and intend with the proceeds to furnish myself with certain of the conveniences and elegancies of life ; and my mind is so fixed upon obtaining them , that I refuse to relieve the poor tenants of the wreck , and leave them to the lingering death of hunger and thirst . O , who of you would not shudder at the hardness of my heart and the blackness of my crime ! But the world dead in sin is surely a wreck . Millions upon millions are famishing for the bread and water of life . Their cry  --  their dying cry has come to our ears . Shall we then take that which might relieve them , and expend it in procuring conveniences , elegancies , and luxuries for ourselves ? Can we do it , and be guiltless of blood ? But , perhaps here , some one may have the coolness to thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living must correspond with his station in society . It is wonderful to what an extent this principle is applied . A man , it is said , can not be a governor of a state , a mayor of a city , a member of Congress , or hold any high office , unless his house , his equipage , his dress and his table , exhibit some appearance of elegance and wealth ; and if a man live in a large and opulent city , he must be somewhat expensive in his style of living , that he may exert an influence in the higher walks of society . Then , country towns , and small villages , take pattern of the large cities , and the plea goes down through every rank and every grade . Scarcely a Christian can be found , who is not familiar with the doctrine . It is a very convenient doctrine . In a qualified sense it may be true , but in its unlimited interpretation it may be made to justify almost every article of luxury and extravagance . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world has always been wrong . The principles of the Gospel have always been at variance with the maxims and customs of the world . Conformity is always suspicious . Again , the doctrine can not be applied to all places . Suppose a missionary conform to the society around him . Instead of raising up the heathen from their degradation , he would become a heathen himself . The descent to heathenism is easy . The influence of comparing ourselves with ourselves , and measuring ourselves by ourselves , is felt by those living among barbarians as well as at home , though the insidious influence leads in another direction . If there is a man on earth , who , more than any other , needs to cultivate neatness , taste and refinement , both in his mind and in his whole style of living , it is the man who is surrounded by a heathen population . Here , then , the rule contended for fails . Travel round the world , and how often will it fail ? Let us turn away , then , from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Word of God . Shall we not then find , that substantially the same style of living that is proper in one latitude and longitude , is proper in another ; substantially the same , paying only so much regard to the eyes of the world , as to avoid unnecessary singularity and remark ; and that this rule , founded on the principles of the Gospel , makes a proper provision for health , mental cultivation , and a neat , sober and just taste ? Are not these the real wants of men allowed by the Gospel , whether they live in London or in Ethiopia ? But the ground on which I choose to rest this inquiry more than any other , is the perishing condition of our dying race . Is fashion , splendor and parade , appropriate in a grave-yard , or in the chamber of the dead and dying ? But the whole world is a grave-yard . Countless millions lie beneath our feet . Most of our earth , too , is at this moment a chamber of dying souls . Can we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amidst the teeming millions commencing the agonies of eternal death ? I erect a splendid mansion ; extend about it a beautiful enclosure ; furnish it with every elegance ; make sumptuous entertainments , and live in luxury and ease . In the midst of it , the woes and miseries of my ruined race are brought vividly before me  --  their present wretchedness and eternal agonies . And it is whispered in my ear , that these woes might have been relieved by the expense I have so profusely lavished . O ! how like Belshazzar must I feel , and almost imagine that the groans of lost souls are echoed in every chamber of my mansion , and their blood seen on every ornament ! Let us have the love of Christ in our hearts , and then spread distinctly before us the world as it is  --  calculate the sum total of its present wretchedness and eternal woes . In such a world and as God 's stewards , who can be at a loss in regard to the course of duty ? When twenty millions of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second death , and we are stewards to employ all means in our power for their salvation , O , away with that coldness that can suggest the necessity of conforming to the expensive customs of the world . May we , in heaven , find one of these souls saved through our instrumentality , and we can afford to forego all we shall lose by a want of conformity . There is a nobleness in taking an independent stand on the side of economy , and saving something to benefit dying souls . There is a heavenly dignity in such a course , infinitely superior to the slavish conformity so much contended for . It is an independence induced by the sublimest motives ; a stand which even the world must respect , and which God will not fail to honor . But how shall those possessing large capitals best employ them as stewards of God ? I speak not of the hoarding of the miser ; that would be a waste of breath . I speak not of property invested in stock that habitually violates the Sabbath . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I speak of large capitals , professedly kept to bring in an income for the service of the Redeemer . The subject is involved in many practical difficulties ; and they who are business men have some advantages of judging in the case which I have not . I will therefore merely make one or two inquiries . Is not the practice in many cases an unwise investment of God 's funds ? Is there not a reasonable prospect that one dollar used now , in doing good , will turn to more account than twenty dollars ten years hence ? A Bible given now may be the means of a soul 's conversion ; and this convert may be instrumental in converting other souls , and may consecrate all his powers and property to God ; so that when years shall have passed away , the one dollar given to buy the Bible may have become hundreds of dollars , and , with God 's blessing , saved many precious souls . One pious young man trained for the ministry now , may be instrumental , before ten years shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortal souls , with all their wealth and influence ; and so the small sum expended now , become ten years hence entirely inestimable . The same may be said of a minister sent now to the heathen , instead of ten years hence ; and the same , too , may be said of every department of doing good . It would appear then , that , in all ordinary cases , to make an immediate use of funds in doing good is to lay them out to the greatest possible interest ; that by such a course we can be the means of peopling heaven faster than in any other way . We can hardly appreciate how much we save by saving time , and how much we lose by losing it . Worldly men , in their railroad and steam-packet spirit of the present day , seem to have caught some just sense of the importance of time , and we , in our enterprises to do good , must not be unmindful of it . Again , is not the expenditure of property in the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the safest possible investment of God 's funds ? Whilst kept in capital , it is always exposed to greater or less risk . Fire may consume it . Floods may sweep it away . Dishonest men may purloin it . A gale at sea may bury it . A reverse of times may ingulf it . But when used in doing good , it is sent up to the safe-keeping of the bank of God ; it is commuted into the precious currency of heaven ; it is exchanged for souls made happy , and harps and crowns of gold . Again , A. keeps a large property in capital , and therefore B. resolves to accumulate a large property , and then give the income . But whilst accumulating it , he not only leaves the world to perish , but also runs the risk of ruining his own soul  --  the awful hazard which always attends the project of becoming rich . And the result is , in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred , that the summons of death arrives before the promised beneficence is paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be wiser , safer , and very much better , in most instances at least , that the greater part of large capitals should be made use of at once in the service of the Redeemer ? It is said of Normand Smith , that " he dared not be rich ; " and that " it became an established rule with him , to use for benevolent distribution all the means which he could take from his business , and still prosecute it successfully ; " and that he charged a brother on his dying bed , to do good with his substance while living , and not suffer it to accumulate to be disposed of , at the last extremity , by will . Sound advice . A few other such men there have been in the world , and they are the SHINING LIGHTS . Their example is brilliant all over with true wisdom . It is not acting always as faithful stewards , merely to accumulate wealth to promote the cause of Christ ; for there may be more need of our personal service in disseminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute . Christians are not faithful stewards , merely when they labor for Christ , but when they do that by which they may most promote the cause of Christ . The dissemination of Gospel truth is the great end to be aimed at , either directly or indirectly . Now , it is evident that many must further this object by accumulating the pecuniary means ; but the danger is , that too many , far too many prefer this course . Many conclude , with perfect safety and justness , that in practising law or medicine , or in selling goods , in tilling a farm , or in laboring in a shop , they are doing as much to further the object as in any other way ; but some , it is believed , come to such a conclusion either from mistaken views or mistaken motives . The fact that so large a proportion of God 's stewards resort to the notion of operating by proxy , and that so few choose to engage in the direct work , shows that there is danger existing . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle aged and the young , prefer to advance the cause of Christ by accumulating the pecuniary means . Now , why is there such a rushing after this department of the great work ? The Saviour calls for a great army of preachers , to carry his Gospel everywhere , and to proclaim it to all nations , kindreds and people . In truth , you need not go beyond the limits of the United States to feel the force of this remark . Look at the destitutions in the more newly settled states and territories , and see if there is not need of men to preach the Gospel . But notwithstanding this need , only a small number , comparatively , offer themselves to the work . Almost all young men , even the professedly pious , slide easily into lucrative occupations ; but to bring them into the direct work of making known Christ , they must be urged and persuaded by a score of arguments . It is needed , too , of lay members of the church , to do much in searching out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even about their own dwellings ; to give here a word of warning , and there a word of consolation ; to add here a helping hand , and impart there the restoring effect of sympathy and kindness ; in short , to employ some hours in the day in going everywhere , as the early disciples did , from house to house and street to street , and in communicating , in an appropriate way , the simple truths of Jesus . Laymen , too , are needed in great numbers in the foreign service . There are reasons numerous and urgent , which I can not here name , why lay members in the church should go abroad . But notwithstanding this call for personal effort , it is too often that we meet with church members who are completely engrossed , from early dawn to the close of day , in accumulating wealth ; and who deny themselves the luxury of spending either hour of the twenty-four , in conversing with souls , and leading them to Jesus . Such persons will give somewhat of their substance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of breath apparently , in the cares of the world , not thinking to say to this man or that , on the right hand and the left , that there is a heaven above and a hell beneath , and death is at the door . You would almost imagine , from the conduct of some , that they would like to commit to proxy even their own faith and repentance . Now this entire engrossment in worldly cares , even though professedly for Christ 's sake , will never illumine the dark recesses of the earth  --  will never usher in the millenial day . It is not so much , after all , an accumulation of wealth that is needed , as the personal engagement of Christians in making known everywhere , at home and abroad , the precious news of Jesus . The disposition to go everywhere , regardless of wealth , and with Jesus on our lips , must be the spirit of the church , before we can expect much good either at home or abroad . The world will not be covered with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till men to make known that word are scattered like rain on all the earth  --  not only in heathen lands , but in the streets and lanes of large cities , and throughout the Western desolations . " So long as we remain together , like water in a lake , so long the moral world will be desolate . We must go everywhere , and if the expansive warmth of benevolence will not separate us , so that we arise and go on the wings of the wind , God , be assured , will break up the fountains of the great deep of society , and dashing the parts together , like ocean in his turmoil or Niagara in its fall , cover the heavens with showers , and set the bow of hope for the nations , and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose . God is too good to suffer either Amazon or Superior to lie still , and become corrupt , and the heavens in consequence to be brass and the earth iron . " God is too benevolent also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his people to be inactive  --  to have here a continuing city , and be immersed in the cares of the world as though here were their treasure , while thousands about them are dying for lack of instruction , and the heathen abroad are going down to death in one unbroken phalanx . The church must take more exercise , and the proper kind , too , or she will become frail and sickly , too weak in prayer , and too ignorant in effort to usher in the millenial day . It is a possible thing to seek wealth honestly for God ; but he that is called to such a work , has more occasion to mourn than to rejoice : he has occasion to tremble , watch , and pray ; for to be a faithful steward of God 's property , requires perhaps more grace than to be a faithful steward of God 's truth . We find many a faithful preacher of the Gospel where we find one Normand Smith , or Nathaniel R. Cobb , or one firm of Homes &; Homer . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ err so many , that almost all prove defaulters , and therefore it is that the world lies in ruins : not because the church has not wealth enough , but because God 's stewards claim to be owners . How small the sum appropriated by a million and a half of God 's stewards to save a sinking world ! The price of earthly ambition , convenience and pleasure , is counted by millions . Navies and armies have their millions ; railroads and canals have their millions ; colleges and schools have their millions ; silks , carpets and mirrors , have their millions ; parties of pleasure and licentiousness in high life and in low life have their millions ; and what has the treasury of God and the Lamb , to redeem a world of souls from the pains of eternal damnation , and to fill them with joys unspeakable ? The sum is so small in comparison that one 's tongue refuses to utter it . There must be a different scale of giving ; and the only way to effect it is , to induce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give himself , or rather let him have a heart that can not refrain from telling of Jesus to those who are near , or from going to those who are more remote , and the mere item of property you will find appended , as a matter of course , and on the plain principle that the greater always includes the less . We must learn to devote , according to our vows , time , talents , body , soul and spirit . Bodies and minds are wanted ; the bones and sinews of men are required : these more substantial things are needed , as well as property , in arduous services at home and still more self-denying labor abroad ; and no redeemed sinner can refuse either the one or the other , and continue to be regarded as a faithful steward of Jesus . Money , though needed , is by no means all that is required of us . Though God has devolved upon us , as stewards , a responsible work , the weight of which is fearful , and sufficient to crush us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of indescribable delight . It is a pleasant work . Angels would rejoice to be so employed . Is there any professed Christian who does not relish the idea ? To such an one I would say , Your condition is by no means enviable . You deny yourself all true happiness . If you do not delight in the thought of being God 's steward ; of holding not only property , but body , soul and spirit at God 's control , then you know not what true luxury is . There is pleasure in doing good ; there is a luxury in entire consecration to God . The pleasures of this earth are empty , vain and fleeting ; but the pleasure of doing good is real , substantial and enduring . The pleasure of doing good is the joy of angels ; it is the thrill of delight which pervades the soul of Jesus ; it is the happiness of the eternal God . In not wishing to be God 's steward , you deny yourself this luxury ; you refuse angels ' food and feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy joy in yielding up all to God , and holding ourselves as waiting servants to do his will . This fullness of bliss you foolishly spurn from you , and turn away to the " beggarly elements of the world . " Do you feel that the principles of stewardship contained in the Bible are too strict  --  that too entire a devotement is required of you ? Angels do not think so . Redeemed saints do not think so . The more entire the consecration , the more perfect the bliss . In heaven devotement is perfect , and joy of course unalloyed . Blot out this spirit of consecration , you blot out all true happiness on earth ; you annihilate heaven . But it is not only a luxury , but an honor to be the stewards of God . What honor greater than that of continuing the work which Jesus commenced ; of being employed in the immense business of saving a ruined race ? What work more glorious than that of being the instruments of peopling heaven ? What employment more noble than to rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eternal joys ; to take their feet from the sides of the burning lake , and to plant them on the firm pavement of heaven ; to rescue victims from eternal burnings , and to place them as gems in the diadem of God ? Would not Gabriel feel himself honored with a work so noble and glorious ? Were a presidency or a kingdom offered you , spurn it and be wise ; but contemn not the glory of being God 's stewards . Remember , too , whether these are your views or not , the work of God will go on . The world will be converted . The glorious event is promised . Almighty power and infinite wisdom are engaged to accomplish it : all the resources of heaven are pledged . The God of heaven , he will prosper his true servants , and they shall arise and build ; but those who do not relish the idea of being God 's stewards , can have no portion , nor right , nor memorial in Jerusalem . The wheels of God 's providence are rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , being a professed Christian , dare to oppose the march of God ? " Ah ! we do not oppose , " say you . But I reply , There can be no neutrality ; you must either help onward his car of victory , or you do really stand in the way  --  will be crushed by his power , and ground into the earth by the weight of his chariot . Take then , I entreat you , this warning , which is given you in earnestness , but in the spirit of love . Joy , glory and immortality , to all who will cordially assent to be co-workers with Jesus . They shall ride with him in his chariot from conquering to conquer , and shall sit with him on his throne in the day of triumph . Be entreated , then , professed Christian , first to give your own soul to the Lord , and with your soul all you have , all you are , and all you hope to be . Make an entire consecration . You will never regret having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God give us all grace to imbibe wholly the true principles of stewardship . Not the principles popular in the world , but the principles of the Bible ; those principles which hold out the only hope of the latter day glory  --  of means commensurate with so great an end . CHAPTER III . GUILT OF NEGLECTING THE HEATHEN . During all the years that I have been allowed to labor for the heathen , my mind has been led to contemplate , constantly and intensely , the obligations of Christian nations towards those who sit in darkness ; obligations arising from the command of Christ , and the principles of the Gospel . And I shall , therefore , in this chapter , freely , fully , and solemnly express the sentiments which have been maturing in my mind , on the great guilt which Christians incur in neglecting the heathen . The heathen world , as a mass , has been left to perish . And by whom ? Not by the Father of mercies ; he gave his Son to redeem it : not by the Saviour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Spirit ; his influences have been ever ready : not by angels ; their wings have never tired when sent on errands of mercy . All that Heaven could do has been done , consistently with the all-wise arrangement of committing an important agency to the church . The church has been slothful and negligent . Each generation of Christians has in turn received the vast responsibility , neglected it in a great measure , and transmitted it to the next . The guilt of this neglect who can estimate ? That such neglect is highly criminal , the Bible everywhere testifies . It says , " If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death , and those that are ready to be slain ; if thou sayest , Behold , we knew it not ; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it ? and he that keepeth thy soul , doth not he know it ? " And shall not he " render to every man according to his works ? " This solemn interrogation needs no comment . The obvious import is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what we can to save them , we are guilty of their blood . But this testimony does not stand alone . What does God say to the prophet , who should see the peril of the wicked , and neglect to save him by giving him warning ? " His blood will I require at thy hand . " What does God say of the watchman of a city who should see the sword come , and blow not the trumpet ? " If the sword come and take any person from among them , his blood will I require at the watchman 's hand . " But this is not only the sentiment of the Bible , but the voice of common sense . A neighbor of mine is drowning in the river . With a little exertion I can save his life , but neglect to do it . Shall I escape the goadings of conscience and the charge of blood-guiltiness ? A house is in flames . The perishing occupants , looking from a window , implore of me to reach them a ladder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , and turn a deaf ear to their cry . The flames gather around them : they throw themselves from the window , and are dashed in pieces on the pavement . Who will not charge me with the loss of those lives ? To-day , a raging malady is spreading through the streets of a large city . The people are dying by hundreds . I know the cause ; the fountains of the city are poisoned . From indolence , or some other cause , I neglect to give the information , and merely attend to my own safety . Who would not load me with the deepest guilt , and stamp me as the basest of murderers ? Both Scripture and common sense , then , concur in establishing the sentiment , that if our fellow men are perishing , and we neglect to do what we can to save them , we are guilty of their blood . But if this doctrine be true , its application to Christians , in the relation which they sustain to the heathen world , is irresistibly conclusive and awfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fearful thought : If six hundred millions of our race are sinking to perdition , and we neglect to do what we can to save them , we shall be found accountable for their eternal agonies . If such a charge is standing against us , we shall soon meet it . The day of judgment will soon burst upon us . Let us look , then , at the subject candidly , prayerfully , and with a desire to do our duty . The conditions on which the charge impends are simply two : that the heathen world are sinking to perdition , and that we are neglecting to do what we can to save them . If these two points are substantiated , the overwhelming conclusion is inevitable . It becomes us , then , to look well at these points  --  to examine them with faithfulness and with honesty . * * * * * Is it true , that the heathen world are sinking to perdition ? As fast as the beating of my pulse , they are passing into the world of retribution , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do they rise to unite with angels in the songs of heaven ? or sink in ceaseless and untold misery ? Certain it is , that they are not saved through faith in Christ ; for " how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? " It is also clear that God , in his usual method , does not bestow the gift of repentance and eternal life where a Saviour is not known . " It pleases God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe . " Those who are saved , are said to be " begotten by the word of truth "  --  " born of the word of God . " As the heathen nations , therefore , are not furnished with the appointed means of salvation , it follows inevitably that , as a mass at least , they are sinking to perdition . They are the " nations which have forgotten God , " and " shall be turned into hell . " It is unnecessary to enter into the inquiry , whether it is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heathen unacquainted with the Gospel to be saved . It is sufficient to know the FACT , that God has ordained the preaching of the Gospel as the means of saving the nations ; and that there is probably no instance on record , which may not be called in question , of a heathen being converted without a knowledge of the true God and of his Son Jesus Christ . But the consideration , solemn and conclusive , which needs no other to corroborate it or render it overwhelming , is the character of the heathen . Look at their character , as portrayed by the Apostle Paul in the first chapter to the Romans . Read the whole chapter , but especially the conclusion , where he describes the heathen as " being filled with all unrighteousness , fornication , wickedness , covetousness , maliciousness ; full of envy , murder , debate , deceit , malignity ; whisperers , back-biters , haters of God , despiteful , proud , boasters , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents , without understanding , covenant breakers , without natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understood in Christian lands , neither can it be ; but missionaries to the heathen , who are eye-witnesses of what is here described , place an emphasis on every epithet , and would clothe every word in capitals . The character of the heathen is no better now than in the days of Paul . It is worse . It is impossible that such a state of society should remain stationary . A mortal disease becomes more and more malignant , till a remedy is applied ; a sinking weight hastens downwards with continually accumulating force ; and mind , thrown from its balance , wanders farther and farther from reason . It is thus with the disease of sin , the downward propensities of a depraved nature , and a soul revolted from God . Besides , Satan has not been inactive in heathen lands . He has been aware that efforts would be made to save them . And night and day , year after year , and age after age , he has sought , with ceaseless toil and consummate skill , to perfect the heathen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every deed of cruelty , sink them to the lowest depths of pollution and degradation , and place them at the farthest remove from the possibility of salvation . It is impossible to describe the state of degradation and unblushing sin to which the nations , for ages sinking , have sunk , and to which Satan in his undisturbed exertions for centuries has succeeded in reducing them . It is impossible to give a representation of their unrestrained passions , the abominations connected with their idol worship , or the scenes of discord , cruelty and blood , which everywhere abound . I speak of those lands where the Gospel has not been extended . Truly darkness covers such lands , and gross darkness the people . Deceit , oppression and cruelty fill every hut with woe ; and impurity deluges the land like an overflowing stream . Neither can it be said , that the conduct of the heathen becomes sinless through ignorance . From observation for many years , I can assert that they have consciences  --  that they feel accountable for what they do . Will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its nature , to overrun his paradise above ? Will he open the gates of his holy city , and expose the streets of its peaceful inhabitants to those whose heart is cruelty , whose visage is scarred with fightings , and whose hands are red with blood ? " KNOW YE NOT , THAT THE UNRIGHTEOUS SHALL NOT ENTER INTO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN ? " Where , then , is the hope of the unconverted heathen ? If there were innocent heathen , as some men are ready to imagine in the face of God 's word , and in the face of a flood of facts , then indeed they might be saved without the Gospel . But this mass of pollution , under which the earth groans , must disgorge itself into the pit of woe . We can not evade the conclusion , painful as it is , that the millions of this world of sin are sinking to perdition . The American churches have peculiar advantages to carry abroad the Gospel of Christ ; and ability in such an enterprise is the measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , it is accepted according to that a man hath , and not according to that he hath not . " " To whom much is given of him will much be required . " And to determine whether Christians in the United States are doing what they can to save the heathen from their awful doom , the second point of inquiry proposed , it is necessary to look at their unparalleled advantages . It may be said then , that Christians in America are not trammeled in their efforts to do good by any governmental restrictions , or ecclesiastical establishment . The remark is trite , but no less true , that the genius of our free constitution is eminently propitious to call forth energy and enterprise . And the remark applies with no more force to worldly matters , than to the business of doing good . The religion of Christ courts no extraneous influence , and is dependent for its power on no earthly aid . Under our free government , uncontrolled , unrestrained and unsupported , it is left to exert its own free and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrary hindrance of any kind in the work of propagating the Gospel . And we can carry the Gospel , too , disconnected from any prejudicial alliance with political interests . This is the free , disencumbered , and unshackled condition in which the Gospel is permitted to have free course in our beloved land ; and it is a talent put into our hands to be improved . Again , no country possesses such advantages of education as the United States . In no land is knowledge so generally diffused throughout the different grades of society , and in no land do such facilities exist for acquiring a thorough education . Schools , colleges and seminaries , are open equally to the high and to the low , to the rich and to the poor ; and only a good share of energy is required , to rise from any grade or condition of society , to eminence in general learning or professional study . The general intelligence of the community is such , that nothing but disinclination can prevent men from being acquainted with the wants of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities for fitting themselves for the work are such , that nothing but criminal delinquency can hold back a very large army from entering the field . This is an immense advantage committed to the American churches , for propagating the religion of Christ . It is another very precious talent committed to their trust , which if they fail to improve , they treasure up guilt . Again , the American churches possess a great advantage in the facilities so generally enjoyed for accumulating wealth . The road to comfort and to affluence is open to all ; and notwithstanding all reverses , the remark , as a general one , is still true , that the prosperity of the United States  --  of the whole mass of the people  --  is altogether unexampled , and that enterprise is vigorous and successful . In the greatest strait , how much retrenchment has there been in the style of living ? And as we look into the future we see , ( God 's providence favoring , ) that wealth is destined to flow in upon the land like a broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bounded only by two rolling oceans ; and at the resources which from year to year are developed  --  varied , unnumbered , and inexhaustible . If then unto whom much is given , of them will much be required , what may not God justly demand of American Christians ? Another advantage which the American church possesses , is the Spirit which has been poured out upon her from on high . God has been pleased to bless her with precious revivals . The Holy Ghost has come down frequently and with power , and gathered in multitudes of souls . What God has wrought for the American Zion has been told in all lands , and every one applies the Saviour 's injunction , " Freely ye have received  --  freely give . " One great reason , perhaps , why the blessings of the Spirit are not now more richly enjoyed , is the neglect of Christians to make this return , and to labor gratefully for the destitute and the dying . It was expected , and justly too , that the land of apostolic revivals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of saving the heathen . A failure to do this may bring a blight upon the churches , if it has not brought it upon them already . Surely , if there is a nation on earth to whom are intrusted many talents , ours is that nation . Our ability is not small . We must come up to a high measure of Christian action , before it can be said with truth , that we are doing what we can to save our ruined race . The United States , a nation planted by God , enriched by his providence , nourished by his Holy Spirit , and brought to the strength of manhood in this solemnly momentous time of the nineteenth century , seems to have committed to her in a special manner the work of the world 's conversion . Who knoweth but that she is brought to her preeminent advantages for such a time as this  --  for the interesting period preceding the latter day glory ; and now if she prove herself unworthy of so lofty and responsible a trust , and neglect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deliverance will break out from some other quarter , but she , like a third Babylon , may sink in the bottomless abyss . An immense responsibility rests upon us . O that God would give us grace to act worthy of our trust  --  to do what we can for a dying world ! Let us inquire , then , Do we pray for the heathen as much as we ought ? Were one duly impressed with the condition of perishing millions , certainly no less could be expected of him , than to fall on his knees many times a day , and to lift up his cry of earnest entreaty on their behalf . Filled with the love of Christ , and having distinctly and constantly before his mind the image of millions of immortal souls dropping into perdition , surely he could not refrain from an agony of prayer . Under such a sense of the wants and woes of our perishing race , a sense true to facts , he would have no rest . But what prayer has actually been offered to the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many professed Christians do not remember the heathen once a day , and some not even once a month ? Let the closet , the family altar , and the monthly concert testify . Prayer-meetings for the heathen  --  how thinly attended ! what spectacles of grief to Jesus , and to angels ! And if that prayer only is honest which is proved to be so by a readiness to labor , give , and go , there is reason to fear that few prayers for the heathen have been such that Christ could accept them , place them in his golden censer , and present them before the throne . Since such is the case , what wonder is it that a million and a half of Christians in the United States should be so inefficient ? Inefficient , I say , for what do this million and a half of professed Christians accomplish ? By their vows they are bound to be as self-denying , as spiritual and devoted , as though they were missionaries to foreign lands . If we should send abroad a million and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under God , they would soon be the instruments of converting all nations . But what , in fact , does this vast number of professed Christians  --  or in other words , of the professedly missionary band of Jesus Christ , accomplish in the narrow limits of the United States ? O , there is a deplorable lack in the churches , of the deep devotion and missionary character of our ascended Saviour . Again , Do we give as much as we ought to evangelize the heathen ? It would perhaps be a liberal estimate to say , that a million and a half of professed Christians in the United States give , on an average , year by year , to save the heathen , about twenty-four cents each , or two cents a month . There are other objects , it is true , that call for contributions ; but put all contributions together , and how small the amount ? The Jews were required to give to religious objects at least one-fifth of their income . One-fifth of the income of a million and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worth on an average five hundred dollars each , would be ten and a half millions of dollars . This is merely the income of capital of which we now speak . A fifth of the income from trade and industry would probably double the amount , and make it twenty-one millions . Is anything like this sum given by American Christians to support and propagate the religion of Jesus ? What Christians have done , therefore , is by no means a measure of their ability . To see what men can do , it is necessary to look away from Christians , to those whose ruling principle is a thirst for pleasure , for honor , and for gain . How vast a sum is expended at theatres  --  on fashionable amusements and splendid decorations  --  not to mention the hundreds of millions sunk by intemperance , and swallowed up in the deep dark vortex of infamous dissipation ! Men are lavish of money on objects on which their hearts are set . And if the hearts of Christians were set on saving the heathen , as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they , think you , be content with the present measure of their contributions ? Look , too , at what men can do who are eager in the pursuit of wealth . Under the influence of such an incentive , railroads , canals , and fortresses spring into being , and fleets bedeck the seas like the stars of the firmament . Money is not wanting when lucrative investment is the end in view . Even professed Christians can collect together heavy sums , when some great enterprise promises a profitable income . They profess , perhaps , to be accumulating money for Christ ; but , alas , to what a painful extent does it fail of reaching the benevolent end proposed ! Worldly men accomplish much , for their hearts are enlisted . Professed Christians , too , accomplish much in worldly projects , for their minds become engrossed . What then could they not accomplish for Christ , if their feelings were equally enlisted in his cause ? They might have , in serving Christ , intellects as vigorous , muscles as strong , and this advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help them . Take another view of the case . The child that is now sitting by your side in perfect health , is suddenly taken sick . Its blooming cheeks turn pale , and it lifts its languid and imploring eyes for help . You call a physician , the most skillful one you can obtain . Do you think of expense ? A protracted illness swells the bill of the physician and apothecary to a heavy amount . Do you dismiss the physician , or withhold any comfort for fear of expense ? Your child recovers , and becomes a promising youth . He takes a voyage to a foreign country . The ship is driven from her course , and wrecked on some barbarous coast . Your son becomes a captive , and after long anxiety you hear that he is alive , and learn his suffering condition ; and you are told that fifty dollars will procure his ransom . I will suppose you are poor , have not a dollar at command , and that the sum can be raised in no other way than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , how many months would expire before you would save the sum from your hard earnings , and liberate your son ? But what is an Algerine dungeon ? It is a heaven , compared with the condition of the heathen . In the one case , there are bodily sufferings ; in the other , present wretchedness and eternal agonies . I once fell in company with a man of moderate circumstances , with whom I used the above argument . He promptly replied , " It is true . Three years ago I thought I could barely support my family by my utmost exertions . Two years since , my darling son became deranged , and the support of him at the asylum costs me four hundred dollars a year . I find that with strict economy and vigorous exertion I can meet the expense . But if any one had said to me three years ago , that I could raise four hundred dollars a year to save a lost world , I should have regarded the remark as the height of extravagance . " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in view of the eternal and unspeakable agony of a world of souls , as a parent feels for a suffering child ? God felt MORE . He loved his only Son with a most tender affection  --  inconceivably more tender than any earthly parent can exercise towards a beloved child . And yet , when the Father placed before him , on the one hand the eternal ruin of men , and on the other the sufferings and death of his beloved Son , which did he choose ? Let Gethsemane and Calvary answer . Can Christians then have much of the spirit of God , and not feel for the eternal agonies of untold millions , more than for the temporal sufferings of a beloved child ? But if Christians felt thus , what exertion would they make  --  how immense the sum they would cheerfully raise , this present year , to evangelize the heathen ! Feeling thus , a few of the wealthy churches might sustain the present expenditures of all foreign operations . Yet all the American churches combined , feeling as they do now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer the schools abroad to be disbanded . The truth is , in the scale of giving , the church as a body ( I say nothing of individuals or of particular churches ) has scarcely risen in its feeling above the freezing point . What they now contribute is a mere fraction compared with their ability . Millions are squandered by professed Christians on a pampered appetite , in obedience to fashion , a taste for expensive building , a love of parade , and on newly-invented comforts and conveniences , of which the hardy soldiers of Jesus Christ ought ever to be ignorant . Then , again , some who are economical in their expenditures , have little conception of what is meant by total consecration to God . There must be an entire reform in this matter . Every Christian must feel that his employment , whether it be agriculture , merchandise , medicine , law , or anything else , is of no value any farther than it is connected with the Redeemer 's kingdom ; that wealth is trash , and life a trifle , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ ; and that so far as they may be used for this purpose , they are of immense value . Let every Christian feel this sentiment  --  let it be deeply engraven on his heart , and how long , think you , would pecuniary means be wanting in the work of the world 's salvation ? And do we go and instruct the heathen as we ought ? This is indeed the main point . To pray , formally at least , is quite easy ; to give , is a little more difficult ; but to go , in the minds of most persons , is entirely out of the question . Satan understood human nature when he said , " All that a man hath will he give for his life . " Speak of going , and you touch the man , his skin and his bones . To go , requires that a man have such feelings as to begin to act in earnest , as men do in other matters . Men act in person , when they are deeply in earnest . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother simply express a desire that the child may recover ? does she merely give money , and hire a nurse to take little or no care of it ? No : in her own person she anticipates its every want , with the utmost attention and watchfulness . When a son is in bondage on a barbarous coast , does the father merely pray that his son may be redeemed ? does he merely send money for his ransom ? No : he chooses , if possible , to go in person and carry the sum , that no means may be left untried to accomplish the object he has so much at heart . Men who are deeply interested in an important matter , where there is much at stake , can not be satisfied with sending ; they choose to go themselves . This remark is true in all the enterprises and transactions of life the world over . If then , after all , the measure of going is the true measure of interest , to what extent , I inquire , have Christians of America gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very few . Look at the proportion of ministers who go abroad . In the United States the number of preachers , of all denominations , is perhaps not far from one to a thousand souls . This is in a land already intelligent and Christian ; in a land of universities , colleges , and schools ; in a land of enterprise , of industry , and of free institutions , where the arts flourish , and where improvements are various and unnumbered ; and more than all , in a land where more than a million and a half of the people are professed Christians , and ready to aid the ministers of Christ in various ways . On the other hand , even if missionaries from all Christendom be taken into the account , there is not more than one minister to a million of pagan souls , with almost no intelligent Christians to assist as teachers , elders , catechists , and tract distributers ; no physicians , artists , and judicious legislators , to improve society and afford the means of civilized habits ; no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even common schools of any value ; no industry and enterprise , and every motive for it crushed by arbitrary and tyrannical institutions : the mind degraded and besotted , inconceivably so , and preoccupied also with the vilest superstition , the most inveterate prejudices , and the most arrogant bigotry . Who can measure the vast disproportion ? What mind sufficient to balance extremes so inconceivably immense ? On the one hand a minister to a thousand souls , with many helpers and a thousand auxiliary influences in his favor ; on the other , one minister to a million of souls , with no helpers and no auxiliary influences , finding out an untrodden track amidst unnumbered obstacles , and penetrating with his single lamp into the dark and boundless chaos of heathenism . This is the manner in which Christendom shows that she loves her neighbor as herself ; and in view of it , judge ye , whether American Christians go as much as they ought to instruct and save the benighted nations . We said , that the number of missionaries to the heathen population is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the conclusion be drawn , that every million of heathen souls has a missionary . By no means . The few hundred missionaries preach to a few hundred thousand souls . The millions and hundreds of millions of heathen , are as destitute of preaching as though a missionary had never sailed , as destitute of the Scriptures as though a Bible were never printed , and as far from salvation , I was about to say , as though Jesus Christ had never died . Men speak of operating upon the world . Such language is delusive . The present style of effort , or anything like it , can only operate on some small portions of the earth . To influence materially the wide world , Christians must awake to a style of praying , giving , and going too , of which they have as yet scarcely dreamed . The work of going into all the world and preaching the Gospel to every creature , has scarcely been undertaken in earnest . And how vain it would be to expect to make any material impression on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company from all the ministers in the United States go abroad , and a less number even of lay members from the vast body of a million and a half . The heathen are not lost because a Saviour is not provided for them . " God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son . " The preaching of the cross is " the power of God and the wisdom of God " both to the Jew and the Greek . Facts show , that in every nation , however barbarous and degraded , the Gospel of Jesus has power to convert , purify , elevate and save . These facts are irresistible . Neither are the heathen lost , because the ocean separating them is rarely passed . For the sake of gain , men can visit the most distant and sultry climes . To solve a question of science or merely to gratify curiosity , they can circumnavigate the globe , or penetrate far into the icy regions of the poles . The improvements in navigation and the extension of commerce have united the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you from Africa , nor the Pacific from China . The amount of intercourse between the seekers of wealth from Christian lands and almost every heathen country , is absolutely immense . Why then are the heathen left to perish ? There is a lack of earnestness in the church in the work of the world 's conversion . What does the present earnestness of the church amount to ? They contribute on an average two cents a month each , and they find that the pittance of money will more than suffice for the small number of men : and then the cry is " More money than men . " A few men are obtained and then the pittance of money fails , and " More men than money " is the cry . A year or two afterwards the supply of men is gone , and the cry again is reversed . As if , in repairing the wastes of the New-York fire , the citizens collect together a small quantity of brick , and then find they have more brick than workmen . So they employ a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men than brick . Was this the rate at which the ravages of the great fire were so soon repaired ? Was this the measure of their engagedness in rebuilding the city ? Some derangement takes place in the Erie Canal : a lock fails , an aqueduct gives way , or a bank caves in . Is business stopped on the canal till the next season , because the times are hard , and it is difficult to obtain money to make repairs ? Some derangement takes place in a railroad : is travelling postponed till next year ? But in the work of doing good , the reverse of times is regarded as a sufficient excuse to detain missionaries , disband schools , and take other retrograde steps . We coolly block our wheels , lie still , and postpone our efforts for the world 's conversion till more favorable times . Men are earnest in worldly matters : in digging a canal , in laying a railroad , or in repairing a city ; but in God 's work  --  the work of saving the nations  --  their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know which is most prominent , the folly , or the enormous guilt . Is it not a fact , that in our efforts for the heathen we come so far short of our ability , that God can not consistently add his blessing . Can it be that the service rendered by the church as a body is acceptable to God ? It is not according to that she hath  --  it forms an immense and inconceivable contrast to that measure of effort which lies fully within her power . Is it not , then , as though an imperfect sacrifice were offered to the Lord  --  a lamb full of blemish ? If the church were weak , and it were really beyond her ability to do more than she does at present , then God would accomplish great victories by the feeble means . He can save by few as well as by many . He would make the " worm Jacob to thresh mountains . " But since God has blessed the American church with numbers , and with great and peculiar advantages , he requires of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow 's mites accomplish much ; but the wealthy man 's mites , or the wealthy nation 's thousands , when she is fully able to give millions ; and her very few sons , when it would even benefit her to spare a host of her ablest men ; what shall we say of such an offering ? The reason why God blesses the efforts of the American church may be , that there are some widows , and some others too who do what they can  --  who honestly come up to the measure of their ability . For the sake of these God may add his blessing , just as for the sake of ten righteous men he would have spared Sodom . But no very great and conspicuous blessing can be expected to attend the labors of missionaries , such as the conversion of China , or of Africa , till the church begins to pray , give and go , according to her ability ; till she begins to come up to the extent of her powers in her efforts to save the heathen . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her service will be accepted ; it will be a sweet savor before God ; his throne of love will come near the tabernacle of his saints , and the noise of his chariot soon be heard among the ranks of the enemy . The church then , with Christ at their head , shall go on rapidly from conquering to conquer , till all nations , tongues and people , shall bow the knee before him . As soon as the church shall put forth all her strength so as to render an acceptable service to God , it is of little consequence whether she be weak or strong , few or many , the blessing will descend ; the mountains will break forth into singing , and the trees shall clap their hands for joy ; God will come , take up his abode with the saints , and verify all that is expressed by " the latter day glory . " It is plain , then , not only that Christians come far short of doing what they can to save the heathen , but that if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might , under God , rescue the dying nations from their impending doom . If they would engage in earnest , pray with fervency and faith , and prove their zeal by giving and by going , then the providence of God would not leave a bolt or a bar in their way , except what might be necessary to test their perseverance . Let every ambassador of Christ , and every Christian too , possess the unreserved consecration of Paul , and manifest that burning zeal which carried him , as on the wings of an angel , to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ ; let every redeemed sinner , minister or layman , stand ready , not merely to contribute of his substance , but to traverse with cheerful step the burning plains of Africa or the icy mountains of Greenland : then the darkness that now envelopes the earth would soon be dispelled , the torch of Revelation be carried to the most distant lands , and its light be made to penetrate the most gloomy abodes of men ; the radiance of heavenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pagan , intelligence now in to us from every quarter , not only of individuals , but of nations converted to God , and the shout of triumph would soon be heard , " The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdom of our Lord . " It seems to be true , therefore , that the heathen are sinking to perdition ; and true , also , that we might , under God , be the means of saving them . Shall we not then be found accountable for their eternal agonies ? O Christian , pause and look at this thought ! Look at it deliberately , for we shall be obliged to do so at the judgment day . No one can plead exemption from it , unless he does what he can to save the heathen . O my soul , how much blood , how much weeping , wailing and gnashing of teeth , will stand at thy account in the day of judgment ! I appeal to each one of you , examine yourselves in the light of this truth . Call up your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compare what you have done with what Jesus did for you . I entreat you , open your ears , and hearts too , to the groans of a dying world . Listen to the notes which , like the noise of seven thunders , peal after peal , are rolling in upon your shores . " Hark ! what mean those lamentations , Rolling sadly through the sky ? ' T is the cry of heathen nations , ' Come and help us , or we die ! ' " Hear the heathen 's sad complaining , Christians ! hear their dying cry ; And , the love of Christ constraining , Haste to help them , ere they die ! " Yes , reader , haste to help them . Confer not with flesh and blood . Meet all vain excuses with a deaf ear and a determined spirit . Let pity move you , the love of Christ constrain you , and a sense of responsibility urge you , to take that precious Gospel on which your hopes rely , and to carry it , without delay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S LAST COMMAND . Let us suppose that all kindreds and people of the earth are assembled , and that the inhabitants of Africa , Asia , the Isles of the Pacific and the wilds of America , are called upon to speak , and to give in their testimony how far the Saviour 's last command has been obeyed . The inquiry is first put to Africa : " Africa , to what extent and for what purpose have people from Christian lands visited thee , and thine adjacent islands ? What have they carried to thy shores ? And what is the treatment thou hast received from them ? Tell the whole truth : let it be known to what extent the Saviour 's last command has been obeyed in respect to thee . " To this inquiry Africa replies : " The truth I can tell , but the whole truth can not be told . I have indeed been visited by people from Christian lands . Thousands and hundreds of thousands from those lands have visited my shores . Some have come to measure the pyramids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; some to search out the sources of the Nile and the course of the Niger ; some to possess the best of the soil ; and a vast multitude have come , with a cruelty that knows no mercy , to tear the husband from his wife and the wife from her husband , parents from their children and children from their parents , brother from sister and sister from brother  --  to crowd them together without distinction of age or sex in the suffocating holds of their ships , where a large proportion of them die , and to convey the remainder far away to spend their lives in degrading servitude . They have brought beads and trinkets ; they have brought instruments of death , such as muskets , powder , knives and swords ; and they have brought , too , full cargoes of liquid poison . The navies of Christian , lands have fought in my harbors , and their armies upon my shores . Their money by millions has been lavished , and their blood has run in torrents . " A few individuals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way hither . They have come in the spirit of benevolence and of peace , and have brought in their hands the precious treasure of the Gospel of Christ . But their number is so small as to be almost lost among the multitude . For one who has taught righteousness , purity , truth and mercy , thousands have taught , by their example , rapacity , drunkenness , lewdness and cruelty . For one who has led us in the path of life , thousands have led us in the paths of destruction . For one who has brought has left a loathsome disease , which with sure and rapid progress is depopulating the land . Such is the sum of my testimony . Days and nights would be required to give the detail . " This testimony of Africa being finished , the same inquiry is put to Asia : " Asia , to what extent have the nations of Christendom visited thee , and thy numerous islands ? What have they carried to thy shores ? and what has been their deportment towards thee ? " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men or of ships from Christian lands , that have visited my shores , can not be told . I know full well the enterprise , the energy , and the perseverance of Christian lands ; yes , verily , and traits too of less honorable name . Large portions of my territory acknowledge the control of their armies . Their thundering navies lie in my harbors and sail along my coasts . Ships without number  --  mighty ships whose masts pierce the clouds , have come for my teas , my crapes , my silks , my spices and other precious merchandise . Their consuls , superintendents , officers of various kinds , and merchants in great numbers , dwell in almost every port , and have erected in those ports stores , shops , offices and sumptuous dwellings . Many things pleasant and useful have been brought hither , but many things also that are ruinous : full cargoes of ardent spirits ; and immense quantities of opium too , a means of destruction no less sure . " Among the multitudes who have come to my shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christ , made known its truths and exemplified its spirit ; but the thousands and tens of thousands have inculcated by their example , worldliness , drunkenness , lewdness , war , violence and treachery . If needful , a volume of details might be given ; but this is the sum . " Next , the inquiry is put to the Isles of the Ocean : " Great Pacific , to what extent has the last command of Christ been obeyed by Christian lands , in respect to thy numerous islands ? " The reply is as follows : " Thousands of ships from Christian lands continually cruise upon my wide waters , and visit my numerous groups of islands . They have exchanged with my ignorant and destitute inhabitants , beads , trinkets , and a few inches of rusty iron hoop , for the best produce of the islands . They have sold to them guns , powder and rum . Many of their ships have been floating grog-shops  --  floating exhibitions too of Sodom and Gomorrah . From some , on slight provocation , broadsides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deep with the dead and the dying . Rum and disease have been introduced . The one has slain its thousands , and the other has slain , and is still slaying its tens of thousands . Many useful things indeed have been introduced , but in connection with a host of evils ! A few individuals too , bearing the Gospel of Jesus Christ , have visited some of my numerous islands ; but what are they among the multitude ? " After this testimony of the Isles of the Ocean , the inquiry is last addressed to America : " America , what is thy testimony ? From Bhering 's Straits to Cape Horn , what treatment have thy native inhabitants received from Christian nations ? " America replies : " Alas ! scarcely enough remain of my miserable inhabitants to return an answer .

Have I been visited by those who bear the Christian name ? Yes , verily , they now possess the best portions of my territory , and have grown into vast nations on my soil . Even my veriest wilds have been repeatedly traversed by them in search of furs ; and the tracks they have made been too often marked with drunkenness , lewdness , and treachery . Few , very few indeed of all that have come to this vast continent , have come to instruct my ignorant inhabitants in the precious Gospel of Jesus Christ , and lead them in the paths of righteousness and peace . Few who explore my wilds , explore them for this purpose . Alas ! a far different object prompts their enterprise , their energy , and their perseverance . This is the sum of my testimony . " Now , reader , let us look well at this testimony of Africa , of Asia , of the Isles of the Ocean , and of America . Is it not overwhelming ? Take , the Encyclopedia of Geography , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Christianity , and carefully examine the facts . Are they not enough to strike us dumb ? To what a vast extent heathen nations have been visited by those who bear the Christian name . What obscure island , or what obscure nook or corner of the earth has not been visited ? What immense multitudes have gone forth . AND , ALAS ! FOR WHAT PURPOSES . How few , how very few have gone forth to make known the Gospel ! What a powerful motive among men is the love of earthly gain , and how weak a motive is love to Christ and regard to his last command . The command reads , " GO YE INTO ALL THE WORLD AND PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY CREATURE . " Christian nations , ye have not failed in great multitudes to " GO INTO ALL THE WORLD ; " scarcely have ye failed to visit " EVERY CREATURE ; " but for what purpose have ye gone forth ? Has it been mainly to make known the precious name of Jesus ? Be entreated to look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retribution is at hand . Many of you indeed , who go forth to heathen shores , do not profess to be the disciples of Jesus ; but imagine not , that on that account your guilt is diminished . Ye who reject the Saviour , and disobey his commands  --  who throw away your own souls as worthless , and are reckless of the souls of your fellow men , what can you say in the day of Christ 's appearing ? If ye had only destroyed your own souls , then your case would be more tolerable ; but since you withhold from the millions of ignorant heathen the knowledge of salvation , which has been imparted to you  --  not only refusing to enter the kingdom of heaven yourselves , but denying the key to those who might be disposed to enter ;  --  and not only do this , but in your intercourse with the heathen , which has been very abundant , confirm them in their evil practices by a pernicious example , and hurry them by thousands to the grave by means of deadly poison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keen remorse and fearful looking for of judgment , which may ere long overtake you ? When the impartial Judge shall appear , and your eyes shall meet his eye , what agonies must rend your souls ! But some of you have the vows of God upon you . To such I would say , Be entreated to look at the case as it is . As ye have gone forth on voyages of just and honorable traffic , and on voyages of discovery , have you manifested in all the heathen ports where you touched , that to make known the Saviour was the great and absorbing desire of your hearts ? Alas ! are there not some among you who , either as owners , masters or agents , are connected with ships that sail from port on the Sabbath , or do other unnecessary work on that day , and who thereby teach the heathen , wherever those ships go , to disobey God when their gain or convenience require it ? Are there not also some among you , who , in one way or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in part , beads , trinkets , guns , powder , rum and opium ? and who thereby teach the heathen injustice , cheating , drunkenness , lewdness , and recklessness of life ? Why is it that ye bear the name of the peaceful disciples of the benevolent Jesus , whilst ye are concerned in scattering among the heathen " fire-brands , arrows and death "  --  in teaching them every species of iniquity , and in rearing a wall of prejudice strong and high to the progress of the Gospel ? * * * * * But most of my readers stand pure from all this crime ; and of such I simply inquire , with deep concern and affectionate earnestness , Why , dear brethren , have ye not obeyed the Saviour 's last command ? Why have ye not made known the Gospel of Christ to every creature ? Each one of you has doubtless some excuse at hand , or he could not escape the goadings of conscience . Let us then , in the spirit of candor and honesty , look at some EXCUSES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The work enjoined by the Saviour 's last command is a very great work , and there has not been time enough to perform it . " True , I reply , the work is great ; but how does it appear that there has not been sufficient time to accomplish it ? Not sufficient time ! What has been accomplished in the pursuit of wealth and honor during the same period of time ? What has been done at home in railroads , canals , steamboats , manufactures , and in other departments of enterprise and industry ? What has been done abroad ? Look at the testimony of Africa , Asia , the Isles of the Pacific , and the wilds of America . There has been time to carry rum to every shore . There has been time to introduce diseases among every barbarous people , which are hurrying them to the grave by thousands . There has been time to kidnap thousands and hundreds of thousands of the degraded Africans . There has been time to extirpate most of the native population of North and South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the blood of human beings has flowed in torrents . And then , in regard to just and honorable traffic , compute , if human arithmetic be competent to the task , the amount of merchandise brought from India , and from other distant lands . There has been time for all this . Now I ask with great plainness , for it is a solemn and practical subject , Had you exhibited the same enterprise , energy and perseverance , in making known the Gospel to all nations , as has been exhibited in worldly pursuits , would not every human being , long ere this , have heard the word of life ? Will you not , Christian reader , look at this question , weigh it well , and deal honestly with your own soul ? Here , I am suspicious that some may be inclined to excuse themselves with a vague thought secretly entertained , which , if expressed , would be somewhat as follows : " True , we have not exhibited as much zeal in teaching all nations as has been exhibited by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pursuit of wealth . But we claim not the praise of a holy , self-denying and apostolic life . We are content with an humble walk in the Christian course , and a low seat in heaven . Entire consecration , in the sense urged , is what we never professed . " Your standard , then , it appears is very low  --  too low , it may be , to admit you even to that humble seat in the courts above which you anticipate . You claim not the praise of an apostolic life , and I seriously fear that you will not obtain even the testimony of being a true Christian . But how does it appear , that you never professed an entire consecration to Christ of all your powers of body and soul ? It is true , the conduct of some would seem to say , that they put on a form of religion to silence their fears , to cheat themselves with a delusive hope , and to enjoy a comfortable state of mind on earth . But what , really , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek by prayer and effort , as your supreme aim , chief desire , and all-engrossing object , the promotion of Christ 's kingdom  --  the salvation of souls for whom he died ? Besides , what is the great purpose for which the church was instituted ? Certainly , not to promote in its members a delusive comfort and quietude of mind ; neither mainly nor chiefly to secure their own ultimate salvation ; but to take advantage of union of strength to convert the world . The church  --  the whole church , without the exception of any of its members , is by profession , not merely a missionary society , but a missionary band : the minute-men of the Lord Jesus , ready to do his will , at home or abroad , with singleness of aim , and with a spirit of entire devotion . " But , " you say , " were we thus to live , the world would verily believe we were deranged . " Deranged ! it would be the right kind of derangement . Were not the apostles thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melancthon , Calvin , Knox and others  --  were not they thought to be enthusiasts and zealots ? Why ? Because they were somewhat in earnest in the cause of Christ . Worldly men toil and strive night and day , in collecting together a little of the pelf and dust of the earth , and think themselves wise in doing so ; but if the disciples of Christ show zeal or earnestness , in pursuits as much higher than theirs as heaven is higher than the earth , and as much more important as the immortal soul is more valuable than corruption and vanity , they call them enthusiasts and fanatics ! But , alas ! how few of us who profess to be the disciples of Christ , have manifested such zeal in his service as to be called by such epithets . Such persons alone God calls wise ; and those worldly men , who are mad in the pursuit of wealth , God calls " fools . " The wisdom of God and the wisdom of the world are utterly at variance . O that all who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as to be strange and singular men ! How soon would every human being hear his Gospel ! But since such zeal is not manifested , the heathen are left to perish ; and where , I ask affectionately and solemnly , where rests the guilt ? But , here it may perhaps be replied , " Our sin is a sin of ignorance . We have not been acquainted with the full import of the Saviour 's last command , nor with the extent of our obligations to Christ . Neither have we been acquainted with the wretched and guilty condition of the heathen world , nor with the exertions necessary to turn it from darkness to light , from the power of Satan unto God . God will wink at our sin , if we be indeed guilty , for we have not been enlightened on this subject . " I answer . Does ignorance of the laws of any nation excuse those who transgress those laws ; or is it not considered to be the duty of all subjects to inform themselves in respect to the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kingdom of Christ ? The requirements of Christ in their full extent are contained in the New Testament , and are expressed in language that need not be misunderstood . If any one has mistaken their import , is it not on account of a self-seeking , money-getting , or slothful disposition ? Let such a one search his own heart , and inquire with concern , " Did I desire to know my duty ? Was not my blindness a matter of choice ; no infirmity , no misfortune , but my guilt ? If there had been a desire , nay , even a willingness to be instructed , could I have mistaken such plain and unequivocal precepts of the Gospel ? " The condition too of the heathen , their guilty and wretched condition , is fully made known in the New Testament , especially in the first chapter of Paul 's epistle to the Romans . Besides , accounts of their guilt and wretchedness have been presented before the Christian community in Heralds , Chronicles , reports and newspapers , till they have become too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day be any other than a criminal ignorance  --  an ignorance of fearful responsibility ? And , I ask again , Can it be an excuse to many Christians that they are laymen and not preachers of the Gospel ? Can they make it appear that many of their number were not called to the office of preaching the Gospel ? Did they take the proper means to ascertain that point ? How , I anxiously inquire , did such persons determine so readily , when a world was sinking to perdition for want of preachers of the Gospel , that they were called to be lawyers , physicians , statesmen , merchants , farmers and manufacturers ? Can it be fairly shown that hundreds of laymen have not rejected an office to which they were called  --  SOLEMNLY CALLED , by the woes and dying groans of six hundred millions of their fellow men ? Is there not reason to fear , that it was from a carnal choice and selfish inclination , rather than a sense of duty , that so great a majority slid so easily into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only preachers of the Gospel are required to labor directly for the destitute at home , and to go forth to the heathen abroad ? It was far otherwise in the days of the apostles . Then the whole church  --  driven out , indeed , by persecution  --  went everywhere making known the Saviour . And at the present hour , not only are ministers needed in propagating the Gospel in destitute places at home , and in raising up heathen nations from their deep degradation , but there are needed also , in their appropriate spheres , teachers , physicians , mechanics , farmers  --  in short , men of every useful profession and employment . Besides , much is to be done at home in sustaining those who go abroad . Has there been no lack in this part of the work ? Alas ! there are facts to meet such an inquiry , facts too well known to be named : disbanded schools , detained missionaries , and deserted monthly concerts : facts that stand registered on a book that shall hereafter be opened . Dear brethren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forgetting my own ; and I would entreat you , by all that is affecting in the death of souls , and by all that is constraining in the love of Christ , to admit freely to your hearts , without subterfuge or excuse , the full import of the Saviour 's last command , and to commence at once a life of sincere obedience . O ! let us deal honestly with ourselves , in a matter of such immense moment . CHAPTER V. LAYMEN CALLED TO THE FIELD OF MISSIONS . In Acts , 8:4 , it is said , Therefore they that were scattered abroad , went everywhere preaching the word . And from the previous verses it seems that these persons , who were scattered abroad , were lay members of the church . The history is instructive . After the day of Pentecost , the number of converts to Christianity amounted to several thousands . They were Jews , and had strong feelings of attachment to the city of Jerusalem , to the temple , and to the land of their fathers . They therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one large church . But it was the design of the Lord Jesus , that the Gospel should be preached everywhere : such was his last and most solemn command . As , therefore , the disciples seemed in a measure unmindful of this command , the Saviour permitted a persecution to rage , which scattered them abroad , and they went " everywhere preaching the word . " The term preaching , in this place , means simply announcing or making known the news of salvation . This must be the meaning , for they that were scattered abroad were laymen . As they went , they told everywhere of Jesus Christ , and of the life and immortality which he had brought to light . This subject engrossed their thoughts ; their hearts were full of it , and out of the abundance of their hearts their mouths spake . It is clear from this history , that in early times lay members of the church , in great numbers , were led , in the providence of God , to go forth and engage personally in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we look at the history , the more we shall be impressed with this fact . Notice the time chosen by God for the first remarkable outpouring of his Holy Spirit . It was on the day of Pentecost , when multitudes were present , not only from all parts of Palestine , but from the surrounding nations . There were present , " Parthians , and Medes , and Elamites , and the dwellers in Mesopotamia , and in Judea , and Cappadocia , in Pontus and Asia , Phrygia and Pamphylia , in Egypt and the parts of Lybia about Cyrene , and strangers of Rome , Jews and proselytes , Cretes and Arabians . " Upon this multitude , assembled from all the nations round about , the Holy Ghost was poured out with such power , that three thousand souls were converted in one day ; and on succeeding days many were added to the church . Many of these converts would naturally return to the different nations and places from which they came , and make known the Saviour far and wide . It was by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the Gospel was early introduced into many places quite remote from Jerusalem , among which may be reckoned , in all probability , the distant city of Rome . The first propagation of the Gospel in that metropolis of the world , can be traced to no other source with so much probability , as to the strangers from Rome who were present at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost . It seems evident , therefore , that in the time chosen by God for this remarkable outpouring of his Spirit , he had an eye to an extensive and rapid propagation of the Gospel by lay members of the church . Again , as hinted before , when the great body of the first converts chose to remain at Jerusalem , God saw best to drive them thence by persecution . This persecution began with the stoning of Stephen , and raged with such violence , that it is said that all the church at Jerusalem were scattered abroad , except the apostles . They were not only a few individuals who were driven out , but so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . " By thus dispersing the great body of the church , the Saviour propagated rapidly and extensively his precious Gospel . For this multitude of lay members  --  and there were several thousands of them  --  went everywhere preaching the word ; announcing in all places , in a way appropriate to their station , the news of salvation through a crucified Redeemer . They propagated the Gospel throughout Judea and Samaria ; and some of them travelled as far as Phoenice and Cyprus , and laid the foundation of the church at Antioch . It was not till the apostles had heard of the success of these lay members at Antioch , that they sent thither Barnabas to help in the work . It appears , then , that the rapid and extensive propagation of the Gospel , in early times , was accomplished in a great measure by the spreading abroad of the great body of the church ; by an actual going forth and personal engagement of a great multitude of lay members . Again , the treasurer of Candace , Queen of Ethiopia , seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply out of regard to his own personal salvation , but as a means of making known the Gospel in the distant place of his residence ; for soon after , we find in that region a flourishing church of Christ . Again , look at the example of Aquila and Priscilla , who labored zealously at Corinth and at Ephesus . Look , too , at the whole list of Paul 's fellow travellers , and those whom he salutes in his letters as helpers in the Gospel . From all these facts it is evident , that in early times God made use of common Christians in propagating the Gospel . Did he not so overrule events in his providence , as to show it to be his design that lay members of the church should go forth in great numbers , and engage personally , in ways appropriate and proper for them , in the work of making known Christ ? We have then the force of primitive example  --  of primitive example , too , brought about by the manifest overrulings of God 's providence . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus saith the Lord ; " yet does it not strongly favor the sentiment , that lay members of the church in great numbers are called to go forth and assist in evangelizing the heathen ? To elevate all nations requires a great variety of laborers . In illustrating this point , I can not expect to present it with all the clearness and force which are due to it . To appreciate fully its truth and its weighty import , it is necessary to live in the midst of a heathen people , and actually to witness the great variety and amount of labor which must be put forth , in order to elevate and improve them . The work of raising up a people from barbarism to Christianity is not only an immense work , but emphatically a various work  --  a work which requires a great diversity both of means and of laborers . The minister of the Gospel must perform a prominent part , but he must not be expected to labor alone . His unaided efforts are altogether insufficient for the task . There is special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the heathen is likely to be so small ; but the need would exist , even though the number of ministers were very much increased . Labors analogous , both in respect to measure and variety , to those bestowed upon a Christian congregation , must be expended on a congregation of heathen . In Christian countries , a thousand important labors are performed by intelligent and praying men and women in the church , as direct aid to the minister in his arduous work ; and a thousand offices are performed by schoolmasters , physicians , lawyers , merchants , farmers , mechanics and artisans , which , though in most cases not aimed directly at the salvation of men , are , notwithstanding , most intimately connected with the world 's improvement and renovation . But while ministers at home are assisted in their work , shall the missionary abroad receive little or no help in his direct labors ? And in respect to all improvements in society indirectly connected with his main work , must the task of introducing them and of urging them on , devolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of civilizing and improving society at home , be brought to exert their influence upon the heathen abroad ? Why should not the aid enjoyed by the minister in Christian lands , from intelligent members of his church , be afforded to the missionary among the heathen ? How , indeed , shall the world be converted , unless there be a going forth to heathen lands from among all classes of Christians ? But I fear that these remarks are too general to be distinctly understood . To make my meaning , then , a little more clear , I will suppose a case . A missionary goes forth to a barbarous nation , and locates himself in a village of four thousand souls . He learns the language of the people , and soon succeeds in giving them a superficial knowledge of the great truths of the Gospel . God blesses his labors . The people throw away their idols ; many sincerely embrace the Lord Jesus ; and the community at large acknowledge Christianity as the religion of the land . Now , a superficial thinker might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done ; but , in truth , it is but just commenced . The missionary looks upon his people , and wishes them not only to be Christians in name , but to exhibit also intelligence and good order , purity and loveliness , industry and enterprise ; in a word , a deportment in all respects consistent with the religion of Jesus . But what is their state ? The government is despotic , and the principles of its administration at variance with Scripture and reason . This takes away all motives to industry and thrift . Then again , the people are ignorant ; have no mental discipline , no store of useful knowledge , but their minds are marked with torpor , imbecility , and poverty of thought : while at the same time they are full of grovelling ideas , false opinions , and superstitious notions , imbibed in childhood and confirmed by age . The children , too , are growing up in ignorance of all that is useful and praiseworthy . Entirely uninstructed and ungoverned by their parents ; they range at large like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simple business of making cloth , of working iron , or of framing wood ; and have but a very imperfect knowledge of agriculture . Of course , men , women and children , are almost houseless and naked  --  destitute of everything but the rudest structures , the rudest fabrications , and the rudest tools and implements of husbandry . A large family herd together , of all ages and both sexes , in one little hut , sleep on one mat , and eat from one dish . From irregularity of habits and frequent exposure , they are often sick ; and with the aid of a superstitious quackery , sink rapidly and in great numbers to the grave . The missionary looks upon his four thousand villagers , though nominally Christian perhaps , yet still in this state of destitution , degradation and ignorance . He sees , that to elevate them requires the labors not only of a preacher of the Gospel , but the labors of the civilian , the physician , the teacher , the agriculturist , the manufacturer , the mechanic and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one man ? Can one missionary sustain all this variety of labor ? Yet all these departments of labor are absolutely indispensable to the improvement and elevation of society . They are necessary in a land already Christian . Still more indispensable are they in the work of raising up a people from barbarism . Teachers are needed . To raise a people from barbarism , the simple but efficient means of common schools must be everywhere diffused ; and higher schools too must be established , and vigorously conducted . To teach the hundreds of millions of adult heathen in week-day schools and in Sabbath-schools , and more especially to instruct and train the hundreds of millions of heathen children and youth , can not be done by a few hands . We forbear to make a numerical estimate : any one may estimate for himself . The number must be great , even though we look upon them rather as a commencing capital than as an adequate supply , and expect that by far the greater part of laborers are to be trained up from among the heathen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this labor on a few ministers of the Gospel . Physicians are needed . They are needed to benefit the bodies of the heathen ; for disease , the fruit of sin , is depopulating with amazing speed a large portion of the heathen world . The nations , many of them at least , are melting away . Let physicians go forth , and while they seek to stay the tide of desolation which is sweeping away the bodies of the heathen , let them improve the numerous and very favorable opportunities afforded them of benefiting their souls . The benevolent , sympathizing , and compassionate spirit of Christ , led him to relieve the temporal sufferings of men , while his main aim was to secure their eternal salvation . Unless we show , by our exertions , a desire to mitigate the present woes and miseries of men , how shall we convince them that we truly seek their eternal welfare ? Physicians must throw their skill in the healing art at the feet of the Saviour , and be ready to use it when and where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heathen can not , and need not , be named . It is unnecessary to remark that printers , book-binders , and book-distributers are needed to carry on the work of the world 's conversion . Civilians too are needed : men skilled in laying the foundation of nations and guiding their political economy . Should such men go forth , and evince by a prayerful , godly , and disinterested deportment and course of procedure , that their sole aim was to promote the happiness of the people , both temporal and eternal ; there are many barbarous countries where they would readily acquire much influence , and be able in a gradual manner , by friendly and prudent suggestions to the rulers , and in other ways , to effect changes that would be productive of incalculable good . Many changes , with pains-taking and care , could be made to appear to the rulers to be really for their interest , as well as for the interest of the people ; and more light and knowledge , without the intervention of any new motive , would soon introduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefs of the Sandwich Islands sent a united appeal to the United States for such an instructor , to guide them in the government of their kingdom , and offered him a competent support . While the nation had improved in religion and morals , the government had remained much as it was  --  keeping the people in the condition of serfs . The system was wrong throughout : of the very worst kind , both for the interests of the rulers and of the subjects . The chiefs began to see this , and asked for an instructor . Such an instructor was not obtained ; and one of the missionaries was constrained , by the urgent necessity , to leave the service of the mission board , and to become a political teacher to the king and chiefs . His efforts have been crowned with great success . Civilians might do good also , not only in the way of their profession , but by a Christian example , and by instructing the people , as opportunity should offer , in the knowledge of Christ . Commercial men also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might develope the resources of heathen lands , and apply them in a wise manner for the benefit of those lands ; promote industry , and afford the means of civilized habits ; increase knowledge , by expediting communication ; and in this way , indirectly , though efficiently , aid the progress of the Gospel . By exhibiting also in their dealings an example of honesty , uprightness , and a conscientious regard to justice and truth ; by showing practically the only proper use of wealth , the good of men and the glory of God ; by conversing daily with individuals , as did Harlan Page and Normand Smith , at their houses and by the wayside , on the great subject of the soul 's salvation ; and by presenting in themselves and in their families examples of a prayerful and godly life , they might exert a powerful influence , and perform a very important part in Christianizing the world . There is also much need of farmers , mechanics , manufacturers and artisans . They should go forth like other laborers in the field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the disinterested intention of benefiting the nations . Private gain must be kept strictly , carefully , and absolutely subordinate , or immense evil will be wrought and no good be done . They should be men who cheerfully throw themselves and their property on the altar of entire consecration , and go forth to labor and toil so long as the Saviour pleases to employ them , with the lofty design of doing good to the bodies and souls of their perishing fellow men . Going forth with such a spirit , and with emphasis I repeat , allowing no other to intrude , they could do much in raising up the nations from their deep degradation . In the first place , they could do much good by communicating a knowledge of their several employments . Not only is a reform in government necessary , but an introduction of the useful arts also , to raise up the people from their indolence and filthy habits , and to promote thrift , order , neatness and consistency . Look at a heathen family as above described . How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can you expect from them the proprieties and consistencies of a Christian life ? Even though they may attend the sanctuary , and be instructed in schools ; and even though the government be reformed , and hold out motives to industry ; yet will not something else be wanting ? Unless the various useful arts and occupations be introduced , how is the land to be filled with fruitful fields , pleasant dwellings , and neatly clad inhabitants ? And to introduce these improvements , men must go forth for the purpose . Such men too might do good , by exhibiting in themselves and in their families habits of industry , domestic peace and strict economy ; by holding up the hands of Christ 's ministers , and by scattering the word of life in their appropriate spheres . That laymen of every useful occupation are needed in heathen lands , is by no means the opinion of one alone . In looking over the periodicals and papers of the last few years , I find that such is the sober and deliberate opinion of many foreign laborers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least five important missionary fields . Would such appeals be made if the enterprise were not a feasible one ? Look too at the fact , that there is scarcely a nation on the globe where men do not go , and permanently reside for the purpose of making money . It is absolutely amazing to what an extent this is the truth . Why then can not men go forth , and while they obtain a livelihood , make it their ultimate and chief aim to do good ? But the inquiry arises , In what way should laymen go forth ? It may not be desirable that they should go forth , to any great extent , under the care of missionary boards at present existing , lest the objects of those boards should become too numerous and complicated . And it may not perhaps be desirable , or necessary , to have any other organization for the purpose . I am not wise enough to give an opinion ; but would suggest , that men of some pecuniary means take those means , and emigrate to heathen lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far West . May there not also be small combinations of men , not to help others , but each other into the field , just as there is in worldly enterprise ? When once established in the field , it is supposed that their trades and occupations will afford them , with trials , hardships and reverses , an adequate subsistence , and open before them a wide door of usefulness . Some have suggested , that ministers of the Gospel should go forth and sustain themselves abroad . That is a far different question . If ministers of the Gospel ought not to sustain themselves in Christian countries by laboring with their hands , still less should they attempt such a course in foreign fields . They have other work to do  --  enough to occupy all their time . But for laymen to go forth , and sustain themselves in this way , is it not both proper and appropriate ? and have not such enterprises , to some extent , been already entered upon with success ? Different fields , of course , present greater or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perplexities , embarrassments and sufferings , would be a matter of course ; but no greater and perhaps far less than those Christians endured , who , being scattered abroad from their beloved Jerusalem , went everywhere preaching the word . It may perhaps be objected , that should many from all classes of Christians thus go forth , to live and labor abroad , they would soon possess the land , while the heathen would melt away before them . Let us look at this point . And first , where is the evidence of such a result ? When and where has the experiment been tried to justify such a supposition ? When and where have individuals or companies gone forth with the sole design of benefiting the heathen , and yet proved their extermination ? The settlers of New England are not an example in point , for the improvement and salvation of the heathen was not their main aim . It was indeed an idea in mind , but not fully and prominently carried out . It is yet to be proved that a company of persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save the nations , and directing all their energies of body and of mind to that end , would prove the extermination of the heathen , instead of their salvation . Neither can it be presumed that the descendants of such persons , trained , as ought to be supposed , with faith and prayer , would possess a spirit so selfish and different from that of their fathers , as to prove the extermination of the heathen . And if such is the necessary event , what is the conclusion at which we must arrive ? It seems certain , that a mere handful of missionaries can not put forth the instrumentality which , according to God 's usual providence , is necessary to save them : that a great number and variety of laborers are needed to do the work . Let us be slow , therefore , to trust in the objection ; for if it must be admitted , the lawful inference will not necessarily be , that Christians of all classes and in great numbers should not go forth to the heathen ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not cease to exist , and remnants of them only be saved  --  a painful and dread alternative , from which every benevolent heart must instinctively recoil . There are other reasons why laymen should engage in the work of missions . The work of the world 's conversion is too great , too momentous and too pressing , to admit of exemption simply on the ground of profession or employment . When the liberties of a people are at stake , how few are excused from the field of battle ? But now the question is not one of temporal liberty : it is whether six hundred millions of the human race shall be won to the company of the redeemed on high , or left to sink in the untold agonies of the world of woe . In this unparalleled emergency , when the question is , whether the destiny of a world shall be heaven or hell , who can be excused on so slight a ground as that of profession or employment ? A few ministers can not do the work . It is too great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete triumph is to be effected by a few missionaries of the right stamp going through the length and breadth of Satan 's extensive and dark empire , and sounding as they go the trumpet of the Gospel around his strong fortifications and deep intrenchments . Such an expectation places an immeasurable disparity between the means and the end . It supposes it to be so easy to effect a transformation of heathen society , heathen habits , heathen minds , and heathen character , and to raise them up from a degradation many ages deep , that a few sounds only from the herald of salvation , as he passes on his way , are sufficient . " Leviathan is not thus tamed . " The prince of the power of the air is not thus vanquished . Neither can the work be effected by a small number of preachers , stationed at different posts , in the midst of the wide domains of darkness and death . Like specks of light , few and far between , how can they illumine the broad canopy of darkness ? To commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missionaries is , in effect , to leave the heathen to perish . A large company of preachers must go forth , and a large company too of other laborers . There must be among the whole body of Christians , not only an interest in the work , but to a greater extent than is imagined , a personal enlistment  --  an actual going forth to foreign lands . Again , laymen must go abroad ; for no less a movement than this will convince them that the work of saving the heathen presses upon them individually , and with all its weight and responsibility . Mere giving does not seem to answer the purpose . Very few laymen at home seem to imagine that they , individually , are as responsible for the life and death of the heathen , as the laborers abroad . Many seem to act only as they are acted upon . This passive state will not answer : there must be a more general feeling of personal responsibility . And how is such a feeling of equal and individual responsibility to be induced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Till then , there will be a spirit of luxury in the church ; a spirit of worldly-mindedness , and a spirit of committing the world 's conversion to other hands . To destroy this spirit , which is evidently eating out the piety of the churches , laymen must be urged to arise ; to break off their luxuries , to bury their covetousness  --  to make an entire devotement of body , soul and spirit , to the direct and arduous work of saving the heathen . Once , I remember , after urging laymen to go forth , and to assist in evangelizing the heathen , a father in the church said to me , " Your reasons are just and weighty , but it is of no use to present them before the churches : they have not piety enough to act upon them . If you can clearly show that men can accumulate wealth , that they can really make fortunes by going to heathen lands , then your appeals will succeed . Bring this selfish principle to operate , and colonies will quickly scatter over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-denial , running the risk of trials and straitened circumstances , and with merely the prospect at best of obtaining a comfortable livelihood and doing good , is a measure not adapted to the present standard of piety in the churches . Until the spirit of devotedness shall rise many degrees in the churches , the course you urge will be looked upon as entirely visionary . " Alas ! can the church be so low in grace ? If it be a fact , it is painful and humiliating . If it be true , then the church is lacking in the most essential qualification required of it  --  is unfitted for the main design of its organization ; and is there not reason to fear that God may cast it away , as he has the Roman church , and raise up another after his own heart , that shall do all his pleasure ? Christian reader , can you calmly entertain the thought of being set aside by the Lord as unworthy of his employment  --  of being rejected on the ground of not fulfilling the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF MISSIONS ON MINISTERS OF INFLUENCE . In early days , ministers of the greatest influence were called to the work of missions . To prove this assertion , let us read the first verse of the 13th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles . " Now there were in the church that was at Antioch , certain prophets and teachers ; as Barnabas , and Simeon that was called Niger , and Lucius of Cyrene , and Manaen , which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch , and Saul . As they ministered to the Lord , and fasted , the Holy Ghost said , Separate me Barnabas and Saul , for the work whereunto I have called them . " Paul had been at Antioch a whole year , and Barnabas a still longer time . Their labors there had been blessed . The word had been attended with the demonstration of the Spirit and with power , and many people had turned to the Lord , so that a large church had been gathered in that great and opulent city . Believers there became so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular name : " The disciples were called Christians first in Antioch . " There were laboring in that city , besides Paul and Barnabas , three other ministers ; " Simeon that was called Niger , and Lucius of Cyrene , and Manaen , who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch . " The Holy Ghost saw that this city , though very important for its numbers , wealth and enterprise , could not claim the labors of five ministers , while the world at large was entirely destitute of the Gospel . Therefore , on a certain occasion , when the church were worshipping before the Lord and fasting , the Holy Ghost said , " Separate me Barnabas and Saul , for the work whereunto I have called them . " The Holy Ghost did not say , " Separate me Simeon , and Lucius , and Manaen , " but , " Separate me BARNABAS and SAUL "  --  the spiritual fathers , and main pillars of the church . Had the church been allowed to vote , it doubtless would have spared its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated their fond attachment to their first instructors ; would have plead the great influence of these two fathers in the church , and the irreparable injury which would be sustained by their leaving it ; and would have said , If we must part with some of our teachers , take Simeon , and Lucius , and Manaen , but bereave us not of our spiritual fathers . The question however was not left to their decision . The demand is stern and solemn from the Holy Spirit , with whom there is no selfish bias , " Separate me BARNABAS and SAUL . " In reflecting on this narration , do we not come to the conclusion , that MEN OF TALENTS AND INFLUENCE ARE CALLED TO THE WORK OF MISSIONS ? If this sentiment be true , it is one of immense and practical importance ; one that not only ministers , but churches also ought fully to understand . Let us , then , dwell a moment longer on the practice of early times . The instance to which we have alluded is a striking one ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Holy Spirit . It is infallible authority that speaks , and what does it declare ? The paramount claim of missions to the ablest , holiest , and most experienced men . If Antioch was required to spare her two ablest men , what may not be required of such cities as Boston , New York , Philadelphia , and Baltimore ? And judging too from this case of Antioch , what is the mind of the Holy Ghost in regard to the twelve thousand or more evangelical ministers in the United States ? Can it be his will that they should all quietly remain where they are ? Again , God in early times made known his mind on this point , not only by the express admonition of the Holy Ghost , but also by the overrulings of his Providence . Take the account of the first dispersion . The Saviour ascended from the Mount of Olives , and the disciples returned to Jerusalem . The day of Pentecost arrived , and three thousand converts were added to their number . This multitude of believers was daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very large city , the capital and pride of the nation , and a place of immense resort from all the nations round about . And in this city were many thousands of Christians , who were in peculiar need of constant care and faithful instruction , and had they been divided out to the pastoral care of the twelve apostles , would have made perhaps as large churches as any twelve in the city of New-York . Jerusalem then presented to the apostles a vast amount of pastoral care , and a field of labor unequalled perhaps in religious influence , considering the world as it then was , by any city that can be named within the limits of Christendom . The apostles were inclined to remain in Jerusalem , and considering the call for labor there , it is not wonderful that they were thus inclined . They seemed for a time to have forgotten the last command of their ascended Lord , and to have chosen a work more resembling that of settled pastors . But the Saviour allowed a persecution to rage in the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards all the apostles , except James , were scattered abroad . So the great Jerusalem was left with but one apostle . Eleven of the twelve , who had become in a measure settled there , were driven abroad ; and not from Jerusalem only , but without the limits of Palestine . Such is evidently the fact . Let every one draw from it the instruction it affords . To my mind it clashes irreconcilably with the present distribution of ministers . Take another case . Paul had been laboring at Ephesus two whole years , and had collected a very large church in that city . This city was the emporium of Asia Minor ; a place of much resort , and greatly celebrated throughout the known world . The large number of disciples there , who needed a pastor to warn them day and night with tears , and the wide door which was there opened for preaching the Gospel , presented such strong claims to the mind of Paul , as seemed likely to fix there his permanent abode . What pastor of the present day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul might have urged for continuing his relation to the large church at Ephesus ? For in addition to a large city and a large church , the converts had been but lately gathered from heathenism  --  were but babes in Christ  --  and needed constant instruction and unwearied care . Yet God was pleased to allow Demetrius to excite an uproar , and thus to sever Paul from his church and congregation , and send him abroad into Macedonia . This is another fact  --  a STUBBORN FACT , which we ought to bear in mind , and weigh well . If God saw best thus to break tender ties , separate Paul from a large city and a large body of such converts as , above all others , needed special care , and to leave the important post almost destitute , can it be his will that all the pastors of the present day should stay in their places , and that none of them should go forth to the heathen ? If the city had been Boston , with its thousand means of grace , the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a heathen city , and depending almost entirely on the living voice of Paul , and yet this one preacher must become a missionary . Let us look at this fact , and each one for himself draw conclusions ; not those that are wild and extravagant , but such as are true and sober . We have here a commentary on the last command of Jesus . It was commented upon by the providence of God , separating the apostles from Jerusalem , Antioch , and Ephesus . It was commented upon by the direct admonition of the Holy Ghost in a particular case . It was commented upon by the practice of the apostles . Let us beware that we substitute not , for this correct commentary , any worldly-wise interpretation of our own . Let us admit it just as it comes to us from early days , fresh and unmodified , and allow it to govern our lives . There are but few who do not admit , that the present distribution of ministers is anti-apostolic  --  that many , who are now pastors , ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can the mere fact of being settled have produced such a vast change in the question of duty , as to place it forever at rest ? If the clustering together of twelve thousand ministers within the bounds of the United States , where a thousand means of grace and improvement exist besides the voice of the living teacher , is a very different thing from going into all the world , and preaching the Gospel to every creature  --  an egregious disproportion to the wants of the world  --  must we stifle all emotion and all inquiry , in taking it for granted that it is now too late for change ? And yet there seems to be a tacit understanding , that any other distribution than that now existing , of the present generation of ministers , is a point not to be agitated . At least , many a pastor quiets himself with the thought , that no change is to be contemplated in his particular case , for the care of a church is on his hands . Almost by common consent , pastors are excused ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children ; and the hope of the heathen amounts to this , that some young men may be kept from imitating the example of their fathers and elder brethren , and be prevailed upon to enter the missionary work before they become pastors . For if the mere fact of being a pastor places the question at rest , young men will feel themselves relieved as soon as they enter that office . I have known young men whose minds were goaded on the question of going to the heathen , like the conscience of a convicted sinner , till a call was presented to some important church ; and then they succeeded in laying the subject at once and entirely aside . Like the pursued ostrich , who thrusts her head into the sand , and vainly imagines that she is concealed from her pursuers , so , I fear , some endeavor to elude the convictions of conscience . I put the question to your own good sense , your candor , and your pious feelings : Can the mere fact of being a pastor excuse a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pastor in violation of the Saviour 's command ? It is acknowledged , that many pastors ought to have become missionaries before they were settled  --  that the present amazing disproportion between settled ministers at home , and missionaries abroad , ought never to have existed . To argue so plain a case would be a waste of breath . How then can the fact of having wandered from duty excuse one from the performance of it ? To-day , it is the duty of Jonah to go to Nineveh . To-morrow , he has engaged his passage to Tarshish , has paid his fare , has gone down into the sides of the ship , and is quietly at rest . Is he therefore excused ? To-day , the command of Christ presses upon me the obligation to go to the heathen . To-morrow , leaving out of mind this command , which still applies in all its force , I enter into an obligation with a particular church to take upon me its pastoral care : which obligation is binding ? The last , do you say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last and most impressive command ? Can I , by such a course , shield myself effectually from its further application ? I have yet to learn , that by any change of place or circumstances we can free ourselves from the weight of the Saviour 's injunction . I mean not to assert , that all who ought to have become missionaries before they were settled , ought to become so now . Some have entirely hedged up their way ; and though they may have been disobedient in doing so , yet deep regret and sincere repentance is all the reparation they can now make . But those who ought to have gone to the heathen , and before whom the door is still open for going , such should still become missionaries , and on the obvious principle , that it is better to do our duty late than not to do it all . The mere plea of being a pastor is not a sufficient excuse ; and it is losing too , continually , more and more of its force . It is a wonder that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since , in the present age , the residence of a pastor is very transient and uncertain . Again let me say , it is a great thing , a good thing , and a rare thing , to be entirely honest in the sight of God . Let us endeavor to be so . It is to be feared , that there may be some who exempt themselves from becoming missionaries on the ground of being pastors , who are not altogether honest in their excuse . Are there not some individuals , who make it , who would manifest but little hesitation in leaving the pastoral office to take the oversight of a college , to become a professor in a theological seminary , or to take charge of some prominent religious periodical ? When urged to become a missionary , the pastor pleads his attachment to his people ; their affection for him , which gives him great influence ; and his acquaintance with their prejudices , opinions , habits , and whole character , so as to adapt his instructions to their particular case . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very readily that he can be more useful in his present situation than in any other . But when a presidency , a professorship , or a more influential church is offered , the reasons before urged seem to lose something of their force ; and through the intervention of some new light , which I shall not account for , the conclusion is formed that another situation would be more useful . The motive for a change is a good one ; but it is to be remembered that this same motive , that of being more useful , could not prevail upon them to become missionaries . Facts of this kind could be collected , I think to a considerable extent ; and they lead me , however unwilling , to suspect that , in some cases , the honest reason why ministers do not become missionaries is not that they are pastors , but something quite different . Another fact , too , makes me suspicious that there is some lack of entire honesty . A pastor says he can not become a missionary , for he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for some cause or other , he is dismissed from his church and people . What does he do ? become a missionary ? I have one in my eye who was a pastor of a church in a large city . He told me , that nothing but his relation as pastor in that city could keep him a moment from the missionary work . Soon after , he was dismissed from his church and people ; and think you he became a missionary ? You would betray a very limited knowledge of human nature to think so . " But , " says one , " I am opposed to fickleness and change . " Ah ! indeed ; does it betray fickleness to leave a church to become a missionary ? Did God favor fickleness and change when he prevented the permanent location of the apostles in Palestine , by a voice from heaven , and by violent persecutions ? Did the Saviour favor fickleness in his last command ? When a presidency , a professorship , or a more prominent and influential church is offered you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in place ; but never , never in place , while untold millions of our race are dying for lack of vision , and our commission reads , " GO YE INTO ALL THE WORLD , AND PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY CREATURE . " * * * * * One pastor excuses himself , by saying , " The attachment between me and my people is very dear , and this attachment gives me great influence with them . " I reply , Was not the attachment very dear between the apostles and the disciples at Jerusalem , and also between Paul and the converts at Antioch , and at Ephesus ? What language of affection and solicitude can equal that of Paul for his converts ? He calls them his " joy and crown "  --  the " little children for whom he travails in birth , till Christ be formed in them . " He says to them , " I live , if ye stand fast in the Lord . " And had not the apostles great influence in the churches in which they labored ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Antioch ? Did not the church love and respect them , and hang in breathless silence upon their lips , and look upon their departure as an irreparable loss ? Yet , though entwined into the hearts of the people , and possessing every advantage to instruct them which intimate acquaintance and unbounded influence could give , the Holy Ghost , notwithstanding , said , " Separate me BARNABAS and SAUL . " Attachment is your plea ; but the spirit of the Gospel is a spirit of self-denial , and requires us not only to forsake church and people , but also father and mother , brother and sister , son and daughter , and to hold our own lives loosely . Those persons to whom attachment is strongest , and who ca n't be spared on that account , are the best fitted for missions . You plead the influence which you possess with your church and people . This , instead of being a reason for remaining at home , is a powerful argument for going abroad . In that very influence you possess an advantage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy . It is greatly to be lamented that the church has but little acquaintance with her missionaries . It was not so in primitive times . On this account there is room for the question to arise , Whether there ought not to be less of the home minister for life , and the exile for life ; a narrower gulf between the two , and more passing and repassing , as the apostles were wont to do ; a breaking up of caste , grade and condition among ministers , as regards various fields  --  a more literal compliance with the precept of " going into all the world , and preaching the Gospel to every creature . " Be this however as it may  --  for there is much that can be said on either side of the question  --  it is most certainly true , that the pastor possesses one very great advantage : that by going to the heathen he can wake up , in one church at least , the spirit of doing good  --  the enterprising and benevolent spirit of Christ and his apostles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of its most intelligent and active members , and call forth the contributions and enlist the prayers of those who may remain . It seems , that nothing less than such means as the separation of pastors for the work of missions , can avail to awake the slumbering churches , and to lead them to begin in earnest to seek the salvation of the heathen ; to feel that the work presses upon them individually , and demands all their energies and their personal enlistment . For it is a sober and humiliating fact , as I have had some opportunity of judging , that there are few churches comparatively , in our land , who seem to have drunk deeply into the missionary spirit . There is need , therefore , of a movement on the part of pastors , to arouse the churches from their guilty slumbers . A pastor possesses much influence with his church and congregation . The Lord then has given him five talents , and he can easily make them ten : by going abroad he can benefit his church perhaps as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , be the instrument of saving many heathen souls . " There is that scattereth , and yet increaseth ; " and " he that watereth shall be watered also himself . " God 's blessing distils upon the liberal soul , and the liberal church . The performance of duty is attended with the Saviour 's smiles and a rich reward . Who does not see , that a pastor could in no way so effectually awaken in his church a spirit of benevolent feeling and action , as by exhibiting it in his own person ; by rising up , and going forth to the heathen , urging a part of his flock to accompany him , and the rest to sustain him in the field ? Who doubts , that by such a course he would do more to arouse the pure and active religion of Jesus Christ and his apostles , than he could possibly do in any other way ; that he would give an impulse to his church in favor of primitive piety and practice , that should add vastly to its strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all time to come . Let not the pastor , then , excuse himself from the missionary work , because he has acquired influence in his church and congregation ; for that very fact is a powerful argument for going abroad . For the same reason , no one can excuse himself because he fills a post of vast importance . He is the pastor of an influential church , a president of a college , a professor in a theological seminary , the editor of a religious paper of immense circulation , or the secretary of some society : his station is one of vast responsibility , and he imagines that he is therefore excused from becoming a missionary . But was not Jerusalem an important place ? more prominent , compared with other cities of that time , than any city in the United States ? And yet all the apostles , except one , were required not only to leave that city , but to go without the limits of Palestine . Was not Antioch as important as Boston or Philadelphia ? Yet Paul and Barnabas were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of a missionary a difficult , important , and responsible work ? The Holy Spirit thought so in apostolic times . When a man was needed to preach to Cornelius and his household , a man of no less ability and influence than Peter was chosen . When a man was called to go to Antioch , Barnabas was sent , a man of great piety and influence . And when two of the five preachers at Antioch were called to go to the heathen , the Holy Ghost did not choose Simeon , or Lucius , or Manaen , but said , " Separate me BARNABAS and SAUL ; " the men of the greatest ability , experience , piety and wisdom . Thus the Holy Spirit seemed to declare that the work of a missionary required greater talents , more mature wisdom , and deeper piety , than the work of a pastor in the largest and most influential churches . And is not this doctrine , while it accords with the instructions of the Holy Ghost and the practice of primitive times , also a dictate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetrate into the very midst of the enemy , and to grapple with the Anaks of the land , and keep those who are strong in a garrison at home ? Would you select indifferent statesmen to settle the affairs of revolutionary France , or to reduce to order the chaotic mass of the South American states ; and employ the able , the wise and talented , in governing a country already quiet and peaceful ? Did it require less wisdom to lay the foundation and form the constitution of our good government , than it requires to manage the state on principles already established ? Does it require less skill to draft the plan of a capitol , than to work at the building when the plan is mature ? Does it require less wisdom to govern a camp in a state of mutiny , than when in subjection and at peace ? Look , then , at the work of missions . Does it require less talent to deal with minds clouded by ignorance , perverted by superstition , and barred by arrogance , bigotry , and pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intelligent ? Does it require less wisdom to tear up the foundations of heathen society , and lay it anew on the principles of the Gospel  --  to change society morally , religiously , and socially , than to preserve in a good condition a people already intelligent , industrious , and Christian ? Surely , if talent is needed anywhere in the kingdom of Christ , it is in the missionary work . That minister , whose talents and piety make him so useful at home that he can not be spared , that is the minister who is needed abroad . The foreign field calls for no laborers who can be conveniently spared . Then , is the church of a pastor wealthy and influential ? It is the very church that needs to be aroused by his leaving it . Or is he connected with a literary , or theological institution ? Some thus connected are needed to go , to produce the best impression on the young men who are in training . The more important and influential then one 's place is , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arise and go . It is very common for men to excuse themselves from the work of missions , on the ground , that they are somewhat advanced in years . There is weight in this excuse . That person would exhibit the want of a proper balance of mind , who should urge all indiscriminately , whatever their age and however circumstanced in life , to go forth to the heathen . But still the excuse of age ought to be looked at cautiously . Age implies experience , authority , dignity , and wisdom  --  the very qualities most wanted in the difficult work of missions . The work of tearing up and laying anew the foundations of society , moral , religious , and social , is a task that ought by no means to be committed to the young and inexperienced . It is preposterous to commit altogether to novices in the ministry a work so new , so complicated , so beset with difficulties , on the right hand and on the left , and so momentous , too , in its responsibilities . Can Satan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none but raw troops are needed for the contest ? Can the broad and deep intrenchments of Paganism , Mohammedism , and Romanism be so easily taken , as not to need men of age , experience and skill , to direct the assault ? Can the snares in which the heathen are held ; which are laid with all the subtlety of the arch-fiend , be so easily divested of their specious character , and traced into their thousand windings , as not to require the wisdom and experience of age ? A minister has age : he has then one great qualification for the work . " Paul the aged " had none too much experience , dignity and wisdom , for the work of a missionary to heathen lands . But age , it is said , is a great barrier in acquiring a foreign language . There is force in this remark ; but let us be cautious , that we do not trust too much to it . A great amount of labor may be performed on heathen ground without a knowledge of the language . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , too , can be done through interpreters . All that David Brainerd accomplished was in this way . But how certain is it , that persons somewhat advanced can not acquire a foreign language ? This plea is not peculiar to those who have been some time in the ministry . No excuse is more frequently offered , and with more appearance of honesty , even in the college and the theological seminary . It is difficult to place the mark of age where this excuse may be properly offered , and where it may not . Shall we place it at thirty-five ? Some missionaries now in the field entered on the work at that age , and acquired the language without much difficulty . It may be remarked , too , that men of traffic abroad , from youth to gray hairs , usually learn so much of a foreign language as to answer their purpose . Let us beware , then , how much we depend on the excuse of age ; and be cautious , too , how far up the scale of years we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this : " I must remain at home to take care of my aged parents . " So said one to Christ : " Lord , I will follow thee , but suffer me first to go and bury my father . " Jesus answered , " Let the dead bury their dead , but go thou and preach the Gospel . " I leave to the reader to determine the precise meaning and force of this reply of our Saviour . This much it certainly means , that some may excuse themselves from preaching to take care of their parents , when the excuse is not valid . I will not say , that the excuse is not sufficient in some cases ; but I am inclined to think that such cases are rare . A parent must be very dependent upon a son , to be liable to such inconvenience and suffering from his absence , as can reasonably weigh in the balance against the claims of the hundreds of millions of dying heathen . But the excuse which seems to be the most valid , is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question , for I have a family of children . " This is indeed a tender point . God has given me some experience on this subject , and I know how to appreciate the excuse . But the Saviour says , " He that loveth son or daughter more than me , is not worthy of me . " This declaration means nothing , unless it requires us to make great sacrifices in regard to our children . So far as we can at present see , the world can not be converted without great self-denial on this point . Precisely what sacrifices are to be made in regard to children , is a question which is not , as yet , fully determined . But let us look at the excuse . If a minister may stay at home because he has children , may not the missionary who has children return home ? A pastor has one child , and can not go . Then may not the missionary who has one child , come back ? A pastor has six children , and can not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return ? The mere circumstance of being already abroad can not have much weight ; and the sacrifice of a voyage in such a question , and among a multitude of other weighty reasons , is scarcely worth being named . If children then are an excuse , let missionaries return . No , you say ; missionaries who have children must not return on that account . What then shall they do with their children ? Keep them , and train them up to be helpers in the work ? Let pastors then take their children into the field , and train them up for that purpose . You certainly have hearts too noble to impose a burden on the shoulders of others which you would not bear yourselves . Your children would have the advantage of the children of missionaries , having been thus far trained in a Christian land . As to future advantages of education , they will have the same with the children now abroad . You certainly can not complain of equality . But , you say , let missionaries send their children home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad . Ah , you say , pastors can not endure the thought ; it would be a shock to their parental feelings that they can not sustain . But , I ask , have missionaries no feelings ? have their hearts become hard , like blocks of wood and pieces of rock ? Does love to Christ , and compassion for the heathen , tend to make men and women obtuse in their feelings , so that a father or mother on heathen ground does not feel as intensely for the present and eternal welfare of a child , as a parent who has never gone to the heathen ? Ah ! had you seen what my eyes have witnessed , facts then should speak and I would be silent . Missionaries , indeed , are trained to cast their care upon God ; their feelings are chastened and disciplined , but at the same time deep and intense . To a thousand dangers , toils and hardships , they may be inured ; but when the separation of children is thought of , they show full well that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , you will not plead for exemption . You would not place upon others this burden , and pull away your own shoulders from it . You have souls too generous and benevolent to do that . You can not find it in your hearts to offer to the lips of others a cup more bitter than you would drink yourselves . You can choose guardians for your children far better than the missionaries can who are abroad , and your children shall have the same provision for their support and education as theirs have . We have glanced at some excuses . Many others there are in this excuse-making age . Be entreated to look at them with the command of Christ , a sinking world and a coming judgment , in your eye , and as far as they have weight and no farther be influenced by them . Where exemption can not honestly be pleaded , the command in all its force is binding . That some pastors of influence and talent should become missionaries , seems necessary ; for how otherwise can the means be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men who may offer themselves ? It is well known , that operations abroad have been and are still exceedingly crippled . It is well known , too , that quite a company of young men have at different times been waiting , for want of requisite funds to send them forth to the heathen . Now this is the state of things , not because there is not money enough in the hands of Christians  --  no one imagines that such is the fact  --  but because Christians , as a body , are not aroused to duty . What means shall be taken to arouse them ? I , for one , am inclined to think that there would be hope , if some influential and prominent pastors would enter the missionary work . In such a case , I should indeed have strong hope that the impulse , falling in with the spirit of primitive practice and the will of the Holy Ghost , would be such as to bring forth the funds needed to sustain the operations now begun , send forth waiting young men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite confident , that the measure would soon clear the seaboard of all who might be detained , and place their joyful feet on foreign soil . The great body of professed Christians are becoming luxurious in their modes of life . One can not go through the churches , after the absence of several years , without being forcibly impressed with this fact . They press forward after wealth , and profess to be accumulating it for Christ ; but in the end , spend it on themselves and on their children . Now what , under God , shall break up this covetousness , and luxurious manner of life ? What shall bring them back to the pure and unadulterated principles of the Gospel  --  to live , labor , and die for Christ , as did the primitive disciples ? Let pastors , like the apostles , go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature . There is reason to hope that the church members would likewise imbibe the right spirit , and act on right principles . Then we should hear no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heralds would be carrying out the news of salvation and sending back tidings of success . There is much philosophical and Bible truth in the proverb , " Like people like priest . " O , what responsibility rests on the ministers of Christ ! Again , if all settled ministers of talent and influence remain at home , how can such a number of missionaries be secured as seem needed for the world 's conversion ? If many of those already in the sacred office do not go , it is absolutely certain , that the present generation of heathen must die without the Gospel . The angel of death continues hovering over the dying nations , mowing down his twenty millions a year ; and before ministers can be raised up from among the youth and children , will be drawing a stroke at the last man of all that are now heathen . The present generation of ministers must preach the Gospel to the present generation of mankind . It will be the duty of the next generation of ministers to preach to the inhabitants that shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the young alone , is making no provision for the present generation of heathen . If the heathen are to be left till missionaries can be trained up , they are to be left  --  the soul shudders at the thought  --  till they shall be in hell ! By making this postponement , the churches , in effect , though certainly without intending it , sign the death warrant of a great portion of the present six hundred millions of perishing heathen ; relinquish all effort for this vast multitude , and only dream of saving the next generation  --  of whom it would be a mercy never to be born , unless there shall be more hope of their salvation than can be seen at present  --  dream , I say , of saving the next generation ; for to think much of raising up the young to be missionaries , without going ourselves , is little better than dreaming . To induce young men , to any great extent , to become missionaries , when their fathers and elder brethren do not , is hopeless . Precept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result can take place . How can you so blindfold the young , stop their ears , and wall them off from surrounding influences , as to expect such a result ? If their eyes are left open , what do they see ? They see their fathers and elder brethren settled at home , and some of them in quiet , comfort and honor . If their ears are left open , what do they hear ? They hear various excuses for remaining at home , and among others , the specious idea of training up children to be missionaries . And what will they do ? They will dream of training your grandchildren for missions , and your grandchildren dream of training the next generation , and so on , as the sixty generations past have done , from the time of the Saviour down . But the fire of God 's Spirit shall burn up this chaff . The world shall not be cheated out of its millenium . The judgment trumpet shall not sound before the arrival of the latter day glory . To become a missionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against wind and tide ; so that those who find their way to the heathen , compared with the number who ought to go , are very few indeed . To urge a large number into the field is hopeless . Bonaparte might as well have urged his soldiers over the Alps without leading them . We can not expect the nature of things to change , and precept to become more powerful than example . A portion of the more talented of the settled ministry must lead the way . Then there shall be found a resuscitating principle ; our eyes shall beam with joy , and we shall fondly cherish a rational hope of the world 's renovation . Again , many pastors should become missionaries , for all things await their personal enlistment in the service . God , in his providence , is causing a state of preparation in the world which calls for some mighty movement on the part of the church . A door is opened into almost every nation on the earth , and ships are ready to carry us to almost every port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the elements are ready for action , and need only to be brought to bear on the glorious cause of the world 's conversion . To effect this , there must be a high stand of prayerful enterprise on the part of the present generation of ministers . The Lord has brought us to the ministry for such a time as this ; and surely my brethren will not prove themselves unworthy of so vast a responsibility , but come up joyfully to the work , and reap the harvest of the world . And here let me say , that the millions of souls already lost are immense ; and it would be awfully presumptuous in Christians to neglect the millions and hundreds of millions of the present generation . Century after century has rolled along , ingulfing generation after generation , till one would think that Satan himself would be satisfied with the enormous havoc . Eighteen centuries have passed away , and sixty generations , five hundred millions each  --  thirty billions of immortal souls left to perish since Christ gave command to evangelize them . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty neglect , suffer the present generation , six hundred millions more , to be added ? O , let the billions of souls already lost suffice . O , let us arise , and go and preach the Gospel to the nations , that the generations that remain between this and the judgment may be saved . Let me suggest , too , that nothing would so readily produce union among ministers at home , as to divert all their powers of body and mind into some all-absorbing and self-denying enterprise . Now , what angel of heaven has not wept over the contentions and jealousies that cloud the glory of the American churches . How has the heart of Jesus bled over the dissensions and strife of his own ministers ! And is there no remedy ? Let pastors become so engrossed in fulfilling their commission as to obey its literal import , and arise and go ; and I mistake much , if the movement would not make a material impression on their contentions and jealousies . They would feel that they were doing a great work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find neither time nor inclination . It would be difficult to state , in a foreign tongue , their metaphysical distinctions , so as to make a difference . Higher and nobler objects would engross the soul . Be entreated to try this course . Then the recording angel shall not be compelled , with aching heart and streaming eyes , to inscribe " ICHABOD " on our American Zion ; but , with willing soul and ready hands , shall write in fairer lines , " BEAUTIFUL FOR SITUATION , THE JOY OF THE WHOLE EARTH . " * * * * * But it is often said , " I never felt it to be my duty to go to the heathen : I never had any such impression . " No such impression ! Did then the command of our ascended Lord , his last command , delivered under the most solemn circumstances , make no impression upon you ? Did the temporal and eternal miseries of six hundred millions of your fellow men make no impression upon you ? Did their groans and sighs , which came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peal after peal , make no impression upon you ? And could you remain at home with comfort and peace of mind , with the weeping and wailing of millions of dying souls in your ears , backed up with the command of Christ to go and seek their salvation ? While Jesus plead , " Lo , I died for them , go , preach my Gospel to them , that they may live ; " could you remain unimpressed and unmoved ? And have all these considerations , and a hundred more , been urged upon you for years , and yet failed to make an impression ? Alas ! of what is your heart made , that it does not feel ? Look for no supernatural impression . Missionaries have none . There is no need of any . He that can live and not be impressed , may well tremble for his own salvation . It appears that you are easily impressed that it is your duty to remain at home . The motives , I fear , that come before your mind are well suited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when country , home , friends , the endearments of society , and the like considerations crowd upon your mind . O , dear brethren , let us be entirely honest , as we expect soon to meet the Saviour and the world of perishing souls for whom he died . Another similar excuse is often made : " Did I possess the requisite attainments in holiness , I should delight to go abroad . But as the case is , I can not become a missionary : I have not piety enough . " Not piety enough ! Then be entreated to become more pious without delay . As you value the souls of dying men , defer not to become more holy . Through your want of piety the heathen may be left to perish . But what is holiness ? Is it not obedience to the commands of Christ ? Obey , then , his last command : that will be becoming more holy . Go forth to the heathen from love to Christ : that will be becoming more pious . " NOT PIETY ENOUGH ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , when you shall stand before him to render account for the blood of the heathen ? And when you shall see multitudes of the heathen sinking into hell , whom , under the blessing of the Spirit , you might have saved ; and hear their weeping , wailing , and gnashing of teeth ; will it ease your mind , and quiet your conscience , that you had not piety enough to go and make known to them the way of life ? This is a solemn subject . Let us try , dear brethren , to look at it as we ought . Allied to this excuse is the following : " I have never thought myself qualified for the work of missions . It is a work which in my view requires rare endowments . Did I possess the requisite qualifications , I should delight to engage in so glorious a work . " To this excuse I would say , There is room in the wide field of missions for every grade and variety of talent . Such is the universal testimony of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so various and vast a work as that of converting all nations , many of whom need to be instructed in the simplest arts of civilized life , and in the very alphabet of knowledge . But the excuse you render is entirely at variance with the facts in the case . If the work of missions be deemed worthy of the greatest talents , why is it that a large number do not go forth from among the more prominent and influential in the sacred office ? The plea of disqualification is a popular one . There is in it much appearance of humility and self-depreciation . But facts testify , that many who plead their want of talent do not hesitate , if invited , to take upon them the care of a college , or of a large and opulent church . If the conduct of men is to be regarded as a just interpreter of their sentiments , then the great body of the Christian ministry , instead of regarding themselves unfit for the work of missions , consider themselves too well qualified to enter it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for missions ; while those of superior minds and brilliant talents must be reserved for important stations at home . It is said again , " All can not go abroad . " I reply , Do not use the word " all " till there shall be some need of it . There is no danger yet that the home company will be comparatively too small . There is another excuse which is worthy of more notice . One says , " My own country claims my first attention . It presents a field of vast extent , and demands a vast amount of labor . Its schools , colleges and seminaries , must be sustained . Its religious periodicals must be edited . The churches must be watched over , and brought up to a higher standard of piety . Revivals must be promoted . But passing by these claims for labor , look at the wide-spreading desolations of the West , where ignorance , infidelity , and Romanism prevail , and threaten , at no very future day , to be the overthrow of our government  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our exertions must be put forth to save our country ; for the progress of light and knowledge throughout the world depends on its existence . The overthrow of our government would put back the dial of the moral world ten centuries . Our own nation lost , and what would become of the heathen ? when would the millenium arrive ? Our present attention must be directed to the salvation of our own country , and our missionary exertions must be concentrated on the West . " The excuse does not stop here ; but a citizen from Great Britain would say , " I too must speak in behalf of my country  --  a country whose possessions encircle the globe . The existence and religious prosperity of a nation whose commerce is so great , and whose dominions embrace a large portion of the heathen world , can not but be intimately connected with the universal prevalence of light and peace . It is of the first importance , that the heart of such a nation should beat with a healthy pulse ; that much effort should be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities and churches at home . But more than this , look at the vast body of laboring men in England and Ireland , who are living in ignorance and in sin . They call loudly for teachers and for preachers of the Gospel , and ought to receive , for the present at least , all we can educate and all we can support . " In reply to this excuse I would first say , Let us look a moment at the conclusion to which we are reduced . " The United States can not furnish missionaries , for the present at least ; far less can Great Britain ; and still less the Continent of Europe . " The inevitable conclusion is , that the present generation of heathen must be left to perish . Six hundred millions of our race must be deliberately relinquished to endure the agonies of eternal death . But what is the plea that so readily leaves the millions of ignorant heathen to hopelessness and despair ? " We must go to the West . " " We must direct our efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I say , be consistent , and actually do what you profess . As yet , how many of the learned , the eloquent and influential of the ministry , have become missionaries at the West ? Some have gone to the West , to be presidents of colleges there ; but how many have gone to engage in the more appropriate duties of the missionary ? And in Great Britain , how many have left their professorships in the universities , and their wealthy churches , to labor as missionaries among the ignorant class of society in England and Ireland ? O ! the West , and the ignorant class in England and Ireland , would lift up their hearts to God in gratitude if you would go forth to the heathen : for the reflex influence of such a course would scatter among them the means of grace as thick as the stars of heaven , and as bright as the sun in his glory . I could almost assert , from personal observation , that every missionary to the heathen sends ten to the West . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stop short of the West . Besides , have you forgotten the nature of benevolence ? If you wish to strengthen it , to increase it and expand it , so as to be the means of saving the United States , and of saving Great Britain , then bring it into exercise . Let the church impart liberally of what she has , both of men and money . She will have the more left , paradoxical as the assertion may at first seem . Let the principle of benevolence be aroused in the churches , and it is literally inexhaustible in its resources , both of money and of men ; for the more it exhausts the more it still possesses . This is not mere missionary philosophy , but Bible doctrine ; and so plainly inculcated , that he that doubts it is a novice in the Scriptures , and a babe in the school of Christ . There is a backwardness , an apathy and deadness in the ministry , and in the churches ; and it is THEREFORE that infidelity and Romanism prevail at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland remain in wretchedness . The great thing needed is that the spirit of benevolence , the spirit of Christ , or in other words true religion , be aroused in the churches . And in no way can you so effectually do it as by giving yourself to the missionary work . God 's wisdom is very much at variance with the cold , calculating , short-sighted and sin-blinded wisdom of man . Let us follow heavenly wisdom , as laid down in the Bible : " GIVE , " " GO , " and thereby save ourselves , our country , and the world . That nation that obeys God shall prosper . Let us try the Bible philosophy of saving the United States and Great Britain , BY OBEYING GOD  --  by going forth and teaching all nations . CHAPTER VII . IMPORT OF THE GREAT COMMISSION . The Founder of the church was a missionary . The church is a missionary band , professedly aiming to carry out the design of its Founder , in the wide field of the WORLD . The commission to the apostles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This commission , it is to be feared , is losing much of its force from misinterpretation . That a construction somewhat incorrect is placed by some ministers on the commission which they hold , seems to be evident ; for how otherwise should an impression obtain , that there is something peculiar about the office of the missionary  --  that his commission is quite different from that of other ministers of Christ . Let the commission of both the minister at home and missionary abroad be exhibited and read . The terms , word for word , are the same . It is unhappy , extremely so , that a peculiarity is thrown about the word missionary , since the New Testament authorizes no such distinction . Both ministers at home and those abroad claim to be successors of the apostles or first missionaries , whose letter of instructions , short but explicit , reads thus : " Go ye into all the world , and preach the Gospel to every creature . " This is the commission of every ambassador , and no one , at home or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he continues to act in accordance with its import . The Saviour is all-wise , and knew precisely what commission to give . He carefully chose every word in which it is expressed . The apostles showed by their conduct how they understood it  --  that they knew what was meant by " all the world " and " every creature . " Now , I ask , how can such a construction be placed on these obvious phrases , as to make it consistent for about eleven thousand eight hundred ministers out of twelve thousand to stay in the United States , and about the same proportion in Great Britain ? The apostles showed by their conduct what they understood by the word " Go . " By what reasoning , I ask , has it been made to mean , in fifty-nine cases out of sixty , send , contribute , and educate young men ? If an inhabitant of another planet should visit this earth , and see ministers clustered together in a few favored spots , could you make him believe that they hold in their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thought dutiful , in military officers , to treat the orders of their commander-in-chief as we do the command of our Master ; or in mercantile agents , to interpret thus loosely the instructions of their employers ? The perversion , however , has become so familiar to us , that we are insensible of it ; and the fact may be numbered among other wonders of a like kind , which the experience of a few past years has exhibited . A few years since , good men were in the use of intoxicating drinks without dreaming it a sin ; and so now we may be shaping our course very wide from the command of our Saviour , and yet think not of the guilt we incur . The misconstruction has become so universal , and so firmly established  --  the true and obvious interpretation buried so deep in the rubbish of things gone by  --  that all books written on ministerial duty , which I have seen , take it for granted that the persons addressed , for the most part at least , are to preach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gospel . And may I not inquire  --  and I would do it with due deference and respect  --  Do not lectures on pastoral theology in the schools of the prophets take it too much for granted , that the hearers are to labor in Christian lands ? Is not the business of going into all the world , and preaching the Gospel to every creature , regarded , practically at least , as an exception , for which there need be no provision in books or lectures ? If Paul were to write or lecture on pastoral theology , would he not give more prominence to the duties that might devolve upon his students in foreign lands ? Would he not , indeed , make the work of missions stand forth as the work , and not as an exception or a peculiarity ? Few men , in these last days , can quiet their consciences , and yet live in entire neglect of the heathen . Almost all professed Christians feel that they must have some interest in the great enterprise . To begin to act just as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ import , as the apostles understood it , would be a hard and self-denying service . What then shall they do ? Will they operate by proxy ? This is the charming suggestion , by which often conscience is lulled to sleep and the heathen are left to perish . It is true that many , and perhaps most , must aid in the work by proxy  --  by training up others , by sending them forth , by encouraging them , and by furnishing the necessary means . But the error is , that all , with the exception of perhaps one minister out of sixty , and one layman out of three thousand , are inclined so to act . It is wonderful with what electrical rapidity the soothing suggestion has spread abroad . It is so insidious and speciously good , that it has found its way , like an angel of light , to the best hearts and holiest places . Indeed , it is a point very difficult to be determined ; and many judge no doubt with perfect correctness , when they decide to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush and universal resort . To be sensible that there is such a rush , begin and enumerate . Directors and officers of various societies  --  and they are not few  --  of theological seminaries too , and of colleges , think they are employed in furnishing the requisite men , the requisite means , and the requisite instrumentalities , and so are preaching to the heathen by proxy . Among ministers , the talented and eloquent , the learned and the influential , think they must labor in the important field at home ; keep the churches in a state to operate upon the world , and so preach to the heathen by proxy . Ministers generally , about eleven thousand eight hundred out of twelve thousand , are zealous for training up young men , and think in that way of preaching to the heathen by proxy . Pious men of wealth , and those who are in circumstances to acquire wealth , or imagine that they have a talent to acquire it , profess to be accumulating the necessary means , and to be thus preaching to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are fond of the notion of raising up children to be missionaries , and of thus preaching by proxy . Proxy is the universal resort . Now some proxy effort , and much indeed , is proper and indispensable ; but must it not strike every mind , that such a universal and indiscriminate resort to it is utterly unreasonable ? How often do we hear the exhortation , " Let mothers consecrate their children to the missionary work in their earliest infancy . Let them be taught , as they grow up , that to labor among the heathen is the most glorious work on earth . Let teachers in Sabbath-schools impart such instructions , and ministers in their pulpits . Let ministers and elders search out young men , urge them to engage in the work of missions , and let the churches educate them for that end , and pray for them that their zeal fail not . Let no pains be spared and no efforts be wanting , to raise up and send forth a large body of young men to labor for the heathen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflecting mind can see that it must be insufficient , if not hopeless . To succeed thus , as I have already said , precept must become more powerful than example . Commit the work of converting the world to your children , and they will commit it to your grandchildren . Try instruction in the nursery , try instruction in the Sabbath-school , try instruction from the pulpit : it will fall powerless as a ray of moonlight on a lake of ice , while contradicted by the example of mothers , of Sabbath-school teachers , and of ministers . Urge young men into the missionary field without going yourselves ? A general might as well urge his army over the Alps without leading them . Consecrate them to the work ? Would it not be an unholy consecration  --  a consecration at the hands of those who were not themselves consecrated ? The command does not say , send , but " Go . " Let us then go , and urge others to come . We shall find this mode of persuasion the most effectual . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and betake ourselves in person to those kinds of labor that are more self-denying , and to those posts that are likely to be deserted . This is the only principle of action that will secure success in any enterprise within the range of human efforts . Suppose the opposite principle is acted upon  --  that every one seeks for himself the most easy and pleasant work , and the most delightful and honorable station , and leaves for others the most obscure , the most self-denying , and the most perilous . Discover such a spirit in any enterprise , secular or religious , and it requires not the gift of prophecy to predict a failure . Practical and business men understand full well the truth and force of this remark . The true method is this : if there is a work that is likely to be neglected on account of its obscurity or self-denial , let every one , first of all , see that that service is attended to . And if there is a post likely to be left deserted on account of its hardships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of all , that that post is occupied . Let there be an emulation among all to do the drudgery of the service , and to man the Thermopylae of danger . Then you shall read in the vigor and nerve of the action the certainty of success . In this way Bonaparte conquered Europe . If a portion of his army was likely to fall back , there the general pressed forward in person , inspiring courage and firmness . If all others shrunk from the deadly breach , thither he rushed , at once , with the flower of his army . This principle of action is not more indispensable in the conquests of war , than in the great enterprise of the world 's conversion . And how truly glorious , how sublime by contrast , to exhibit this principle of action , not in destroying mankind , but in laboring for their salvation ! Let all Christians be filled with this spirit , let every redeemed sinner adopt in practice this rule of action , to do the most self-denying , the most difficult and perilous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proxy , then there would be a sight of moral sublimity that earth has not seen  --  all the elements in action that are needed , under God , to usher in the millenial day . O , if to angels were committed the instrumentality of the world 's conversion , where would Gabriel speed his way if not to the post of peril , and to the post of self-denying and toilsome drudgery ? I mistake his character much , if he would not betake himself at once to the most arduous service . O , how he would delight to come down and labor with the lowest being on New Holland or New Guinea , and be the instrument of raising him up to the throne of Jesus ! But to angels is not committed the stewardship of propagating that precious Gospel , which God has ordained for the world 's renovation . The infinite treasure is placed in our hands , the immense responsibility is thrown upon us . O , let us prove ourselves worthy of such a trust , and not become traitorous to the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proxy . But , in truth , how far do we act on the principle named , that of performing in person the most arduous service , and of leaving the most pleasant work for others ? Look over the desolate and secluded parts of the United States ; look over the heathen world , and make out an answer . Let facts speak . Is a residence in Arkansas preferred to a residence in New-York , or a voyage to New Guinea before one to Europe ? Our blessed Saviour and his apostles did not feel inclined to shrink from the more self-denying service , and to shift it upon others . If they had felt so , then we should have continued in a state of darkness , and have known full well the import of present wretchedness and eternal woe . Let us suppose , for a moment , that the apostles had made the discovery of obeying by proxy the Saviour 's last command . But I hesitate to make such a supposition , lest the force of such an immense contrast should make it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . In other words , our efforts to convert the world become so clumsy , slow and inefficient , from a lack of the right spirit and enough of it , in ministers and in the churches , that to impute the same kind and degree of effort to the apostles and primitive Christians , might excite a smile , rather than a sigh ; and be deemed an attempt to ridicule what is at present done , rather than an earnest , serious , and solemn expostulation . Such a result I should deplore . But if my readers will believe me to be aiming simply , with weeping eyes and an aching heart , to illustrate with force my own defects and their short-comings in duty , by detecting and tracing out a wrong principle of action , I will venture cautiously to make the supposition . The words of the last command have fallen from the lips of the ascended Saviour , and the apostles assemble to deliberate how they shall carry them into execution . In the first place , Peter delivers an address . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wing his way to foreign lands . After the discourse , they form themselves into a society . Arrangements being made , and the machinery being complete , they send forth John to solicit funds . He finds the disciples willing to contribute on an average , after much urging , about twenty-four cents each . A pittance of money is obtained , and then they search for a man . They thought Peter would be ready to go , from the speech he delivered , but he wishes to be excused : he has a family to support . They then fall upon various plans : some think of training up young men to go forth , and others exhort parents to infuse a missionary spirit into their children . At length , however , it is found that one of the twelve begins to feel that he has a call to go  --  but this would be at the rate of one thousand from the twelve thousand ministers in the United States . This one man is sent forth to " go into all the world , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the apostles sustain the various offices of the society , and have charge of important posts in Jerusalem , and in the cities and villages round about . They meet yearly , to deliberate upon the missionary enterprise . Some feel much , and humbly pray , and some say eloquent things about the glorious cause , and tell how they have found a fulcrum , where to place the lever of Archimides to elevate the world . Now I ask most solemnly , and in a spirit of grief and humiliation , how such a course of conduct would have appeared in the apostles ? Would it have evinced a spirit of obedience ? Believe me , in early times , a readiness to obey supplied a great deal of machinery . Bring back into the ministers of the present day the spirit of the apostles , and into the churches the spirit of the early disciples , and operations at once would be more simple and more efficient . A backwardness in duty  --  a disposition , if we do anything for the heathen , to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels so ponderous and encumbered . " The letter killeth , but the Spirit giveth life . " Give us the spirit , and annihilate the notion of operating so much by proxy , and we shall soon see a multitude of angels flying in the midst of heaven , having the everlasting Gospel to preach to the nations . There is no cheap or easy way of converting the world . It is to be feared that some fall into the contrary notion , because they do not wish to believe that all they possess is needed in the work of the Lord , and that there is absolute necessity that they themselves go to the heathen . It is to be feared , that it is for this reason that so many are ready to imagine that the work is to be done by a few men , and a small amount of means . It would seem they expect to form lines of these few men , and encircle the globe in various directions ; to place them on prominent points , like light-houses , and leave each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide circumference . They seem to imagine that nations can be elevated from a degradation many ages deep , and thoroughly transformed , religiously , morally , mentally and socially , by the influence of a few missionaries , scattered here and there on some high eminences of the earth : that a single missionary , under a withering atmosphere , is to be preacher , physician , teacher , lawyer , mechanic , and everything that is necessary in raising a whole community from the inconceivable degradation of heathenism , up to the elevation of an industrious , intelligent , and Christian people . Neither are the expectations formed by many , of mission seminaries , less visionary . A school , with two or three teachers , limited accommodations and small funds , with all its school-books to make , and the whole literature to form , is expected to accomplish all the work of the academy , college , and theological seminary , and speedily to transform untutored savages into able preachers of the Gospel . And it is expected , by not a few , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , in a house of poor accommodations , with unfaithful domestics , or none at all ; that notwithstanding , she will not only attend to the arduous duties of the household and educate her own children , but teach a school among the people , and superintend the female portion of the congregation  --  a task which a minister 's wife in a Christian land , and under a bracing air , does not often attempt . Now , would it be really a benefit to the church thus to flatter her indolence and her avarice , and convert the heathen with a fraction of wealth and a handful of men ? Be assured , God loves the church too well thus to pamper a luxurious and self-indulgent spirit : he will allow no cheap and easy way of accomplishing the work . The object is worth more : worthy not only of the combined wealth of Christendom , but worthy also of the energies , the toil , and the blood if necessary , of the greatest and holiest men . It will not be in consistence with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be achieved , till the treasures of the church shall be literally emptied in the contest , and the precious blood of thousands and tens of thousands of her ablest and best men poured out on the field . The work has already cost the blood of God 's only Son ; and the prosecution and finishing of it shall be through toil , self-denial , entire devotement , and obedience even unto death . Some rules that may be of use in agitating the question of becoming missionaries. 1 . Guard against an excuse-making spirit . This is an age of excuses . There is no need of seeking for them ; they are already at hand , and of every variety , size and shape . They are kept ready for every occasion . If one will not suit , another may be tried . Be admonished then , that a disposition to be excused is not much different from a disposition to disobey . 2 . Guard against antinomianism on the subject of missions . There is a great tendency in these days to say and do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhilarating gas , is pleasant to many ; but the sober and humble business of engaging in the work is not so welcome . A disposition to say much and do little is a feature of the most alarming kind . It shows an obtuseness of conscience . 3 . Remember that Divine direction is better than human wisdom . We are very much inclined to argue the question , " Where can I do the most good ? " Be assured we can do the most good by obeying the Saviour : by carrying out the spirit of his last command . Let us keep close to that command : it is safer than to determine by our own dark and biased reasoning , and by our very limited foresight , where we can be the most useful . 4 . The nearer you live to Jesus , the more hope will there be of your coming to a right decision . There is a process of conviction and conversion before a man becomes a missionary  --  a serious conflict . Nothing but nearness to the Saviour will prepare a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely on the side of truth and duty . 5 . If , after examining thoroughly and prayerfully the question of becoming a missionary , the mind waver between conflicting reasons , it will be safest to lean to the side of the greatest self-denial. 6 . In selecting the place of the greatest usefulness in the wide field of the world , the best rule is , to fly to the post most likely to be deserted . 7 . A kindred principle is , to do in person the more difficult and unpleasant work , and to commit the more easy and delightful to proxy . 8 . Remember the time is short . A few days more , and we shall meet our Saviour in the presence of a world of souls . 9 . Keep in mind the conduct of our blessed Saviour , and be imbued with his spirit . Feel as he felt , and do as he did , when he beheld us in misery and in sin . CHAPTER VIII . TRIALS TO BE MET . Common trials need not be named : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most severe . Take then first , the trial of leaving friends . The Saviour says , " He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me , and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me . " The plain meaning is , to be Christians , our love to Christ must be supreme . Now , if it is supreme , it will show itself to be so in our conduct . There is full room , even at the present day , for a practical test of this condition of discipleship . Not only is the spirit of this passage required , but in many cases , a literal compliance with the identical things named in it . This saying of our Saviour has been too much forgotten . Like some other important sayings of our Lord , it has been virtually expunged . It has been regarded as applying only to apostolic times  --  to times of persecution . This is a wide mistake . If all nations are to be enlightened by the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the present time , and in all time to come , of a love to Christ superior to the love which we owe to father , mother , son or daughter . And this love is not spoken of as a high attainment in piety , but as an indispensable condition of discipleship . The missionary enterprise presents many instances of stern necessity to test and exhibit this principle . The occasion most familiar to the general reader , and the one best appreciated by him , is the time when missionaries go forth to the heathen . They are compelled to break away from almost every tie . The strength of attachment to all that is dear on earth , is a feeling that may be experienced , and can be imagined too , in part , but can never be described . There are a thousand ties , and tender ties too , that must be sundered . The loved scenes of childhood and youth , and scenes of sacred peace and pleasure that cluster about the sanctuary , the conference-room and the praying circle , must all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections , must receive a last adieu and a lingering look . But O how keen the sensation when the last sigh , the last tear , and the last embrace is to be exchanged with father and mother , brother and sister  --  when all the touching associations of kindred and home are for once revived to be dismissed forever ! Imagine not that the sensibilities of missionaries are less exquisite than those of other persons . The pangs they endure are indeed alleviated by soothing considerations drawn from the Gospel ; but they are , notwithstanding , deep  --  deeper than the looker-on may at first suppose . There may be some persons  --  I have heard of such  --  who misrepresent the feelings and motives of missionaries in leaving their friends ; who impute to them cold hearts and a bluntness of sensibility ; who say that they are wanting in filial devotion , and can therefore leave aged parents to droop and die : that they have a small share of fraternal affection , and that it is therefore they can break away from the embrace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tears . All these remarks are sometimes made , and perhaps oftener secretly indulged , than openly expressed . It is often that the missionary is not allowed to take his leave merely with a bleeding heart and a soul gushing with emotion , but is compelled to endure a keener anguish : that of knowing that the course he is taking , agonizing as it is , is imputed by some to a want of sensibility ; to a destitution of the finer , tenderer , and more delicate feelings , that adorn society , and that make families lovely and happy . Here then are trials : such , however , as he must cheerfully meet for Christ 's sake . But the separation from home , with its numerous and nameless endearments , and at the risk of misrepresentation , is but the first lesson of obedience . That person whose love to Christ is so weak as to fail here on the threshold , would give but poor evidence of being prepared for similar and severer trials in prospect . The main occasion for exemplifying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alluded , is on heathen ground , when stern necessity calls upon parents to make the best disposition in their power in regard to their own children . This is an occasion not so well understood by the Christian community as the one I have noticed . The difficulties in the way of properly training children on heathen ground are not clearly seen ; neither are all the objections appreciated which attend the usual alternative , that of sending them to a Christian land . These are the occasions of trial , compared with which all other sufferings of the missionary are scarcely worthy of being named . They are trials , however , that must be met , not evaded ; for the Saviour says , " He that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me . " They must be cheerfully met , and counted " all joy , " or we can not claim the spirit of the first disciples . There are those , I know , who would relieve this subject at once by proposing the celibacy of missionaries ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering , till they shall know a little more " what they say , and whereof they affirm . " Celibacy for ministers at home would be a much more proper and expedient arrangement , than for missionaries in most foreign fields . And one would think that the experience of the church , from the days of the apostles till now , had taught us enough to silence at once any such proposition , and to place it forever at rest . Were it in place for me , I could give reasons here to the heart 's content : but I deem it more prudent to forbear . The DIFFICULTIES in the way of training children on heathen ground , can not all be named ; and fewer still can be justly appreciated by those who have never made the attempt . What I shall say will apply particularly to barbarous and degraded nations , such as the Sandwich Islanders once were ; for it is to such nations that the missionary 's eye should be specially directed . I shall mention first , the difficulty of keeping children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have eyes , and among the heathen what do they see ? I need only refer you to the knowledge you already possess of the naked condition , vile habits , and gross vices of a barbarous people . There is much in heathen society which can not be described , but which children must more or less witness . The state of things , in this respect , is very much improved at the Sandwich Islands ; but I refer to that condition in which they once were  --  to that condition in which all barbarous nations are , without the light of the Gospel . Imagine then to yourself this feature of heathen society , and then repeat the inquiry , What do children see ? Again , children have ears , and they can not be so effectually closed as to be kept from learning in some measure the language of the heathen . And if they become acquainted with the language of the heathen , what do they hear day after day ? In many a pagan country they are liable to hear disputes , contentions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are liable to hear in familiar , unblushing and open conversation , words and phrases which are not so much as to be named . The heathen have no forbidden words in their language . Every term is liable to be brought into public and frequent use without the least sense of impropriety . On account of this pernicious example and vile conversation , many missionaries , where it is practicable , make walls about their houses , and endeavor by strict inclosures to prevent their children from having intercourse with the natives . This can be done in some places , and to some degree , while children are young ; but when they are somewhat grown up , it is preposterous to think of keeping them within inclosures . And as soon as they are out of their inclosures , there are a thousand pitfalls ready for their feet , on the right hand and on the left . How much solicitude was felt by Abraham and Isaac for their children , on account of the heathen population which surrounded them . This pernicious influence , better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is one of the reasons which lead missionaries to undergo the agony of separation , and to send their children to a Christian land . This evil at the Sandwich Islands is much diminished , but not so much so as may at first glance be supposed from the progress in Christianity which has been made , and from the powerful revivals which have here been experienced . Again it must be remarked , that children trained up on heathen shores are in danger of contracting habits of indolence . The heathen , as a general remark , exert themselves no oftener and no longer than they feel the pressure of present want . They are far from being industrious , and farther still from anything like enterprise . Those nations that are partly civilized exhibit more or less industry , and are acquainted with some of the arts ; but barbarous nations are acquainted with none of the improvements that elevate society , and exhibit a state of lounging indolence and torpid inactivity . If there be noise , it is not the rattle and whirl of business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giddy mirth , boisterous and unmeaning laughter , or fierce and angry contention . If there be stillness , it is not the peace and quiet of well-ordered society , but the gloomy and deathlike stillness of indolence , sensuality , and beastly degradation . Now , who does not know that children are likely to be much influenced by the aspect and character of the society by which they are surrounded ? Who does not know that they are likely to imbibe the spirit of the nation in which they live , whether on the one hand it be that of industry and enterprise , or on the other , that of sensual ease and torpid indolence ? Let a youth be trained up in a village of intelligence , active industry and stirring enterprise ; let his ears be filled with the noise of business from morning till night ; let him travel in stages , in steamboats and on railroads , and it will be next to impossible for him to be indolent and sluggish . But in heathen society , the whole atmosphere is entirely different ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls on the senses with a benumbing and deadening influence . But more than this , missionaries have no business in which to employ their children ; and if it were possible to devise business in which to employ them , there is no one to superintend their labor . Missionaries have no time for the purpose , and no other persons , among most pagan nations , can be found who are trusty and competent . This is a stubborn fact , and stands in the way as a very great obstacle . Neither , in most cases , can the children of missionaries be kept industrious in the acquisition of knowledge . Their fathers and mothers can not devote so much of their time to their children , as to keep their minds industriously employed in the pursuit of knowledge ; and as to schools , most missions are not thus favored . Missionaries then , if they keep their children on heathen ground , run the risk of seeing them grow up in habits of inactivity and indolence . This , if a risk , is a fearful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful when they themselves shall be dead . But indolence and usefulness are the opposites of each other ; whereas indolence and vice are closely allied . To prevent then this deadly evil , of having their children grow up in indolent habits , is one of the strong reasons why missionaries resort to the heart-rending alternative of parting with their children , with but little probability of seeing them again this side the grave . Again , as the state of things now is , the children of missionaries , if kept on heathen ground , can possess but very limited advantages for mental improvement . Their mothers can not be depended upon to instruct them much in literature and the sciences . Under the influence of a withering atmosphere , often sick , with no help in many countries in their domestic affairs but untrusty domestics , and often with none at all , and obliged to attend to many calls from the people , or run the risk of giving offence , how can they be expected to find much time and strength for disciplining the minds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They may succeed in giving them an acquaintance with the branches of common education , but to carry them into the higher branches is , as a general remark , entirely out of the question . Such a task is by no means expected of a minister 's wife at home , much less can it be expected of the wife of a missionary . Neither can their fathers be depended upon to give a thorough education . Ministers at home would find it a great encroachment upon their time to spend several hours each day in instructing their own children ; but they have vastly more leisure to do so than the foreign missionary . To instruct a class of three or four requires the same apparatus , the same preparation in the teacher , and the same number of hours each day , as would be required for a class of thirty or forty . But should a missionary devote such an amount of time and means to his own family , it must be to the neglect of other labor . The most economical , and the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together a sufficient number of missionaries ' children to form a school , and devote a competent number of teachers entirely to that work . But even where such schools can be enjoyed , they must be attended with many risks and privations , and be only preparatory in their nature . Those scholars , who may need a thorough education , must be still under the necessity of visiting a Christian land . It is too of great , and perhaps indispensable importance , that youth who are trained for active life should see the industry , enterprise , and intelligence of a Christian land , and so far , at least , partake of its character and imbibe its spirit . Missionaries , then , must either suffer their children to grow up with a very limited education , or submit to the alternative sooner or later of sending them to a Christian land . But missionaries see the want of laborers in the great field of the world , and ardently desire that their children may be qualified to take part in the work . They choose therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , that there may exist a reasonable prospect that their children , at some future day , may be eminently useful in the vineyard of the Lord . One other difficulty I must name , and that is , that missionaries ' children , if kept on heathen ground , will have no prospect of suitable employment when old enough to settle in life . They will have no trades . To be merchants they will not have means . They will not be acquainted with agriculture , and in many countries will not be able to obtain land to cultivate . Some , who are fit for the work , may become preachers and teachers , but will not command the influence that they would if they were educated in a Christian land . Thus the prospect of suitable employment is very dark , and is a fact in the case of much weight . These reasons and others that might be named , possess in the minds of missionaries immense force  --  force enough , in many instances , to induce them to tear from their embrace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a wide ocean to the care of friends , and often to the care of strangers . They do not lead all parents to this result ; for on the other hand , there are strong , very strong objections to such a course . The trial in either case is great ; but it is one that must be met , not evaded . It is wise to count the cost , but it is treason to be faint-hearted ; for the trial , after all , can not weigh much in the balance against the eternal interests of the dying heathen . HOW MUCH WORSE IS THE CONDITION OF MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF HEATHEN CHILDREN ! The first OBJECTION in the minds of missionaries against sending their children home , is , that such a measure seems unnatural . That it is a violation of nature , all parents not only admit , but most deeply feel . God has implanted feelings in the breast of natural parents , which peculiarly fit them to take care of their own children . No other persons can precisely take their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwearied concern  --  the same unprovoked temper and unchangeable love through good report and through evil report . In a word , no other persons , however good and worthy , can be natural parents . Guardians can be found , who will feel a warm interest in those children who are bright , interesting , well-behaved and pious . But to feel properly for children that are dull , uninteresting and wayward , requires a parent 's heart . That this is the state of the case , is too true to be denied . For parents , then , to violate this provision of nature , is causing a sword to pierce through their own bosoms , and the bosoms of their children : to do it without sufficient reasons , is to act at variance with the God who made them . In the feelings implanted in the breasts of parents towards their children , God has established a general rule : has made known his will , his law , and indelibly inscribed it on the parent 's heart . Missionaries must be able to plead an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found to be opposing the will of their Maker . That the very strong reasons they can urge really justify an exception , is plain to the minds of many , but not to the minds of all . Another objection arises from the command binding upon parents to train up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord . It is clear to the minds of some missionaries , that the spirit of this and similar commands is complied with when they make provision , according to the best of their judgment , for the religious education of their children . By others it is thought , that these explicit commands of God can not be obeyed by any arrangement which commits the work to proxy ; that there is risk in committing the work to others ; that fully to obey God , parents , if not removed by death , must in person pray with their children and instruct them in the truths of the Gospel ; and that they must do this , not only through the period of childhood , but also through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to think and act for themselves . It is admitted by all , that it is desirable that parents should do this interesting and responsible work in person . No one else can do it with the feeling and unction natural to parents . All not only admit this to be true , but feel it , too , to the very centre of their souls . But some think that it is not only very desirable , but altogether indispensable  --  that any other course is an unwarrantable substitution of human wisdom for the explicit direction of the all-wise God . The reader must judge whether this position is tenable or not . There is another objection : If missionaries ' children are sent home , then one very important influence of a missionary 's family upon the heathen is in a great measure lost . Among the heathen , the family constitution is in ruins . The state of society is almost a perfect chaos . It is of immense importance , therefore , not only to inculcate the principles of domestic peace , but actually to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They need to see , not only young children well governed , but also the mutual interchanges of love , affection and duty , between young people and their aged parents . But this they can not see if children are sent home . A missionary 's family , who sends his older children home , and keeps with him only those that are quite young , is not like a tree adorned with its natural and well-proportioned branches , but presents the aspect of a tree closely trimmed , and with only a few twigs left at the very top . And when all his children are sent away , his family presents the aspect of a trunk without branch , shoot , twig or foliage , standing alone in an open field . This is unnatural , blighting to much of the comfort and cheerfulness of the parental abode , and is not the example which it is desirable to hold up before the eyes of the heathen . One important reason , then , why a missionary should have a family , is lost in sending his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous influence to which children are more or less exposed on a long voyage at sea . From some of the missionary fields , the voyage must be five , six , or seven months . I speak not of what are called the dangers of the deep , or the hardships of a sea life for six or seven months . These are of little account . The danger of which I speak is , the pernicious influence to which for that length of time they are exposed . This is an objection which , though not of sufficient weight in itself to determine one 's course , may yet come in as an item in making up the account . On the supposition that children are sent , they go of course without their parents . In some cases the protector to whom they are to be intrusted may not be altogether such as could be desired . Even in case a parent accompanies the children , he will find it a great task to keep them from many pernicious influences during a long voyage . In very many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vulgar and infamous language , both in conversation and in song . They will see exhibitions of anger , impatience , fretfulness , boisterous laughter and giddy mirth . They will see the holy Sabbath made a day of business , or at best a day of lounging and idleness . They will be likely on the one hand to receive such caresses as to make them vain and self-important ; or , on the other hand , to be so treated as to chafe their tempers and injure their dispositions . In short , for six or seven months , they must be thrown into a strange family ; into a family confined to the narrow limits of a ship 's cabin and deck ; into a family over which the parent of the children has no control ; into a family , too , composed of the variety of character and disposition of those who sail on the ocean . Thus circumstanced , children inevitably suffer much , even under the vigilant eye of a parent , and still more would they suffer under any eye less careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed at sea , though not an objection of the strongest kind , is yet an item worthy of being noticed . Missionaries think of it when sending away their children , and dread it far more than tempests and tornadoes . Another objection is , that no adequate provision is made for the support and education of missionaries ' children , if sent to a Christian land . The provision that is made by the American Board of Commissioners is $60 a year for a boy till he is eighteen years of age , and $50 a year for a girl during the same period . Now , every one sees that this is a sum scarcely sufficient to furnish them with food and clothing , without provision for sickness or means of education . It may be said , that they must be thrown much upon the spontaneous charities of Christians and of friends . But such a dependence must be uncertain , especially as few Christians appreciate the reasons and feelings of missionaries in sending home their children . Who of my readers in Christian lands would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsistence ? But the strongest objection , in my opinion is this : If no other course can be adopted than that of sending the children home , it is to be feared that the number of missionaries will never be so increased as to afford a rational prospect of the world 's conversion . While the plan of sending children home is cherished , it will seem so incompatible with a large number of laborers , that it will tend to perpetuate the destructive notion , that the nations are to be saved by the labors of merely a few hundred men . But if means are to be employed in any measure commensurate with the end in view , a few men can not put forth the instrumentality needed to elevate all nations . To commit the work to a few is in truth to relinquish it . If , then , the measure of sending children home should tend in the least to favor this destructive notion , it must , if possible , be avoided . This tendency is disastrous ; and is , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are , on the one hand , very strong reasons for sending children home , and on the other hand , very strong objections to such a course . Missionaries , then , are reduced to a very trying dilemma . Whichever course they choose , it is equally distressing . Whichever way they turn , they find enough to rend their hearts with anguish . There are two cups , mixed indeed with different ingredients , but equally bitter , one of which they must drink . Their only comfort is to look upward , pour their sorrows into the ear of God , and cast their cares on him who careth for them . This is a trial , the sting of which can not be appreciated except by those who have felt it . It is by far the greatest trial of the missionary , and probably greater than all his other trials combined . The pain of leaving one 's kindred and country is nothing compared with it . But if the cup be of such a mixture , can there be found those whose hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the draught more bitter ? If missionaries keep their children , and ask for the requisite means of education , shall they be called extravagant ? If they send them home , shall they be regarded as possessing but a small share of natural affection ? Here , then , are trials ; but however great , they are to be met , not evaded  --  met by the churches , met by missionaries ; and however severe and agonizing such trials , they are nothing in the balance against the dying condition of the heathen . The situation of our children , trying as it is , is unspeakably better than that of three hundred millions of heathen children and youth . The Saviour commands  --  the world is dying  --  and he that loveth son or daughter more than Christ is not worthy of him . * * * * * The inquiry is worth notice , Whether the situation of missionaries can not be so altered as to change very materially the state of the question , in regard to their children ? Would not such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great numbers , and of all the useful professions , arts and employments , so as to form little circles here and there over the earth ? A great part of the heathen world is open for such classes of men . Appeals for such men have been sent from Africa , Asia Minor , Siam , the Sandwich Islands , and in short from almost every mission . They would of course labor under greater or less disadvantages ; but these disadvantages should only have the effect to call forth the more energy , patience and perseverance . But it will be asked , How would the going forth of such classes of men better the condition of missionaries ' children ? 1 . They would afford society , form a public sentiment , and thus serve in a measure to keep children from the influence of a heathen population . It is already found on heathen ground , that where there are several families of missionaries , the children form a society among themselves ; but where there is but one family , the children are more inclined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again , if men of various useful employments should be located with the missionary , there would be held up before the children examples of Christian industry and enterprise ; whereas , in their present isolated condition , the children suffer from an atmosphere of indolence and stagnation . 3 . The going forth of such men to introduce the different arts and occupations , would afford suitable employment for the children and youth of missionaries , and furnish them to some extent with permanent situations in mature life . 4 . If there were such little circles of laymen as we suppose , they would have at whatever sacrifice , as the Pilgrims of New England did , institutions of learning among themselves , where children and youth might receive a suitable education . Unless some arrangement of this kind can be made , the trials of missionaries must remain unrelieved and unmitigated . And even with such an arrangement , the trial would be only in part removed . Even then the children of foreign laborers would by no means receive all the advantages of a Christian land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a heathen community . But it is worthy of thought , whether by such an arrangement they would not be so far shielded , and possess advantages to such an amount , as to change the preponderance of argument . Then , in addition to this or some similar arrangement , should not Christians be more liberal in affording means and facilities for education , and expect of missionaries to devote to their children more of their time ? I have now brought before your minds the greatest of all missionary trials ; and yet I urge many of you , ministers and laymen , and urge you considerately and solemnly too , to enter the work . I have not hesitated to state freely the whole difficulty , for I am in no wise unwilling that you should count the cost . And I would say with Gideon , " Whosoever is fearful and afraid , let him return and depart early . " God desires no faint-hearted men in his service . He desires men that shrink from no self-denial for his sake . For after their trials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wishes to crown them with glory , and place them at his own right hand as partners of his throne . He will place no unbelieving , faint-hearted men there . He will place none there who are not " worthy of him . " And remember that he said , " He that loveth son or daughter more than me , is not worthy of me . " Footnote * : The author , soon after writing this appeal , was called to enter into the joy of his Lord. * * * * * In looking at the embarrassment of missionaries in regard to their children , a thought something like this is apt to arise : missionaries are by profession a class of self-denying persons , and this trial is only in consistency with the life they have chosen . Now , where in the Bible do you find , that a spirit of self-denial and of consecration is enjoined peculiarly upon missionaries more than upon others ? Where do you find it intimated , that a missionary spirit is a thing superadded to Christian character ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a test of missionary spirit , but a test of discipleship . Not the missionary , but " He , that loveth son or daughter more than me , is not worthy of me . " The spirit of this injunction requires all parents to train up their children in that way in which they may be of the greatest service to Christ ; and not only to be willing  --  that would be but a small measure of Christian feeling  --  but earnestly and constantly to pray , that they may be employed in that part of his vineyard , and in that kind of work , where they can be instrumental of the most good , even though it be on some distant shore , teaching the alphabet to the ignorant and degraded . But is this the spirit which prevails in the churches ? I have seen it stated that , of twenty or more young men in a theological institution , who were at the same time agitating the question of their duty to become missionaries , all but two were discouraged by their parents , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts of a similar kind might be added , if it were best to name them . Many parents give their children to the Lord when young , and talk of locating them on the shores of Japan , or New Guinea ; but the very manner of educating them  --  in softness , delicacy and helplessness  --  shows at once the inefficacy of such a profession . Many parents are quite ready to consecrate their children before they become pious . " O , if the Saviour would only convert my child , I would readily yield him to go to any part of the world , and to perform any service for which he might be fitted . " The child becomes a Christian , and proposes to go to the heathen . The parents cling , dissuade , and throw every consideration in the way to keep him at home . At the judgment day , if I mistake not , we shall see a great deal of our conduct in a different light from what we do now . The spirit of the Gospel is a spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worthy of our highest love , and no earthly attachment can be allowed to come in competition with the supreme affection which we owe to him . This love to Christ must be manifested by obeying his commandments . To yield strict obedience to Christ in this world , disordered and confused by sin , it is frequently necessary to sunder some of the tenderest ties on earth . Keen as is the sensation , it must be endured . A child must not cling unduly to a parent , nor a parent to a child , but each cling with more ardent feelings and firmer grasp to Jesus Christ and his cause . This world is not our rest . Neither is it a place to give much indulgence to many of the fond affections of the soul . There is no time for it . We live in a world of sin  --  a confused , disordered and chaotic world  --  in a revolted territory , among a crowd of sinners dying an eternal death . The main point then is , to save our own souls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , before the grave shall close upon us . The indulgence of many of our tenderer feelings of love and fondness must be postponed to a more peaceful abode . While in a world of dying souls , self-denial and laborious effort are most in place . Parental and filial affection should be deep and ardent indeed , but under the control of judgment . Love to Christ and to souls must predominate and govern our conduct
