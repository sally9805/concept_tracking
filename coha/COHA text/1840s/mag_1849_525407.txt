txt NOTHING can be more absurd or more contrary to the facts than the proposition put forth by certain would-be statisticians , that low prices with large production is a state of things favorable to the operative or manual laborer . The smaller the capital the larger must be the return from its investment . If I have only a thousand dollars , but can make it bring me five hundred every year , I am as well off , nay , in a better condition , than if I had two thousand yielding the same sum . One thousand is easier to manage , and less liable to loss than two thousand . A farm of 100 acres , yielding $500 worth of produce per annum , is a better property than one of 200 , yielding the same per annum . There is less ground to be gone over , and in every respect less care to be taken on the smaller , than the larger domain . It is extremely difficult to find an investment of capital which will yield the owner more than 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself . So rare indeed is the opportunity for a safe and profitable investment without risk or labor , that large capitalists are well contented with 7 , and even with 4 per cent . and in England with 3 and 2 1-2 per cent . interest , when the capital is absolutely secured against loss , and gives its owner no trouble in employing it . A thrifty industrious mechanic , working at good wages , say at $1,50 a day , can support himself and a small family , and have something laid up in a Saving 's Bank at the end of the year . After a few years of labor , economy and accumulation , he will find himself master of a small capital , say of $500 . Let us suppose that the business at which he works is one which has not as yet attracted the attention of capitalists , either as importers or manufacturers . The demand is moderate but steady and the prices good . Under these circumstances , our frugal artizan will be able to establish a small factory of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage another man to work with him as a journeyman receiving wages . With moderate success , he will make his five hundred yield five or six hundred , aided by his own labor , besides enough to pay his journeyman . The next year he will have gained a credit , and can borrow 500 more , at 7 per cent . and with these two capitals he will employ two journeymen , pay the interest , support his family and lay up money . The success of such a management depends in the first place upon the existence of a good 4emand with good prices , and in the second upon the thrift and good management of the small capitalist . Let us suppose that he and his journeyman with the families of both , require altogether $1000 for their support , and that the sale of what he manufactures produces that sum , and enough more to pay the interest on the capital borrowed . Our artizan will now subsist but he will make no money-he will have no surplus , or profit , at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other artizans , observing the success of this one , combine their labor and capital and engage in the same business , one of them having credit enough somewhere , to borrow a considerable sum to be laid out in machinery . Or , let us imagine , what is quite as likely to happen , that an opulent importer has got wind of the matter ; and that now , through a larger quantity being offered for sale , the price of our artizan 's product suffers a depression . He will now find that to make the same profit he must 1849. 637 // sell more of his manufactures , and to do this he must employ more journeymen and borrow , or unite with a larger capital , and put his wares for sale at a lower price , besides engaging in a system of correspondence and advertisement . If he has not the ability to launch out on such a tide , he must dismiss his journeymen , sell his machinery and again live as before , by his daily wages paid him by some more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former course . He is bold , skillful and thrifty . He becomes a large manufacturer . By competition prices have fallen to such a pitch he must now sell ten or an hundred times as much as formerly to make the same profit . A great number of journeymen have learned the business ; it has become common and its wages are less . They have fallen from $1 , 50 to $1 a day . But the profits of the master workman have fallen in a much larger ratio , and for that which used to bring him two dollars , he now gets perhaps only one , and of that one he has but a small share himself  --  the profits of his manufactures not much exceeding the interest of the capital borrowed for their production . When our artizan began life he could make his borrowed capital double itself in two years . He now barely pays the interest and supports his family , and is involved in the care and responsibility of managing a large amount of other people 's money . The whole attention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extend the sale of his wares to the utmost , by forcing them into every market and at every sacrifice , short of ruin ; and second , to make them at the least wages and with the cheapest and most rapid machinery . The likelihood is , that by this time he has connected himself in partnership with some large capitalist , who has money to employ , and who now becomes the real owner of the establishment . To this person the financial department is made over . It is he who stimulates production , who reduces wages , who multiplies operatives , and extends the business by his agents into every region of the earth . Other capitalists have meanwhile become employed in the same kind of manufacture , and by competition prices and consequently wages , are driven down to the lowest point . As long as other fields of industry continue open , the production of any particular manufacture will not , in the natural course of things , exceed the limit of a reasonable profit . Workmen 's wages will never be ruinously low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time fall to the limit of the least possible profit to the capitalists who produce them . We have now to consider the effect of the introduction of several disturbing causes into the above described natural order of events . Let us suppose that in the country where these manufactures have grown up , it was thought necessary that the revenues of the state should be collected by a duty upon imports . This duty was laid as a most convenient method of collecting the revenues of government ; a method by which to avoid , in the most effectual manner , the expense , the trouble , the danger , and the odium of a direct taxation of personal and real property in the country . This method of collecting revenue was esteemed to be an equitable and a just method , and one which , more than any other , would compel the wealthier part of the people to bear their full share of the expenses of government ; for as the greater part of the imports of every country have the character of luxuries , which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefly upon imports would be very effectually a tax upon the rich , but which avoids entirely the odium of an excise or of a graduated tax . While there was a manufacture of these imported articles in the country which received them , the duty advanced their price much more than it checked their consumption , so that the importers had to pay but a small proportion of the duty-they sold off their goods somewhat less , or at slightly reduced prices , throwing the payment of the duty back upon the foreign producer . As soon , however , as manufactures of the same articles and at the same prices began to spring up in the country , it was found necessary by the importers either to withdraw from the trade or to sell at reduced prices this went on until the profits of importation began to be less than the profits of manufacture , which had the effect to divert capital in New England from commerce to manufactures . The very large and powerful importing 638 Dec. // qwq IT is a very general opinion entertained by both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be diminished by the increase of manufactures in the country ; a greater error could scarcely enter into the mind of the economist than this . Exportation is proportioned to the ability and wealth of a country . A country can export , in the regular course of trade , only the surplus of its produce , either in the shape of coin or of commodities . This coin and these commodities are exchanged is foreign markets for other coin and commodities ; the breadstuffs of New York are sold perhaps for coin in Liverpool ; the same coin , converted into silver dollars , is taken to China for the purchase of teas , opium , &amp;c . In our dealings with China it would appear as though the balance of trade was against us ; because money is taken out , and merchandise is brought home ; but the money which we pay in China we have received in England , and thus the balance is made even . We very often hear it stated with a fear of alarm , that the balance of trade is against us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the account , it may possibly be found that the balance of trade is , on the whole , in our favor . Whether it be so or not with any parti cular country , is however a matter of much less importance than is frequently imagined . All that is necessary to be known to judge of our real prosperity , is whether the industry of the country is so well employed , and in such a variety of projitable ways , is to yield a fair surplus of profit frr a commerce with foreign nations . Whether the industry of every man is sufficient to enable him to purchase such foreign comforts and luxuries as he may think necessary to his happiness . If a manufactory of cheap cloth in Massachusetts , can produce a surplus to sell in India or China , and the money paid therefore can be used in France for the purchase of French luxuries , silks , wines , and the like , the balance of trade is not then against us with France , nor with the w*rld generally ; we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we are not dependent upon France for the necessaries of life ; we can do without silks and wines , if need be . The commercial power of a country depends upon two circumstances , its ability to produce , and its power of commanding the market ; the first is given by the industry and economy of its people ; which , however , can not come into activity , hardly into existence , until they are freed from the oppression and the competition of foreigners . // Unless the capitalist is protected against the foreigner , he will not lay out his wealth to the advantage of the country in which he is ; he will spend his surplus in the purchase of foreign luxuries and conveniences , which the poor man , having no employment to which he can turn his hand , that will yield him any profit , contents himself with cultivating a small farm , just sufficient for his own maintenance and that of his family . As soon , however , as the capital of the wealthy is forced to remain at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a positive increase begins to be perceived in the productive power of the country ; population increases with greater rapidity ; a distribution of employment ensues ; numbers engaged in agriculture , quit that employment for manufacture ; the consequence being that those who remain upon their farms find themselves able to produce more , and atbetterprices . The distribution of employment tends invariably to the increase of productive power and of production . Every new mode of industry , which makes the proportion of agriculturists or food producers smaller in proportion to the whole , augments their profits , and giv**s them opportunities of disposing of a larger surplus . Let us imagine a community composed of one thousand men , with their families , employed in agriculture . They produce enough for themselves and their families , and , having no market , their wealth does not increase ; add to that community a thousand more , with their families , employed as artizans , in various trades , that community will shortly become rich . The agri cultural part of them have found a market for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found a market for their wares . A healthy man is always able to produce more than is enough for his own immediate necessities , in any occupation ; and therefore it is that free and orderly communities become wealthy when a market is opened to them for a sale for the products of their industry . We have said that the commercial power of a country depends upon two circumstances ; that the first of these is its ability to produce , and the second its ability to command a market ; for the first is needed an industrious and frugal population ; for the second , a naval armament ; but it is the first necessity that we are at present considerino ' ; that a country shall produce more than is necessary for its own consumption crc it can become rich by a commerce with foreign nations , and that the greater its home production , the more certain , and extended , and profitable will be its foreign commerce . The prohibition , by tariff , of a foreign manufacture , in such a country as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the introduction of this new species of industry , either a new population is introduced from abroad , increasing the market of the agriculturalist , or the same number of persons is withdrawn from agricultural and other occupations , leaving of course a smaller number engaged in these , and consequently securing to them not only a larger market , but a larger profit in that market . lf one man supplies an entire village with food produced upon his own land , he will become the most important man in it , and other things being equal , the wealthiest . The smaller the proportion of population engaged in agriculture , other things being equal , the larger the profits of the agriculturalist ; indeed , nothing could be a greater proof of the stupidity and dullness of the agricultural population generally , than their opposition to the introduction of manufactures . By the most stupid jealousy they mar their own fortune* . The ability to export will be measured by the ability to produce ; * the ability to produce will depend upon the variety of occupation assisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economical and industrious population , working at a variety of employments , will produce everything out of the earth , in such a country as ours , ( that is to say , if they are well protected , ) everything that is necessary for sustenance , clothing , and habitation . For these pur.poses they will require no foreign assistance . The raw material of iron and steel , of copper , zinc , tin , and lead , and other valuable metals used in the arts ; every species of timber ; every material used for the manufacture of clothing , rough cloth , cordage , and felts ; every kind of grain and serviceable fruit , all kinds of animals employed in the economy of the farm ,  --  there is , in short , nothing that can be esteemed absolutely necessary * First shown by H. C. Carey . b*1:U Dec. // to a civilized existence , which is not easily and abundantly procured in the temperate climate of the North American Continent . If every want of the people , nay every comfort , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sersous error , or some wiful perversion in the mind of the governing power ; that is to say , of that portion of the people who make government and its qffices their peculiar care ; to which may be added , those whose fortune or whose ability gives them power over the prejudices of that nameless multitude whose opinions are all prejudice . When every thing has been produced and wrought up-when the last degree of value has been communicated by agriculture and manufacture to the material which the earth offers to the industry of man-when the iron has been wrought into steel , and the steel into implements-when the wool , the flax and the cotton have been made into cloth , and the hemp into cordage-when the copper and its kindred metals have been wrought up into utensils and ornaments ; in short , when every possible value has been communicated to the raw material - when the home market is supplied with these , it then becomes advantageous to a country to export its surplus to foreign countries , and not before . During the famine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cork and from Dublin ; that exportation , although profitable to the merchants who engaged in it , was injurious to Ireland . The exportation of food from England at the present time , to a country where food happened to be dearer than in England might indeed bring fortunes to a few grain producers and exporters , but it would be highly injurious to the English artizan who starves when grain rises beyond a certain price . Political economy , after the school of Malthus and Ricardo , regards all laws against exportation as a mere absurdity-as contrary to the laws of trade-as an interference with the natural and indefeasible right of free trade . Humanity and common sense may sometimes , it seems , array themselves against our political economists ; a prohibition of exportation may sometimes be absolutely necessary to the safety of a people , and so may a prohibition of importation . The rule of common sense and of true statesmanship is to legislate , not from a theory , either of free trade or of protec tion , but to legislate for the good of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to export is measured by the ability to produce a surplus for exportation ; it is also measured by the value of that surplus . If it is the raw material , the ores of metals , the first substance of cloth , or the like , it is not and it never will be a profitable exportation : the risk and the expense of its conveyance will fall upon the producer ; that this is the fact may be easily shown from the history of the cotton trade . It has been demonstrated , in the previous number of this journal , that the expense of exporting the raw material of manufacture is far greater , in proportion to its value , than the expense of exporting the manufactured article . The expense of transporting a rod of iron worth only one dollar is greater than the expense of transporting a case of surgical instruments worth one hundred dollars , and so of other articles ; the higher the value communicated to them by the industry of artizans , the less the expense to the producer and manufacturer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceeds the demand , or very nearly equals it in most branches of trade , the producer is continually seeking a market ; that is to say , the commerce of the country is eagerly and assiduously extending itself , seeking new customers in every quarter of the globe , and sending out ships of war to establish its markets in foreign ports , to open new channels of commerce with barbarous nations-to negotiate treaties for the advantage of home industry , and sometimes to make conquests for the establishment of mercantile colonies . It is thus absolutely shown by the conduct of all trading nations , from the earliest periods of time , that it is , in general , the producer and the mamfufacturer who bear the cost of transportation , who send out their products in their own ships , and defend their commerce by expensive naval armaments . That it is on the producer that all risks fall , or if not all , the greater part of risks , may be seen in the trade between any manufacturing town and its neighboring great city , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturer who loses , and not the commission merchant , by fluctuations of the market . It // is the miller who loses by a fall in the price of flour , and behind him the farmer in whose hands the miller 's notes are protested . The commerce of a country depending on its ability to produce and its ability to command a market , successful and profitable commerce will be that which commands the widest and the most universal market that can send the same cargo to many dif : ferent ports ; that has its choice of markets , and is not shut up to one or two ; it is therefore absolutely certain that an exportation of grain or of any species of raw material or first product of the earth , can never be as sure or as safe , or as continuous and steady , as an exportation of manufactured articles . When the European markets are shut , there is no corn trade but the same corn that would have been exported to England , being used for the food of artizans at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutlery , to almost any part of the world : * if one market is closed , another is opened ; if England will not receive our cloths , France , or Germany , or Holland , will perhaps receive them ; or they can be sent into the Mediterranean , or to the South Sea Islands , or to South America , or to many other places ; or , if there is no foreign market , they can be laid up at home and bide their time . The expense of their transportation is comparatively small ; their durability under all climates makes them always insurable ; the profits on their sale are the profits of agriculture on the food which feed the workmen who were employed in making them , and those upon the ores and other raw material , used for the machinery and fabricall these profits being concentrated in the manufactured article ; a consideration which ought to show the agriculturalist that it is rather a commerce in manufactured articles which he should support by his vote and his influence , than a commerce in grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of raw material of any kind , and for the time , render it profitless . The closing of the Europcan markets against American bread-stuffs will throw an indisposable surplus upon the hands of the farmer ; a vote of parliament will ruin the hopes of tens of thousands in * H. C. Carey . America , who have engaged in the production of grain for the European markets . An unusually fine harvest in France and in England will have the same result . Fifty millions of English capital turned into the improvement of agriculture in that country and in Ireland , as two years ago it was turned into rail-roads , and before that into cotton mills , would have the same result . It is clear that this trade in bread-stuffs is subject to the most alarming contingencies ; and it is well known to be the most speculative and irregular department of commerce . The reason of this latter peculiarity is not to be sought only in the fluctuations of a foreign market ; we may find it as well in the destructibility of the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Equator with safety ; a cargo of meal is very apt to turn sour before it reaches Liverpool . Another reason is , that the natural profit on raw material is necessarily small , and that , under ordinary circumstances , the food of life can not be made an article of commerce between distant nations . It is a dreadful necessity which compels one great nation to purchase food of another , and is always a token of destitution and suffering in the country which receives it . The commerce of a country is sustained by its pi*oductive energy Not by the richness of its soil , but by the productive energy , directed by ingenuity and ability , of its inhabitants . Its productiveness is measured not by the quantity of fruits , grain , ores , or other raw material which it produces , but by the value which it has communicated to these raw products previous to their exportation The steel instrument , worth one dollar and weighing a few ounces , has concentrated in it the value of a bushel of corn worth one dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saleable in all markets , easily transported at a very trifling cost , through all climates , over all seas  --  the other , occupying a large space , difficult of transportation , destroyed by a very moderate rise of temperature , or by the slightest dampness , saleable only in countries where the poorer class are perishing of hunger . The one , intrinsically worth nothing , and having all its value imparted to it by the ingenuity of artizans , a thing created out of dirt , and stones , and rubbish  --  the rubbish of the ground ; the 214:4 ' Dec. // other an almost spontaneous product of the earth , requiring but one species of labor for its production with but moderate ability , and therefore yielding but little profit to him who produces it , and still less to him who sells it . These are the instances which we must look at , and carefully consider , before we begin to turn the forces of government to the extension of our commerce . We must know , before we move in such a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our senses to be deceived by the lying arithmetic of statisticians . XVhen our own wants are supplied , the surplus of our industry is the material of a profitable commerce ; but who would send seed corn to mill ? The seed corn which we foolishly send to mill , is the raw material of our industry , and the mill is in England . We legislate away our seed corn-we write , speak , and vote it away-we deprive ourselves of every opportunity of wealth , of that valuable material of commerce , that product of the most refined and concentrated industry ; concentratiag all that the farmer and the artizan can do-we deprive ourselves of this by legislation-by a farrago of closet theory supported by a lying statistic , and the prejudices of the ignorant served up with senatorial sophisms . The commerce of such a country as ours must be a commerce for luxuries , and not for the necessaries of life . It is we who must supply nations inferior to ourselves in fortune and ability , with what they need , and they must give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only d6-sire , and which our superior industry and ability have given us a right to use and to enjoy . We do not mean to say that commerce must be exclusively for luxuries ; the products of other climates : drugs , medicines , dye-stuffs , peculiar kinds of food which grow only in the tropics , certain valuable metals , and some manufactures , of an undesirable character to be produced at home ; in short , a vast variety of articles , not properly luxuries , will always furnish out a vast commerce , and open a market for the products of our own industry . It appears from all that has been presented to our view in the course of this argument , that the legislation of a country like ours should be directed not to the production of an unprofitable surplus of raw n*aterial , liable at any moment to be thrown back upon its producers , but to the introduction and the building up of as many new species of industry as possible , in order that no one department may be overdone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the staples of a truly safe and valuabl&amp; commerce . XI . CALIFORNIA . It is beginning to be predicted by the more observing class of speculators , that a commercial catastrophe awaits those who are building upon expectations raised by the gold of California . We have several times before alluded to the state of things in that country , and have predicted the defeat of all extravagant expectations . The time has not yet come , but it is probably not far distant . The first symptom of its approach which we have to notice , is the fall in the price of provisions , of clothiag , and of shipping , in the harbor of California . We learn that the fine ship Edward Everett , which sailed from Boston some six months ago , has been sold at San Francisco for $15,000 . At the so called California prices , the same vessel should have brought $100,000 . One would think that the mere timber would have brought more money than was given for the vessel . Startling as the conclusion may appear , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commerce . Owners of property in California will not invest money in shipping . That department of commerce which is called shipping interest , may be said in California to have no exist . ' ence . The population of California being , as // yet , a small one , not exceeding that of a third rate city , a very moderate coasting trade from South America and the Sandwich Islands , and especially from Oregon , will easily supply it with provisions . A single manufacturing village in New En*-land could furnish it with clothing . The commerce in luxuries will never be large , until its population becomes domestic and thriving . The market is already overstocked with all the necessaries , and many of the luxuries , of life . The prices of many of these commodities has already fallen below that which they bear in New York , which , considering the prodigious cheapness of gold , shows an alarming depreciation . When these effects come to be generally felt and known , commerce will gradually withdraw itself from the ports of California , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessities of the population , the immediate presence of the precious metals , the monopoly of the trade , which must fall into the hands of a few adventurers , and the character of the population which , in all gold countries , will be more or less reckless and unthrifty . When the more superficial diggings are exhausted , and it becomes necessary for several men to combine for the employment of labor and capital in the opening of deep mines , a result which may be expected in a few years , it will be found that the price of labor , always severe in will bring the profits of such adventurers within very moderate limits . Expensive machinery will have to be constructed and transported across the Isthmus , or carried about Cape Horn ; salaried gold hunters , engineers , and miners , will have to be employed at a great expense ; constant failures , and a vast waste of labor , will strike away a large proportion of the profits . In time , a share in a gold company in California , will become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the population , instead of increasing , may be expected to diminish , having first reached its maximum . Let us suppose that the actual proceeds of the mines in California amount to about $2,000,000 inontlmly-$24,000 , ooo annually ; if the whole sum is expended in procuring food and clothing , it will pay , from year to year , the expenses of a population of 50,000 persons , living at an expense of something more than $500 a year . California produces nothing but gold ; it must therefore , pay for every thing in gold. * Gold , being the largest commodity in quantity , is cheapened by its own abundance ; and $500 will be found insufficient for the support of a single adult individual living by provisions and clothes brought to him across the ocean . It is certain that far more has been taken to California in the shape of clothing , shipping , provisions , luxuries , and money , than has , as yet , been brought out of it in the shape of gold . If a California outfit cost $500 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take with them $50 ,  - -  000 ; this is $50,000 and the labor and enterprise of an hundred men taken direetly out of the country where they belong and which they enrich , and transported to California . $50,000 , and the labor of an hundred men , skillfully employed in manufactures , or farming , in a civilized community , would double itself in a few years , besides providing subsistence for an hundred families , creating rich farms and a thmivin* village , and securing to its owners and employers all the moral and physical advantages and comforts of civilization . Let us see now how this same money and laSor are employed in California . There is no combination in California ; each man is for himself ; combination has been found to be impossible . Two or three may combine together to work at a digging , or to speculate in lands , but there can be no companies , no joint enterprises , for the advantage of a number . Of the hundred men who have taken each a capital of $500 , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in such a way that it creates nothing , yields nothing for themselves or for their country , but is literally thrown into the sea , a third , perhaps , or more likely a fourth , will find themselves strong enough and possessed of sufficient fortitude to engage in mining  --  a species of toil which is compared only to stone breaking , well digging , or the laying of heavy walls . Twenty-five of the hundred have engaged in this terrible labor , Of the remaining seventy- * XVhat have " balance of trade " theorists to say to that ? Dec. // laborious brethren as carriers , tool makers , coiners , house builders , and the like occupations . They must be paid very liberally . They are the friends and the countrymen of the miners , and their labor is worth more than that of foreigners . The twenty-five men who engaged in mining , the thirty or forty who engaged in other labor , and the thirty or forty who wander about after their arrival as marauders , idlers , or beggars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support all these . Such is the law of communities . No man would be permitted to starve or go naked in so liberal a country as California , where gold is so abundant . Every man , too , will do something , under the pretext of earning his bread . They will dig a little , work a little , trade a little , just enough to keep body and soul together . They will employ their best abilities in the art of living easy upon the industry of others . The twenty-five gold diggers have to dig gold enough among them , not only for their own support , but , whatever may be their own intentions , for the support of the remaining seventy-five , who are a part of the same community . To get back their first expenses , and that of their comrades , they have to dig , in the course of the year , $50,000 worth of gold , beside enough to pay their current expenses . But they can work during only one half the year . They have to dig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but as only one balf of them will more than support themselves during that time , the remainder ( a large proportion ) being the lucky ones , these lucky ones must clear $8,200 the month , over and above their expenses , to pay costs , and replace the capital invested ; for it must never be forgotten that California produces nothing but gold . Unless gold is produced , nothing is produced , and the money expended in and upon the country is lost . In six months twelve men have earned about $50,000 . This money is to be divided between them , but not equally ; the least of the lucky ones will have but $1,000 of this money , and the most lucky will have perhaps $20,000 . During the year expended in the replacement of the original $50,000 , these twelve men will have dug gold enough , beside all this , to support a community of an hundred adult persons in a civilized state , at the rate of $500 a year . I have taken small numbers for this ideal estimate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The result of all this is that the production of $50,000 of clear gain in California , requires the expenditure and sinking of $100,000 ; that in this process an available capital of $50,000 , and the labor of an hundred men-civilized and educated men-is withdrawn from the community where they were born , and to which they belong ; that a property , at first equally distributed among an hundred persons , is concentrated in the hands of a few pereons , that the morals and manners of the great majority are impaired , or quite ruined ; that many have perished of malaria and hard labor , who would otherwise have lived to a good old age ; that some have become gamblers and sots ; that many have given up excellent business and good hopes , to engage in an unprofitable and dangerous adventure ; and finally , that of those who successfully bring home fortune from beyond the seas , suffering the intoxication of too sudden a success , and by too desperate a means , the greater part will soon lose unluckily at home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two out of , the original hundred will certainly benefit themselves and others by the adventure , is saying more than is prudent . Such , when they come to be written , will be found to be the average history of California adventure . It is true , immense fortunes have been made , and a few who went there poor have come back rich , notwithstanding all of which we still aver that such in future will be found to be the history of California adventures . We have said that California can never have a commerce ; it is a gold producing country ; it will by *rnd by become , to a certain extent , agricultural , and possibly a few manufactures may be introduced ; but , for the first , it can not enter into competition with Oregon or Chili ; nor for the second with the United States and England . There is no reason to believe , that for many ages , California will export manufactures or agricultural products ; the population will consequently consist almost exclusively of miners and those who employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population ; // it will not grow beyond the necessity created by the operation of capitalists in its mining regions ; its property will be owned chiefly by persons residing in England and in the United States ; they will send money and machinery , and receive gold in return . The commerce of Benecia and San Francisco will consequently be extremely limited . Commerce is centered in a region by its becoming either a mart for the exchange of commodities , like Samaracand or New York ; or by its being like Babylon or Boston , a centre for the production of manufactures . The city of Babylon , in which at one period , the trade of the East was concentrated , was , at the epoch of its greatest glory , nothing more than an assemblage of manufacturing villages , surrounded by a range of artificial hills , called walls , to shut out the neighboring barbarians . The city of Boston owes its commercial importance , in great part , to its being the trading centre of manufacturing interests in New England . It is impossible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trading centre , as it neither produces anything to create a commerce , or to ensure a steady growth of population . For the same reason it can never become a port of deposit or of exchange . The badness of its harbors will alone prevent that result . Let us now make enquiry of the benefits , real or imagined , which are to be secured to this country by the addition of California . That these benefits are to arise from the addition of a certain amount of gold coin to the circulation of the entire world , no one will perhaps pretend . The value of the precious metals is diminished as their quantity increases ; to have that quantity largely increased would be an inconvenience , as it would add nothing to the wealth of the world ; nothing to the comforts of life , and would disturb the coinage of governments . The benefit to be derived from the finding of gold consists in the good fortune of those few lucky individuals who make fortunes by the adventure . The capital hitherto invested , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns . On the whole , regarded as a commercial speculation in which the entire country is interested , California has already cost much more than it is worth , both in the war that was made for it , and in the money and labor that has been carried into it . As an investment of labor and capital it is already a total failure . But if California can never become a seat of trade , and is , as a speculation , in itself unprofitable ; if its effect is to demoralize the entire community by creating an unnatural thirst for gold , and a love of foreign adventure , if it is to continue to withdraw capital , labor , and talent , the ready capital , the free labor , and the adventurous talent of the hardiest portion of our population from fields where they are most needed , and where their value is alone appreciated , with what favor can the public economist regard this new acquisition of a gold region ? The most sanguine calculators have not yet shown that the product of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the cost of its purchase and colonization . These then , we conceive , are to be the advantages which are to accrue to us as a nation by the conquest of California , and the discovery of its placers . First , it has directed our attention upon the western borders of our continent ; it has already drawn us nearer in thought , to the Asiatic side of the globe ; it has opened the way for a commerce with Asia ; it has created a necessity for the establishment of a free and rapid communication between the Atlantic and the Pacific ; it has brought us nearer , by the space of several centuries , to our ultimate destiny as the civilizers , and perhaps masters of Asia . The existence of the state of California on the shore of the Pacific , has made it necessary for us to establish a communication between the two sides of the continent . When this communication is established , affairs in California will take another turn ; a railroad will pass from the Mississippi River perhaps to the Columbia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be established an entrepot for the commerce between the United States and Asia ; the gold of California will pass first into Oregon before it is distributed to the East and West . Or if it is resolved that the great international railroad shall go to California first , still we may predict for it the same consequences , that it will become a route of commercial enterprise between America and Dec. // a grand commercial centre , but she will continue to be insignificant as a state ; and for the reason that she produces nothing , or rather produces nothing but gold , of all products the least valuable , the least profitable the least beneficial to the world . Should Oregon , on the other hand , be made the terminus of the new route , there will be added to the United States a country well fitted for every purpose of agriculture and manufacture , of vast extent , free from the remotest danger of invasion , of a temp3rate climate , and lying convenient to the ocean , towards which already a stream of population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilderness to a wealthy and prosperous state , but whose prosperity will be most seriously retarded should the great road be turned away from it , and directed upon the barren mountains and unprofitable plains of California . With such a route as is contemplated , the products of Oregon will within a century far exceed a dozen Californias ; nor will those , meanwhile , of California decljne in consequence , since nothing is more needed to the prosperity of that state than the immediate neighborhood and intercourse of such a population as that which will be in Oregon . Let not the Californian think me his enemy . The fewer the better in that country for those who are there.
