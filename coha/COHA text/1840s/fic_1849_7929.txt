Whitman , Sarah Helen , 1803-1878 : THE MAIDEN 'S DREAM . from The maiden 's dream ( 1849 ) " Thrice hallowed be that beautiful dawn of love when the maiden 's cheek still blushes at the conscious sweetness of her own innocent thoughts . "  --  Jean Paul . Ask not if she loves , but look In the blue depths of her eye , Where the maiden 's spirit seems Tranced in happy dreams to lie . All the blisses of her dream , All she may not , must not speak , Read them in her clouded eye , Read them on her conscious cheek . See that cheek of virgin snow Damasked with love 's rosy bloom ; Mark the lambent thoughts that glow Mid her blue eye 's tender gloom . As if in a cool , deep well , Veiled by shadows of the night , Slanting through , a starbeam fell , Filling all its depths with light . Something mournful and profound Saddens all her beauty now , Weds her dark eye to the ground  --  Fling 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the veil of coming years  --  Read upon life 's mystic scroll Its doom of agony and tears ? Tears of tender sadness fall From her soft and lovelit eye , As the night dews heavily Fall from summer 's cloudless sky . Still she sitteth coyly drooping Her white lids in virgin pride , Like a languid lily stooping Low her folded blooms to hide . Starting now in soft surprise From the tangled web of thought , Lo , her heart a captive lies , In its own sweet fancies caught . Ah ! bethink thee , maiden yet , Ere to passion 's doom betrayed ; Hearts where Love his seal has set , Sorrow 's fiercest pangs invade . Let that young heart slumber still , Like a bird within its nest ; Life can ne'er its dreams fulfil  --  Love but yield thee long unrest . Ah ! in vain the dovelet tries To break the web of tender thought  --  The little heart a captive lies , In its own sweet fancies caught .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
