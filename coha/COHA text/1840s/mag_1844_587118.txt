txt OF all the " great principles " of the day , this much misunderstood Right of Petition is certainly the smallest . To Mr. Adams , indeed , it is a great matter . He has so long held it so close to his eye , that like a man 's own hand raised to his face , it is able to shut out the view of a whole universe . He regards it as one of the fundamental elements of public liberty , as one of the most precious and sacred of the rights guarantied by the Constitution , and therefore to him it is all that . Looked upon from his point of vision , it may well claim and deserve all the zeal , firmness , courage , and perseverance , which have characterized his long championship of it in the House of Representatives ; and therefore the merit personally attaching to him and his exertions , is little less than if his cause were indeed worthier of both him and them ; and we design no disrespect to him in any expression that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fought a stout fight , " per se , " even though the prize was not worth the struggle . It appears very possible that he is about to come off from it victorious after all . Before the public appearance of the present number of this Review , there seems much likelihood that he will have achieved the abolition-not of slavery in State or District , for this he neither aims at nor would vote for  --  but the " abolition 's of the famous-in his view the infamous-Twenty-First Rule . We hear in advance the p*ans of which that event is to be the occasion ; we behold the popular honors which will attend his triumphant return to his native shades . This will be all sincere , all in perfect good faith and honest enthusiasm ; and it is possible that the result of the whole may be to establish , in the public mind , this same " Right of Petition , " as indeed one of those fundamental constitutional principles it is contended to be-so that it may never again practically he called into serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and all that may be done , we must certainly look upon the whole as one of the greatest mistakes that ever owed an unmerited success to accidental causes extraneous from their own fallacy . If , contrary to the apparent probabilities of the present date , the vote for the rescinding of the Rule in question shall not yet have been put and passed , we commit the remarks we have to make upon it to such fate as they may meet , and to such influence upon the decision of the question at issue as they may deserve . are not indeed about to discuss , in any of its aspects , the subject of Slavery and Abolition . The Democratic Review has , from its commencement , adhered to the resolution then announced to its subscribers-that of standing aloof from this delicate and dangerous topic . For so complicated has this question become with apparently conflicting principles  --  and so variously distorted and discolored by the different media through which it is viewed by the champions of the opposing interests connected with it , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in some cases , to the verge of insanity-that while any attempt at a calm and dispassionate discussion of it , on a middle ground of impartial candor , would find but few listeners and fewer converts , we are conscious that it would probably only provoke the emulous hostility of both the conflicting schools of opinionan effect seriously detrimental both to the existence of the work itself , and to the distinct and higher objects which prompted its establishment . From this resolution it is no part of our intention now to depart . Although the subject of Slavery has been the source out of which has grown the prominence into which the question of the Right of Petition has recently risen in our constitutional discussions , yet the connection between them is only accidental and temporary ; it is easy to separate them , and to confine our view simply to that of the Right of Petition , as an abstract constitutional principle , without regard to any present application of it to the question of Abolition , further than may be necessary for the illustration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express , because we think them true and just . It may be well to take a brief reti*o // spect of the history of ' this much mooted " Twenty-First Rule , " which was established at the opening session of the twenty-sixth Congress , on the 27th January , 1840-in the shape which it has ever since retained . It is well known that the question had been a subject of earnest agitation in Congress for several years prior to that date-on each occasion the strength of the opinion hostile to the high sanctity of the asserted Right of Petition advancing under the process of discussion , and of the attention attracted by it to a question before little scrutinized . The South has always been influenced by its great sectional interest in the present application of the right , to go in united phalanx against it . But after a countless number of Pines that a vote was taken , in one form or another , on the question of the rejection of Abolition petitions , and the various resolotions adopted for the summary disposal of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority was found to *take the ground of an open , decisive , unequivocal refusal to receive them . The resolution which was adopted in the House of Representatives in the twenty-fourth Congress , on the 26th of May , 1836 , ( Mr. Pinckney 's resolution ) was as follows : Re8olved , That all petitions , memorials , resolutions and propositions , relating in any way , or to any extent whatever , to the subject of slavery , shall , without being either printed or referred , he laid on the table , and that no further action shall be had thereon . That adopted at the first session of the twenty-fifth Congress ( Mr. Patton 's resolution ) on the 21st December , 1837 , was as follows : Resolved , That all petitions , memorials and papers touching the abolition of slavery , or the buying , selling , or transferilag of slaves in any State , District , or Territory of the United States , be laid upon the table without being debated , printed , read , or referred , and that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening of the succeeding session of the same Congress , Decemher 11th , 1838 , the following series of resolutions was adopted on the motion of Mh Atherton of New Hampshire Resolved , That this government is one of limited powers , and that by the Constitution of the United States , Congress has no jurisdiction whatever over the institution of Slavery in the several States of the Confederacy . Resolved , That petitions for the abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia and the Territories of the United States , and against the removal of slaves from one State to another , are unrt of a plan of operations set on foot to affect the institution of slavery in the several States , and thus indirectly to destroy that institution within their several limits . Resolved , That Congress has no right to do that indirectly which it can not do directly , and that the agitation of the subject of Slavery in the District of Columbia or in the Territories , as a means or with the view of disturbing or overthrowing that institution in the several States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution , an infringement of the rights of the States affected , and a breach of the public faith on which they entered into this Confederacy . Resolved , That the Constitution rests on the broad principles of equality among the members of this Confederacy , and that Congress , in the exercise of its acknowledged powers , has no right to discriminate between the institutions of one portion of the States or another , with a view of abolishing the one or promoting the other . Resolved , Therefore , that all attempts on the part of Coneress to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia or the Territories , or to prohibit the removal of slaves from State to State , or to discriminate between the institutions of one portion of the Confederacy and another , with the views aforesaid , are in violation of the Constitutional principles on which the Union of these States rests , and beyond the jurisdiction of Congress ; and that every petition , memorial , resolution , proposition or paper , touching or relating , in any way or to any extent whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shall , on the presentation thereof ' , without any further action thereon , be laid on the table without printing , reading , debate or reference . And finally , as before stated , in the early part of the first session of the twenty-sixth Congress , after a month spent in the discussion of the subject , the following were adopted  --  the first on the motion of Mr. Thompson , of Sont.h Carolina , and the second on that of Mr. Johnson , of Marylana ; // 305 Resolved , That upon the presentation of any memorial or petition praying for the abolition of slavery or the slave trade in any District , Territory , or State of the Union , and upon the presentation of any resolution , or other paper touching that subject , the rec ption of such memorial , petition , resolution or paper shall be considered as objected to , and the question of its reception shall be laid on the table , without debate or further action thereon . RESOLVED , That no petition , memorial , resolution , or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbia , or any State or Territory , or the stave trade between the States or Territories of the United States in which it now exists , shall be received by this House , or entertained in any way whatever . The latter of these two resolutions has remained as one of the standing Rules of the House , and we have italicized it to mark it as the celebrated " Twenty-First Role " now again under the consideration of Congress and the country . In the Senate , after frequent unsuccessful attempts on the part of Southern Senators to obtain a direct refusal to receive these petitions , the practice has long settled down to this-though no general resolution has been adopted to regulate it - namely , that on the presentation of one of the Petitions an objection is made to its reception . This brings up that question , which is , however , immediately , on motion of some Senatoc , and as a matter of course , laid on the table by a silent vote  --  a motion to lay on the table being , by the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in form never decided or acted upon : so that both of the opposite opinions on the subject of the Right of Petition may find a certain degree of partial satisfaction in this disposition of them ; the one considering that they are negatively rejected , by reason of no decision being ever had on the question of reception  --  and the other considering that the laying of that motion on the table is a mere postponement and suspension of the question ; and that as the incident accompanies the principal , the petition itself virtually , in parliamentary presumption , goes with the motion to lay on the table ,  --  being thus in fact received , and liable at any time to be called up for consideration , on motion and vote to that effect . One thing is very certain , and must strike every reader on comparing the last resolutions with those which had been adopted on former occasions-that the practical operation , so far as regards the attention given to the petitions , was as decided under the method of procedure established by the several Piuckney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute rejection at the threshold which is the effect of the present rule . Like most eompromises of this nature , the former resolutions were exceedingly loose , feeble , and equivocal ; nor could they but fail of accomplishing their*object , namely , as stated in the preamble to the first of them , " that the agitation on this subject should be finally arrested , for the purpose of restoring tranquillity to the public mind . " For they virtually recognized the doctrine put forward by the advocates of the Right of Petition , and paid to that right the highest tribute in their power , at the same moment in which they trampled on it-that is to say , as the right existed according to their own simultaneous recognition of it . It was evidently and avowedly their object to treat the petitions with studied contempt and detestation-not to give them a moment 's consideration , a moment 's attention-not to read , refer , print , or debate them ; of course , therefore , the majorities which adopted these resolutions must have been ready to reject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . Their refusal to do so , though strenuously urged by the Southern Members , . as well as by their own declared antipathy to the petitions and petitioners , was an acknowledgment of the whole constitutional principle of the Right of Petition as asserted by the latter-an admission that they were bound , however reluctantly , to receive the petitions . Now it appears very clear that the distinction on which these resolutions were all based , between the obligation to receive and that to consider , was an utterly untenable one-as a mere quibbling refinement of special pleading , alike unworthy of the dignity of legislation , and foreign to that higher spirit of enlarged liberality and common-sense simplicity , which should govern the construction of constitutional provisions . Who can fairly deny that those who then denounced these resolutions , as violations of a cardinal principle of popular right , had the whole truth and force of the argument on their side , when they insisted upon the // 3O*l The Twenty-First Rule . duty of Congress to Jieci* , f ? mine , refer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving ? If the Right of Petition was such a constitutional principle as to impose on Congress , however bitter and sore its reluctance , the imperative obligation to receive , how hollow a mockery was it , then , of that principle and right , to refuse to do anything beyond this naked and worthless formality of receptionto " keep the work of promise to the ear , but break it to the hope ! " Such at least could never have been the intention of the framers of the sacred Charter of Liberty to which both parties in this controversy appealed for the authority of their course . Such at least could never be the true spirit in which the meaning of a high constitutional guarantee should be construed and applied . Plausibly then-rightfully indeed-were these resolutions denounced as substantial outrages upon the very principle to whose sanctity they themselves , with an unconscious and self-deceitful hypocrisy , bore the most emphatic testimony . Nor can it be a matter of surprise that they had the effect of almost irreparably entangling the question , and confusing the public mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanding the rejection of these petitions , Mr. Calhoun and the South were undeniably in the right in their declarations that " to this complexion it must come at last "  --  and that the middle ground by which it was attempted to compromise the question could not permanently be maintained . It would certainly have been a far wiser course , as well as a worthier and manlier , to meet the principle of the Right of Petition fearlessly at the outset , and to decide frankly upon its essential merits , on a large and liberal view of it , with a consistent application of the consequences necessarily following from such decision , whether it should incline to the one side or the other . The neutral course which was attempted , of a barren recognition of the empty form of the Right as claimed , with a simultaneous substantial violation of its plain spirit and intent , was certainlylike all timid compromises of this nature  --  the worst of the alternatives presented by the case . We have a ! *ays felt clear in the conviction tI*t these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rcspet*tfully considered and acted upon , or to have been frankly met with a positive rejection at the threshold ; where  --  the popular action , by way of assembling and petitioning , being complete  --  the legislative action of Congress , according to its own forms and modes , began . There was an important distinction , which should not pass unnoticed , between the two resolutions of the 26th session  --  a distinction which was entirely lost sight of in the protest which the Legislature of the State of New York saw fit shortly after their passage to adopt . It is this . The one was more comprehensive in the subjects which it embraced , while the latter is more positive and strong in its action upon those which do fall within its scope . The former embraced all petitions or papers in any way " touching that subject " ( Slavery in the United States ) ; the latter confines itself to those praying for a certain specific action-namely , " the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia , or any State or Territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States , in which it now exists . " The latter refuses to receive these particular petitions-it does not refuse to receive all propositions relating to the general subject , in the various points of view in which it may be regarded . Yet such was the illconsidered assertion of the New York Legislature , in the resolution of censure to which we have referred . The importance of this distinction will not fail to strike the reader 's mind . It may be perfectly competent for a legislative body to declare that a certain specific and defined action which it is called upon to take is beyond the rightful powers conferred upon it by the organic law of its creation , and that therefore it will not even listen to any propositions inviting it to such action ; while it might not be equally proper or rightful for it to announce a determination not to receive any proposition in any manner , or in any point of view , relating to the same subject . As for Mr. Thompson 's resolution , it did not refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct object of the abolition of slavery , and the internal slave trade , in the District or in the States or Territories . Mr. Adams , in describing its effect , said that it hung // them up midway between heaven and earth , so that no one could pronounce whether they were received or not . It , at least , therefore , is no positive violation of the great " Right of Petition . " On the contrary , by not directly and in terms refusing to receive them , it might be said by implication , like the resolutions of former sessions , to recognize and sanction it . It simply declared in substance that such petitions , &amp;c. , on their presentation , should be considered at once as objected to , and thereupon that the question of their reception should be laid upon the table without debate or further action . This then established nothing more than the actual practice which , we have seen , had for some years prevailed , in the case of each individual petition , in the Senate , against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Right of Petition , " of which so much has been lately heard , has been wont to direct itself . And undeniably it is fully within the competence of each House , under the established parliamentary practice , and their own rules of proceeding , of which the constitutionality has never been questioned , thus to dispose of any subject , whether brought before it in the form *of petition or in any other mode . Any member has the right to object to the reception of any particular petition ; for which there may be various rightful reasons-such as , disrespect to the body or to any member of it ; plain absurdity or gross indecency ; or the utter and unequivocal absence of any power on the part of the body to which it is addressed to grant the prayer of the petition , or to act at all on the subject to which it relates . Such objection raises the question of reception , which is commonly considered as passed over sub silentio , by implication of universal consent , when no objection is made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debated and acted upon like any other ; or like any other it may he disposed of , at the discretion of the House , by being laid on the table ; from which , however , it is at all times liable to be called up . And certainly it would seem , as before mentioned , that there can be no doubt , notwithstanding Mr. Adams 's remark , that as the coherent necessarily accompanies the principal in the operation of this motion , the petition is laid on the table with the question of reception , and therefore is in fact received by the house , and ought to be kept on file among its documents , ready to be called up at any future time when the wise and proper motives which , it is to be presumed , have induced the House to postpone its present consideration , by laying it upon the table , may cease to exist . The question of the expediency of this course is not here brought into view ; but if it may be constitutionally adopted in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the House may not , under its unlimited power to adopt rules for the regulation of its own proceedings , condense all these multitudinous details , in the case of a particular class of petitions , into one aggregate , generalizing the practice , as it were , from several thousand individual instances , into one comprehensive and summary rule . It becomes merely a question of mode of procedure ; and such a rule merely a piece of labor-saving machinery . And certainly those who admit the right of the body to adopt the course in question in each individual case- ( and who can impeach its constitutionality 2 ) - must concede that if the House has maturely determined uniformly to pursue that course in relation to a particular class of petitions , it is far betterwith reference to the obvious economy of time , labor , expense , and to the well known angry excitement , on the part of a large portion of the House and of the country , awakened by the agitation of the subject on the floors of Congress-it is far better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific action on each individual case . But Mr. Johnson 's resolution ( or the Twenty-First Rule ) , while it does not go near so far in the subjects embraced within its action , carries that action much further within the more limited scope of its application . It refuses point-blank to receive at all the propositions for the abolition of slavery , and the slave trade , within the District or the States and Territories . This therefore brings us directly to confront the principle of the " Right of Petition , " as we have been of late years accustomed to hear it asserted . There are two grounds on which this Right is made to rest by its advocates , as one of the great cardinal principles // of American liberty . The first is the ground of original natural right-sacred , unalienable and indefeasible , antecedent and superior to legal or constitutional enactment  --  the right of complaint , of prayer , on the part of any sufferer of wrong or evil , to those in whose hands the institutions of society may place the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the following clause of the Constitution , which was added as the first of the amendments to that instrument , as it came from the hands of the Convention of its Framers . We have italicized the parts of the clause applicable to the present instance , so as to admit of their being read in con-nection : Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assepible , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances . " This second ground is found indeed partially to merge itself in the formerthe expression , that " Congress shall make no law to abridge the right , " &amp;c. , referring it back to a deeper foundation , as a right not to be abrogated or impaired by human legislation or authority . Well , the soundness of both these grounds is conceded . It is the inference only which is impeached - namely , the alleged obligation incumbent on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all petitions that may be addressed to it . Regard it in the first place in the point of view of an original natural right . There are many other original natural rights of various degrees of importance to the complete enjoyment of such happiness as may be within the compass of human capability . It is but one of a class . Without an enumeration of them all , a reference to that of freedom of speech and of the press will suffice for our present purpose . With the value of this , few persons would place in comparison that of the right of petition . Yet is not this , like every other natural right , subject to necessary restrictions , grow . ing out of the mutual relations created by the congregation of men into civil and political societies , with the mutual xights and duties incident to such rela tions Is it not limited by the just amenability of the individual to legal punishment for its abuse when to the damage of his neighbor ,  --  and &amp; fortiori when to the plain and undeniable general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the irresponsible privilege of slander and libel 1  --  or does it entitle an individual to indulge his peculiar fancy by forcing on the ears or eyes of the whole community , in the public highways for example , revolting , disgusting and demoralizing recitals or exhibitions ! This will not be claimed . In the same manner it would be easy to put cases of the abuse of all our other natural personal rights , which would extort the concession that they are necessarily , in all human society , subject to certain restrictions and limitations* according to their various nature and mode of action . The Right of Petition , then , is not , any more than the rest , exempt from such necessary limitations . It may be abused-it may be totally perverted from its legitimate design and use into a mere engine of disorder and mischief . Now , from the very nature and mode of the action of this right , it is only in the authority towhich it addresses itself that the power can reside to apply this restriction upon its abuse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of every other similar right , to exist somewhere . Nor , in the case of its supposed abuse , are the sensibilities of our attachment to ' the right shocked at the idea of applying what seems the only restriction which the nature of the case admits of , namely , a refusal to receive the petition-always under a high responsibility to the public opinion of a people ' familiar with the great principles of democratic freedom , and vigilantly jealous of their sanctity . That this discretion as to the reception of petitions is the proper and . rightful check upon the abuse to which this , like every other natural right , is , subject , has always receivedthe sanction of the universal recognition of the principle , in the case of other different . applications of it . For not even the most fanatic advocate of the " Right of Petition " of the present day denies to a. legislative body the right to refuse to receive petitions of various kinds that might be named ,  --  such as those disrespectful to the body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grossly inde-. // 309 cent in language , or outrageously blasphemous-or plainly absurd , and for an object impossible in its nature . Why , in the case of the first , the disrespect to the body may be deserved , the individual insult may be but the just truth-and both may indeed be inseparable from the statement of the grievance complained of . As for the ground of indecency or gross blasphemy , it may be a matter of taste and education ; and a petitioner would not find it difficult to quote classic Elizabethan , or indeed Scriptural authority for such language as would cause his petition at the present day to be scouted with indignation , by universal consent , from the threshold of the Hall . And then as for that of plain absurdity or impossibility , that must always be a question of opinion ; - in some men 's vocabularies the latter word has no place ,  --  and we daily witness that that which seems ridiculously impossible to one age is hourly familiar in practice to the next . Yet in all these cases none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their high responsibilities to conscience and the universal reason of mankind , to apply to such abuses of the Right of Petition the simple restriction of a refusal to entertain or receive them . And this concession yields the whole ground contended for by the champions of the Right in the present controversy . The principle of a correlative obligation on the one part to receive all petitions , as essentially incident to the right on the other to present them , is either in its nature absolute and unlimited-for the admitted exceptions above instanced are nowhere stated or defined  --  or else the element here contended for , of a wise and conscientious discretion on the part , of the legislative body as to the reception of particular petitions , in its undeniable privilege of regulating its own internal proceedings , must be admitted into the question , as equally a substantial right on the one side , with the right of petition on the other . And once thus admitted  --  and how can it be excluded l - it is clear that it opens wide the whole field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of propriety and public policy involved in them , to bear upon the decision of the body in any particular instance . It is one of those necessary cases of discretionary power in which men must needs be extremely chary of its exer cise , and must venture to act only under high and imperative motives of duty and right . And neither is it ever likely to be abused , nor , under our institutions , could even any abuse of it be attended with evil effect , in the multitude of means and modes in which an obnoxious subject can be forced upon the attention of such a body-means and modes of a higher order , as valuable rights , while at the same time of a more effective character . Assuming the above course of reasoning to be correct , it appears , then , that while the Right of Petition is an original natural right , it is necessarily at the same time subject to that restriction upon its possible abuse , which is alone to be found in the discretionary right , on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refusal to receive . And the question here presents itself , too , whether it is a right of such nature and value as to claim , from the ardent devotee of the principles of democratic liberty , that . high reverence and jealous attachment , which should incline us to an extreme latitude of construction in its favor , and to a corresponding rigid severity in permitting the application of its restrictive counter-principle , or antagonist right , on the part of the legislative body . For example , in the case of the right of religious liberty , our strong bias must lean in favor of the right ; and in construing the terms of the constitutional guaranty we would always carry its principle far beyond the mere literal construction of the phrase , to all such enlarged analogical applications . of it as may seem most in harmony with its spirit arid intent . We would not be content that Congress should merely refrain from passing any " law respecting an establishment of religioa or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . " We would not patiently suffer even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of either of the component branches of that body , or of any of the functionaries of the executive department of the government , should be designed to infringe upon the widest latitude of religious freedom , or to cast the slightest weight of moral influence in favor of any one sect over any other . But this " Right of Petition , " about which we have lately heard so much , is one of a very inferior order , and one to the construction // and application of which every American democrat must bring a very different spirit . It seems , indeed , to argue a strange misappreciation of the true genius of our institutions , to insist upon this as one of the cardinal principles of American liberty . It is true that the renognition of its existence- ( ihough not to the exclusion of its natural and necessary limitations ) - is to be found , as above quoted , in the Constitution . But it should be borne in mind that the men of that time had received all their political education in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was for that day . In England the movement and struggle of the people had always been upward , forcing their way slowly up towards the light of liberty , against the massive superincumbent pressure of a monarchy and aristocracy once unlirnitedly despotic . To such a people the right of petition to this paramount omnipotence above them-an omnipotence extraneous from themselves , both in its constitution , and in its distinct and often adverse interests - was indeed a great cardinal principle of popular freedom ; as also that of " peaceable assembling " for the parpose ,  --  which in fact was always regarded as the most important part of the right , beiug that for which it was most necessary to secure , from the jealous fears of authority , a full constitutional guaranty. * At the adoption of our present Constitution the men of * The following concise summary of the history of the Right here considered , in the English school in which it had its origin as a principle of popular liberty , is quoted from an able pamphlet on this subject , by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the present article is a reproduction of our remarks on the same subject in the year 1840 , when it was also , as now , a topic of vehement controversy : " In the English Bill of Rights of 1668 is the following clause : - That it is the right of the subject to petition the king , and that all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal . ' In the progress of English history , as the liberties of the people were conceded , from time to time , experience suggested that this point should be made prominent . The importance of it consisted in the fact , that the subjects had no voice in the Government by representation . Probably it would never have been thought of as part of a constitutional Government but for this defect in the frame of society . It was always a right in the nature of social relations , but it was not always recognized . Not unfrequently , after it became a law , was it suspended by arbitrary power , and the petitioners were spurned or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by sundry pains and penalties . In some instances it was aggravated into the crime of hi'h treason even in violation of " the securities of law , and thus the last refuge of the subject for relief , or redress , or help , or facility in business , as the case might be , was swept away . He had no voice in the Government , neither was be permitted to present a petition at the foot of the throne . The object of these severities was to frighten and deter subjects from the use of this privilege , and thus to confirm and strengthen the high and irresponsible prerogatives of the Crown . Petition , the humble , dependent , supplicatory right of petition , was all that was claimed , in hope of the grace of the benefit solicited . The petition might be disregarded ; the chances were many that it would be ; of that complaint was seldom , if ever , made ; but all they asked was the privilege ; all they wanted was a security that they would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only mode of signifying or obtaining their wishes , not otherwise provided for by the laws , or the will of the Sovereign . Even after this right was fully recognized and well secured , both the Parliament and the Sovereign were accustomed to leave petitions from the most respectable bodies unnoticed at one time , and to reject them without ceremony and without reason at another . In 1643 a petition from the general assembly of Divines was left unnoticed . In the same year the University of Cambridge was treated in the same manner . In 1648 the citizens of London and Westminster , in joint petition , were unnoticed ; and , when they applied again for an answer , none was returned . The protest of the twelve bishops in 1641 , their arrest and commitment to the Tower , and their trial and acquittal , are well known ; and yet the next year , when the current was changed , petitioners were still visited with like pains and penalties for the use of the privilege . All along during the remainder of the seventeenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records exhibit the frequent rejection of petitions from respectable bo // that slaywere familiar with this phrase as one of the rudiments , the truisms , of their political school ; and it was accordingly copied into that instrument from the English Bill of Rights of 1668 , as one of the amendments to its draft as projected by the Convention , required by one of the States , and assented to without objection by the rest . But surely in the midst of the wide democratic freedom of our institutions , the question presents itself now to the American citizen with a very different aspect . The right of petition is no longer to him one of those dear and sacred privileges to which should attach the inestimable value now claimed for it , by those who use it avowedly as an engine for the indirect accomplishment of an ulterior object beyond the conceded scope of the constitutional power of Congress . He possesses a higher right , in which the inferior is overshadowed and reduced to insignificance ,  - -  the right of dictation . Prayer , in affairs of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nor can he who enjoys the right to utter the accents of command , attach any peculiar value to the poor privilege of supplication . The American citizen possesses the freedom of speech , of the press , and of the ballot box . Every newly proposed reform has free scope and play through these instruments , to work out that conviction in the public mind requisite to make it practically effectual . The privilege of addressing prayer to the temporary depositories of governmental authority delegated from the individual citizen himself , constitutes no enlarging or strengthening addition to these means of influence . What cares he for this privilege l If desirous of carrying out any particular reform , can he not write freely for it in newspapers and Reviews-can he not speak freely for it , at the street corners , from the house-tops , in the frequent popular assemblage-can he not freely allow it its full influence in his selection of candidates for public office  --  and is he not certain that if it indeed possesses the vital strength and health of the truth , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shall inoculate a sufficient proportion of the public mind to claim the eager favor of the occupants and the seekers of the seats of legislation This point might be presented in some other views , but enough has been said to prove that there is very little substantial weight or force in the declamation of which we hear so much about the precious sanctity of the " Right of Petition , " resting on the basis of the eternal laws of God and Nature . In countries in which the governors and the governed are twainwhere there is absolute power on the one side ( wholly or in part ) , and compulsory subjection on the other , it may indeed have a deep foundation in natural right and justice . But it is idle to draw analogies from such sources to a country in which the governed and the governors are one  --  the latter being but the delegated agents of the former , jealously restricted in power , and responsible at short intervals to the great source of their little brief authority . It is no reply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as against majorities . It has been sufficiently shown that the solitary individual does dies , on the question of rejection . In 1706 it was resolved , that no petition for money should be received without a recommendation from the Crown ; and in 1713 this resolution was made the standing rule of the House . The law forbidding more than twenty names to the same petition , and more than ten to present it , was long in force . If more than twelve persons assembled for any objects connec*ed with the Government , it became the daty of magistrates to disperse them , by force if necessary , and resistance was high treason . " From these facts we discover , that the use of petition originated in the wants and necessities of the subjects of monarchical Govt'rnments , who had no voice in the making and administration of law , as the only mode of declaring their wishes ; that the act was simply one of supplication ; that all they claimed was exemption from pains and penalties in the use of this privilege ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or remained unnoticed , or were treated with undisguised contempt . It is the right of the subject to petition the King , and all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal . ' Such was the law , and such the history . " // not need it , in the ample freedom he enjoys for other and far higher means of infinence on the course of public opinion and legislation . How much less can it be needed when he has his work already more than half done to his hand , by having a considerable party which , if it is in the right , a little perseverance will soon either place in actual majority , or in such a position as to exercise a commanding influence between the great parties that always divide every free commonwealth . The origin of the erroneous opinion 80 extensively prevailing at the North upon this point , we take to be this . The freedom of speech and of the press are indeed rights of inestimable value , in comparison with which even the Union itself is of but little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North , violent and foolish attempts were made to outrage these rights , against the use of which their abuse constitutes no valid argument . Thus they became blended together in the public mind with the right of petition to Congress , which was under agitation at the same time ; and with which thus became naturally associated those feelings of sacred respect and attachment most justly indeed due to the right of freedom of the Pen and of the Tongue . Our object in the present Article is simply to draw attention to the true merits of this greatly exaggerated " Right of Petition . " The consequences that naturally follow from the views of it above stated , are sufficiently obvious on the surface to dispense with the necessity of more than a brief allusion to them . We hold , then , that we are in no respect bound to construe the terms of the Constitution to which appeal is made , in the same large and liberal spirit which we would apply to the other rights which are enumerated in the same clause ; nor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of them . And in the present case all those who entertain a different view from that of the petitioners , as to the effect of the movement of which these petitions have been made the principal instrument , are perfectly justifiable in obeying the motives which dictate to them the duty of quieting the agitation of an exciting and dangerous topic in Congress , provided they are borne out by the plain terms of the Constitution , fairly and closely construed . If , therefore , " Congress " refrain from passing any " law " abridging " the right of the people peaceably to asseirrble , and to petition for a redress of grievances , "  --  the requisition of the Constitution is sufficiently satisfied . Now , the resolution in question is simply an internal rule for the regulation of its own proceedings , under the unlimited privilege to that effect conferred by another clause of the Constitution . The exercise of the popular right , of peaceable assemblage and petitioning , is left complete and undisturbed . The petition is presented to the body-its object made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual right on the part of the latter as to its own action on it . What is there to forbid its action by anticipation upon any particular class of petitions , with the prayer and character of which it is perfectly familiar ! What is there to prevent it from making up its determination in advance , either on the ground ; of its want of constitutional power or of expediency , or of both combinedfrom announcing this prejudgmentand from then refusing to entertain , during the brief term of its existence , any further petitions on the subject , . which , in such a state of the case , become a mere idle and vexatious waste of time and national expense , apart from all other graver considerations ! We can see no just impediment , either in the terms of the Constitution , or in the original nature and value of the Right of Petition . Let it be kept in mind that the question is not as to the good policy of this course in the present instance ,  --  upon which different opinions may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the House thus to exercise its privilege of regulating its own proceedings , in relation to a particular class of petitions , after the other party have exercised their complete right of peaceably assenibling and petitioning . So far as the object is concerned of making known to the body the grievance and prayer of the latter , it is still fully attained-for it is only after becoming acquainted with it that it can be brought under the operation of the resolution ; which is in fact nothing more than a summary rejection of its prayer , the subject having been before amply dis // 313 cussed in the body , and , so far as regards all future petitions of a similar nature , having been determined by it in advance . And moreover , while the operation of the rule confines itself to the existing Congress alone , even within that brief period any Member may still present the petition , and move for a repeal or suspension of the rule of restriction-besides that there are , as is perfectly understood by Mr. Adams and every member on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , if desired , the obnoxious subject may be brought before the attention of the body . It is not necessary to go into the question of the constitutional power of Congress to grant the prayer of a particular petition . The absence of such power is not necessary to confer the right of refusal to receive . A settled prejudgment or predetermination on the part of the body-under its high responsibilities to conscience and to public opinion-is sufficient . Drawing the just distinction between a narrow , techideal authority , and that higher view of rightful constitutional power which refers itself to great pervading principles of good faith , wisdom , and duty , rather than to the naked letter of a written document , we think that they do not possess the " power , " in the case covered by the resolution which has here been considered . But this position is not necessary , we repeat , to the justification of the principle of that resolution-though of course adding to it , in its present application , a strong i fortiorz confirmation . We have designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . Th*at of the good policy of the Twenty-First Rule is a totally different question , which we leave to others whom it may more directly concern . On this point we differ from those with whom our constitutional views . *entirely accord . It has certainly been , and must certainly always he , ineffectual for*the purpose of excluding Aboli*mn p*titiqiip amj . Abolition discussion from the floors of . Congress . The obnoxious subject can be almost daily renewed in a vast variety of forms , as well through resolutions brought forward by members , as through petitions of similar general spirit and design , yet praying for other immediate objects than those defined in the Rule , and so framed as to evade its exact terms . And there prevails at the same time so much misconception of the principle involved in it , that it has unquestionably done more to fan the fire of the Abolition agitation , than the most unrestricted discussion of the subject within the walls of Congress could ever have effected . Yet this is a matter of sectional interest , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of that body to settle , than to us , or even to the Northern delegations in Congress . If they choose to demand the exclusion of this particular class of petitions-if it appears a necessary concession to the excited feelings and alarms of a large portion of the Confederacy-if the alternative of disunion is threatened as a possible consequence of the refusal of this concession-if it be * settled question in the mind of any Representative that Congress has no rightful power to grant the prayer of such petitions , or even that it ought not to be granted , so that the agitation of the subject in the mode of petitions could produce nothing but a useless consumption of time and irritation of feeling , and derangement of the mor8 proper and legitimate duties of the body-then that member , most undoubtedly , both may and ought to vote for the retention of the Rule , as one o.f the regulations of the modes of business adopted by the House , for the short period covered by his vote . There would be in such a vote no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American liberty or human rightshowever mistaken , in point of policy , may be the views of those who demand it , and whose course in relation to it may create the necessity for its adoption . We are certainly no friends to the institution of slavery . On the contrary , *f resident in a &amp;ate in which it prevails , we should feel bound in conscience and duty to spare no effort that might tend to its safe and practicable extinction . Yet , with the warmest possi. *o aspirations after universal human liberty-with the deepest possible sympathy with . any of the ideas hostile to that spirit-we certainly should feel no greater difficulty in voting for the exclusion of the petitions described in the Rule , than for the exclusion of petitions for the establishment of mo // narchy by an act of Congress , or a state religion , or any other object equally beyond its constitutional or rightful authority . One concluding remark alone we will add , for the benefit of that class of Northern readers , which we know to be a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement , on the ground of that State-Rights Principle which they justly regard as the true conservative principle of our Union , are yet honestly opposed to Slavery as " a great moral , social , and political evil " ( to quote Mr. W. C. Rives ) , and anxious for the arrival of the day which shall witness its extinction by the voluntary conviction and spontaneous action of the South itself , if the sun of that day is ever destined to dawn . It is chiefly from this class that partisans have been won over by the specious app*eals which have been founded upon the alleged outrages upon the " sacred Right of Petition , " as identified with the cause of the Abolition movement . A slight degree of reflection would seem sufficient to convince all rational minds of this school of opinion , that this false movement upon the Federal Government can produce no other effect than both to aggravate the very evils they complain of , during their present existence , and indefinitely to postpone the attainment of their own object . For betwecn this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State-Rights Principle , now decidedly , and we trust for ever , in the preponderance throughout the Union . Against this the movement in question must always dash itself in vain . It becomes a political cause ; and in the act loses all the character of mild and affectionate persuasiveness appropriate to a purely moral one  --  and throws away all those means of silent , irresistible progress inseparable from such a cause when animated by the divine might of the truth , and advocated in a spirit and manner worthy of its professed character . It connects itself in fatal union with all the other exciting partisan questions of the day , every one of which hinges more or less directly on the cardinal principle of the StateRights theory  --  and necessarily arrays against itself all the sympathies and efforts of that great political party of whose system of doctrine that principle is one of the fundamental articles . Hence the general unanimity of the Democracy of the North ( notwithstanding the general spirit of their political doctrine and habitual feeling ) in opposition to the Abolitionists , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are derived from the party which it is unnecessary for us here again to demonstrate to be substantially identical with the old Federal school of consolidation and centralization . It must be apparent , therefore , to the class to which this remark addresses itself , that instead of the resolution of which we have spoken being one , as it has been called , to " stifle the groans while riveting the fetters of the slave " - if its effect could be to throw back and break down the movement in question , in its present well known organization and character , it ought rather to be regarded as the greatest blessing that could be conferred on him , and as the first indispensable step towards a more enlightened course of moral action in his behalf@@184091152.txt THE volume before us , as we learn from the preface , was compiled for the purpose of presenting in a manageable shape the series of speeches delivered by the great statesman whose name it bears , from his resignation of the VicePresidency to his retirement from the Senate . Comprising a collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countrymen , framed with consummate skill , and fraught with remarkable conclusiveness , it will rank in future , whatever may he the reception with which it meets at present , among the text books from which the republican creed is to be constructed . Immediate populaiiity , we apprehend , will not be its fate . The great mass of readers will lift it up , will dub its contents with the vulgar nickname of " metaphysical , " will put it down , and according to their political bias will rank it afterwards as an abstruse vindication of orthodox faith or a subtle apology for paradoxical heresies . So was Chillingworth treated by the multitude who were unwilling to take the trouble of finding out the reason of the faith that was in them ; and yet , notwithstanding the fact that his great argument ran through but two editions and fell into few hands , to him is to be attributed the fortitude with which the Protestant faith has withstood the attacks of a power as re markable for its rigor as for its discipline . Luther spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire of his invective , roused them to indignation against the Roman Court . Chillingworth spoke , if not to the people themselves , at least to such among them as were willing to take upon themselves the burthen of the national thinking . To such  --  the Lord High Chancellors of the third estate , the keepers of the consciences of the Commons-his great argument was addressed ; and through them the result to which he had arrived  --  the tenet of the sacred inviolability of private judgment-was brought home to the people at large , at a moment when their hearts , inflamed and excited by the appeals of the reformers , were ready to receive and embrace a doctrine , by which alone the Reformation could be justified . We fear that even at our own age , when common schools are at work in every little village over the face of our young and vast country , the day of opinions taken at second-hand is not over . Everything is taught among us , from a*rology that begins the Encyclopedia , ? o zobtomy that ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the most abstruse sciences are introduced to the school-boy 's vision , they are carried through the concave lens of primer tuition . We read the cap Speeches of Jolma C. Calhoun. 8vo . New York ; Harper and Brothers . 1843 . YoL . XIV . // tion and the corollary , but we do not trouble ourselves with the demonstration which is between them . When we reflect upon the habit of thought which is thus acquired , and when we contrast the beautiful but severe argumentation which distinguishes the speeches before us , with the loose and nerveless declamation which pervades the oratory of the day , we confess we have our doubts of the immediate success of a work whose object is to elevate the reason , and not to amuse the imagination . If the principles it contains and the reasoning on which they are based are not now adopted , it shall he the work of time to vindicate the truth of the one and to unfold the beauty of the other . It is our object at present to give a rapid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the features they display . Mr. Calhoun 's speeches fall into three great eras ; beginning , first , with the war struggle of 1812 ; secondly , with the State-Rights controversy of 1834 ; and lastly , with the sub-treasury conflict of 1837 . With the first , 1Ir . Calhoun came into public life . Ordinarily , the texture of the legislature preserves a uniform aspect , from the fact that though new members must necessarily be introduced , they are introduced , like fresh strands into a rope , at such regular interval as to maintain the continuity of the seriesbut at the time of the late war , with which Mr. Calhoun 's political career opened , there was poured into Congress a stream of new members , who , from their numbers , their ability , and their energy , took into their hands the whole business of legislation . With the war , in fact , parliamentary eloquence in the United States may be said to commence . Giants had shown themselves in earlier days , it is true , for it is impossible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail in calling into action the whole intellect of the country ; but long before the war of 1812 , the great men of the revolution had retired from the council chamber . Patrick Henry shook the Richmond court-house as passionately in the convention which deliberated on the Federal Constitution , as he had when he aroused the House of Burgesses by his splendid invective against the flritish King ; but Patrick Henry had retired from public life , on the establishment of the General Government ; and though in the days of Mr. Adams lie was prevailed on to be . a candidate for Congress , before the day of meeting took place , the tongue of the orator was motionless in the grave . John Adams made his last speech at the dissolution of the Continental Congress , and though for twelve years longer he formed a part of the government , his duties were such as to leave no field for the exertion of those extraordinary powers which had swayed the revolutionary councils . It is true that Mr. Rufus King , Mr. Pickering , and Mr. J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Madison was for some years in them lower House ; that the late Chief Justice Marshall was there , also , for one or two sessions , and Mr. Josiah Quincy for almost the whole period between Mr. Jefferson 's inauguration and Mr. Madison 's retirement ; but yet , admirable as were the speeches of Mr* King , Mr. Madison , Mr. Marshall , ud Mr. Quincy , they are as remarkable for their entire freedom from those features which provoke enthusiasm , as they are for the display of those which produce acquiescence . There were two men , it is true , in the lower house , during 1'Ir . Madison 's Presidency , who deviated from the track which had been rigidly mapped down , but those two , eminent as were their abilities , were of a character rather to repel than to excite imitation . Fisher Ames was one , and even after we have made full allowance for the morbidness of sensibility , to which every speck on the horizon appeared an omen of destruction , and which carried its fears and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must still stop to admire the splendor of an intellect which produced , . almost without effort , a series of speeches whose coloring is as rich as their perspective is distorted . Fisher Ames loved his country with fervor and honesty , and had been , if we recollect rightly , somewhat of a democrat in his earlier days ; but whatever may have been his boyish creed , the . horrors of the French Revolution , and . the treachery of the French Government , drove him from his moorings .. One great calamity hung before his eyes , confusing his intellect and dis // torting his affection ; and that was the danger of a French alliance , offensive and defensive . Perhaps the difficulty he found in proving , by the ordinary process of reasoning , the probability of a treaty so wild , led him to resort to the less conclusive weapons of the rhetorician ; but , however that may have been , his latter speeches preseut little else than a collection of metaphors , sometimes false , but always striking , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeals to what he called the ashes of the patrietism of the country , couched in language as powerful as it is pathetic . There is a dirge-like sadness about the famous speech in which he took leave of public life , which is one of the most touching things we know of in political history . A subdued minor tone pervades the whole , which is such as we would suppose a man would utter who felt that the time for exertion was over , and that all that remained for him , was to sound his country 's requiem . There are none of those fierce and indignant bursts with which his former speeches abounded ; resembling , from their shrill and vehenient passion , rather the *var-cry of a savage horde , than the charge of a disciplined army . There are none of those rich and glowing appeals which almost persuade us against our will , to enter into a crusade against contingencies as unlikely as they are terrible . But there is something more sublime in the sad and deep note with which the lamentations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varied eloquence of his former efforts . It is then , when the orator has ceased to upbraid , and continues only to lament , that we begin to sympathize , and it is then that we become fully conscious of the worth of intellect so splendid , and of patriotism so pure . We said that there were two men in the house who deviated from the path struck out by Mr. Madison , Mr. King , and Mr. Marshall , and between those two men there was a contrast most fixed and striking . Take Mr. Randolph 's speech on the war question and compare it with that of Mr. Ames on the same subject , and you will observe an opposttion as great as that between the requiem of Mozart and the Era Diavolo of Auber . And yet , in spite of the wildness , the confusion , the hubbub , which pervades Mr. Randolph 's speeches , it is impossible to be deaf to the exquisitely beautiful passages with which they abound . Sometimes a snatch of reasoning steals upon us so logically turned as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wit , polished into a sharpness that pierces the nerves , and yet beautiful as may be the interlude , so great is the din and confusion into which the context is thrown , that the impression left on the senses is bewilderment and not conviction . The mind is exhausted with the effort it has been forced to make of analyzing that in which there is no analysis , and of discovering the drift of passages between which there is no connection . How different is the impression left between that which remains after listening to those last remarkable discourses of Mr. Ames ! We leave them with the feelings which follow when we have witnessed the pageantry of a solemn funeral . There are the plumes , and the trappings , and the imposing insignia of the final journey , and yet the eye takes no pleasure in the outside show when it falls upon the coffin and its emblements . It may have been a. mock funeral , it may have been a corninemorative service for one for whom we cared little . The coffin itself may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere substitutes of the undertaker , but still the heart is subdued . Mr. Randolph failed , in the long run , from his want of stability . We question whether he possessed the power of sitting down for any length of time in a fixed position . There is an old French legend in which Saint Cecilia is said to have been startled , when playing on the harpsichord , by a continued rustling and flapping in the air around her . She looked round , and discovering a flock of cherubs who had been attracted by the melody to which she had given rise , she felt bound to extend to her visiters the obvious rites of hospitality . " Sit down , gentlemen , " she said , addressing the little troop . " No , madam , " the spokesman replied , " we would rather not . " The musician suffered a little while longer to elapse , but becoming nervous herself from the incessant fanning behind her , she turned round once more and insisted that her guests should take chairs . " We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last , the foreman // being very much pressed , motioning behind , and showing how entirely innocent he was of all those parts that are underneath the shoulders , cried , not a little vexed , " you ought to know , madam , we have not the means of sitting . " There was a similar defect in Mr. Randolph 's intellectual construction . Always fluttering about from one end of the horizon to the other , surprising both friends and foes by the extraordinary gyrations which he loved to perform , he exhibited to the end of his life a melancholy instance of the impotence of intellectual strength when separated from intellectual stability . Watch him in any one of his set speeches , and it will be a question whether in any other spectacle whatever you can discover so great a waste of power . Every succeeding paragraph has a different aim from those which preceded it ; and from the utter confusion and opposition of the integral forces , the aggregate energy is destroyed . You will see him at one moment sedulously hunting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common hatred has united him , but in the neit instant , if a cross scent strikes him , he will be found scampering off in hot haste , and will return before long , loaded with the trophies of a victory over his own associates . And yet , notwithstanding his entire inefficiency on any immediate 1 ) olitical object , it can not be denied that Mr. Randolph has exercised a weighty influence , the character of which it is not for us to determine , on the oratorical taste of his country . It would be better for us if the exquisite beauty of his language , and the sparkling vivacity of his thoughts , had found more imitators , and his more objectionable peculiarities fewer . We said that Mr. Ames and Mr. Randolph were the only prominent men who , before the war of 1812 , broke loose from the parliamentary model which had been established by the example of Mr. Madison , Mr. King , and Chief Justice Marshall . The war struggle , however , aroused n%w interests . The great conflict between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government on the other , and the vivid sympathies awakened by the alternate victories or defeats of the American arms , called into action a new generation of statesmen . The restrictions which the federalists had attempted to throw around the powers of the General Government , reversed , for a while , the poles of the two parties , and destroyed the force of political discipline . TIme restraints of party connection , or of hereditary association , were dissolved . The new members came into the Capitol , free as the winds , as far as their own consciences were concerned , to advocate or oppose any measure that might be brought forward ; and when we look upon the numbers they exhibited , and the ability they possessed , we will not wonder either at the amount of their power , or the vigor of their exertions . From New Hampshire came Mr. Webster ; from New York , Mr. Grosvenor , whose great parts were as readily acknowledged as they have been rapidly forgotten ; Mr. Root , who still continues to he a vehement politician , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of district judge for his native city ; from New Jersey , the late Mr. *outhard , whose long public services , and whose pure personal character , deserve the continued affections of his country ; from Pennsylvania , Mr. Sergeant , Mr. C. J. Ingersoll , Mr. Tugham , and the late Judge Hopkinson , a man who united what few ever unite , brilliant parliamentary talents with high judicial merit ; from Virginia , Mr. St. George Tucker , and the late Judge Barbour ; from North Carolina , Mr. Gaston ; from South Carolina , Mr. Lowndes , Mr. Cheves , and Mr. Calhoun ; from Georgia , Mr. Forsyth ; and from Kentucky , Mr. R. III . Johnson and Mr. Clay . It was under such auspices that Mr. Calhoun took his seat . On the opening of the first session of the twelfth Congress , as we learn from the life with which the present volume opens , he first entered the Capitol , and was appointed by the Speaker on the committee of Foreirn Relations , in conjunction with Mr. Peter B. Porter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randolph and Mr. Key , of the opposition . It was in defence of the war measures projected by the committee that the opening speech in the collection before us was delivered , and it is worthy of observation how strongly the logical peculiarities of the orator stand out at a time when there was every temptation to rhetorical excess . Take , for instance , the passage where*. // in reply to Mr. Randolph , the financial practicability of the war was main-tained " We are next told of the expenses of the war , and that the people will not pay taxes . Why not ? Is it a want of means ? What , with 1,000,000 tons of shipping , a commerce of *l00,000,000 annually , manufactures yielding a yearly product of $150,000,000 , and agriculture thrice that amount , shall we , with such great resources , be told that the country wants ability to raise and support 10,000 or 15,000 additional regulars ? No ! it has the ability , that is admitted  --  but will it not have the disposition ? Is not our course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this libel on the people ? Where will proof be found of a fact so disgraceful ? It is said , in the history of the country twelve or fifteen years ago . The case is not parallel . The ability of the country is greatly increased since . The whiskey tax was unpopular ; but , as well as my memory serves me , the objection was not so much to the tax , or its amount , as the mode of collecting it . The people were startled by the bust of officers , and their love of liberty shocked by the multiplicity of regulations . We , in the spirit of imitation , copied from the roost oppressive part of the European laws on the subject of taxes , and imposed on a young and virtuous people , the restrictions made necessary by corruption and the long practice of cvasion . If taxes become necessary , I do not hesitate to say , the people will pay cheerfully . But it may be , and I believe was said , that the people will not pay taxes because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defence will cost more than the gain . Sir , I here enter my solemn protest against this low and calculating avarice entering this ball of legislation . It is only fit for shops and counting-houses , and ought not to dis*race the seat of power by its squalid aspect . Whenever it touches sovereign power the nation is ruined . It is too short-sighted to defend itself . It is a compromising spirit , always ready to yield a part to save the residue . It is too timid to have in itself the laws of selfpreservation . It is never safe but under the shield of honor . There is , sir , one principle necessary to make us a great people  --  to produce , not the form but real spirit of union  --  and that is to protect every citizen in the lawful pursuit of his business . He will then feel that he is backed by Government ; that its arm is his arm , lie will then rejoice in its increased strength and prosperity . Protection and patriotism are reciprocal . Sir , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , therefore , pretend to estimate in dollars and cents the value of national independence . I can not measure in shillings and pence the misery , the stripes and the slavery of our impressed seamen , nor even the value of our shipping , commercial and agricultural losses under the orders in council nod the British system of blockade . In thus expressing myself , I do not mean to condemn any prudent estimate of the means of a country before it enters on a war . This is wisdom , the other folly . " - P. 11 . In Mr. Calhoun 's early speeches , the observer can not fail to recognize the same marked and singular features that distinguish his Vter efforts . There are the same short and clipped sentences , the same disregard of oratorical trappings , the same simplicity and almost boldness of diction ; but there are also displayed , in maturity almost startling , those remarkable powers of reasoning which have made his speeches the most admirable political arguments of the age . Fixing his si* ht steadily on the mark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a directness which it requires the utmost attention . to follow . Very often parenthetical to the unthinking hearer , sometimes obscure , the most parenthetical or obscure of his arguments fail not to vindicate their strength when they receive what they demand  --  the full attention ofthe student . There is a clearness of perception of the true principles of political economy , then looked upon very much as a black letter science , that gives an earnest of that remarkable force of analysis which has since been exhibited by him . Thus , at a time when the administration staked everything on the embargo , and when the war enthusiasm of the South had cried up the whole sche. e as the wisest and most glorious that could have been desired , the young statesman had the boldness to say " The restrictive system , as a mode of resistance , or as a means of obtaining redress , has never been a favorite one with me . I wish not to censure the motives which dictated it , or attribute weakness to those who first resorted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I object to the restrictive system because it does not suit the genius of the people , or that of our government , or the geo*raphical character of our country . We are a peo le // essentially active ; I may say we are preeminently so . No passive system can suit such a people ; in action superior to all others , in patient endurance inferior to none . Nor does it suit the genius of our government . Our government is founded on freedom and hates coercion . To make the restrictive system effective requires the most arbitrary laws . England , with the severest penal statutes , has net been able to exclude prohibited articles ; and Napoleon , with all his power and vigilance , was obliged to resort to the most barbarous laws to enforce his continental system . But there are other objections to the system . It renders government odious . The farmer inquires why he gets no mere for his produce , and he is told it is owing to the embargo or commercial restrictions . In this he sees only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts of violence and injustice which this system is intended to counteract . His censures fall on the government . This is an unhappy state of the public mind ; and even , I might say , in a government resting on public opinion , a dangerous one . In war it is different . Its privation , it is true , may be equal or greater ; hut the public mind , under the strong impulses ef that state of things , becomes steeled against suffering . The difference is almost infinite between the passive and active state of the mind . Tie down a hero , and he feels the puncture of a pin : throw him into battle , and he is almost insensible to vital . ashes . So in war . Impelled alternately by hope and fear , stimulated by revenge , depressed by shame , or elevated by victory , the people become invincible . No privation can shake their fortitude , no calamity break their spirit . Even when equally successful , the contrast between the two systems is striking . War and restriction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only leaves you poor , but even when successful , dispirited , divided , discontented , with diminished patriotism , and the morals of a considerable portion of your people corrupted . Not so in war . In that state the common danger unites all , strengthens the bonds of society , and feeds the flame of patriotism . The national character mounts to energy . In exchange for the expenses and privations of war , you obtain military and naval skill , and a inure perfect organization of such parts of your administration as are connected with the science of national defence . Sir , are these advantages to be counted as trifles in the present state of the world ? Can they be measured by moneyed valuation ? I would prefer a single victory over the enemy by sea or land to all tbe good we shall ever derive from the Non-Importation Act . I know not that a victory would produce an equal pressure on the enemy , but I am certain of what is of greater consequence , it would be accompanied by more salutary effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eutaw , is immortal . It is there you will find the country 's boast and pride  --  the inexhaustible source of great and heroic sentiments . But what will history say of restriction ? What examples worthy of imitation will it furnish to posterity ? What pride , what pleasure will our children find in the events of such times ? Let me not be considered romantic . This nation ought to be taught to rely on its courage , its fortitude , its skill and virtue for protection . These are the only safeguards in the hour of danger . Man was endued with these great qualities for his defence . There is nothing about him that intimates he is to conquer by endurance . He is not encrusted in a shell . He is not taught to rely upon his insensibility , his passive suffering for defence . No , sir ; it is on the invincible mind , on a magnanimous nature , he ought to rely . Here is the superiority of our kind ; it is these that render man the lord of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise above nations as they are endued in a greater degree with these brilliant qualities . " - P. 9 . It can not he denied that there is a change between the views expressed by Mr. Calhoun on the subject of a national bank and a protective tariff , both during and immediately after the war , and those which he adopted after the more mature consideration for which his removal to another sphere of action gave opportunity . We have depicted the circumstances under which he took his seat in the House , and it would have argued a cold heart in a young man scarcely of the constitutional age , representing a constituency remarkable for its high-toned patriotism , to have minced and liiggled at the adoption of expedients which the President demanded as essential to the maintenance of the war , and the people required as necessary to the safety of the country . No matter how strong might he the instinct against the constitutionality of a national bank , the first measure the republican party was called on to establish , it would have argued principles far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have resisted the // executive pressure from within and the popular pressure from without . " I have waived my own objections to a bank , " said Mr. Jefferson , from Monticello , " and the proof that I did so lies in the fact that I suffered the hank that existed in my administration to extend its branches and multiply its offices . " - " I also , " spoke Mr. Madison from the presidential chair , " surrender my old creed to the determination of the Supreme Court and the acquiescence of the country . " When once the constitutional harrier was removed , a host of considerations were let in as urgent as they were plausible . How was the war to be carried oul Money must be had , and foreign capitalists might not , in case of a protracted and single-handed conflict against Great Britain , be willing to fling themselves into a contest which to a European eye would have appeared desperate . How else , then , could money be obtained , except by the establishment of a large anxiliary treasury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if the ear was deaf to such an appeal , there were others which addressed themselves to the very pores of the legislature . The distresses of war had so deranged the monetary circulation , that exchange from point to point was in the process of annihilation . There had been a suspension of specie payments well nigh universal , and such banks as did not suspend , ceased to iisue . The country was mapped out into a series of sections between which business intercourse was almost suspended . Each State had its own infected currency , which had to undergo the quarantine of a fifty per cent . discount before it was fit to travel into another . Spocie was gone , and notes were no longer negotiable . With the melancholy ruins of the I st Bank of the United States before our eyes , we might now act more wisely ; but in those days the associalions connected with a national banking institution were more happy . Can we wonder then , that the republican party , composed , in the House at least , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demands of the administratioii and the pressure of the people I The acquiescence was undoubtedly a mistake , but recollect that it has been proved to be such hy what followed , not hy what preceded its occurrence . If the establishment of the hank was an error which the defective lights and the mistaken emergencies of 1816 made venial , much more so was the tariff by which it was followed . Peace had been proclaimed , hut peace itself induced necessities no less urgent than those of war . A new commercial system was to he established , and in its construction two great elements were to be taken into consideration . A debt of $150,000,000 was to be paid off . The nation which had preferred the dangers of protracted war to the safety of commercial dependence , could never , with its late history before its eyes , have consented to the remotest appreach to repudiation . The same spirit which had prompted resistance to foreign encroachments , demanded an honorable and rapid discharge of the debt which that resistance had produced . An annual appropriation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to insure that appropriation , a tariff approximating to the maximum of revenue was necessary . By such a tariff not only would the rapid discharge of the debt be insured , but the destruction of the manufactures would be averted . By the embargo-on the propriety of which , as we have seen , Mr. Calhoun differed from his political friends-the manufacturing interests completely sheltered from foreign competition , had been fostered to extraordinary luxuriance . There was not a single manufacturing interest , in consequence , which was not allowed to exist in undisturbed monopoly . The vineyard was so walled in by the mighty arm of government , as to exclude the feeblest breath of trans-Atlantic rivalry . Would it have been just then , when peace canine , to have torn down the outworks , and to lay bare interests which had thus been provoked into existence , to the destructive blast of competition which would have been irresistible I Never did more perilous alternatives stand out . On the one hand Congress was called upon to continue a system which would have crushed the rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other to pull down the shelter by which the existing manufactures were protected . With wisdom which the more it is studied the // more honorable it appears , Congress did neither one thing nor the other . A tariff was passed which , while it guarantied the payment of the existing debt , was neither so light as to annihilate the manufactures , which were in full growth , nor so heavy as to impair the commercial and agricultural interests , which were in comparative infancy . The capitalists who had invested their wealth in manufactures which the embargo had called into existence , instead of being thrown nut of the window , were taken gradually down stairs ; and while the fall on their part was broken , sufficient play was given to the merchant and the planter to allow for the rapid and permanent advance of what are in fact the true and substantial props of the prosperity of the country . We have said thus much , not in justification of Mr. Calhoun and the republican party of those days , for they need no justification , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning which claims the tariff of 1816 as a precedent for subsequent restrictive legislation . There was generosity , it is true , shown by those representing the southern planting interests in postponing the sectional benefit they would have derived from the immediate opening of trade , to the credit of the treasury and the relief of the manufacturer ; but let it be recollected that the tariff itself , when passed , gave woollen and cotton goods , above the value of 25 cents on the square yard , a duty of only 20 per cent. , though they were then the chief articles of manufacture . Iron , another leading protected staple , was sheltered by duties of only nine per cent . as fixed by the act , and of but 15 as reported by the bill . " Looking back , " said Mr. Calhoun , in 1833 , " even at this distant period , with all our experience , I perceive but two errors in that act : the one in reference to iron , the other to the minimum duty on coarse cottons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as reported , proposed a duty relatively too low , which was still further reduced in its passage through Congress . " There is a gap of more than twenty years between the war speech which opens the present collection , and the speech on the Force Bill which follows it . In that interval , the States had doubled their population , had multiplied four-fold their wealth , and had placed their national independence and their permanent prosperity on a footing that could not be shaken . In .1814 , outward pressure and inward weakness produced , in the minds of a great mass of the people , a tendency to a policy by which the arm of the General Government could be strengthened . In 1833 , the treasury was free from debt , the authority of the Federal Government was supreme , and the general tendency of power became centripetal , not centrifugal . In 1814 , the danger was disunion ; in 1833 , consolidation . At the one period , it was necessary to raise ten millions beyond the current wants of the government for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , the income was so exuberant as to allow margin for the annual distribution of ten millions among the States . It would he hard to find a stronger contrast than between the tariff of 1816 , the average of whose duties was sixteen per cent. , and the tariff of 1828 , whose average was forty-six ; and yet , the first was adopted when the country was loaded with debt , and in ten years turned out to be ml ) le enough to remove that debt in toto , while the other was carried at a time when the treasury was not only unincumbered with debt , but charged with a surplus . It was while Mr. Calhoun occupied the offices of Secretary of War and of Vice President , that the great change of which we have spokeji had gradually been taking place ; and when once more he took his seat in the national legislature , the question was brought up for determination whether the tendency to consolidation , which the tariff and the Distribution Bill had evinced , should he fully developed , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hayne 's election to the post of Governor of South Carolina , Mr. Calhoun , then Vice President , was elected to fill his seat in the Senate of the United States . It had been intimated that he was to have been arrested on his road to Washington ; and with the single exception which was presented by Mr. O'Connell 's initiation into the British Parliament after the passage of the Catholic Emancipation Bill , there never was a moment when the swearing in of a new member into legislative body was awaited with // expectation so anxious and curious . When he entered the Senate chamber , where , for the seven last years he had presided , over which he then held authority as representative of the collected Union , and in which he now appeared as the delegate of a State which the federal authorities had pronounced to be in open rebellion , all eyes were turned upon him , and every ear was opened to catch the slightest whisper as he was called upon to take the constitutional oath . Very different is the impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great Irish ajtator tossed off , as it were , a dose which he would soon take means to get rid off , the oath of allegiance to the British crown , and the oath of disregard to p*pal supremacy ; and that created by the calm and religious tone avith which the southern chiefrepeated those solemn words which called God and his country to witness his fidelity to the federal constitution . When the ceremony was over , and he had taken his seat among his old politici friends , now , with but few exceptions , arranged in hostile array against him , it was impossible hut that the hard feelings of party should have become a little softened . No one who knew his purity of character or purpose , who recollected that twenty years had passed since he entered into the political arena , and that , in that long period , there had not been a speck on his fair and honorable fame , no one who had stood by him in the calamities of the war of 1812 , or the perils of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his heart for an instant a reservation to the oath he had taken . There were many who may have looked upon him as an ambitious and dangerous man , butwe question whether there were any who knew his character , and knew his history , who doubted , no matter how mistaken they might have considered his notions of the unconstitutionality of the tariff of 1828 , the full sincerity of his attachment to the limited constitution under which the Union exists . One of the most remarkable debates in legislative history , perhaps the most remarkable as far as concerns the result on the popular character of the United States , was that which took place on the memorable session to whose opening scene we have just alluded . Mr. Calhoun , in order to bring up the true merits of the controversy between South Carolina and the Federal Government , bad offered a series of resolutions , built on the foundations of the celebrated Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 , affirming the people of the several States to be united by means of a constitutional compact , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond , is a union between the States ratifying the same . " The Force Bill had just been reported , and it was the effort of the State-Rights senators to obtain the temporary postponement of the bill till the resolutions could have been discussed and decided . Such , however , was not the plan of the coininittee by whom the Force Bill had bee reported ; and in accordance with their wish , the Senate laid the resolutions on the table , and voted to proceed with the bill . After a long and most able discussion , during the progress of which almost every Senator expressed his views , with the exception of Mr. ? *Tebster and Mr. Calhoun , to whom , almost involuntarily , the eyes of all were directed as in reality the champions of the two hostile systems , Mr. Calhoun entered at large into the reasons which induced him to oppose the hill as unjust and unconstitutional in its bearings . He was followed by Mr. WTebster , in a speech most elaborate in its construction , and powerful in its influence-predicated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on the resolutions introduced by Mr. Calhoun on the State-Bights controversy . Under such circumstances , the privilege belonged to Mr. Calhoun , as the author of the resolutions which had then been brought on the carpet , of vindicating the principles on which they were founded . On the 26th of February , 1833 , he delivered the remarkable speech that stands the sixth in the present collection ; which avas characterized by Mr. Randolph as the most splendid effort of the day ; and the leading position of which , that against which Mr. Webster had directed the whole fire of his attack , was pronounced by the North American Review to have been supported by arguments which were unanswerable . We quote two passages from that state in the debate in which the two great statesmen examine the interpretation given by the Constitution // itself , of the question whether the Constitution is a compact or otherwise . MR . WEBSTER . " Whether the Constitution be a compact between States in their sovereign capacities , is a question which must be mainly argued from what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is an instrument which has been in some way clothed with power . We all admit that it speaks with authority . The first question then is-What does it say of itself ? What dues it purport to be ? Does it style itself a lea*ue , confederacy , or compact between sovereL*n States ? It is to be remembered , that the Constitution began to speak only after its adoption . Until it was ratified by nine States , it was bat a proposal , the were draft of an ins trurnent . It was like a deed ilrawn but not executed . The Convention had framed it ; sent it to Congress then sitting under the confederation : Congress had transmitted it to the State Legislatures ; and by the last , it was laid before the conventions of the people in the several States . All this while it was inoperative paper . It had received no stamp of authority : it spoke no language . But when ratified by the people in their respective Conventions , then it had a voice and spoke authentically . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular will , and was to be received as the expression of that will . What the Constitution says of itself , therefore , is as conclusive as what it says on any other point . iDoes it call itself a " compact ? " Certainly not . It uses the word compact but once , and that is when it declares that the States shall enter into no compact . Does it call itself a " league , " a " confederacy , " a " subsisting treaty between the States ? " Certainly not . There is not a particle of such language in nil its pages . But it declares itself a CONSTITUTION . What is a Constitutioe ? Certainly not a league or confederacy , b it a faudame tel law . That fundamental regulation which determines the manner in which the public authority is to ha executed , is what forms the Constit'ution of a State . Those primary rules which concern the body itself , and the very being of the political society , the form of government and the manner in which poaver is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together the Cpnstitulion of a State-these are fundamental laws . This is the language of the public writers , But do we need to be informed in this country what a constitution is ? Is it not an idea perfectly familiar , definite and well settled ? We are at no loss to understand what is meant by the Constitution of one of the States  --  and the Constitution of the United States speaks of itself as being an instrument of the same nature . It says , this Constitution shall be the law of the land , anything in State Conslilset ions to the contrary notwithstandiny . And speaks of itself , too , in plain contradistinction from a confederation : for it says , that all debts contracted , and all enga , , ements entered into by the United States shall be as valid under this Constitution as under the Confederation . It does not say , as valid under this compact , or this league , or this confederation as under the former confederation , but as valid under this Constitution . " MR . CALHOUN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition contained in the resolution-that it is a binding and a subsisting compact between the States . The Senator was not explicit on this point . I anderstsnd him , however , as asserting that though farmed by the States , the Constitution was not binding between the States as distinct communities , but between the American people in the aggregate , who , in consequence of the adoption of the Constitution , according to the opinion of the Senator , became one l ) eople , at least to the extent of the delegated powers . This would , indeed , be a 0reat change . All acknowledge , that previous to the adoption of the Constitution , the States constituted distinct and independent communities in full possession of their sovereignty ; and surely , if the adoption of the Constitution was intended to effect the great and important change in their condition which the theory of the Senator supposes , some evidence of it ou , , ht to be found in the instrument itself . It professes to be a carefol and full enumeration of all the powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their political condition . The Senator said , that he looked to the Constitution in order to ascertain its real character ; and surely he ought to look to the same instrument in order to ascertain what changes were in fact made in the political condition of the States and the country . But with the exception of ' We the people of the United States , ' in the preamble , he has not pointed out a single indication in the Constitution of the great change which he conceives has been effected in this respect . Now , sir , I intend to prove that the only argument on which the gentleman relies on this point , must utterly fail him . I do not intend to go into a // critical examination of the expression of the preamble to which I have referred . I do not deem it necessary ; hut were it , it might easily he shown that it is at least as applicable to my view of the Constitution as to that of the Senator , and that the whole of his argument on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States ; which may mean certain territorial limits comprehending within them the whole of the States and territories of the Union . In this sense the people of the United States may mean all the People living within these limits , without reference to the States or territories in which they may reside , or of which they may he citixens , and it is in this sense only that the expression gives the least countenance to the opinion of the Senator . iBut it may also mean the State , united , which inversion alone , without further explanation , removes the ambiguity to which I have referred . The expression in this sense , means no more than to speak of the people of the several States in their unite ( l and confederated capacity , and if it were requisite , it might be shown that it is only in this sense that the expression is used in the Constitution . But it is not necessary . A single argument will for ever settle this point . Whatever may be the true meaning of this expression , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they exist under the Constitution , hut as it was under the old confederation before its adoption . The Constitution had not yet been adopted , and the states in ordaining it could only speak of themselves in the condition in which they then existed , and not in that in which they would exist under the Constitution . So that if the argument of the Senator proves anything , it proves , not , as he supposes , that the Constitution forms the American people into an ag*Iegate mass of individuals , hut that such was their political condition before it was adopted under the old confederation , directly contrary to his argument in the previous part of the discussion . " But I intend not to leave this important point , the last refuge of those who advocate consolidation , even on this conclusive argument . I have shown that the Constitution affords not the least evidence of the mighty change of the political condition of the States and the country , which the Senator supposed it effected ; and I intend now , by the most decisive proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such change was intended , and that the people are united under it as States , and not as individuals . On this point there is a very important part of the Constitution entirely and strangely overlooked by the Senator in this debate , as it is expressed in the first resolution , which furnishes the conclusive evidence , not only that the Constitutiou is a compact , but a subsisting compact , hinding between the States . I allude to the 7th article , which provides that the ratification of the Convention of nine States shall be sufficient for the establish . meat of the Constitution between the Statc* so ratifying the same . ' Yes , between the States-these little words mean a volume - compacts , not laws , bind between the States , and it here binds , not between individuals , hut between the States ,  --  the States rat*fyismg-imply , as strong as lan guage can make it , that the Constitution is what I have asserted it to be  --  a compact ratifying the States , and a subsisting compact binding the States ratifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave this point , all-important in establishing the true theory of our government , on this argument alone-demonstrative and conclusive as I hold it to be . Another , not much less powerful , but of a different character , may be drawn from the 12th amended article , which provides that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited to it by the States , are reserved to the States respectively or to the people . ' The article of ratification which I have just cited , informs us that the Constitution which delegates powers , was ratified by the States , and is binding between them . This informs us to whom the powers are delegated , a most important fact in determining the point at issue between the Senator and myself . According to his views , the Constitution created a union between individuals , if the solecism may be allowed , and that it formed , at least to the extent of the powers delegated , one people , and not a Federal Union of the States , as I contend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delegation of powers was to the American people in the aggregate ( for it is only by such delegation that they could be made into onepeople ) ; and not to the United States , directly contrary to the article just cited , which declares that the powers are delegated to the United States . And here it is worthy of notice , that the Senator can not shelter himself under the ambiguous phrase to the people of the United States , ' under which he would certainly have taken refuge , had the Constitution so expressed it ; but fortunately for the cause of truth , and for the great principles of constitutional liberty , for which I am contending , people ' is omitted ; thus making the delegation of power clear and unequivocal to the United States as distinct political communities , // and conclusively proving that all the powers delegated are reciprocally delegated by the States to each other , as distinct political communities . " - P. 107 . It is not within our present duty to enter into a discussion of the merits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it created have not yet passed away ; and there are few , whether in the north or the south , who are able even now , when ten years have intervened , to look back upon it with candor . The prejudices which were then enlisted have not yet been disbanded . When even the naked name of Nullification is spoken , our eyes fall back on the spectacle , on the one side , of the Federal Government , under the guidance of one who never failed to arouse the enthusiasm and attract the devotion of his followers , insisting with the energy which the consciousness of right imparts , on the maintenance of its prerogatives ; - on the other , of a single 8tate , in face of a vast majority , struggling with a boldness which we can not refuse to admire , for the restoration of liberties which it considered invaded . There have never been two war-cries which awoke so many warm and active sympathies , as those of Union and StateRights . It may have been that there were errors on both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the powers of the General Government , the State of South Carolina was mistaken in considering the tariff of 1828 so palpably and avowedly unconstitutional as to make an appeal to the last extremity of secession advisable . Such , perhaps , if we can judge from the subsequent bearing of the controversy , will be the result to which posterity will arrive . That the Constitution is a compact established by the individual States who compose the Union , is a truth which , however it may have been contested in the heat of argument , was asserted by almost every one of the original States as they entered into the Union , was maintained by the leaders of the republican party in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions , and has ever since been acted on by both north and south , as the pressure of the Federal Government shifts northwards and southwards . We heard of something of the kind in the Hartford Convention . We heard the same truth spoken still more strongly by the South Carolina government . We heard it also , only a few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it passed a resolution unanimously declaring that if Congress should annex Texas , Vermont would secede . We have heard it too from Georgia on the occasion of its Indian affairs . But while the doctrine so powerfully urged by Mr. Calhoun , that the Constitution is a compact between sovereign States , has thus been expressly adopted even at the extreme north , we think there is still room to doubt whether the emergency of 1828 was sufficient to justify South Carolina in resorting to measures so extreme . Remember that South Carolina herseW generously , it is true , but not the less effectually , had waived the constitutional question in 1816 , and that the objection of unconstitutionality weighs as strongly against the principle of any tariff not horizontal , as it did against the odious bill of 1828 . We derived one great benefit from the StateRights controversy , and that is the revival of the great fundamental truths on which our Constitution rests ; and we can not refrain from feeling satisfied that the south , these truths being vindicated , should subsequently have waised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good sense and justice of the Union for its repeal . Unless we mistake the straws which the popular wind is moving ,  --  among which may be noticed Mr. Clay 's free trade letter to the Georgia committee ,  --  the day is not far off when it will appear that the good sense and justice of the people has not been appealed to in vain . It was said by Chancellor Kent , when he read Mr. Webster 's second speech on Mr. Foot 's resolutions , that peace hath its victories as well as war , and that that speech was one of them . Such , no doubt , was the case ; and admirable as were the speeches delivered by Mr. Hayne in that remarkable discussion , it is impossible to read the whole debate without feeling that the victory was with the northern statesman . But the victory was rather personal than political . The listener is won over by the splendor of the intellect which is exhibited , and when his ear is filled and his heart thrilled by appeals , as refined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ju ( lgment , he flings himself into the contest with the fervor of a partizan . The mind is awed and subdued by contact with powers so grand . Take that celebrated // appeal to the old federal associations of the south , where the orator painted South Carolina and Massachusetts " when they struggled shoulder to shoulder in the Revolution , when they stood hand in hand around the administration of Washington , and felt his own great arm lean on them for support . " At that fine passage  --  the finest , we think , as far as the feelings go , in American parliamentary history-the iron features of Mr. Calhoun , who sat in the Vice President 's chair , are said to have relaxed from the fixed and anxious expression which the perilous debate before him had induced , and to have caught for a moment a glow of sympathy from the speaker as he looked back with him to the days of the revolution . And yet , after all , the victory which was then gained , was gained principally by attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great auditory which crowded the Senate chamber . Who of us who has followed Napoleon through his Italian campaigns-who has watched him crossing the Alps in spite of the severity of the mountain *vinter and the cannon of the Austrian troops-who has seen him separate , for distinct and distant adventures , his little army , and then with the accuracy and completeness of a mathematician whose only battle field is a piece of pasteboard , unite at the point and moment determined months hack , the component fragments-who has gazed on him storming on foot the hridge of Ancona , or dashing with the rapidity of lightning from province to province , till the Austrian geneials , in the confusion of an attack so multiform , hedge themselves up in their trenches , - who , we say , who has witnessed that extraordinary campaign , no matter how strong may perhaps be his conviction of the selfishness of the object , and the badness of the cause of the great conqueror , but has felt his sympathies taken captive by adventures so wild , directed by genius so mighty * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webster 's earliest triumphs , and it was under such influence the great mass of the American people cheered him on in those great efforts of which we have spoken . As examples of strong Saxon debating , we question whether we can find their equal since the days of Mr. Fox . No matter what may be the conclusion to which we ar rive on the question whether or no the general drift of their argument has been advantageous or deleterious to the country , no man can doubt that the nervousness of their style and the elegance of their arrangement are admirably calculated both to chasten and invigorate the character of our national eloquence . There is a marked difference , however , between Mr. Webster 's speeches on Mr. Foot 's resolutions , and his argument in the debate with Mr. Calhoun , from which we have given extracts . Whether it was that the cxVice-President was an antagonist before whom it would be imprudent to execute man*nvres so bold as those he had performed in the face of Mr. Hayne , or whether his ardor had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech on the Force Bill has neither the richness of style nor the luxuriance of illustration which distinguished its predecessors . Had it stood by itself without the reflected glory which the character of its author threw on it , we question whether it would have attracted anything beyond ordinary attention . There are none of those Olympic thunders which won for Mr. XVehster the epithet of " the god-like . " The argument , no doubt , is powerful , for it is impossible that any train of reasoning could issue from so great a mind without exhibiting the marks of power , but though it is powerful , it is not eloquent . It is here that we can notice a distinction between Mr. Calhoun and Mr. Webster , a distinction to which we shall advert hereafter-that while the eloquence of the one is inherent in his argument , the eloquence of the other is extraneous to it . With both there are great , we are willing to say for the present , equal powers of reasoning , but yet , while on the one hand , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and put on without destroying the texture of his argument , the eloquence of his great rival consists in his argument itself . In Mr. Calhoun 's we miss those gorgeous passages with which Mr. Webster 's speeches abound , passages which , from the fullness of their imagery , or the mellowness of their pathos , or the fervor of their invective , or the force of their retort , arouse and carry away the hearer , but their place is supplied by the enthusiasm which the intense and // fiery energy of the argument kindles . There is passion enough , but like the steam in a well-regulated engine it displays itself not in wreaths and puffs of vapor , but in the rapid and methodical action of the machinery it impels . The mind of the student is heated , not by sparks applied to his prejudices , his tastes , to his sense of the ridiculous , or his sense of the sublime , but by the fire which has been raised by the vehement electric rapidity with which the reasoning process has been conducted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have left them with a sense of admiration for the abilities they exhibit , and of consciousness of the victories they record , and yet he may be unable , when he is asked afterwards what is the syllogism by which he was captivated , or the argument by which he was convinced , to give an answer which is sufficient even to satisfy himself . That which had won him , perhaps , was a happy retort , or a fine apostrophe , or perhaps an analogy or an illustration which drew their power more from the depth of their coloring than the justness of their application ; and if so , he will find that when he comes in calmness to seek for the reasoning which overcame him , he will discover that the scattered ashes of a trope , or the broken skeleton of aa analogy , are all that remain on his memory . There was a great deal else , it is true , besides , but the more subdued and sombre coloring of the argument itself is too often killed by the richer tints of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is eloquence enough around it , but there is hut little in it . It is then that he finds the great contrast between Mr. Webster and Mr. Calhoun , for we defy any one to study a speech of the southern statesman without being able to carry off the argument it contains . There is nothing else to carry off . There are no fretted carvings , nor sculptured ornaments around the capitol of the column , that can be broken off and removed . If anything at all is taken it is the shaft itself . The student will master the whole argument , or he will master nothing ; and so eloquent is that argument in itself , so beautiful in its diction , so classical in its proportions , so dense and firm in its construction , that he must be a careless observer that can pass by it without feeling his heart sub . dued and overcome , as much by its simple majesty as by its unbroken strength . The third period to which we confined our attention begins with the agitation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specie payments which had just occurred , the banks and government , by the operation of the joint resolution of 1816 , which allowed the reception of speciepaying notes only , by the treasury , were finally separated . The deposite act of 1836 , also , had prohibited the depositing of government funds in the vaults of any banks whatever except such as paid gold and silver ; and the moment the suspension took place , therefore , a practical divorce was worked between the banking system , on the one hand , and the treasury department , on the other . For a moment , the course which would he taken by the two great political parties was uncertain . The Whigs had vehemently opposed the deposite scheme when it was pressed in General Jackson 's administration , and their late professions , consequently , were in the way of their accepting the pet-bank league , under circumstances far more disadvantageous than those under which it was first proposed . The friends of the administration who had devised it , were reluctant so soon to cast it away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there are few who do not remember the shock which Mr. Van Buren 's message created . There was a boldness in it which surprised both wings of the Capitol . With admirable wisdom , he had seen the true alternatives of the emergency , and discovered that there was no medium between an entire disconnection with banks whatever , and a complete and final entanglement with the whole system . With remarkable courage , when we reflect how intimately the leading men of both parties were connected with the banks , he determined to recommend , at once , the latter alternative . Mr. Calhoun had already very plainly intimated his sentiments in favor of the separation , and when he arrived at Washington , and found what was the course the President had taken , he hesitated not a moment to give the administration scheme his full and earnest support . When the bill for the establishment of a subtreasury came up  --  a name which has been so much abused , and with which // so many ludicrous and dishonorable associations have been connected , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that it is in itself a natural and appropriate title for the most simple and innocent scheme that ever was devised for the purpose of conducting the fiscal operations of the GovernmentMr . Calhoun moved an amendment providing for the receipt of government dues in specie alone , which being adopted by the Senate , was incorporated in the bill . It was in defence of the whole measure , as finally amended , that he delivered three speeches , which for their comprehensive review of the banking system in its vast ramifications , and for their conclusive vindication of the government scheme in its fiscal relations , took rank at the same time among the ablest economical treatises , and the most complete political arguments . The sub-treasury question is once more in the process of agitation , and though it is impossible to cut out from Mr. CalhouWs speeches passages far exhibition , without breaking up the train of the argument , and though it is to the whole , and not to extracts , however copious. that the attention of the thinklug man should at present be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being kept constantly before the eyes of the country , and which we copy , not only for the truths they contain , but for the energy with which they are exhibited : WHAT 15 TO BE DONE I " The system having new arrived at this point , the great and solemn duty devolves on us to determine this day what relation this Government shall hereafter bear to it . Shall we enter into an alliance with it , and became the sharers of its fortune and the instrument of its aggrandizement and supremacy ? This is the momentous question , on which we must now decide . Before we decide , it behoves us to inquire whether the system is favorable to the permanency of our free republican institutions , to the industry and business cf the country , and , above all , to our moral and intellectual development , the great object for which we were placed here by the Author of our being .

It is the remark of a profound statesman , that the revenue is the State ; and , of course , those who control the revenue control tie State , and those who can control the money power can the revenue , and threneb it the State , with the property and industry of the country , in all its ramifications . Let us pause for a moment , and reflect on the nature and extent of this tremendous power . " - P. 280 . BANKING ON TIlE cUREENOY .

The currency bears even a smaller proportion to the aggregate capital of the community , than what the blood does to the solids in the human system . What that portion is , has not been , and perhaps can not he , accurately ascertained , as it is probably subject to considerable variations . It is probably between twenty-five and thirty-five to one . I will assume it to be thirty to one . With this assumption , let us suppose a community whose aggregate capital is $31,000,000 ; its currency would be , by supposition , one million , and the residue of its capital thirty millions . This being assumed , if the currency be increased or decreased , the other portion of the capital remains the same , according to the well known laws of currency ; property would rise or fall with the increase or decrease ; that is , if the currency be increased to two millions , the aggregate v aloe of property would rise to sixty millions ; and , if the currency be reduced to $500,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law so well established , place the money power in the hands of a single individual , or a combination of individuals , and by expanding or contracting the currency , they may raise or sink prices at pleasure ; and by purchasing when at the greatest depression , and selling at the greatest elevation , may command the whole property and industry of the community , and control its fiscal operations . The banking system concentrates and places this power in the bands of those who control it , and its force increases just in propor // lion as it dispenses with a metallic basis . Never was an engine invented better calculated to place the destiny of the many in the hands of the few , or less favorable to that equality and independence which lies at the bottom of all free institutions .

Bat , if allotted to pursuits that require inferior qualities , the higher are sure to decay and perish . I object to the banking system , because it allots the honors and rewards of the coininunity , in a very undue proportion , to a pursuit the least of all others favorable to the development of the higher mental qualities , intellectual or moral , to the decay of the learned professions , and the more noble pursuits of science , literature , philosophy , and statesmanship , and the great and more useful pursuits of business and industry .

" - P. 282 . IS THE DEPOSITE SCHEME CONSTITU TIONAL " I have not yet exhausted my constitutional objections . I rise to higher and to broader , applying directly to the very essence of this substitute . I deny your right to make a general deposite of the public revenue in a bank . More than half of the errors of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of words ; and among not the least mischievous is the application of this word to bank transactions , in a sense wholly different from its original meanine . Originally it meant a thing placed in trust , or pledged to be safely and sacredly kept till returned to the depositor , without being used by the depository , while in his possession . All this is changed when applied to a deposite in bank . Instead of returning the identical thing , the bank is understood to be bound to return only an equal value ; and instead of not having the use , it is understood to have the right to loan it out on interest , or to dispose of it as it pleases , with the single condition , that an equal amount be returned , when demanded , which experience has taught is not always done .

Or if not to them , to individual officers of the Government ; for instance , to the four principal receivers under this bill , should it pass ? And if ' this can not be done , that the distinction be pointed out . " - P. 297 . MEANING OF sun-TaEASUav . " I regard this measure , which has been so much denounced , as very little more than an attempt to carry out the provisions of the joint resolution of 1816 , . and the deposite act of 1836 .

The object of this bill is to supply this omission ; to take the public money out of the hands of the Executive , and place it under the custody of the laws , and to prevent the renewal of a connection which has proved so unfortunate to both the Government and the banks . But it is this measure , originating in an exi*ency caused by our own acts , and that seeks to make the most of a change effected by operation of law , instead of attemptin* to innovate , or to make another experiment , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of the Sub-Treasury with such unexampled bitteraess.

If it can virtually endorse by law on the notes of specie-paying banks , receivable in payment of the public dues , ' it surely can order the same words to be written on a blank piece of paper .

Mr. Walsh , in one of his late admirable letters from Paris , mentions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of by some of the best French critics , as one of the most classical and cogent arguments of modern times . It would be running beyond our present limits for us to attempt to notice with any justice , either that or the Oregon speech , both of which , though embracing subjects which did not at the time fall within the field to which Mr. Calhoun 's attention had been principally turned , exerted a preponderating influence in deciding the two weighty questions with which they were connected . The speeches in the latter half of the volume , in fact , fall into two great branches , covering , in the first place , the questions which relate to the currency and revenue of they country , and , secondly , those which concern its foreign and domestic policy . Under the first head , may be classed the speoches on the sub-treasury , in. 1837 and 1838 ; that on the assumption of State debts , in 1840 ; that on the treasury note bill , in 1841 ; that on Mr .. Clay 's revenue resolutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1842 ; and that on the tariff bill , in 1842 . Under the second head may he classed the speech on the bill to prevent the interference of Federal officers in elections , in 1839 ; on the case of the Enterprise , in 1840 ; on the bankrupt bill , in 1840 ; that o the pre-emption bill and the land distribution bill , in 1841 ; that in support of the veto power , in 1842 ; that on* the treaty of Washington , in 1842 ; and that on the Oregon bill , in 1843 . There is one , however , we mean that on the tariff of 1842 , on which , front the remarkable degree in which it exhibits Mr. Calhoun 's power , both of *nalysis and argument , as well as froni its present applicability , we will dwell for a moment in conclusion ; THE TARIFF ON THE MANUFACTURERS , " In tracing what would be the effects of the high protective duties proposed by the bill , I shall suppose all the grounds assumed by its advocates to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are caused by the imports received in exchange for exports ; that the imports have , to a treat extent , taken possession of the market ; and that the imposition of high duties proposed on the imports would exclude them either wholly , or to a great extent ; and that the market , in consequence , would be relieved , and Le followed by the rise of price desired . I assume all to be as stated , because it is the supposition most favorable to those who ask for high duties , and the one on which they rely to make out their case . It is my wish to treat the subject with the utmost fairness , having no other object in view but truth . " According , then , to the supposition , the drst leading effect of these high protective duties would he to exclude the imported articles , against which they are asked , either entirely , or to a great extent . If they should fail in that , it is obvious that they would fail in the immediate object desired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , I ask , must be the necessary consequence of the exclusion of the articles against which the protective duties are proposed to be laid ? The answer is clear . The portion of the exports , which would have been exchanged for them , must then return in the unprotected and free articles ; and , among the latter , specie , in order to purchase from the manufacturers at home the supplies which , but for the duties , would have been purchased abroad . And what would be the effect of that , but to turn the exchange , artificially , in our favor , as against other countries , and in favor of the manufacturing portion of the country , as against all others ? And what would that be , but an artificial concentration of the specie of the country in the manufacturing region , accompanied by a corresponding expansion of the currency from that cause , and still more from the discounts of the banks ? I next ask , what must be the effects of such expansion , but that of raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing the expense of manufacturing , and that continuing till ihe increased expense shall raise the cost of producing so high , as to be equal to that of the imported article , with the addition of the daty , when the importations will again commence , and an additional daty be demanded ? This inevitable result would be accelerated by two causes . The effect of the duty in preventing importation would cause a falling off of the demand abroad , and a consequent falling off , temporarily , of price there . The extent would depend on the extent of the falling off , compared with the general dem2nd for the article ; and , of course , would be greater in some articles , and less in others . All would be more or less affected ; but none to an extent so great as was insisted on by the Chairman , and other advocates of the system , the other day , in the discussion of the duty on cotton-bag* , in ' ; but still sufficient , in most cases , to be sensibly felt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and equalize prices would , in time , cause , in turn , a corresponding falling off in the production of the article , proportional to the falling off of the demand . " Bat another and more powerful cause would he put in operation at home , which would tend still more to shorten the periods between the demand for protection . The stimulus caused by the expansion of the corrency , and increased demand and prices consequent on the exclusion of the article from abroad , would tempt numerous adventurers to rush into the business , often without experience or capital ; and the increased production , in consequence , thrown into the market , would greally accelerate the period of renewed distress and embarreesment , and dam ad for additional protection . " The history of the system fully illustrates the operation of these causes , and the truth of the conclusion drawn from them . Every protective tariff that Congress has ever laid , has disappointed the hopes of its advocates ; and has been followed , at short intervals , by a demand for higher duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cry has been protection after protection : one bottle after another , and each succeeding one more capacious than the preceding . Repetition but increases the demand , till the whole terminate , in one universal explosion , such as that from which the country is now struggling to escape . " - P. 524 . THE TAItIFF ON THE LABORER . " No one is more averse to the reduction of wages than I am , or entertains a greater respect for the laboring portion of the community . Nothin* could induce me to adopt a course of policy that would impair their comfort or prosperity . But when we speak of wages , a distinction must be made between the real and artiIlcial ; between that which enables a laborer to exchange the fruits of his industry for the greatest amount of food , clothing , and other necessaries or comforts , without regard to the nominal amount in money , and the mere nominal money amount , that is oftenthe result of an inflated currency , which , instead of increasing wnge.s in proportion to the price and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most effective means of defrauding him of his just dues . But it is a great mistake to suppose that low prices and high wages , estimated in money , are irreconcilable . Wages are but the residuum after deducting the profit of capital , the expense of production , including the exactions of the Government in the shape of taxes ; which must certainly fall on production , however laid . The less that is paid for the use of capital , for the expense of production , and the exactions of the Government , the greater is the amount left for wages ; and hence , by lessening these , prices may fall , and wages rise at the same time ; and that is the corabination which gives to labor its greatest reward , and places the prosperity of a country on the roost durable basis . " - P. 530 . TIlE TARIFF ON THE PEOPLE AT LARGE . " If all this be traced back , the ultimate cause of this deplorable change will be found to originate mainly in the fact , that the duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imports ) , from which now the whole revenue is derived , are so laid , that the most powerful portion of the community-not in numbers , but ira influence - are not only exempted from the burden , but , in fact , according to their own conception , receive bounties from their operation . They crowd our tables with petitions , imploring Con*ress to impose taxes - high taxes ; and rejoice at their imoposition as the greatest blessing , and deplore their defeat as tile greatest calamity ; while other portions regard them in the opposite light , as oppressive and *rievous burdens . Now , Senators , I appeal to you  --  to the candor and good sense even of the friends of this bill-whether these facts do not furnish proof conclusive , that these high protective duties are regarded as bounties , and not taxes , by these petitioners , and those who support their course , and urge the passage of the bill ? Can stronger proof be offered ? Bounties may be implored , but it is not in humna nature to pray for taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such . I again appeal to you , and ask if the power of taxation can be perverted into an instrument in the hands of Government to enrich and aggrandixe one portion of the community at the expense of the other , without causing all of the disastrous consequences , political and moral , which we all deplore ? Can anything be imagined more destructive of patriotism , and more productive of faction , selfishness , and violence ; or more hostile to all economy and accountability in the administration of the fiscal department of the Government ? Can those who regard taxes as a fruitful source of gain , or as the means of averting ruin , reaard extrava , ance , waste , neglect , or any other means by which the expenditures may be increased , and the tax on the iruports raised , with the deep condemnation which their corrupting consequences on the politics and morals of the community demand ?

Should the present volume he destroyed , and should no record be left of the speeches it contains , how different would that judgment he from that whikh we are confident will be ultimately pronounced ! Let the man who lives after us he told that the author of the lost hook he d preserved for twenty years a paramount sway over a section of the Union as remarkable for the warmth of its temperament as for the luxuriance of its taste ; that during the course of a long political life , whose vicissitudes were as great as its associations xvee various , never for a moment did his constituents abate one tittle of their trust in his wisdom , or of their confidence in his ability ; that by the extraordinary power which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one memorable period , to encounter single-handed the collected Union ; if , in addition to what has been said , the Nullification struggle in alJ its desperateness , be spread before the critic , we apprehend that he would picture to himself as its case and leader , a mart whose rhetoric was warm as the climate which gave him birth , and who , like iWirahean and O'Connell , acquired his supremacy more by the eloquence of passion than the power of reason . How widely does such an estimate contrast with that which the speeches before us will induce ! Severe in their argument , chaste in their style , the most critical observer will fail to discover through their length and breadth , a single attempt . to entrap the judgment by invoking the prejudice or amusing // the fancy . But yet , in the very intensity of their argumentation , there is eloquence more vehement than it is in the power of the most passionate declamation to produce . The elicitation of truth , like the creation of some of the rarer chemical bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the composing elements . The reasoning process itself , when conducted with correctness and energy , is the perfection of rhetoric ; and we have no doubt that when the force of local allusions and temporary stimulants decays , that the chaste and powerful argumentation in the volume before us will cause its author to take rank among the few great men whose mission it is to improve the reason , and not to amuse the fancy.
