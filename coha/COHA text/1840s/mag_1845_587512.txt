txt WITH the controversy of which these publications form a part , we have nothing to do . We would merely avail ourselves of the occasions thus furnished , to suggest a few thoughts of our own upon the subject . We may remark , by the way , however , that we had read Mr. Mann 's " Report , " before any opposition to it had appeared . We must say , we thought it an admirable production in every respect , admirable in matter and in manner ; and we were not a little surprised to find a portion of the Boston teachers waging a war against it . Calm and temperate , but firm and vigorous , Mr. Mann seems admirably qualified for the post he occupies . Most heartily do we wish he may continue to hold it , so long as he will furnish us with such productions as the " Report . " True , his standard is high , very high ; but not at all higher than we need . Though , perhaps , not likely soon to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would much rather see the practice raised than the standard depressed . We found , indeed , some slight matters in the " Report , " from which to dissent , but felt inclindd on the whole to raise as loud and long a note in its favor as we could . Of his subsequent doings in reply to the Thirty-one , we have nothing to say . If on some points he appeared rather bitter and violent , it should be borne in mind , that he had no slight provocation ; and it must be confessed , we think , on all hands , that he has shown himself a man whom it is safer to conciliate than to irritate . That the whole subject of education should be despatched in a single article , probably is not expected , certainly is not promised . For , should we attempt to go over so much space in so little * Seventh Annual Report of the Secretary of the Board of Education . Boston : March 1 , 1844 . Remarks on the Seventh Annual Report of the HON. HORACE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston : Little &amp; Brown , 1844 . Reply to the " Remarks " of Thirty-one Boston School-masters on the Seventh Annual Report , * , c . By HORACE MANN , Secretary of the Board . Boston : Fowle &amp; Capen // time , we would not go into any of it ; and as we intend to urge the precept of going into things , we ought , if possible , to avoid the example of going over them . That our readers may not indulge the anticipation of novelties , we beg to assure them in the outset , that we mean to re-collect and re-present the oldest truths we can find . Education is one of the few subjects whose acknowledged greatness comparatively excludes them from our thoughts , and whose very triteness denies them a just appreciation . The least understood , perhaps , of all subjects save religion , people think they understand it so well that they can hardly be induced to reflect upon it . As is often the case with the Bible , we seem to have read the subject into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we know nothing whatever about it . The chief danger now appears to be , that its advocates will eat it out of house and home ; that its physicians will doctor it to death ; for , that we are fast killing it with kindness , that we are nursing and petting it into a premature grave , is a fact too obvious to need remark . Temples are daily erected and priesthoods established for it ; nay , our efforts to build prevent our becoming temples for it ; and our enthusiasm in its deification would seem to argue its decease . It is with no little shame , therefore , that we venture to open our mouth upon the subject ; and our only apology for speaking is , the alAuiost universal practice , in which we have ourselves been educated , of praising it , and neglecting it . To declaim on the advantages of education were , indeed , an easy matter , and , probably , no less useless than easy ; but to set forth the means by which it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be styled the creator of all that is peculiar to our being ; the inspirer of all our distinctive attributes . Gifted , ludeed , with the germs of a rational soul , it is yet education that must breathe into those germs the breath of life , and spread them forth in graceful development . Like the air we breathe , it is the very life of our being ; like the air we breathe , too , its worth can not be adequately felt , till we venture out of its presence . All nature lays herself under voluntary tribute in its favor ; there is not an object in the universe without us , there is not a principle in the universe within us , but contributes a testifying voice to its importance . Without it , man is scarcely superior to the brutes ; with it , he becomes scarcely inferior to angels . Chained to earth with his body , education may yet bring his soul to touch heaven . Without it , we exist but among material things and palpable forms , discerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to earthly appetites ; all nature seems speechless , soulless , meaningless ; spiritual darkness and spiritual silence brood over the face of creation . But education comes transforming and transfiguring all before us ; in her presence the whole creation becomes a divine apocalypse ; " Flowers laugh before her in their beds , And fragrance in her footing travels , " she hangs a whisper , a tale , or a song in the mouth of everything that surrounds us ; nature grows instinct with beauty and life at her touch ; and all things wax eloquent of God . But it is not our purpose to spend time in mere encomia on a thing which all would be glad enough to have ; which it is so much easier to wish than to get ; and which is recommended to us alike by daily experience of its advantage and by the instinctive election of our nature . To furnish , if possible , some aids and inducements to get and to give what all are compelled to wish , is the task we have set ourselves . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , our design requires us to be as practical as we can . Our task , though selfimposed , is one for which we truly feel our inadequacy ; but we are sure that the integrity of our purpose will amply compensate us for the feebleness of our performance . Of laborers and of writers in the field of education there is certainly at present no deficiency ; but the misfortune is , that the study and practice of it are seldom found together . For most part , those who act think not , and those who think act not ; so that we have either mere speculation without experience , or mere labor without reflection . Now , if instruction were a mere mechanical affair , requiring only a few intellectual artizans to devise the machinery , and then a stream of physical labor to keep it in motion , all this might do ; but such , it seems to us , is not quite the case . What we more // particularly need is , a code of instruction setting forth the combined results of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most other things , true wisdom is the offspring of both . It is only from experience suggesting the thought , and thought shaping the means , and practice approving the thought , that any legitimate results are to be expected . It is necessary , not only that each one should have an idea of his own to translate into action , but that each should translate it into action for himself ; for while his means must be carefully suited to his patients , his plan must also be suited to himself . In short , it is only by reflection adapting itself to practical exigencies , and by action embodying and testing the results of reflection , that any genuine fruit is to be produced . Many have indeed written with great beauty and fluency ; have even conquered , in theory , whole provinces of ignorance and vice ; for in the world of mere speculation all things are not only possible , but easy ; but if they were to encounter its real difficulties , they would doubtless find how much easier it is to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out into the world and perform their own instructions . But without stopping to dwell on such considerations , we shall proceed to suggest , as well as we may , some practical observations in regard to getting and giving instruction . Now , in our ideas and plans of education , it is to be feared that we are apt to make an undue division and distribution of labor . We seem , often , to regard the student as having various independent susceptibilities , which may be best developed and disciplined in succession . Hence , we suppose his several endowments to have each its appropriate teacher and school ; and assume that we even draw out his nature faster and better , by talking to but one endowment at a time . We therefore address our instruction to but one side of his nature at once , and aim to complete his education on a sort of rotatory scheme . Assuredly , no mistake can be greater or more fatal than this . Such a course is repugnant alike to nature and to sound philosophy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying out nature , as trying to supersede and dispense with her . It not only does not educate , indeed , but altogether miseducates , inasmuch as it destroys the very harmony and equilibrium of being from which all true wisdom springs , and which it is the aim of all true education to produce . Such a school , in short , rather shuts pupils up away from instruction , than shuts them up with it ; we had better send them out into the fields and woods , and leave them to the unassisted influence of nature . Considered as the subject of education , man is not made up of parts , to be addressed in succession ; he is an unity , a whole . The mind is not a mixture , or mechanism of spiritual susceptibilities , but an individual concrescence ; and the just development of any one susceptibility implies a corresponding development of all the others . Intellectual , moral , social , and religious endowments , do not refer to different elements of a compound substance , but to the same individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , to duty , now , to society , and now , to them all together . The chief worth of education undoubtedly consists in its forming or promoting the well-being of its subject ; and his well-being in every capacity is inseparable , even in idea , from his well-being in any capacity . He is not created , and is not to be regenerated ,  --  is not lost , and is not to be saved , by parts and parcels , and therefore is not to be developed and cultivated by parts and parcels , any more than a bird , or a plant . Even the head will never work to any good purpose , unless constantly supplied with warmth from the heart : educate the former into isolation , and it will freeze up . By a partial and onesided culture , a man may , indeed , contribut.e to the economical well-being of society ; but that his own well-being is , or can be , thus secured , is entirely out of the question . Mere economists and financiers doubtless have their value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a shameful abuse of terms , to call them intelligent men . We often speak of reason and imagination , for example , as incompatible with each other . This , we suspect , is a pretty sure sign that we lack them both ; for , in our present state of being , neither can exist and act without the other . Many people seem to think all knowledge consists in acquiring and using certain abstract ideas . But the truth is , this is no knowledge at all , for God and nature // give us no such things to study . They are but the spider's-web of our own brain , and those who employ their minds in spinning them generally stumble over them into perdition . The more we think , without humility , and reverence , and love , the further shall we go astray . It is like using our eyes without light ; in which case , they only see phantoms , and thus make fools of us . Mere logicians and abstractionists , like Mr. ilume , may indeed become very popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such men can no more distinguish between a martyred saint and an executed criminal , between one dying for the truth , and one dying by the truth , than a man without eyes or ears can distinguish between colors and sounds and whenever they attempt to speak on such subjects , they can not choose but lie . Those people who , in the pride and arrogance of modern illumination , are perpetually kicking up such a hubbub of logic , and constructing their Babel-tower of syllogisms , and packing men off to one place and another on railroads of moral , and political , and theological doxies and abstractions we very much doubt whether they truly know anything . If they had any true knowledge of things , would they be so desperately love-sick for certain abstract ideas ? If they really saw anything out of themselves , would they have so much confidence in themselves ? Do not the cobwebs , which they are for ever spinning out of their minds , blur their vision , so as to prevent their seeing anything , or , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made ? Would not the least particle of true wisdom drive out of them that contempt and arrogance that so dilates and gigantifies them If we do not wish to be befooled out of what little wit we have , had we not better make haste to cork our ears with our fingers , and take ourselves out of their way , whatever righteous judgments and holy indignations it may please their sweet voices to utter respecting us ? But we digress . It is idle , then , to talk of an intellectual school , of a moral school , of a social schoA , of a religious school , and of a corresponding division of the duties and functions of a teacher . Each school must be all , and all schools must be each . Each study must be all , and all studies must be each . It is only in virtue of all these relations , that a teacher is to succeed in any one of them . It is only by addressing himself to every endowment at once , that he is to speak successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our whole nature ; everything is to be studied with our whole nature . Can the brain perform its functions without the heart , or the heart , without the lungs , as the lungs , without the brain ? Does not the successful operation of each depend upon the constant co-operation of them all ? Why do we not analyze our food before we eat it , and then take the constituent elements by themselves , at such times and in such portions as convenience or physical science may prescribe ? The answer of course is , nature has so made our bodies , that each organ requires all the elements , and all the organs requires each element of our food ; and that , if all the constituents be taken together as nature furnishes them , then each organ will perform its office , and receive its share , according to the laws of system . Nay , it requires the harmonious co-operation of all the organs , to digest and assimilate the food for each . If , then , we take materials to make flesh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course neither will be made ; and our skill in gastronomy will stop our gastronomising . As nature feeds and exercises all the organs of the body at once , so instruction should feed and exercise all the faculties of the mind at once ; and if the food for either be decomposed into its constituent elements , it can only be taken as medicine , relished , perhaps , by a diseased taste , but loathed by a healthy one . It is for this reason , doubtless , that those minds which are most in love with nature as she is , often have the least relish for her when analyzed into scientific abstractions . Such minds instinctively reject the anatomies of science , and cleave to the living forms of nature , because of their very wholeness and healthiness . To be a true teacher , therefore , requires a whole man . Clear visions , warm sympathies , noble passions , and lofty purposes ; the whole mind , and heart , and soul , and body ; all , in short , that goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman , should be present and active in each // and every part of the work : and the less he smells of the closet , or the office , or the pulpit , or the school-room ,  --  of anything , indeed , but heaven , and nature , and humanity , the more instinctive will be his instructions . He , who brings only a book , a voice , a sceptre , and a piece of cerebral clock-work into the school-room , can never truly teach anything , because he does not truly know anything . He may act upon the mind as an external force , but he can not act within it , so as to develope it and all his instructions will but tend to crush and deform it into angularity . A teacher should stand before his pupils , as at once the subject and the object of all the feelings and faculties that enter into the idea of manhood . He should be to them a breathing revelation of humanity , in the recognition of which they are themselves to grow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much by virtue of what he knows and says , as by virtue of what he is . Mere learning , mere competency as a scholar , though indispensable , is by no means enough . Himself is the matter to he communicated ; his learning is but the means of communication , and indispensable only as a means . He is not to use himself as an instrument to impart what he knows , but use what he knows as an instrument to impart himself . To communicate life and inspiration to the mind , is the thing ; the mere communication of diagrams , and theorems , and syllogisms , is nothing . In short , all true instruction is but forming and perfecting a mutual acquaintance ; a process in which each tries to reproduce himself in the other , and reproduce the other in himself . Hence the necessity , that the teacher should be able to touch the pupil 's mind on all sides at once ; or rather , to touch the centre , and through this diffuse his influence over the whole ; as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire plant at once , and not by acting on each petal in succession . Without the respect and love of the pupil , he can not get access to his mind ; without access to his mind he can not get his respect and love ; in a word , he must have access to the whole at once , or he can have access to none at all . All our plans , then , of instruction are worthless , unless they aim , as far as they go , at the harmonious and simul taneous development and culture of our whole nature . The truth is , a human being is not be raised out of the region of ignorance and debasement by fragments and sections ; as far as he is raised at all , his whole being must be raised at once ; and all attempts to raise him otherwise will but tend to pull him asunder . In this matter , division is destruction ; it is as if the brain , the heart , and the lungs should perform their several functions apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of all , that each continues to exist . To intruct , is , to perform the highest duty of one intelligent being to another intelligent being , on grounds of common sympathy , and from feelings of mutual affection . Teaching is the exercise of benevolence in imparting knowledge from a sense of duty , or the discharge of duty in imparting knowledge from a principle of love we care not how you have it , but it must be all in each , and each in all , or it can be truly nothing . But there is , probably , no point in which this position is better verified than in the obvious necessity of subordination and respectful submission to a teacher . To load down a teacher with responsibilities , and yet withhold from him the authority requisite to their dis . charge , is almost as common as it is *preposterous . The great strife , among us democrats , is , to secure our right , without doing our duties ; to realize the benefits of government , without being governed . Impatient of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subordination ; and are everywhere trying to substitute convictions of interest for sentiments of loyalty and reverence . We are like Gonzalo in the play , the latter end of whose commonwealth forgets the beginning ; we will have no sovereignty , and yet we will all be kings . Now , to be above or beyond the control of a teacher , is , simply , to be above or beyond his instruction ; for it is perfectly natural that pupils should conceive themselves wiser than their teacher , when they are encouraged or allowed to sit in judgment on his requisitions . Docility implies submissiveness , and upon indoci* lity all instruction is of course powerless . The mind must he humbled before it can be elevated ; the heart must be softened before it can be moulded . People can never rise until they look // up to something above them ; while looking up to themselves , their course is always downwards . Angels , so far as we know , have never fallen but once , and that was in an attempt at self-government . Democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be treated as democrats in boyhood , it is to he expected that they will turn devils in manhood . A self-governing school is , simply , a self-damning school . If men are ever to govern themselves , they must perforce be fir t taught to obey . Obedience to ourselves is but the renunciation of all obedience . If people be made coordinate with each other , they all become teachers , not teacher and pupils ; and bedlam springs up in the footsteps of our school-house democracy . No one can teach us , unless he be set over us ; if he set us over ourselves , we shall be sure to set ourselves over him . In short , we can never truly learn from a teacher , till we obey him ; we can never truly obey him , till we revere him ; we can never truly revere him , till we recognize his superiority ; and if that recognition c* unot be awakened in our minds , it most be awakened in our bodies . If we both obey and revere , We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e are slaves to him ; if we neither obey nor revere , we are Javes to the devil . I-Je*ce , too , in regard to the teacher , the manner and *pirit with which he enforces his authority , are no less important than the act of enforcement itself . To regard himself , or be regarded by his pul*ils , merely as the repository of power , is utterly subversive of the very respect and loyalty which all true submission implies . His government must he known and felt to be a government of right , not one of might , and of might only in enforcement of right ; of principle , not of passion ; of practical equity , too , not of abstract legality ; and of living order , not of lifeless formality . The naked enforcement of order by threats and penalties is alike vicious and impotent . The capricious or gratuitous exercise of power can not be too severely censured , or too studiously avoided ; it mars the sense of right , without producing the e ect of order . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ready to give liberties than to take them ; to meet the obligations upon him , than to enforce the obligations to him : and , above all , he must avoid any ostentation of conscience ; for there VOL. xvI. - *o . LXXXIII. is probably nothing that youth are so quick to perceive , so slow to forget , and so sure to despise , as moral coxcombery . The moralistic and pietistic cant of the present day , is the last thing that ought to have any place in the world ; and the school-room is the last place in the world where it ought to be practised . The whole system , indeed , of administration should be pervaded by a spirit of humanity and conscientiousness . Every act of enforcement must derive its sanction and its efficacy from an obviously paramount , yet unostentatious , sense of duty . He , who strikes one blow from a severe sense of duty , and then turns away to hide his grief for the pain or disgrace he has been obliged to inflict , will scarcely need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is best to treat pupils as if we thought they had souls . It is true , they may not always have them ; but by treating them as if they had , we may reasonably hope to developo souls in them ; while , by treating them as if they had none , we shall he sure to kill all the germs of soul out of them . Doubtless , the worst of all governments is that which only acts upoa them , not within them ; which gives them all to dread , and nothing to venew te : and the next worst is that which dis sins to act upon them , in order to act within them ; for , whether pupils h*vo souls or not , they certainly have bodies ; and treatino ' them as if they had no bodies is nearly as had as treatin. them as if they had no souls . To reason with a pupil , is but to compromise with his self-will ; the surest way to confirm the very disobedience which needs to be subdued . No one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all attempts to reason him into it only tend to strengthen him against it . If it be said that pupils are rational beings , our answer is , they are not rational beings , until thef obey ; if they were , they would not need to be reasoned into submission . In the school-room , or the nursery , an ounce of birch is always worth a ton of logic . That there is danger in using the former , is admitted ; that there is more danger in refusing it , a very wise man once asserted and a very wise age is now demonstrating . The truth is , people may a well be destroyed in their youth , as be educated into grown-up destructives ; they may as well be burnt up in the egg , as hatched out into walking firebrands. 33 // The modern notion , that , whether as pupils , or as citizens , we are to obey orders , as according with our sense of right , and not as coming from our lawful governors , is alike false in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine of democracy , then we , for one , have small care for democracy . By thus inviting pupils to sit in judgment on their duties , we foster a pride of understanding , a sort of intellectual self-sufficingness , that is equally at war with growth in knowledge , and with growth in virtue . Government , from its very nature , involves something which the forms of logic can not convey , and the understanding can not receive ; and of which the whip is a far better expression than all the syllogisms in creation . And the notion , that a teacher , or a parent , should enforce his orders by love , is nearly as had as the notion that he should enforce them by logic . The truth is , it is time enough to show pupils our love , when they have obeyed ; while disobedient , we had better show them our authority . It may even be questioned whether pupils , while in a state of disobedience , are fit objects of love , and whether such untimely manifestations of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather too much like dispensing with the natural conditions of love , and thus precluding the natural motives to obedience . It is often said , indeed , that by inflicting corporeal punishment , we break down a pupils self-respect . But if a pupil respects himself while obstinate and disobedient , the more pity for him , and the more whip for him , too . This is altogether a bastard self-respect-a self-respect that is incompatible with a respect for law and authority : and the quicker it is broken down , the better . Genuine self-respect always involves , or rather presupposes , a recognition and confession of what is above us ; is of a meek and submissive spirit ; and manifests itself in a generous loyalty , that fears , or rather scorns , to disobey . A stiff neck is sure proof of low thoughts ; and low bows are the truest signs of lofty conceptions . If pupils really respect themselves , they will not give a teacher occasion to mar their self-respect ; for , in this case , neither floggings , fondlings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often wickedly miscalled self-respect , which makes pupils selfwilled and insubmissive , is the same in kind that once turned angels into devils . Let it be crushed - Power , in short , is obviously a much better representative of authority than logic or love ; and the sense or sensation of power is often the best , sometimes the only , means to awaken a proper respect for authority . But the upshot of all these remarks touching discipline is , that a teacher must inspire reverence and love , in order to impart knowledge ; that he is to awaken these sentiments by being , himself , their object , and not by discoursing about them ; that the pupil 's heart must be subdued before his head can be instructed ; and that order is to be maintained , not by emotions of fear , nor by convictions of the understanding , but by true moral , nay , religious feelings of submissiveness , and by true social feelings of respectfulness . It is by thus addressing and interesting all the susceptibilities , moral , social , religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all upon himself as their object , that a teacher is to instruct : and he may be assured , that whatever susceptibilities he does not take along with him , will pull against him ; that whatever powers he may awaken , unless he awaken them all , will be thwarted by those which he leaves asleep . But we have doubtless said enough on this subject , and will therefore pass to another topic . Whether the pride and arrogance of modern illumination have fulfilled , or are fulfilling all their promises to the world , may , we think , admit of serious doubt . In education we have certainly had illuminators enough ; but , unfortunately , the places they have visited are not , it is believed , much the better for ' their visits . In spite of all our modern march-of-intellect , we can not help thinking , that there are some very old truths which are really none the worse for their age ; that what has been long tried and found successful , brings some proof of excellence ; that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of merit , in using the retrospective , than in using the inventive faculties ; that , on such subjects as religion , and morality , and education , whatever is wholly new , must be wholly or mostly false , and therefore false , even because it is new ; and that , after all , it is no mark of wisdom , " to presume that they perforce must go astray , who tread the footsteps of their sires . " There is really more // true intellectual progress , as well as more virtue , in the humility that consents to err along with the past , than in the superiority that presumes to dispense with it . The surest way to build higher than our fathers did , is by continuing the structures which they began ; if we tear down their structures , and begin anew , ten chances to one we shall not build so high as they did . If we can not find any wisdom in them , it behooves us to inquire whether we have any eyes to find it with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the remark , that all ages have complained of their own degeneracy . In thinking themselves worse than their fathers , other ages have given some proof they were better ; in thinking itself better than its fathers , this age only gives proof that it is worse . Assuredly , if we have any reverence at all , we shall show it towards the past ; if we have no reverence , then , indeed , we are as low as we can be , and all our knowledge will but puff us up , not raise us up . We are aware that almost everything is subject to the freaks and caprices of fashion ; but that religion and education may be saved from her tender mercies , seems a consummation devoutly to be wished . Without either much of respect , or much of contempt for most modern inventions , we can not help thinking that the system which God and nature have been teaching , and which experience has been testing for centuries , has some claims to our confidence , which many more recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trumpery , our knowledge-factories , and teaching-jennies , instruction is still , to us , the same mysterious communing of knowledge with ignorance , that it used to be . An intellectual railroad or turnpike , aircraft , or water-craft , were an improvement which we have not even the hope of living to see effected . Leaving , therefore , our modern , cunningly-devised , vehicular swiltsures to such as prefer them , we are very well content to trudge , trudge , trudge along , in the good old way ; and have only to say to all such spiritual space-annihilators , nay , annihilate us none of your annihilations ; you may be from heaven , and you may be from Tuphet ; but your speed argues your course to be downwards through Duncedom to Nowhere , or to a worse place ; so , please take yourself along , lest you get belated , and leave us to tread in the path our fathers trod , and go to the place where they have gone . The best apparatus that we know of for instructing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , and gushing with the spirit of love : if this be present , instruction will be gixen , whether we have any apparatus or not ; if this be wanting , instruction will not be given , and all the apparatus in creation will not avail us a straw . As for you , Mr. Space-annihilator , you may , for aught we know , have such a soul ; but you look , and smell , and puff mightily like some infernal machine . If you were stripped of all this noisy rigging and gearing , wherewith you have rigged and geared yourself , we could see whether you have any soul ; but as you are , we can not even see the place where the soul ought to be : and we hugely suspect you have rigged and geared yourself only to hide your want of a soul . But the practical results of our so much boasted improvements may he best seen , we apprehend , in the prevailing and , perhaps , growing tendency , to regard the surface rather than the depth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , the offspring of a vain attempt to realize a vain expectation . In everything we grow impatient of delay , and clamorous. for immediate results . Despatch is everywhere the order of the day ; we must have everything done with despatch . We must , therefore , have education done with despatch ; and the teacher , instead of exposing to us the folly of our wishes , invents , or adopts some system ( of mnemotechny , for example ) , and goes to work to realize them for us . Butfinding , as of course he must find , if he have half an eye , the method . of despatch impracticable in his sphere* he proceeds to substitute the show of knowledge for the reality ; and hence we have surface unsupported by substance . But , surely , it must be good ; it has been done with despatch ; in everything else despatch is evidence of goodness ; and why not , then , in education ? We answer , simply because it is evidence of badness . We want no more proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been done with despatch .

It were well to rememher , that by inflating people , till they rise from their own levity , we prepare the . for exposure , not for exhihition . There are certainly buhbles enough in this world , without teachers blowing up any . The truth is , the minds of people seem possessed by some vague scheme of spiritual m*chanics , or intellectual steam-engine possibilities . The idea of a locomotive or aerial-steamboat passage from the Limbo of Ignorance to the celestial city of Wisdom , or at least to the stump or the rostrum of Vanity Fair , is so grateful to their indolence , and so alleviating to their purses , that they must perforce accept it ; and the afflatns , celestial or infernal , with which it inspires them , transports them away from seeing or suspecting its utter futility . Instruction , therefore , seems to them but a sort of cunning mechanical process , and intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastened and cheapened indefinitely , by mechanical shill and contrivance . Now , we deem it our duty to admonish people that our fierce , hut fruitless endeavors to realize some such scheme , have nearly or quite demonstrated that the thing is impracticable ; or that , at least , nothing short of a few more Bacons and Lut.heran Reformations can possibly realize it for us . Our best way , therefore , for the present is , to go to work , one and all , in the good old way , and try first to raise up a few more Bacons and Luthers ; and if they should not work out the desired invention , the fact that the old way can produce such men , will prove , perhaps , that it is good coon h for us . Why do not our modern systems , if they be so much more divine than the old , as is pretended , give us some more such inca ? 1-las nature ceased to do her part ? Pe . haps , then , cc has been playing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispense with her , has determined to p*ague us , by letting us have our way . T he gods , we read , to cure our wilfulness , sometimes punish us with our own choice . But seriously , it is passing strange , that people will not r*st , once for all , in the very plain truth that education is not a manufacture , but a development ; that the human mind is not a piece of mechanism , but an organic growth ; a growth which may , indeed , be facilitated and perfected by art , but which can no more he wrought out by time-and-labor-saving machinery than a tree or a horse ; and that every attempt thus to fahricate it must perforce end in mere deceptive and worthless appearance . As might be expected , however , the result of this wasting haste , or hastening waste , or both , is , that various things are constantly attempted to be taught , before the faculties , to which they are addressed , are or can be unfolded . // Nothing is more common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong almost exclusively to the reflective and constructive powers , to be passed over before those powers can possibly have burst their shells . Probably no science , for example , has less to do with the memory than the science of numbers : and yet it is almost universally despatched when the pupil has no faculty hut the memory to study it with . The consequence of course is , that the study , instead of being a clear , active intuition or intellection of mathematical truth , is but a blind , passive reception of verbal furmularies into the memory , each pushing out the one that preceded it , and to be pushed out , in turn , by the one that follows it ; so that when the pupil has completed a given circle , he has hut to turn back and repeat the process , with just as much benefit and a little more ease than at first . The truth is , we might just about as well attempt to distinguish sounds by the eye , or colors by the ear , as to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this science , the mind can make no true progress whatever , except by insight and construction ; it must proceed by an evolution of principles , not by an exercise of memory . Indeed , the very idea of progress , here , involves the construction , not merely the application , of formularies . The mind , therefore , must , itself , give out the light by which it sees , and put forth the strength by which it moves ; and a formal application of rules can no more teach us the thing , than riding behind a locomotive can teach us how to build one . A set of formularies lodged in the memory , are as dark and dead as the ink they are printed with , until pervaded with the light and life of the student 's mind ; or rather , they are like a looking-glass in the dark , which offers resistance indeed to the touch , but no image to the eye or object to the mind . This repeating of a process , without originating or even understanding it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it . Nay , your formularies are not so much a medium as a substitute for insight ; stifle , rather than stimulate , the reflective and constructive powers . For as we do not turn our eyes back when we wish to go ahead , so we generally stop going ahead when cur eyes are turned back ; our very efforts at recollection naturally blur and confuse our vision . In short , remembered for mularies are to a mathematical student , much the same as floating straws to a drowning man ; they afford him no help , while , at the same time , they divert his attention from things that would . Every one , who has ever thought at all , knows there are no two things more different than knowledge and remembrance ; for what we merely remember we may easily forget ; but what we once truly know , beccmes a part of our being , so that we can no more forget it than we can escape from ourselves . It seems plain enougl* , indeed , that however swift one moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; while he who moves in a straight line can not go so slow but that some progress will be made . Nevertheless , the former thinks he advances ; for he is conscious of motion enough , and knows there is great pawing of dirt or puffing of steam ; and he seems to himself to devour the road before him . But the important fact which escapes his knowledge is , that his road is always returning upon itself . Nay , he has not time even to form sufficient acquaintance with the objects he meets , to recognize them when he comes round to them again . Impressions rush on and rush off in rapid succession ; the very wind which his speed creates , blows them out as fast as they are made ; or rather , his velocity of movement blends and confuses them all into vagueness , so that he takes up no distinct impression at all . It is so with the student who is hurried round through a set of arithmetical formularies without insight of their contents , or even the faculty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their results , by the exercise of his constructive powers , hut only a manufacture of results , without any intehlection of their principles at all . He does not mechanize , but only turns and tends the machine which another has made . Now , we speak from the very best authority , when we say it is altogether more difficult to teach a pupil the science of numbers , after he has thus gone several times round the usual circle of formularies , than if he had never seen a formulary at all . For , to him the sens*ti6n of motion has come to be the only evidence of progress . Accustomed to proceed without insight and construction , he is of course impatient of the effort and delay necessary to attain // them . His mind has got thoroughly vitiated with the idea , that he has nothing to do with principles and processes , hut only to manufacture a quantity of results . With your formularies floating like straws in his mind , he can neither help catching at them , nor get any aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusting to memory and going by rote , lies like an incubus on his reflective and constructive powers ; and it is next to impossible for him to realize the need of thinking into and thinking through that which he has so often done without thought . He has acquired , perhaps , a sort of mental dexterity ; but his acquisition has only blocked up the inlet of real knowledge . But a still more vicious substitution of faculties is involved in our constant efforts to make certain things intelligible to the understanding , of which the understanding is not legitimately cognizant . We are perpetually sending pupils to the understanding for answers which they can not find there , and ouo*ht not to seek there . The result is , tha*'t the questions remain , either without any solutions at all , or , what is still worse , with false solutions . Questioned for a morality , or a religion , the understanding , if it answer at all , gives but a sort of prudential foresight and selfregard , which is the very reverse of religion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not competent to originate laws , but must , itself , receive them from higher , or , at least , cocrdinate faculties . Virtue and religion are not acquisitions , but developments ; not something to he taken in from without by the understanding , but something to be unfolded from within . Contrivance , say our natural theologists , proves design , and therefore , a designer . Yes but the very question is , whether there be any contrivance . They might as well say , contrivance proves a contriving , and therefore a contriver ; which is hut an identical proposition ; that is , one whose subject assumes its predicate , not proves it . Grant the existence of a designer , and of course , all things prove it , but it is impossible to prove it to the understanding without first assuming it . It is like going to visible things to prove the existence of light , while it is that very light that renders them visible . To one who has eyes , its existence needs no proof , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The idea of God is a development from within , and a matter of faith , not an induction from without , and a matter of proof . When Christianity has developed its correlative principles within us , then we find evidence of its truth everywhere ; nature is full of them : hut we can not find them before , simply because we have no eye to find them with . The irreverent man of course sees nothing around him to revere , because he has nothing within him to see it with ; and to reason with him ahout it , is like dissecting eyes before a blind man . To the man of mere understanding , God himself is not a being to worship , hut only a sort of omnipotent diagram , to reason , and speculate , and syllogize about . But let the principle of reverence he unfolded within him and he finds something to revere everywhere , and your reasoning at once becomes superfluous . The same may be said respecting our perception of the beautiful . It is the development of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that brings us to see and feel the beauty of things . Hence , as Bishop Taylor says , with characteristic felicity , it is impossible , on these subjects , to make men understand their ignorance ; for it requires knowledge to perceive it ; and therefore he that can perceive it hath it not . It is of course useless to talk to the ear ahout colors , the ear can not possibly distinguish color from sound . And it is equally useless to talk to the mere understanding about virtue ; the under .. standing can not distinguish virtue from prudence . In like manner , abstract reasonings on religion , whether in the shape of natural theology or of orthodox divinity , can afford us little or no help . They may , indeed , be valuable as science , but for all religions effect , they are like eating theological paper , and drinking theological ink ; and might just about as well be addressed to the digestive as to the logical powers . The defect is not in the object , but in the percipient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fault from himself to the object . This trying to give and get a knowledge of everything through the understanding is undoubtedly the deepest and fatalest vice in modern education . Ever // since our boyhood we have been accustomed to hear people say ; But we want more religious and moral education ; we have intellectual education enough already . They therefore go to work with all their might , to manufacture morality and religion into scientific svstems , addressed to the mere understanding , and only aggravate the very evil they seek to remedy . In thus attempting to teach , through one faculty , what is addressed to another faculty , we spoil both the mind studying and the subject studied . In vain do we labor to syltogize a pupil into the perception of beauty ; he must be developed into the perception of it , and all our syllogisms but tend to convince him that no such thing exists . Even the understanding itself is thus perverted by giving it authority out of its sphere . Cognizant only of outward tendencies and consequences , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nor religion , but only the political economy of a future state . Morality and religion , like beauty , are intelligible only to the inward principles preconfigured to their influences ; and they must first quicken and unfold these principles within us , before we can truly know and receive them . In short , they all require special developments , and can not possibly be understood by the same faculty to which political economy is addressed , until they are , themselves , turned into political economy . Nothing , therefore , can be worse , than sending people to the understanding for a knowledge of them ; for it leads them to expect satisfaction from a source that can never give it , and thus tends to make them either honest sceptics , or , what is far worse , ignorant or insincere believers . Now , nature and revelation , in their concrete , organic forms and transpirations , have elements and qualities corresponding to all these inward susceptibilities . They nowhere offer us abstractions for the exercise of the understanding alone , or of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always speaking to all our faculties , to our whole nature , at once . A true knowledge of them , therefore , requires , and a true study of them , as they are , will ultimately effect , an harmonious development of all their correlative principles within us . Indeed , the crowning excellence of the Bible is , that , instead of giving us abstract notions and propositions respecting justification and redemption , for us to reason and speculate about ; it bodies forth in facts and figures a Justifier and a Redeemer , as the object of faith and love ,  --  the object , indeed , of everything good , and the antidote of everything bad , within us . Hence it is , that the old poetry , and painting , and architecture were so much better teachers of religion , than our modern theologies . Presenting the truths of Christianity , not in their lifeless elements , but in their vital concrescence or consubstantiation , they thus ensured catholicity and completeness of impression . It is for this reason , too , that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implies a knowledge of them all . Such a knowledge involves the development and exercise of all our faculties and susceptibilities . The perception of beautyand sacredness in one thing awakens within us the power to perceive them in everything ; so that , from being non-existences , they pass into omnipresences , to us . We may thus learn each thing in all , and alt things in each , and make every object a sort of panopticon , in which we may behold , and enjoy the boundless opulence of creation . But by dissecting , and analyzing , and manufacturing nature and revelation into abstract , scientific systems , we disrobe and denude them of all instruction but what is addressed to the understanding . To analyze and botanize a flower , is , to destroy , not develope , its meaning . By the time we have cut open the bird , to find the why , the how , and the whence of its singing , the divine musician has taken its flight ; our s* crilegious inquest but scares away the object of our search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for something to relieve , and , by relieving , increase , a sort of itching or lusting of the brain . It is thus that we make fools of ourelves , by first conceiving ourselves xv*ser than nature , and by attempting to improve upon her instructions . Weclaini to have conquered nature , to have broken and harnessed her into our service ; and we have become but the slaves of our own conquests . We are prodigal sons ; we must return to nature , and humble ourselves before her ; for we may be assured that she will never truly serve us but on condition that we first obey her . But perhaps the absurdest thing of all is , the time and manner in which intellectual // philosophy is attempted to be taught . Books of metaphysics , books addressed almost exclusively to the reflective powers , are put into the hands of youth , before even the perceptive powers are developed ; when they have no power to reflect , nor any anything to reflect upon . We thus set them to watching their mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we make them turn their eyes inward , to gaze upon-nothing . This , truly , is like trying to develope the flower , before the stalk is grown ;  --  the surest way , of course , to spoil them both . Now , intellectual science , in so far as itis genuine , is obviously hut a sort of universal portrait of the human mind . Its study , therefore , is utterly worthless , unless it involve a constant comparison of the picture with the student 's inward original ; and yet it is attempted to he studied when that original is comparatively undeveloped . In short , it is simply an effort to bring forth into consciousness the laws and activities of the mind before they are fully awakened into life . The very obvious fact , obvious , at least , to all hut those who are most bound to know it , is , that the intellectualfaculties and processes are first unfolded by external objects ; and that , until they are unfolded , introspection has nothing to lay hold of . All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so , that the mind can not gain a single idea of itself , its powers and operations , except through the medium of consciousness ; and that it can not he conscious of them until they are developed . Its reflex perceptions must of course follow , not precede , its direct perceptions ; it must perforce learn to work , before it can learn to perceive its workings . To say , therefore , that such books have no instruction for people at such an age , is not enough ; they have no meaning for them whatever . It is holding the mirror up to our inward being , when there is nothing but the mirror itself to be seen ; when we have no spiritual figure to be imaged therein , nor any eye to see it , if it were . The only thing we can learn from them , in this way and at this time , is , to marvel that such useless and meaningless books should ever have been written . The study , like our arithmetical formularies , is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal committing and repeating of certain expressions , without understanding them . But this effort to force a prematurity of reflection , in so far as it succeeds , can not be otherwise tLan unhappy upon the character of youth . We are apt to he interested quite enough in ourselves anyhow ; and our earlier years had better be spent in trying to interest us in something out of ourselves : otherwise we are in danger of drawi ngthe little button of self so near the eye as to shut out everything else . The longer we are kept unconscious of our mental faculties and processes , or even that we have any , the better it will be for us . The chief beauty and bliss of childhood are its tendency to self-oblivion , and absorption of mind in outward objects . In this " first Eden of our innocence , ** it is not ourselves , but the world , which seems to us newly born ; and we naturally forget ourselves in love and admiration of the beautiful and wonderful objects which seem everywhere springing up into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it does , from the very vividness and intensity of our perceptions and emotions , is the true " heaven that lies about us in our infancy ; " and is no less favorable to growth of mind than to purity of heart . To prolong this state of mind as far as is practicable , is alike the dictate of wisdom and of humanity . It is for this reason , that such books as Pilgrim 's Progress , Robinson Crusoe , Arabian Nights , and old English Ballads and Romances , are so much better than the moral and religious nursery and Sabbath-school hooks which have come to be substituted for them . The selfforgetting emotions of wonder , and love , and awe , which cluster around these marvellous old tales , areincomparably better than all the reflection and introversion , that childhood and youth can he forced or tortured to undergo . In this way , and in this way alone , may we hope to realize , in some degree , the beautiful picture , by Coleridge , " of pleasures lying upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhaled insensibly like the fragrance ; of dispositions stealing into the spirit like music from unknown quarters ; of images uncalled for , arid rising up like exhalations ; of hopes plucked like beautiful wild-flowers from the tombs that border the highways of antiquity , to make n garland for a living forehead : in a word , of miature as a. teacher of truth , through joy and&gt; // through gladness , and as a creatress of erything comes through them , not from the faculties by a process of smoothness them . and deliaht . " But there are other studies , equally qwq like flying for wings , instead of flying with them . Such an attempt , accordingly , is nowhere made . The little Philistines have nothing to do with these mighty Samsons , till their locks have been shorn off . Having no mouth to take in either the embodied soul , or the anatomized body , of the past , a sort of tertium quid is manufactured , to suit such mouth orrather such want of mouth , as they have . For in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not in the faculty , hut in the object of study . Instead of forcing memory up to the greatness of history , we force history down to the littleness of memory . Instead of raising us to a knowledge of individual men , or even the abstract ideas of men , it sinks them both into mere names , and dates , and events , which are really but the clippings of the beard , and parings of the nails , and castoff slough of the past . This , truly , is like going to the old clothes and shornoff locks of men , to learn their lives and character . It is thus that the mind is taught to dance in masquerade , and play at hide-and-seek among the empty eggshells of the past . Such are the transformations that are wrought in order to transform nurslings into sages . History is no longer a speaking picture of the myriad-souled past , nor would it answer our purpose if it were . It has been shorn of its beams , that it may illumi nate our darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disclose our want of eyes . The great drama of human life is shrunk to a mere puppetshow , to suit the scope of the nursery ; the master champion of human knowledge has dwindled into a doll of shreds and patches , to beguile the precious dreaming-time of life . No wonder thaf people lose their reverence for the past , when it is served up to them in such a shape ! Similar remarks might be made of various other studies which usually swell the catalogues of a pedagogic puffery , and inflate the sails of a pay-loving philanthropy . The radical vice of them all is , that they tend either to spoil the subjects studied , by shrinking them within their proper limits , or to spoil the mind studying by stretching it beyond its proper limits . If it be asked , when and how fast such studies ought to be pursued , the answer is , just as soon and as fast as they can be understood . Nay , the power of full comprehension should , no doubt , be , in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfolding and strengthening it , not oppressing or outstripping it . It was a favorite remark of Dr. Johnson 's " that to advance in small things , is far better than to stand still in great things . " It is by first doing what we can , that we gain strength and skill to do what we wish.
