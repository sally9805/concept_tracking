Gallagher , William D. ( William Davis ) , 1808-1894 : OUR EARLY DAYS . from Poems , in Selections from the poetical literature of the West ( 1841 ) Our EARLY DAYS !  --  How often back We turn on Life 's bewildering track , To where , o'er hill and valley , plays The sunlight of our early days ! A Boy !  --  my truant steps were seen Where streams were bright , and meadows green ; Where flow'rs , in beauty and perfume , Breath 'd ever of the Eden-bloom ,  --  And birds , abroad in the free wind , Sang , as they left the earth behind And wing 'd their joyous way above , Of Eden-peace , and Eden-love . That life was of the soul , as well As of the outward-visible ; And now , its streams are dry ; and sere , And brown , its meadows all appear ; Gone are its flow'rs ; its bird 's glad voice But seldom bids my heart rejoice ; And , like the mist as comes the day , Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torrent made The music which my soul obey 'd . To shun the crowded ways of men , And seek the old tradition 'd glen , Where , through the dim , uncertain light , Moved many an ever-changing sprite ,  --  Alone the splinter 'd crag to dare , While trooping shadows fill 'd the air , And quicken 'd fancy many a form Traced vaguely in the gathering storm ,  --  To tread the forest 's lone arcades , And dream of Sherwood 's peopled shades , And Windsor 's haunted ' alleys green ' ' Dingle ' and ' bosky bourn ' between , Till burst upon my raptured glance The whole wide realm of Old Romance : Such was the life I lived  --  a youth ! But vanish 'd , at the touch of Truth , And never to be known agen , Is all that made my being then . A Man !  --  the thirst for fame was mine , And bow 'd me at Ambition 's shrine , Among the votaries who have given Time , health , hope , peace  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when found , Is oftenest but an empty sound . And I have worshipp 'd !  --  even yet Mine eye is on the Idol set ; But it hath found so much to be But hollowness and mockery , That from its worship oft it turns To where a Light intenser burns , Before whose radiance , pure and warm , Ambition 's star must cease to charm . Our EARLY DAYS !  --  They haunt us ever  --  Bright star-gleams on Life 's silent river , Which pierce the shadows , deep and dun , That bar e'en manhood 's noonday sun . Gallagher , William D. ( William Davis ) , 1808-1894 : LINES TO A POETESS. from Poems , in Selections from the poetical literature of the West ( 1841 ) Lady  --  I know thee only Through the breathings of thy song , But my thought has often pictured thee The loveliest of the throng , Who , in our free , wild forest-land , Have knelt them at the shrine Of Eloquence and Poesy  --  The thrilling , the divine . The ever-verdant islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pilgrim-spots , Familiar unto thee ; And the flowers of immortal Thought That there unfading bloom , Thou hast their beauty at thy heart , Their brightness , their perfume . Along the blessed Heaven Thy spirit holds its way , In the starry radiance of the night , And the golden light of day ,  --  Its pinions flashing back the sheen Of those unclouded spheres , And its own wild music mingling With the angel-notes it hears . In the human heart already Thou hold'st an honored place , And there thou hast engraven things Which nothing can efface . Hold on , among Earth 's gifted , then ! Tread firm the paths of Fame ! And high , upon the heaven of Mind , Thou'lt write a deathless name . Gallagher , William D. ( William Davis ) , 1808-1894 : OLDEN MEMORIES . from Poems , in Selections from the poetical literature of the West ( 1841 ) There 's a voice from every bird , There ' s a tone in every tree , That recalls some burning word I have uttered when with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , There ' s a look in every cloud , That bears my thoughts afar Where thou rulest Fashion 's crowd . Every sweet and breathing flow'r That scents the twilight breeze , Hath a ministry and pow'r Over " Olden Memories : " Every ripple of the stream That goes singing on its way , Hath a tale of boyhood 's dream , And of manhood 's merry May . I have treasured every look , I have garnered every tone , Till my heart is like a book Fill 'd with memories alone : I have asked no higher bliss , ' Mid the world 's incessant din , Since our last hope died , than this  --  To dream of what hath been . And in the silence of the night , And ' mid the bustle of the day , Oft a vision glads my sight , And I wish it not away : But I wonder then if thou , In thy far and wedded home , Ever think'st of him who now To thy presence may not come .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
