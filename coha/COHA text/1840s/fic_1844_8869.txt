PREFACE . A beloved friend , with whom I wished to share the interest I feel in the mythic legends of our land , once read aloud with me , in the long autumn evenings in the country , a learned work upon the mythology of the ancient Scandinavians . As we read , her expression became more and more clouded with displeasure , and when we came to these words , ' Loke found the half-roasted heart of a witch , ' she threw the book from her indignantly , exclaiming , ' No , I can bear it no longer ; it is too disagreeable , too odious . ' ' And yet , ' I answered earnestly , ' there is a deep meaning in these sagas , great and touching interest if one  --  ' ' It may be so , ' cried my friend , somewhat impatiently , ' but if this meaning is ever to be comprehended by me , it must be presented under a different form . Write something , in which this hidden meaning shall be unfolded , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitably impressed by it . ' Laughing , I undertook the task , but as the shadows of past ages gathered round me , and the doubts and sorrows of those distant years became present to my soul , tears filled my eyes , and the work that was begun in mirth was accomplished in sadness . Three days after this conversation , the ' Bondmaid ' was written . I sent for my friend , and proposed to read it aloud to her . I began with saying , by way of preface , ' I have endeavored to place before you in this sketch , as in a visible picture , what our forefathers believed concerning gods and men ; concerning life and death , heaven and hell . Though in the morning of the world , as in that of the natural day , we see the shades of night still resting upon earth , yet is the sky tinged with a faint glow of eternal truth , harbinger of that sun which shall diffuse light and joy throughout the universe . ' My friend heard my preamble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always a hard trial to pass through , whenever I read any of my compositions to public the arbiter of our difference . My friend desires me to believe that no one can wish more sincerely than herself , that the fate of ' the Bondmaid ' may be a happy one . I assure my friend that no one can join in her good wishes with a warmer sympathy than does THE AUTHORESS . Frid . A Princess betrothed to king Dag . Kumba , Slave . Feima , Slave . Grimgerda , a Sorceress . A Ljus-Alf . ( Light-Alf , or Spirit of Light . ) A Svart-Alf . ( Black Alf . ) The scene is laid in a woody mountain region . The castle of a Viking rises among the cliffs . On one side is the sea , on the other a flower garden . Main text PART FIRST . SCENE I. Flower garden . Feima is tying up the flowers to their supports . Kumba waters them . FRID . Frid How clear and lovely is this early morning ! Amid the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sacred tree , End note 1 : 2Kb over whose spreading boughs the Nornas pour the waters from the holy well of Urda . Gently upon the flowers and leaves of earth descends the heavenly moisture . Bees draw it from the bosom of the flowers and offer up to man the precious juice that cheers in health and sickness . How beautiful , how kind are nature 's ways ! How great the goodness of the gods , who made this earth for man like a full honey-cup ! Glorious goes forth the sun upon his conquering path ! I greet thee , thou enlightener of all spirits ! thou in whose fires spirits of light and darkness , joined in love , prepare earth 's golden harvest ! How all glows , how all rejoices in the light of the Great Father 's eye ! End note 2 : 1Kb The Eternal One is light , is fire , Love too is fire ; a deathless flame , sprung from the All-father 's breast . Oh sun , thou image of his being ! thou warm and glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask thee to protect a flame as pure , as powerful as thine . A ray of thine own fire beams from the eye of Dag ; still clearer glows the bright flame in his heart ; he draws his lineage from the gods themselves ,  --  Protect him , guide him over the wide , stormy sea . Give his path light , give his arm strength and victory ! Lead back my hero to his fatherland , to his true bride , and , kneeling by his side , I will devote to thee a better offering , thou glorious lord of day ! ( Approaches Kumba and Feima . ) It is well , maidens . The garden is well cared for . The blooming beauty of the plants gladdens the eye and heart . Soon shall king Dag too see it , and reward your care . He sends you here by me , these marks of favor ; he will one day bestow yet richer gifts . Take this chain , Feima ; it shall adorn thee on thy bridal day . The same sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shine upon thy marriage with the faithful Hreimer . The cottage I have ordered to be built for you is ready . I will that you shall always stay with us . Thou , my Feima , shalt brew the fresh mead for the bridal banquet ; and call thou the good Disor to thy aid , that it be clear and sparkling . FEIMA . Feima ( Kneels and would kiss the feet of Frid . Frid extends her hand to her . ) Great is thy favor , princess . We will live and die for thee . How fair thy hand is , how white , how soft ! Only king Dag has hands as beautiful as thine . FRID . Frid More beautiful , Feima , for they are stronger . Kumba , thou art most dear to me of all my handmaidens . From childhood have we been together . Thou shalt be always near me ; take this golden ring . KUMBA . Kumba King 's daughter , it is not for me . FRID . Frid I give it to thee . KUMBA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should these fingers do with golden rings ? Keep thy gift , lady , I ask but for thy favor . FRID . Frid I keep it then ,  --  but for thy bridal day . I know well that Klur loves thee . Thou wilt not always be so harsh to him . It shall be his to place this ring upon thy finger . ( Kumba turns away . ) But , Kumba , if thou hast a wish , tell me , that I may grant it . I would have all happy . Ah , see , here blooms a rosebud . Welcome , thou harbinger of highest joy ! ' When the first roses bloom I shall be near thee . ' Thus wrote king Dag to me . Perhaps when these soft leaves have fully opened , my life 's joy too will bloom . Maidens , guard well the tender bud . You shall not have watched over it in vain . Kumba , in an hour , I shall need thee to attend me to the bath . KUMBA . Kumba Thou shalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard well my rosebud . SCENE II . KUMBA , FEIMA . FEIMA . Feima How good she is ! KUMBA . Kumba She is happy . FEIMA . Feima How stately and beautiful she is ! Well is she worthy of a great king 's love . Kumba , what dost thou ?  --  thou tearest the bud she bade us cherish ! KUMBA . Kumba She will have so many others ! FEIMA . Feima Oh , Kumba , that was ill done ! Should not her lightest wish be law to thee ? Thy mistress , thy benefactress ! KUMBA . Kumba I am her slave . FEIMA . Feima And yet is she so kind , so affable to thee . KUMBA . Kumba Upbraid me not ! My heart is sick . How gladly would I die ! FEIMA . Feima Die ? Wherefore ? KUMBA . Kumba I am a slave . FEIMA . Feima And had ever daughter of our race a happier lot than thine ? Has not the princess freed thee from all painful toil ? Hast thou not been with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handmaidens ? Has she not clothed thee better , fed thee better ? Hast thou not had free entrance to the palace halls ? Hast thou not learned there many things slaves are not used to know ? KUMBA . Kumba What thou callest good , I count as evil fortune . Why was I not left in the squalid hut , with poverty and toil , to teach myself to bear the wretched lot to which our race is born ? Why must a slave dwell in a king 's palace , and learn to compare herself with the noble ? Why must she learn to love the great , the beautiful , when her portion is with deformity and meanness ? Why must she gain knowledge which could only teach her to despair ? FEIMA . Feima Ah , thy proud heart alone has taught thee this . It is thy haughty spirit that has changed honey into poison . KUMBA . Kumba Frid too is proud .  --  Pride is no fault in her . FEIMA . Feima No , for her pride becomes her . Pride is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we are serfs . KUMBA . Kumba And yet , Feima , the sagas say , our race springs from a god , yes , the same god who later was the forefather of the proud race of Jarls . We are the elder born . Why do we creep in the dust , while they have lifted themselves even to the heaven of the gods ? FEIMA . Feima That I know not . But well I know it would ill become thee to wear Frid 's crown upon thy head , her golden girdle round thy waist , and walk with her proud step . KUMBA . Kumba Alas , I know it well . All that in her is beautiful , were laughable in me . Too truly I am Kumba . But it is even therefore I complain . Why was I thus ? FEIMA . Feima I know too that there is much of good , and much of gladness for us if we but tame our hearts and wishes . Does not the sun shine for us ? Do not the flowers bloom for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not huts to shelter , food to nourish us ? May we not , under a good lord 's protection , have husband and child , as good , as dear as those of nobles ? KUMBA . Kumba Slaves ! FEIMA . Feima Hreimer is a slave ; yes , his hand is brown and rough , but faithful and strong to labor . His heart is good , and his look tells me how dear I am to him . By his side shall I live happy and free from care ; we love each other , we love our lords , and know that they will never send us forth , or part our children from us . We desire no better lot than to live always in their service . KUMBA . Kumba Happy thou ! FEIMA . Feima The same happiness may be thine , if thou wilt ; Klur loves thee . KUMBA . Kumba No , no , speak not of him . FEIMA . Feima And , if thou wilt never listen to a lover , what happier lot than thus to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and see around thee proud nobles and their stately dames . Ah , that were happiness indeed ! KUMBA . Kumba Misery !  --  Feima , far to the north , in those wild wastes , where giants and fierce dragons have their home , there , amid the ice mountains , dwells a race not far above the brutes . Their dress is of the wild beasts ' skins , their dwellings , caves and rock-clefts , their speech a brutish sound . And yet , with this wild folk  --  on these bleak hills , should I be happier than here in a king 's daughter 's halls . FEIMA . Feima Thou wouldst live rather with these wretched outcasts , than here with the good , beautiful Frid ? Thou wouldst rather harbor in their caves , and hunt in their dark woods , than braid her golden hair and bathe her white feet in the silver basin ? KUMBA . Kumba I would so . FEIMA . Feima Strange !  --  and wherefore ? KUMBA . Kumba There I should be free . FEIMA . Feima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy here , dost thou not ask the princess for thy freedom ? She loves thee and would not deny thy prayer . Why dost thou remain where thou art wretched ? KUMBA . Kumba Ask me not . FEIMA . Feima Thou art strange . Thou wilt and thou wilt not . KUMBA . Kumba Alas , thus is it . My feet are bound to the earth that scorches them . FEIMA . Feima Poor sister ! I pity thee . KUMBA . Kumba Well mayst thou ! But the powers who formed the noble and the slave  --  who gave the one gold and the other dust  --  of them will I demand , if it was just thus to divide their gifts . FEIMA . Feima Kumba , tempt not the gods ! KUMBA . Kumba These gods who ask man 's homage for the useless gift of life  --  who demand praise and sacrifice for these earth sods , on which we spend our toil , for others  --  these will I declare unrighteous , selfish beings . FEIMA . Feima Cease , oh cease ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flash ; Kumba thou blasphemest ! KUMBA . Kumba And if , in my despair , I murmur and blaspheme , what then ? Soon  --  soon  --  shall I be silent in the mould ; soon shall the blaspheming spirit vanish like a mist-wreath in space , and be as if it had never been . But Valhalla 's songs of joy has it never troubled ; thither complaint and murmur never come  --  And when , in the Skald 's lays , the deeds of the mighty live deathlessly on earth , where then shall be the memorial of the slave ? Where the record of his virtues and his griefs ? Silently , under the weight of toil , he sinks to earth and is forgotten . Where is there justice for the slave , in heaven or on the earth ? In vain were we created ! FEIMA . Feima That I will not believe . Do not our holy sagas tell us that even for us there is another life ? KUMBA . Kumba See you the pale gray cloud that floats over the wasted heath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bornehither and thither by the wind ? There see you the slave 's after-life . See you the sun go forth upon his conquering path , warming and gladdening all with the glow of his inward blessedness ? See you the stars by night , radiant  --  calm  --  like throned kings  --  like blessed spirits in their halls of light ? There see you the deathless life of the hero , of the nobly born . Dark the slave 's life on earth ; darker the life beyond the grave . The poor come not to Odin ; the needy find in his wide halls no room . Only to the king , only to the hero who has borne through far lands his blood-dripping sword , open the sounding gates of Valhalla . For him the couch is decked , the goblet crowned , for him the Valkyrior pour the sparkling wine . Heaven 's joys are but for the strong , the fortunate of earth . FEIMA . Feima It is said though , that even slaves , who come in the train of great heroes , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king 's slaves kill themselves upon the bodies of their lords . KUMBA . Kumba Fools ! Yes , that they may toil for them there as here . Rightly do the Skalds call our race Uslingar ; miserable is our lot here , miserable in the gloomy halls of Hela . Bondage and toil await us there as here . And for those of us who have followed no lordly master upon earth  --  these no after life awaits  --  they have lived here in vain . FEIMA . Feima Ah , my heart tells me otherwise ; it tells me the gods will not forget the beings they have made . KUMBA . Kumba See you the worm in the dust , how the ants torture it and drag it on ? See how it writhes and struggles ! No , save it not ; though you free this a thousand still would suffer . Vain are thy struggles worm ! On , thy tormentors urge thee to the heap , the inglorious deathpile whence no flame shall rise . Soon shalt thou be as nothing .  --  Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods who mark them not , regard not us . Our destinies are like . FEIMA . Feima No , I will not believe it . Truly , shall those who have served here in faithfulness , hereafter dwell in peace and joy . Yet were it even so  --  KUMBA . Kumba And were it even so ? FEIMA . Feima From dust was I created . The goodness of the gods has given me life . I have seen the sun 's beauty , I have enjoyed the earth 's fruits , the water 's freshness , I have loved .  --  Should the gods one day withdraw from this dust the life they gave it , still will I bless them , and render up what I received from them , if not without regret , at least without a murmur . KUMBA . Kumba Shall I admire thee or despise thee ? FEIMA . Feima We are of small account . Then let us in humility acknowledge it . Humility alone gives the soul peace . Lay down thy proud thoughts , Kumba ; humble thyself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leave the courts of kings if there thou art not happy ; but go not forth among the wild people . Come to us , my sister ; Hreimer and I will love thee , tend thee , toil for thee . Choose for thyself a home , a mate ; clasp a child to thy bosom . My mother has told me that when she had borne me to the world , the world was light for her ; she would not have changed me for a king 's inheritance . See , even the brutes who are so much less than we , how they love , how they rejoice in their young . Be wife and mother , Kumba ; be good and happy . KUMBA . Kumba Fate stands beside the cradle and the bier , and no man shall deceive his destiny . I will not bring into this wretched world beings foredoomed to misery . FEIMA . Feima Hreimer and I are happy , yet are bondswomen 's children . KUMBA . Kumba My mother was the slave of queen Gunilda . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abject was her lot ,  --  yet would she willingly live on . My father was a freeborn man , who deemed it a light matter to forsake the woman who had loved him , the child to whom he had given being . I yet remember well a night  --  that night has darkened all my after life . A flame rose upward from a funeral pile  --  rose high even to heaven ; it was the funeral pile of queen Gunilda . My mother was with those who watched the fire . With others , who were tending it with her , she was cast living to the dreadful flames . The queen , they said , needed her servants in the other world . I stood among the people , yet a child , and heard my mother 's cries , and saw her fiery death . Fatherless , motherless , then went I forth , alone in the world ; and wandered through the woods , not knowing whither . Then people met me and took me back with them to Atle 's court . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and led me to the presence of the king . I answered truly all king Atle 's questions , and then he bade them scourge me till I bled , to punish , as he said , my want of duty . Thou , Feima , layst then on thy mother 's breast ; thou couldst not know the bitter wrongs I suffered . FEIMA . Feima But Frid , the beautiful daughter of king Atle 's brother , knew them . She asked thee of the king , and though scarce older than thyself was as a mother to thee . She sought to make amends to thee for all thy suffering . KUMBA . Kumba Then went I forth by night and watched the silent stars , the flitting clouds : I asked them of my mother 's fate ; I called her name and listened : mournfully the night-wind sighed over the heath  --  the mist chilled me with its damps  --  this was my only answer . FEIMA . Feima And can not all the blessings granted to thy youth , make thee forget the terrors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy mother 's soul lives happy in the sunshine that even now wraps thee in its warm embrace . Oh , that light might shine into thy soul  --  that life and thy own fate might look brighter to thee ! It is long since thou hast offered to the gods . Come , sister , let us seek the holy spring . Seest thou this silver penny ? King Dag once gave it to me . This will I offer up for thee . Do thou bear thither too some precious gift , that so the gods may favor us and grant our prayer . KUMBA . Kumba What would you I should ask ? FEIMA . Feima A pious , a contented spirit . KUMBA . Kumba Is my heart then so evil ? FEIMA . Feima Forgive me , sister , tho harsh word  --  indeed thou art not good . KUMBA . Kumba Thou sayest truly . And yet I could be good  --  would the gods listen to my prayers , Feima , I could be even pious . I too , like Frid , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it shall sting thee , and lay poison in the wound ; leave it its wings , its life among the flowers , and it shall draw and give forth only sweets . FEIMA . Feima And what then wouldst thou ask the gods to grant thee ? KUMBA . Kumba Beauty , high birth , wealth , and a hero 's love ; room in the halls of Odin after death , for me and for my race . FEIMA . Feima Kumba thou ravest  --  thy words are wild . Sister , I pity thee  --  thy heart is sick . Come , oh , come with me and bathe thy forehead with the holy water ; offer and pray with me in the still morning , before the tumult of the world begins , while yet the faintly whispered prayer can reach the ever listening car of Heimdall . KUMBA . Kumba I will not , sister . The prayers my heart sends up , would make thee tremble  --  would make the gods reject me . Thou art right , my soul is sick . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what shall I tell the princess when she shall ask me for her rosebud ? KUMBA . Kumba Tell her a cold northwind has blighted it . FEIMA . Feima Thou wilt not go with me ? KUMBA . Kumba No ! once more no ! leave me alone ! FEIMA . Feima Then will I go alone  --  Yet Hreimer gladly will go with me , and pray for our unhappy sister . ( Goes . ) SCENE III . KUMBA . Kumba Yes , go ! Pray  --  offer to the rapacious , selfish gods ! I am not child enough for that . Yet she is good and pious  --  Oh , were I good like her ! Can I be so ? No , for I have more knowledge . My eye has pierced deeper into the mysteries of fate . A poison , whose wasting power she can not know , corrodes my life , ' Why not fly ? ' she asks me , ' Why dost thou not ask thy freedom ? ' Unhappy power that binds my soul and will ! Abhorred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not win ; that urges me to seek what I should shun . Why did I look upon a glory that I could never reach ? Why did I gaze upon the splendors of a day whose brightness had not dawned for me ? Wherefore , grim , terrible fate , didst thou mock me with the light , only to plunge me deeper in my darkness ? Now thy evil work is wrought . My eyes are blinded ; my heart spell-bound ; my soul doomed ; my life given to misery . Here is my torture and here I must remain . So will the cruel powers . I must  --  for I must hear his name . If I hear not of him , it is as if the air of heaven were shut from me . Yes , I must once more see him , must once more hear his voice ; his eyes ' clear light must shine on me once more . Oh , king Dag ! wilt thou remark the bondmaid ? Wilt thou bestow one look , one thought on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy conquering hand , thou dost not scorn to pat the neck of thy proud charger ,  --  but Kumba 's touch would soil thee . For Frid , for the king 's daughter is thy hand ; for her thy fame , thy love , thy great , proud hero heart . And it must be my part to tend upon her , to deck her out , that she may be more lovely in thy eyes , more blessed in thy love . Still must I look upon her beauty and her joy , and feel the gnawing fungs of envy in my heart . ( Pause . ) In the chill , misty Nifelheim rises the spring Hvergelmer . Forth from thence , rivers of poison glide , and in its depths lies the great serpent Nidhgg who gnaws at the root of the world 's tree , gnaws , gnaws unceasingly . When I was very young this saga made me shudder . Now is it portion of my daily life . I am this spring , my world is wrapped in mists , worms gnaw my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise up in me at times . It has been said that the black Alfs who live at the northern limits of the earth , under the outermost roots of the world 's tree , sometimes come forth from their dark dwelling place , and whisper in the ear of man words that may not be breathed in the light of day . They are sent forth by Hela to do her fearful bidding . It is to me , at times , as if an evil spirit 's voice rose up in me , and prompted me  --  ( Pause . ) Could I but die and thus find rest ! Might the life after death be bright to me ! Might the freed spirit but look down from heaven upon the earth where it has pined and sorrowed ! Could I but know that a compassionate God had for his weary , griefworn child a home , where after life 's hard struggle he might rest , and dwell in light and stillness ! Then oh then , I could indeed submit ; oh then , I could renounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye gods , ye have forgotten us , and therefore does my soul rebel against you . Your gifts are lavished on your favored children , but we must look for nothing at your hands . Nothing ?  --  for bitterness  --  for poison . Ye gods ! if from the poison drops that through long years have fallen on my heart , a stream should swell , mighty to blast and kill  --  the guilt be yours ! SCENE IV . Frid 's Chamber . FRID . KUMBA . FRID . Frid Kumba , braid my hair , and pour on it the perfumed oil king Dag has sent me from the southern land . KUMBA . Kumba I obey . FRID . Frid And , as thou braidest , I would have thee tell me some of the sagas that thou knowest so well . Well is it said that round the home of Saga the gliding waters murmur , to whose voice the ear of Odin listens willingly . Saddening yet spirit-stirring too are song and saga . KUMBA . Kumba Princess wilt then hear the old saga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . KUMBA . Kumba Heimdall , thus runs the tale , once , roaming through green paths , came to the sea-shore ; he found there a lonely house and entered in . The door was half open ; fire burned on the floor . Within , grown gray with toil , sat Ae and Edda in old work-day clothes . Edda set before him soup in a bowl , and took from the fire thick seed-mixed cakes ; but the chief dainty was the sodden calf . Heimdall , who called himself by the name of Rig , tarried here three days and nights , and went forth on his way . And when nine moons had come and gone , Edda bore a son who was dipped in water , and was called Trl . And the boy grew and throve ; he was of dark color ; his countenance was ill-favored ; the skin of his hands was thick and shrivelled ; his back was round ; his heels were long . And there came to the hut a beggar girl ; her nose was flat ; her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was called Trlinna ; she passed with Trl the heavy days , and bore him sons and daughters . It was their work to draw burdens ; to carry wood ; to dress the fields ; to herd swine ; to tend goats ; to cut turf . From these are slaves descended . And Rig journeyed on further and found in another house another pair . The door stood half open , fire burned on the floor . The man was shaping a tree into a weaver 's beam . His beard was trimmed ; his hair cut from his forehead ; he wore a straight shirt confined by a buckle at the throat . The housewife turned a spinning-wheel , drew out thread , and laid it by for cloth . She wore a fillet round her head ; a kerchief round her neck ; a ribbon over her shoulders . This pair were Afe and Amma . And Rig was received by them , and entertained three days and nights , and then went forth upon his way . And when nine moons had waxed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with beaming eyes . He was dipped in water and was called Karl . And the boy grew and throve . He learned to tame oxen ; to fashion tools ; to build houses ; to make wool-cards ; to guide the plough . And to him Snor was led home as his bride . She wore a kirtle of goat 's hair ; keys hung from her belt . And they gave one another rings , and built them a house . They had many sons and daughters , and from them are the yeomanry descended . And Rig journeyed on , and came to a stately hall . The door was shut and decorated with a ring . He entered . The floor was wide . There sat Fader and Moder . Their work was pastime . The husband bended bows ; twisted bow strings ; polished arrows . The wife stiffened and smoothed her sleeves , and placed a coif upon her head . She wore a jewel on her breast ; a silken kirtle , and blue-dyed linen . Her face was fair , her nock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table ; and placed thereon thin , white , wheaten cakes ; silver plates filled with various meats ; bacon and roasted fowls . Wine was poured from cans and embossed goblets . And they drank and talked till the day was done . Rig tarried here also three days and three nights , and went forth upon his way . And when nine moons had waxed and waned , Moder became the mother of a son , who was dipped in water and was called Jarl . His hair was light ; his cheeks fresh colored ; his eyes keen as those of the young eagle . And he grew and throve ; he twisted bow-strings ; bended bows ; shaped arrows ; threw the spear ; shook the lance ; rode horses ; trained dogs ; drew the sword ; and used himself to swimming . Then came Rig again to the hall ; taught him the Runic letters , and owned him for his son . The young Rig carried war over the mountains ; won victories ; and divided goods and lands . He married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble Erna . Kour was the youngest of their sons . He strove with his father in Runic lore and vanquished him . Then was it the son 's lot to be himself called Rig , and to have learning above all others . From him are kings and nobles derived . Here ends the saga of Rig . FRID . Frid Thanks , Kumba ; the saga is beautiful and full of meaning . KUMBA , Kumba ( aside . ) Beautiful ! yes for her . FRID . Frid But even as I listened to the tale my thoughts wandered . A dear yet terrible memory rose up before my soul . This day , just three years since , I first beheld king Dag . KUMBA . Kumba This day ? Ah , tell me how it was ! FRID . Frid Thou knowest my father 's brother , gloomy Atle , had slain the father of king Dag , the great renowned king Ifvar . Thirsting for vengeance on their father 's foe , Dag and his brother Ragnar stormed my uncle 's castle . Shut up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother Arild , I listened to the clash of weapons , the shouts of warriors , Arild elenched his little hand in rage . I prayed the gods to spare the infant 's life , for he was dear to me as to a mother . Suddenly I heard a cry , followed by a loud shout of triumph  --  ' Atle has fallen ! Ragnar has slain Atle ! ' But soon another cry was heard  --  ' Ragnar is wounded ! Ragnar dies ! Revenge ! Revenge ! ' And now , with terrible din , the combatants approached my room . The door fell , shivered by a battle axe . It was not fear that in that hour I felt , but anger and a proud despair . I seized a shield and spear , resolved to die rather than yield myself a prisoner . ' Back ! ' thundered a commanding voice , as the armed men were rushing forward , and gleamed-round by flashing swords , as by a thousand lightnings , I saw a man before me  --  a god he seemed to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frid Yes that was he . It was king Dag . ' Yield thy-self prisoner ! ' cried he ; my answer was my lance pointed at his breast . My trembling arm was wounded by his sword , and he disarmed me . Bleeding , I sank down at my brother 's side , and cried , ' Mercy for him ! Mercy for the young child ! ' ' Death to the traitor 's son ! ' shouted the champions , and pressed forward , King Dag covered us with his shield and turned against them . ' Back ! ' cried he , once more , to the furious throng . ' The victory is won . We war not with the helpless . Down with weapons ! ' But a mad rage for blood had seized on Rangnar 's followers . They shouted wildly , ' Blood for blood ! ' Thou shouldst have seen king Dag . Noble and strong as Thor , he raised his sword in aid of the defenceless . Like lightnings fell the whirring blows among the raging champions . Heaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kumba The brave , the noble ! FRID . Frid Astonished by his superhuman strength , the furious throng gave ground . Then cried king Dag , ' To me , my men ! each true friend follow me ! ' He raised my brother Arild from the ground , and bade one of his followers bear him in his arms . He took me in his own ; and guarding me with shield and sword , bore me forth safely from the fray . I saw no more , A faintness overpowered my senses ; my eyes closed . KUMBA . Kumba But he watched over thee ! FRID . Frid When I reopened them , I found it night ; but night illumined by a fearful glow ; I saw upon a distant shore , a blaxing castle ; but soft winds fanned my cheek ; and on , still on , the winged sea-dragon bore me over the dancing waves . Under a purple canopy , my brother Arild stood beside me , and clapped his little hands in childish rapture . Before me , with uncovered head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dag , and I  --  I was his prisoner . KUMBA . Kumba Oh blessed lot ! FRID . Frid Yes , his prisoner ; the brave , the noble one had taken my heart captive ; I could not , as I would , turn in proud anger from my conqueror . With his strong arm he had disarmed me ; with his love he sought to win my love ; and when he prayed , as soft , as mild as Baldur ; when , as a suppliant , he besought his captive to share his crown and kingdom , I no more strove to hide my heart from him ; he clasped me to his breast , and called me bride . KUMBA . Kumba Thou happy one ! FRID . Frid Yes , I was happy . Days and nights passed by ; life was as a ray of heaven 's light to me . All was so beautiful about me . The sea-dragon flew over the blue sea , under the dark blue heaven ; the waves danced cheerily ; the winds sang among sails of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day king Dag practiced his men in martial sports ; himself exciting them to a fierce , glad daring , while I beheld them from the royal tent . When evening came , and sea and wind were still , then king Dag took his harp and played to me ; and sang that my heart throbbed with rapture . Then the clear stars looked down ; the sea birds skimmed over the waters foam ; the sea glowed with a wondrous brightness ; and we sailed on as borne on waves of fire . While all adored the hero , the hero worshipped me . Yes , I was happy ; happy amid war 's perils .  --  My father 's castle had been burned and plundered . Foes overran the country of king Dag . We had no home . My hero bore me to Upsala 's temple ; there to remain in peace , while he drove forth his foes . He came again , and brought me to this castle ; but left me soon ; for he had vowed to celebrate no joyful festival , till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her unhappy bondage . Here shall I live , guarded by faithful men , and wait his coming from the Saxon land . KUMBA . Kumba And should he not come back ?  --  If he should fall in combat on the foreign shore ? FRID . Frid No , no , I fear it not . A mighty sorceress , a wise far-seeing Vala , who visited the temple of Upsala , read me his destiny . His course shall be victorious and long . From this adventure he shall come back safe , and rich in spoils and honor . KUMBA . Kumba Thou hast seen the glorious temple , the court of the great gods ! Thou hast lived with Diar and Disor . Were they beautiful ? Were they happy ? FRID . Frid Yes , beautiful and happy . A noble calm , an infinite loftiness , dwells in their mien , and breathes from all their being . Earth 's joys and sorrows move them not . High above these they stand , and gaze into the clear heaven of the gods . The high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Odin , full of all power and mildness . In his majestic presence , all unrest dies ; the stormy heart feels its wild beatings stilled  --  the troubled spirit finds itself at peace . KUMBA . Kumba ( Aside , ) Peace , Ah ! And I  --  ( aloud ) And the temple  --  is it magnificent ? FRID . Frid Far above all description . The walls are all of gold and precious stones , their splendor lights up the surrounding region . The radiant glories of the temple bear witness to the power of the divinity ; while , in the lofty halls , the sacred groves , a deep , religious silence , never broken but by the Diar 's hymns , invites the soul to holy contemplation . Had I not loved king Dag , I would have given myself to the service of the gods , and passed my life with the Assynior . KUMBA , Kumba ( aside . ) She chooses between the temple and the throne ; and I  --  FRID . Frid When I look back upon those days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was beautiful in those temple courts , those lofty halls ! There , pondering the counsels of the gods , moved , with slow step , the deeply thoughtful Diar  --  KUMBA . Kumba And didst thou learn their heavenly wisdom ? the knowledge that gives power to calm the waves , to subdue fire , to lighten heavy sorrow ? Didst thou learn the secret of the beginning and end of all things ? FRID . Frid No , I was yet too young ; my heart too full of the world 's outward splendor and of love . My voice was blended in their songs ; I mingled in their nightly dance ; but the deep meaning of their mysteries was hidden from me . They thought me , and with reason , unable to receive it . KUMBA . Kumba And what is all the wisdom of the priest , compared with king Dag 's love ? FRID . Frid Thou art right , Kumba ; but had I never known him , I would have chosen , rather than sit on any earthly throne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even thus they call it , is a foreshadowing of the heavenly Asgaard , the eternal home of God . And beautiful it is to walk on earth before the gods , with prayer and sacrifice , and thus pass upward to their heavenly dwellings . KUMBA . Kumba That I can well believe . They sacrifice then in the temple ? FRID . Frid Yes , often . But there are , in especial , three yearly feasts of sacrifice which Odin has appointed . They have newly celebrated there the victory-sacrifice . This is offered in the spring , when the unbound waters offer a free path to the daring Vikings . KUMBA . Kumba Are human victims ever offered there ? FRID . Frid Yes ; oftenest slaves and criminals . KUMBA . Kumba Slaves and criminals ? FRID . Frid Yes , but sometimes even the noblest life . The victim is led forth arrayed in festive garments . The seat of the gods is sprinkled with his blood ; it is even showered down on the assembled people . The smoke that rises from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the halls with a sweet-scented vapor . Clear and loud sounds forth the chant  --  KUMBA . Kumba But the victim  --  makes he no complaint ? Do not his cries of agony disturb the holy songs ? FRID . Frid His cries are stifled ; or they are lost in the loud songs of praise . KUMBA . Kumba Are lost in songs of praise ? FRID . Frid Yes ; no discord mars the beauty and majesty of the high festival .  --  But , Kumba , what was that ? I hear the trampling of horses , the winding of horns , the raising of the draw bridge . It is a messenger  --  and of importance . Good Kumba , hasten , and bring me tidings quickly  --  SCENE V. FRID . Frid It is a messenger from Dag . My heart assures me of it . Oh , how it beats ! Be quiet , restless one !  --  Yet , thou dear trouble ! I would not exchange thee for the unruffled calm of the Assynior . My king ! my Dag ! to love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beats thus with hope of tidings from thee , how shall I look on thee and not die with gladness ? SCENE VI . FRID . KUMBA . KUMBA . Kumba A letter  --  from  --  king Dag . Below are costly gifts . FRID . Frid A letter ! give it me . Ah , ye dear characters ! He comes !  --  comes soon ! Before the next new moon will he be here . Victorious , rich in honor and in spoils , he comes back to his bride , ' the ever loved . ' Oh , my betrothed ! My Dag ! KUMBA , Kumba ( aside . ) And I ? FRID . Frid I will myself speak with the messenger . I would see the man who has so lately seen my loved one . Kumba , go thou and work upon the golden girdle , and be industrious , Kumba , that it may soon be ready . I wish to wear it on the king 's return  --  I shall then see him soon ! Oh , happy that I am ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I ? Oh , wherefore was I born ? And must I look upon this happy meeting ?  --  I listen to these vows of endless truth ? Must I adorn her ?

Ye trample them beneath your feet , and take no heed of their death agonies.  --  ' The victim 's cries are stifled , that they disturb not the high festival . '  --  Men drag them to the altar , murder them , and drown their death cries . From the fire , that burns their quivering limbs , rises a delicate perfume for the priests chanting their hymns of praise . Human victims ! Slaves ! Poor wretches ! No help , no pity ! They are dragged forth in spite of prayers and struggles . They must .  --  Terrible destiny ! Fearful necessity !  --  Even for me  --  and why necessity for me ? If I will not , who shall compel ?

Dark thoughts rise up in me , like black Alfs from the earth . Frid was not used to be thus weak and fearful . She has not shrunk before the thunders of war ; and when the winter nights were dark and threatening , then thought she on king Dag and all was light . Why , therefore , now , when he is no more distant , now when each moment brings him nearer to me , when I so soon shall look in his clear eyes , why now this secret fear , this tremor in my heart ?

Why is its light so unlike to the sun 's in splendor  --  in influence on the heart ?  --  How it contends for life with the black clouds !  --  Now it is lost in darkness .  --  Strange world ! strange , fearful depth !  --  I have been very happy .

Do we not see the trace of bitter tears upon the face that used to glow with smiles ? Is not her voice too , weak and broken ? KUMBA . Kumba And dost thou weep for this ? FEIMA . Feima Yes , I weep , I must weep , that the beautiful , the divinely good , must go forth from the earth , that Hreimer and I will miss our beloved mistress , that the young king shall come and find his fair bride faded . How desolate will the rose-garden be when we no longer see the princess there , no longer hear her voice , and see her lovely face , queen over all the flowers .

Would she , even with a finger , touch the burden under which thou sinkest ? Would the proud princess stoop to aid thy toil ? FEIMA . Feima Kumba , thou talkest idly  --  Could one descended of the gods do this ? KUMBA . Kumba And wherefore not ? Is not goodness , is not mercy godlike ? FEIMA . Feima Yes , but the high gods and their children may not toil like slaves . It is not meet for them . Each one has his own lot . KUMBA . Kumba And even therefore will I not serve thy gods . They are too high to waste their cares on us . The god to whom my spirit shall bow down must be of other sort . FEIMA .

He shall , like us , endure reproach and shame , like us shall be contemnd by the mighty ; and , sharing all the fortunes of the slave , guiltless shall meet the shameful death of guilt . But after death he shall return in glory , and thus he shall declare unto his own ; I have known all your needs , have borne your burdens , and have become acquainted with your griefs , that ye too might continue to the end , that your hearts faint not in the day of trouble . In the All-father 's heaven are many homes , and there he hath ordained a place for you . There shall the weary rest them from their toil ; the heavy laden lay the burden down ; there shall be no more death nor pain nor sorrow ; but in untroubled peace , in undimmed brightness , ye shall abide throughout eternity . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great ones of the earth shall tremble . Behold ! the proud brought low , the lowly raised !

Foam stands on thy white lips . Thy words , how fearfully they move me ! Kumba , sister , they thrill me , yet I understand them not . KUMBA . Kumba That I do believe . FEIMA . Feima But this I understand , that she is good who made my heart light with her friendly words , who had a cottage built for me and Hreimer . I know that I would rather bear a double load , than have the smallest burden laid on her . When she commands me , and I do her bidding , I feel it must be so , that it is best for both . KUMBA .

Blessed may he be who shall stay her sickness , who shall turn from her the cold hand of Hela ! But curses be on him who works her harm ! And if it be a human hand , be it accursed ! May Nifelheim 's cold poisons drop ever on the traitor 's heart ! May no more gladness be for him on earth ! KUMBA . Kumba Sister , speak not thus ! FEIMA . Feima Yes I will speak thus : I will wish evil to the hand that would work evil to the good . But I will not yet despair , I will offer up this chain for her . It was from her I had it ; for her then will I offer it , to appease the unfriendly powers . SCENE II . KUMBA , Kumba alone .

Only the thirst for vengeance was not stilled  --  I have had strength to give to the proud princess , the poisondraught the giant-woman mingled . Since then my soul has lain as in a trance . I think it sleeps  --  sleeps deeply  --  Shall it ever wake ? ( Pause . ) Frid is dying . Now is her bright course closed . Now does she share the fate of other mortals , and learn what suffering is . Now shall she never meet king Dag 's embrace .

Away , then , coward thought ! It is too late . I can not now go back ; then forward , forward into night ! I can not now be reconciled with heaven . On , then , to the abyss ! Frid comes .

SCENE III . FRID . Frid This is the hour in which all nature weeps the death of Balder . Now every tree and leaf and flower is bathed in quiet tears ; the stars themselves are dim with sadness . Now is nature weak , her heart is open ; now , perhaps , she may have feeling for a mortal 's sorrows , may hear my prayer , and give my sufferings ease . ( She leans thoughtfully against a tree . ) He died , the good , slain by a crafty foe , and in that hour the flame of peace was quenched , and Discord lighted up her blazing torch . Sorrow and tears then found a home on earth . Before it was not so ; the gods walked gladly through her blooming vallies ; in love did they create the race of man . But then came Jettemr and stirred up strife , and fearful monsters rose from out the depths , unknown on earth before . I marked it not till now ,  --  the pain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering . What is there good , what is there pure in life ? Does not the Midgaard serpent , Jormungandur , End note 6 : 1Kb enclose the earth within his venomous circle ? Are not the roots of the world 's tree gnawed by the Serpent-king ?  --  Is not a worm hid in each human breast , in every flower 's bosom ? It sleeps a while ; the flower sends forth its sweets , the mortal smiles . It wakes at length , comes forth to light and stings ; the flower withers and the mortal dies . Even my hour is come ; my hour to suffer . Since that night when the Alf came upon his fearful errand , some hidden evil has consumed my life . My days and nights are passed in restless pain . My eyes are dim , my lips are parched , my weak limbs fail , all my life 's strength dies out . Oh Dag ! oh my beloved ! how will it be with thee when thou shalt find thy bride thus wasted to a fading shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too terrible ! Die , without seeing thee ! that were eternal misery !  --  Oh no , the fates are not so cruel . Does not the heaven of the great father compass me , so clear and mild ? Is not all nature round about me , tearful and full of gentleness ? Why should I then despair ? May I not hope yet to win back my life ? May not this suffering be a trial sent but to make me better and more thankful ? I will bow down before the powers of nature , and ask them for their help ; great is my suffering , great is my need of healing . Oh ye kind powers who dwell in the green trees ! Powerful the juices that the sun distils into your friendly bosoms .

Come back , console me , give my spirit strength ! ( The Ljus-Alf returns surrounded by a faint light . ) FRID . Frid I know that thou art good . I feel that I may let thee look upon my heart . Within short space I have endured much sorrow , and , through my own pain , have I learned to know the griefs that mortals suffer . At times it seems to me that there is nothing good upon the earth . I even doubt the goodness of the gods ;  --  doubt if the life they gave have any worth ; for is not all here transient and uncertain ? Does not all bloom to fade ? Are not all born to die ?

Frigga perhaps may summon thee to Vingolf , to dwell among the blest Assynior . Thou wilt , perhaps , be of the chosen maidens , who share with Gefion her radiant palace .

Passing from battle and from victory , the land of shades will have no gloom for him , for thou wilt meet him there . FRID . Frid Pleasant but fearful are thy words . A strange fear thrills me ; dim seems my life in the pale land of shadows .  --  Yet doth love live there , and in the spirits ' world I shall behold my Dag .

A tree near Kumba falls . She starts aside and supports herself against a rock . ) What was that ? Only a tree that fell before the lightning . Why do I tremble ? Why do I shrink back ? Is not this wild uprooting known to me ? Does not a fiercer night-storm rage within me ? ( Pause . ) Why is all now so calm , so silent ? This stillness is a pain to me.  --  Why do the pale stars gleam thus fearfully ?  --  The sky is clouded ;  --  can they look through the clouds ?

The moon , the wizard 's sun , lends its pale rays to light them on their path . There , on her winged dragon , rides forth Mara , who stifled Vanland in his quiet sleep : from the black swamps rise Dwalin 's dwarfish daughters ; and the small imps come tottering from their holes . They come to waken pain , to stir up thoughts of evil in the breasts of those who linger near their haunts . They bring disquiet , and I ask for rest .  --  I seek the sorceress , her who has deceived me . I will compel her yet to keep her promise .

Though the cold drops stand on my brow , I shrink not , creep not hence like you .  --  Send forth thy lightnings , father Thor , thou angry ruler of the clouds ! Since , after death , I am to be thy bondslave , it is but meet that thou shouldst serve me now , and light me on my way with thy keenglancing fires . SCENE VI . A mountain cavern .

What is it to you that I have guests ? If you cease not your clamor , you shall be changed to stones , as it has chanced to some of you already . Back to your holes , I say . Here , stupify yourselves with the poison steam , and then , sleep till I call you . Only my chosen spirits may remain with me . ( The little Trolls shrink back terrified .

Thou art discourteous . KUMBA . Kumba Give me rest ! Thou didst promise rest ; thou hast deceived me ! GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda Not so loud ! Thou wilt wake my little ones who sleep . KUMBA . Kumba They sleep ! I sleep no more ! GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda What is wanting to thee ? KUMBA . Kumba Every thing ! Oh , Grimgerda , if thou hast human feelings in thy breast , feel for my need and help me .

Grimgerda Check the swift arrow in its flight , or bid the stream flow backward to its source ! The deed once wrought can never be undone ; and the strong soul never disowns its work . KUMBA .

Here , my poor child , take food and strengthen thee , then will we talk together . KUMBA . Kumba No , I can not eat . GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda Such meat is seldom offered . It can give wisdom and strength to those who eat of it . KUMBA . Kumba Give me rest !  --  Give me the goblet of forgetfulness ! GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda This draught only the dead may drink . KUMBA .

Give me but death ! death and forgetfulness ! GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda Those only can forget who have done nothing worthy of remembrance ; no great deed , good or evil . KUMBA . Kumba Alas , forgetfulness is not for me ! But there is a sleep , a trance , a state between life and death , in which we know nor day , nor night , nor cloud , nor sunshine ; know only that we would not wake . May not this sleep be mine ? GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda Thou askest what belongs to higher spirits . Thou , a slave 's daughter , art not worthy of it . KUMBA . Kumba This is denied me too . Keep thy word , then , in any way thou canst ! I bought thy promise dearly , let it not be for nothing . Rest thou hast promised me .

What tortures hast thou in thy power , keener than those that I have felt already ? Bid thy wolves rend me , I will laugh at them . But in my death hour thou shalt fear me , witch ! What should I dread from thee ? What can I lose ?  --  Thou hast thy power , thy treasures . Therefore tremble ! I feel a strength within my tortured breast greater than thine . Tremble before the curse , that in my last hour , my pale lips shall utter ! GRIMGERDA , Grimgerda ( aside . ) Ha , strength , great strength ? It shall serve greater cunning .

KUMBA . Kumba Speak more plainly . GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda Enter my service fully and forever . The first work I shall give thee to accomplish , shall ratify our compact . KUMBA . Kumba And my reward ? GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda Thou shalt win great power in this earthly life , and , in the other life , still greater power to work harm to the mighty of the earth . Thou shalt be there one of my chosen ones , even as the powerful Disor thou hast seen about me . KUMBA . Kumba Have they peace ? GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda Observe them . KUMBA . Kumba I see no sorrow in their aspect . At times it is as if a smile moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . Of some the countenance is fixed and rigid , as if about to change itself to stone . GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda Thou seest them in their twilight dress ; their night cloaks in which they journey to the mortal world . They do not always look thus dull and joyless ; when I will , they shine forth in bright festive garments ; and at a sign from me splendor surrounds us exceeding that of Upsal 's temple . Behold ! ( The witch waves her wand and the cave seems for a moment dazzling with gold . The sorceress and the Disor appear in splendid dresses with crowns upon their heads . ) GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda What thinkest thou ? KUMBA . Kumba It is splendid . ( Aside . ) But they are none the more beautiful for this . GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda What sayest thou ? KUMBA . Kumba It is splendid . GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda Ay , thou mayst well think so . Thou hast seen nothing like this among the boasting Jarls . ( Waves her wand , the light vanishes . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold was red like glowing fire ; I thought I saw lizards and spiders creeping among the dazzling gems . GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda Because thy eyes are unused to such splendor , and therefore does it seem to thee like spider 's webs . But gold and jewels are not all we have here . We have our mirth too , and , believe me , this cave has seen right merry sports . Here we know nothing of remorse or care . We eat and drink , sleep when we will , dance and make merry to our hearts ' content . But thou shalt see . ( Grimgerda blows on her horn . Black Alfs , Dwarfs , and small Trolls swarm forth and join in a wild dance . ) KUMBA , Kumba ( aside . ) Is this mirth ? No , it is madness .

Grimgerda , stop the hateful revelry ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , when they are once warm for the dance . We must have cold water . ( Strikes the rock with her wand ; a stream of water gushes out over the dancing Trolls , who run off howling and creep back to their holes . The witch laughs . ) These sports charm thee not because thou art still unwouted to them . But ask my little ones if they find the dance wearisome . When thou hast been a little time among us , thou wilt be as merry as they . ( Kumba sighs . ) Well , slave 's daughter ! have you a mind in my service ,  --  to be free ? KUMBA , Kumba ( bitterly . ) As one of these ? GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda No , even more free . Kumba , I mean well by thee ; I have great things in view for thee .

GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda Hear , and mark well my words . In the strong castle , on the other side the water , there dwells a Jarl named Harald Sigurdson.  --  KUMBA . Kumba I know him . A brave nobleman . A friend to the king Dag . GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda I hate him . And yet more I hate his wife , the haughty Herborg . KUMBA . Kumba Well ! GRIMGERDA .

Kumba No , I can not ! GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda Thus only canst thou win my friendship , and share my treasures and my power . Thus only can the daughter of the slave become a free and happy being . KUMBA . Kumba The gods defend me ! GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda Thinkst thou the gods take thought for such as thou ?  --  But I can understand thy horror , Kumba . Nature shrinks back from unaccustomed deeds . But this divides the great souls from the mean , that they have power to conquer nature 's weakness . KUMBA . Kumba I will not ! Let it be with me as it may . I will not ! GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda Thou wilt not ? That we will see . Thou goest not hence alive , till thou hast sworn to do it . KUMBA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not do it . Driven by wild passion I have sought to still my hate ; but , a soft , innocent child , that never wronged me !  --  No , I am not yet so fallen . Thanks , sorceress ! thou hast given me back my strength . I can defy thee and despise thy offers . GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda What ! art thou proud even of thy cowardice ? Go , wretch ! Thou art not worthy to be near the sorceress . Go , pigmy , and remain a slave ! KUMBA . Kumba Better even so , than to be such as thou art . GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda Wretch , and wouldst thou exalt thyself above me ? Thou , base , cowardly murderess , who hadst not strength to withstand evil , nor courage to be resolute in crime ?

Thy portion shall be abject , lonely wretchedness ! KUMBA . Kumba Thou tellest me but what I know already . Hast thou no heavier curses , witch ? GRIMGERDA . Grimgerda Yes ; and though it cost me dear , yet will I utter them . Know , then , Kumba , that there is One who could have rescued thee ; who could have given thee peace even on this earth ; who would have borne thy spirit , after death , into eternal light . But him thou didst reject ; thou didst thrust from thee thy deliverer , and through all time his image shall pursue thee , reproaching and avenging ! See and tremble !

( A bright light appears in the depths of the cave . In the midst is seen the form of a beautiful youth , of mild and majestic aspect . He fixes upon Kumba a look stern and sorrowful .
