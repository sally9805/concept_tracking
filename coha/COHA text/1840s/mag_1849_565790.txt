txt THIS IS No. xxxii in a series of tracts purporting to be published by the " Tract Committee of the Diocese of Massachusetts . " All the tracts of the series , as advertised on the cover of this , appear from their titles to be addressed , like this , ad populum , as the Oxford men have it , rather than ad clerum , or ad scholares . A three cent pamphlet , in such a series , can hardly be expected to // be very thorough in the discussion of the subject which it handles . The nature of such a work requires it to be striking rather than accurate , imposing rather than profound . Accident having thrown this little publication in our way , our attention was attracted to it chiefly by our personal respect for the author . We felt a friendly curiosity to see how he would perform such a task as that of writing a tract to be used in making proselytes . We had no doubt that a tract of that sort from his pen would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that system of church organization and worship , which he believes to be the nearest existing approximation to the primitive type of Christianity as traced in the Scriptures of the New Testament . At the same time we expected to find a courteous deportment towards Christians of other ecclesiastical connections , and in general a spirit quite the reverse of that arrogance towards " the sects " which is so common in bishops , priests and deacons , and which is sometimes too ludicrous to be offensive . Nor have we been disappointed . So far as manners and temper are concerned , there is little to be censured ; while in respect to matter and arrangement , the tract is eminently adapted to its purpose . The plan is ingenious but simple . The author has been requested to reply to the question , " What is the Episcopal church , or , by what is it distinguished from other bodies of Christians ? " He informs us that in answering this question he is expected " to give to persons who know scarcely any thing of that church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , history , doctrines and customs . " Accordingly , he supposes a person of serious and thoughtful character , and of ordinary New England intelligence , who having grown up to manhood without the opportunity of attending on Episcopalian worship and preaching , or even of seeing an Episcopalian house of worship , comes at last " to live in some place where an Episcopal church stands on the same green or street with the Congregationalist , the Baptist , the Methodist and the Universalist meeting-houses . " The imaginary succession of such a man 's observations and experiences in the process of becoming a proselyte to Episcopalianism , gives the author an opportunity of saying all that he wants to say for the s*tke of producing the desired effect upon his reader , and of omitting , very naturally and gracefully , whatever might be unfavorable to his design . The first thing then which is supposed to strike the unsophisticated mind of the new settler in this imaginary village where there are so many places of worship , is the fact that sometimes the Episcopal church is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one . // " In his own home , he never heard , although he often read , of churches ; except as sdcieties of believers . He easily understands that the name is given to the place from the assembly , and that it carries with it a kind of sacredness , since where two or three are accustomed to meet in the name of the Lord , He is accustomed to be with them . " - p. 4 . Bnt is not this young man a little unwary in receiving impressions ? If he " understands that the name is given to the place from the assembly , " is he not too hasty to understand the matter aright ? No assembly gathered in that place is called " a church , " or even pretends to be " a church . " The Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America is a church ; but the handful of Episcopalians in that village , are too well grounded in their own distinctive principles to claim for their single , local assembly such a title . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mind 's eye-is a respectable specimen of carpenter 's gothic , built of pine boards and painted white ; and if this devout stranger supposes that the society of believers** which holds its meetings there pretends to be a church , and that the house is so denominated from that circumstance , he is very evidently a Congregationalist or a Baptist who has not yet thrown off the prejudices of his education . If the name church is appropriately " given to the place from the assembly , " then obviously the name belongs of right only to those places in which " churches meet to praise and pray ; " and not at all to those edifices in which the members of a parish , not pretending to be a church but only the smallest fractionary portion of a church , hold their religious meetings . And whatever sacredness the name carries with it , belongs legitimately only to those edifices to which the name may be legitimately applied by a metonymy , as the grammarians say , of the thing contained for the container . Why should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church assembles , be denominated parish meeting-houses , chapels , or by some other name consistent with the Episcopalian theory ? Our stranger is supposed to receive yet other impressions , in meditating upon the word church as the exclusive designation of the place in which the Episcopalians meet to worship . " He can see , for the same cause , why Episcopal churches are said to be consecrated , ' at their dedication ; why they are used for public worship only , and not for popular meetings , lectures , courts and elections ; why men , when within their walls , always remain uncovered . It is because a place where prayer is wont to be made ' is a place where God has promised to be specially present . But , asks the stranger , is not a meeting-ho usesuchaplace ? Why , then , is it not called a church , and treated as sacred ? He is answered , that the custom comes from the Puritan settlers of Massachusetts . They had been trained up in a land where all the churches were Episcopal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against all ceremonies , refused to think their places of worship sacred ; called them houses for meeting ; and used them for every good purpose , as well as for religious services . " - p. 4. // Why a building which is " consecrated " should seem any holier to this stranger than one which is dedicated , as all Congregational churches are , to be used in public worship , we can not understand , without supposing that his imagination is more affected by the sound of words than by their meaning . The promise ii pon which his mind runs as he meditates , is quite apocryphal . A distinction of places , as if one place were strictly holier than another , or as if God were permanently present in one place more specially than in another , is unknown to the arrangements of the Christian dispensation as we find them in the New Testament . That wherever two or three are met together in the name of Christ , there he is in the midst of them , is good New Testament doctrine but to infer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first day of the week , there he is specially present during all the six days of their absence-more present than he is in their dwellings and their places of business-is contrary to the first principles of Christianity . Where contrite and believing souls unite to pray and praise , on the holy day , there , doubtless , God  --  the Father , the Son , the Holy Spirit-is present , in some special sense , to hear and to save ; but to transfer the conception of God 's special presence from the assembly to the locality , and to make it a fixture there  --  to reason , to think , or to feel as if the gracious power of that ineffable Trinity must needs remain after the assembly is dispersed , and be a part of the furniture and equipments of the edifice , is at once preposterous and grossly superst itious . The " Puritan settlers of Massachusetts , " then , may have erred in refusing to think their places of worship sacred in any sense ; and yet they may not have erred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Testament , as they would have done if they had accepted the popular English superstition which conceived of the Most High as dwelling in temples made with hands . The disuse of the word church as the designation of a place of worship , and the substitution of the word meeting-house in its stead , may have been , in that age , the best possible method of protesting against an old and mischievous superstition . Let them be honored for having made their protest so earnest and so effectual. rJlhat they used their houses of worship " foi ' every good purpose as well as for religious services , " was certainly very excusable in their circumstances . in the early poverty of New England , it was wiser and more religious to build first the house of God , shaped and furnished for the convenience of a worshiping assembly , and to use it for town meetings , and for courts , every town meeting and every court being conducted with religious solemnity-sanctified by the word of God and prayerthan it would have been to build first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the understanding that // it might be occupied for religious services . It is much better to hold the town meeting two or three times each year in the meeting-house dedicated to God 's worship , than it is to hold the assembly for xvorship , year after year , in the town-house . Undoubtedly it is highly desirable that the place of public worship be dedicated-set apart-consecrated if you please-so that it shall be occupied only for religious uses . Every intelligent New Englander , unless affected by some strange idiosyncrasy , knows this , and feels it . But why should the place in which the church assembles be thus dedicated ? Is it because God that made the world and all things therein , dwelleth in ternT ) ies made with hands ? Is the house dedicated to God as though He needed it ? Does He , the Lord of heaven and earth need a house which he may inhabit during the week without being disturbed by the intrusion of secular business ? We trust that no native inhabitant of New England , who has arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that the reasons why the house of public worship should be regarded as sacred to religious uses , must be found in the nature of man , and especially in the principle of the association of thought and feeling . Good taste , and a xvise economy of moral influences , unite in demanding that the house which is occupied by the worshiping assembly on the Sabbath , shall not be degraded by being converted unnecessarily into a place of amusement or of worldly business . The town meeting , the lyceum lecture , the exhibition of the public schools , the college commencement , ought to be in some other place , if possible ; for the vivid remembrance of such things , clinging to the house of prayer , is unfavorable to devotion . Yet there is a law of necessity , under which even Episcopalians open their churches for the commencement exhibitions of colleges . For though the college may have been originally founded and chartered on the liberal plan of uniting in its support the utmost variety of religious opinions , it is sometimes found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as neither common nor unclean . Another discovery made by the stranger in his observations , is that the Episcopalians of the village do not merely call their house of worship " the church ; " nor do they merely distinguish it from the other houses of worship as " the Episcopal church ; " but they give it a name of its own ; and the name is " Trinity Church , or Christ Church , or Zion Church , or Grace Church , or St. Paul 's , St. John 's , St. Peter 's , or the name of some other saint of the New Testament . " On inquiry he finds that this method of naming houses of worship is according to " an old practice in all Christian countries ; " and it seems to strike him as a pleasing way of distinguishing one church from another , although the practice " was once abused , as if the saint had some // 148 The Stranger in the Episcopal Church . charge of the church . " The practice , we believe , is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other practices which the author of this tract would repudiate as earnestly as any Puritan of two hundred years ago . At the present day , the practice is as grossly abused , in most countries , as ever it was . There are churches in the city of New York , which announce to every man who can read Latin , that they are dedicated to the saints whose names they bear , and which are regarded by those who worship there as being under the particular and powerful guardianship of this or that holy Apostle , or , as the case may be , of " the blessed Mary the mother of God . " Far be it from us to impute to our Episcopalian friends , in their way of naming their churches , any sympathy with that polytheistic superstition . Yet we must confess that we can not see any reason why a church which happens to be the only church in the place , should have any other name than the name of the place , like the Church of Cenchrea or the Church of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tract , there are several places of worship , occupied by assemblies of different religious denominations , each one must needs have some designation by which it shall be distinguished from the others ; and the natural mode of designating each place of worship , and the one which in spite of all efforts to the contrary will be adopted by the common sense of the people in their common usage , is that which names each place of worship by the ecclesiastical or doctrinal denomination of the worshipers . The Congregationalists may name their house the Edwards Church , and the Baptists may name theirs Enon Chapel , and the Methodists may name theirs the Centenary Church , and the Unitarians may name theirs the Church of the Immortality of the Soul , and the Episcopalians may *iame theirs St. John 's Church , and the Roman Catholics may name theirs the Church of St. Francis Xavier ; but , after all , the stiff good sense of the people will reject these pretty fancy names ; and usage , quem penes arbitrium est et jus et norma loquendi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baptist , the Methodist , the Unitarian , the Episcopal , and the Roman Catholic . Mr. Muggius may attempt to fix upon his own dwelling-house some romantic designation , such as Muggins Hall , Gilead House , Sans Souci , Robin 's Nest , or Riverside , and he may date his notes and letters accordingly ; but if he lives in New England , the people will insist upon calling it simply Mr. Muggins 's house , and he will find that the people are too strong for him . But when the village begins to grow into a city , and there are more churches than one or two of the same denomination , there arises a necessity for proper names to distinguish one church from another . And here our Episcopalian friends have in some respects the advantage over Congregatioflalists and Presbyterians. // Their mode of naming parishes and churches is always convenient , and , aside from those medieval and polytheistic associations which offend a Puritan taste , is quite unexceptionable . We are Puritans ourselves ; we find that in scriptural usage the title " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we therefore dislike the application of that title as an honorary distinction , by which some departed believers are exalted above others , as by a kind of apotheosis . Yet we have no violent antipathy to this use of the xvord-none that would lead us to quarrel with those to whose taste it happens to be agreeable . We can speak of the cities of St. Augustine and St. Louis , and of the churches of St. Thomas and St. George , without any fear of symbolizing with idolatry . And if a body of Christians in one of our cities , uniting to form a Congregational church , should call themselves the Church of St. Paul or of St. Barnabas , and should transfer the name by the usual metonymy from the church to the meetinghouse , their doing so would cause no interruption of communion between them and other Congregational churches . How to name churches in large cities , would be one of the very first questions to be discussed in a Congregational Ecclesiological Society . The numeration system , First , Second and Third , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it grows complicated , and begins to involve nice questions of chronology . The meridian system , which names the churches from the points of the compass , has its advantages ; but in a growing city it soon becomes obsolete , and the " Old South Church " may find itself quite north of the " Central . " The street system , which gives to churches such names as Park Street and Pine Street , Chapel Street and Mercer Street , is in some respects convenient ; but the names are often connected with undevont and undignified associations ; and when the church in the progress of improvement relinquishes its first location , and builds a better house , in a more favorable position , it is compelled to change its name , and to lose something of its historic identity . If none of these methods is satisfactory , then churches must be named according to the taste or fancy of the individuals who unite in forming them . The name may be determined by some historical feeling ; and hence come such n*.n*ies as " Plymouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " Edwards Church " in the place where Edwards lived and labored , and " Eliot Church " in Roxbury , where the famed Apostle of the Indians had his home and his grave ; but the range of such associations is somewhat limited . The name may be borrowed from some scriptural locality or event ; and thus we might have names of a class peculiar as yet , if we mistake not , to our Baptist brethren , who have appropriated , very naturally , such names as Enon , Bethesda and Satim , but would not feel their rights invaded if Congregational or Presbyterian churches in our large cities should // begin to take such names as Zion , Moriah , Salem , Bethany , Ohvet , Hermon , Calvary , Nazareth . Or a name may be preferred that is more distinctly redolent of some great Christian truth , or of some characteristic Christian sentiment-such as Grace , Redemption , Providence , Hope , Perseverance ; but the danger is that such names will be too quaint or far-fetched , or may have the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole method of nomenclature in which names are given to churches according to the taste or fancy of the people who unite in forming them , is liable to the objection that the taste and fancy of those who constitute the church may happen to be ludicrously misdirected ; and thus some Congregational church might be as oddly named as that odd-looking structure , yclept St. Gabriel 's , which rears its unconth figure hard by a certain railroad , as if it were trying to frighten the iron horse as l3alaam 's ass was frightened by the angel . But it is time that we return from this digression to our inquiring stranger . His next discovery is that the Episcopalians have no other church-covenant than that which is implied in baptism . He finds that in their assemblies all receive the Lord 's Supper who have been baptized as adults , " and all who , having been baptized in infancy , renew their covenant and profess their faith in the presence of the congregation . " He finds furthermore that with them all " discipline is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no church-meetings , or meetings of the communicants , for the exercise of discipline . The minister , however , " can not excommunicate , except where there is plain and undoubted proof of such guilt as , even in the judgment of charity , can not exist along with a true repentance . " And yet discipline when it must be exercised , is exercised by the minister . Thus it happens that among the Episcopalians , " the stranger hears nothing of investigations , trials , committees , divisions amongst neighbors concerning some scandalous story . " What his meditations are on these points of information , the respected author does not distinctly tell us . We think however that a shrexvd New England man , familiar with the New Testament , would reflect and reason somewhat after this manner . As to the conditions and method of admission to the Lord 's table , I do not see that these Episcopalians , if their way is correctly represented , differ much from us , except in form . My old minister used to speak of baptism as admission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children of believing parents belong to the church , and that their baptism is the acknowledgment of that relation to the church which is theirs by inheritance . When I made what we call a personal profession of religion before the congregation , I understood that I was renewing the coyenant which my parents made in my behalf when they offered // me to God in baptism ; and that the faith which I then professed was that in which I had been trained . And as to the question of who shall be excluded from communion , I see no great difference in theory . Our churches " can not excommunicate , except where there is plain and undoubted proof of such guilt as , even in the judgment of charity , can not exist along with a true repentance . " Of them , not less than of those who rule in the Episcopal church , it is true that they can not impose terms of communion which Christ has not commanded ; " that they can not search the hearts of their brethren ; " and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit . " But as for the idea that discipline when exercised must be exercised by the minister alone ,  --  I do not see how it is to be reconciled with the New Testament . Certainly there were in the church at Corinth , those very things which Episcopalianism glories in getting rid of  --  a " scandalous story , " an " investigation " or " trial , ' * " divisions among neigh-. hors , " and " church-meetings , meetings of communicants , for the exercise of discipline . " The Congregational system may have its inconveniences ; but on this point I am sure it agrees , more nearly than the Episcopalian system , with the arrangements made by the Apostles . ' In the next place , the stranger being informed that in case of any mistake on the part of a minister in the exercise of discipline , an appeal may he made to the bishop , finds himself arriving at " that feature of the Episcopal church which gives its name : the Episcopal office , the office of bishops . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is plain enough that they were nothing more than elders and that there was a plurality of them in a single congregation . But now he is reminded that Timothy and Titus , though not apostles , " were set over elders and were more than elders ; " and he is led to ask , " What were they ? " lie looks through the epistles addressed to these men ; and overlooking the fact that one of them is expressly called " an evangelist " he lights upon the confessedly spurious notes appended to these epistles , and reads that Timothy was " ordained the first bishop of the church of the Ephesians , and Titus the first bishop of the church of the Cretians . " These statements , he is tQld , though they are no part of Scripture , " are very ancient ; " and he is supposed to be simple enough not to know that many errors and falsehoods , particularly in relation to this subject , " are very ancient . " He is furthermore informed that " immediately after the times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presided over the elders and deacons ; " and that unless he can find Congregational churches in the New Testament , " he can not find a sitigle one in all the countries where the Apostles preached the gospel , nor in any other country , till modern times . " lie is reminded , withal , of certain martyrs and fathers of the second // 152 The Stranger in the Episcopal Church . century , who are named in history as bishops , and particularly of " Clement , one of the first bishops of Rome , who is mentioned by St. Paul as one of those whose names are in the book of life , ' and who wrote an epistle to the Corinthians that is next to the New Testament in age , authority and spirit . " And the impression which all this produces on his mind seems to be deep and strong . He has found " a church that has bishops still . " But let us suppose that the stranger , instead of being quite carried away by these representations , dares to inquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history and taking the advice of some one who understands the other side of the question . He finds that the earliest bishops who appear authentically in ecclesiastical history , make their appearance not far from half a century after the date of Paul 's last epistle to Timothy ; and that of the changes which had taken place in that half century there is no record . He finds that the bishop in the second century , was the pastor not of a diocese but only of a parish . He finds that when the bishop began to be distinguished from his colleagues in the eldership , he was at first only a presiding presbyter , and as such the conductor of public worship . He finds that after the distinction between the bishop and his fellowelders was recognized , every church that had an altar had also its own bishop . He reads the epistle of Clement , as it is called ; and it turns out to be in form arid fact a letter not from the bishop of Rome but from the church-most palpably a letter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church at Corinth , on an occasion which seemed to require such an act of the communion of churches , and quite conformable to the provisions of the Cambridge Platform , Chap . 15 , Sec. 2 . He sees that the argument about the episcopal office , though at first sight quite imposing to his imagination , falls to pieces upon close inspection . We have already followed the progress of the stranger farther than xve intended . Should we follow him to the end of his experience , we should have occasion to touch in this cursory style on almost every difference between the system of the Episcopal church and the polity and worship of other Protestant churches . Every page would give hints on which we might speak-sometimes to acknowledge the good taste , the good sense or the evangelical spirit of the author-sometimes to expose the incautiousness with which " the stranger " yields his mind to sectarian representations or to sudden impressions . But we forbear . On the whole we recommend the book , very heartily , to Episcopalians , for in its spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its expositions of the usages and institutions of their church , it is much better than the general current of their sectarian **25;170;TOOLONG WE have determined to offer some thoughts on the views of the leading British journals respecting the late French Revolution ; because the English press exerts a decided influence upon the opinion which large numbers of our people form of that event . For , besides the control which it has over that pretty numerous class of persons who look upon every thing in English type with what the London Quarterly Review wonid call a prescriptive reverence , it has misled many of our leading newspapers and reviews , and made them quite too ready to retail wares which were manufactured in England , it is not unlikely , for the foreign as well as for the home market . We shall , however , confine our remarks to the Edinburgh and London Quarterly Reviews , both because they are more extensively read than any others , and because they are the principal source from which many persons obtain their knowledge and opinions of European politics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to our readers . Ff he contest , which is now going on in Europe , is a contest of principles , a contest , it might almost be said , between the American and the English principles of government . And , as the cause of the people is to be argued as well as fought , it has seemed to us the argument should not be entirely surrendered into the hands of English writers . The Reviews , to which we shall direct our attention , may be regarded as the principal champions on the side of aristocracy . For , though opposed to each other on most other subjects , on the question of an aristocratical government they act in concert . They differ only in the mode of warfare . The London Quarterly is contemptuous and abusive , but earnest and sincere in its defense of venerable wrong ; the Edinburgh is more philosophical , with a greater show of candor , and more plausible . The former denies there is any need of change any where ; the latter admits there might be some improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries than to risk a revolution . In order to fix some definite lirriits to our remarks , we shall in the first place examine the abstract question of the grounds and necessity of revolutions ; and then consider the particular case of the late French Revolution . The October number of the Edinburgh Review contains an elaborate article on " Revolution and Reform , " in which the philosophical argument against " armed revolutions " is set forth with // much ingenuity . The doctrine of the writer is , " that where there is the shadow of a constitutional government , revolutions are never likely to pay . " It is not quite clear in this statement of the question , what the shadow of a government precisely might be . For example , would the Magna Charta be considered as the shadow of a constitutional government ? And if so , was there no appearance of it in the time of Charles I ? Did England possess what might be called the shadow of a substance at the time of " the glorious revolution of 1688 ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution ? Has Ireland now a constitution ? She has sixty thousand voters out of eight millions of inhabitants-she has members of parliament ,  --  but if the question of revolution should again arise , would it be on the point whether she had a constitution , or , whether her sufferings were not intolerable , and relief from them hopeless , otherwise than by force ? What increases our perplexity , is , that while the writer would admit of no revolution against even the shadow of a constitution , he holds up England , the very mother of modern revolutions , as a model to other nations . But , we suppose he would make the question of revolution turn upon the question of the mere existence of a constitution , though his arguments , if valid at all , are equally so against revolutions under any form of government . The first argument of the writer is drawn from what he calls the law of continuity in political developments . " All great political changes , " he says , " should be gradual and continuous , vrought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceding institutions , and so that there shall not only be no solution of continuity in the series of political developments , but even no visible danger of it . " Now , the question is not , let it be observed , whether all changes should be made by revolution , but whether any should be . Unless , therefore , the writers intend to say that this law of continuity should never be broken , an assertion , which would condemn " the glorious Revolution of 1688 , " and which without proof would be a palpable begging of the question , his allegation about the importance of gradual changes in the laws , is an empty truism , applicable to ordinary cases of legislation , but not pertaining to those emergencies in which the question of revolution arises . But if he does intend to say this , we may fairly demand the proof of the assertion . It is not selfevident . There is nothing in the law itself which makes it necessary . But let us look a little more carefully into this law of continuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis , is the action of mind upon mind . The law of continuity in political development is a law of development in moral beings . The development , then , is not under the control of the laws of organic life , but is the action of intellect and will . The contintiity of life in organic beings , it is true , can not be severed without // destroying their existence . But in man , as a spiritual being , there may be at once a complete change of all his l ) lirposes-a regeneration of the soul- " a solution of the continuity , " so far as that term is applicable at all , without any destruction of his spiritual nature . Why , then , may not states undergo an immediate and thorough revolution of fundamental laws , without destroying their being ? Revolution is not a mere destruction of material things , but a change of ideas , principles , purposes . Laws , constitutions , charters , are expressions of mind , whether of the individual man or of a body of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reside , has heretofore pursued his own interests , there is nothing in the nature of action in moral beings , which should prevent an immediate revolution of purpose , and the management of the government on entirely different principles . The reviewer refers to Aristotle , Bacon , Montesqnieu , and Burke , which would be all well enough , if his object were merely to prove that innovation in laws should in general be gradual . But Aristotle , in the very passage which the reviewer quotes , makes the distinction we are contending for . " There is no analogy , " lie says , " in innovating in an art and innovating in a law : inasmuch as law has no power of inducing obedience unless by habit ; and this can only be effected by lapse of time ; so that lightly to exchange the existing laws for other and new ones is to enfeeble the force of law . " True , " lightly ; "  --  but a revolution is *o light matter , and the fact that the people are determined to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already prepared to obey new laws and new institutions . Another argument of the reviewer , is drawn from the nature of government , and is stated in the language of Sir James Mackintosh : " that political constitutions are not made but grow . " We reply there is no necessity of growth being always continuous , and , therefore , if governments do grow , they may grow as really under the high temperature of revolution as under the ordinary one . Indeed we should like to know what is growth in the moral constitutions of states , if that complete change of ideas , principles and purposes , which in revolutions springs directly from the hearts of men , is not growth . If this is riot vital action , what is ? The growth may he gigantic , but still it is growth , nothing made , nothing imposed from without , but is a development from within . The reviewer proceeds with reference to the remark of Sir James Mackintosh , and says , " The figure is as logically just as it is felicitous in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felicity of a literal translation of nascitur , non fit ? ) - " since all such constitutions imply in common with other forms of organized life , perpetual processes of minute change and imperceptible assimilation of parts , and the pervading influence of a vital energy from within , turning blood into muscle , and cartilage // into bone-in other words , hardening ductile first impressions into solid habits of reverence arid affection to institutions . " This may pass for " just logic " with some , but never till they have identified " the blood and cartilage " of a man with his soul . Government is not " a form of organized life , " but a development of spiritual life . The life which belongs to it , is not the life which gives growth and form to the animal or the plant , but the life which rules in the soul . The life of the soul and the life of the body and of other organized existences , have many relations in common , on the ground of which it is usual , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there is one important respect in which they differ , and they differ precisely at the point where revolution begins . Organized life perishes in undergoing changes analogous to revolutions , but life in the soul of man admits even of entire regeneration and lives thereafter with greater vigor . We deny , therefore , that constitutions imply " perpetual processes of minute change " as the only mode of growth , for we deny that they are " organized beings . " We would not he misunderstood . We do not contend that there is not a great deal in the progress of laws arid constitutions , which may well be illustrated by a reference to organic life , nor do we object to calling government in popular language , " a form of organized life ; " we only guard against being misled by the analogy in an argument where it does not belong . rpj* reviewer of course must apply his reasoning to his own government . " It has been a very slowly developed growth of centuries . " " It is a pile " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or are they made ? ) - " majestic indeed , but of varying orders of architecture and of parts that have to be referred to the most widely distant eras ; much of it heavy with age and some of it the fresh looking masonry of yesterday . " " Still as in the human body , continuity and change have cooperated and secured substantial identity , by the simultaneous process of decay and reparation , it has been throughout different and yet the same . " We hardly know which is worse here , the confusion of thoughts or the confusion of figu*es , the logic or the rhetoric . We would like to ask now whether the civil wars in the time of Charles I , the Protectorate , arid the Revolution of 1688 , were assifnilated into this growth of centuries or not ? And if they were , whether this was not a growth produced " by an armed revolution , " and a very violent one too ? But if they were not , whether the English constitution is not an example of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results ? English writers are fond of speaking of the gradual growth of the British constitution . There never was a greater abuse of words . Its great improvements have been made at long intervals and by violent changes . Can we forget how Magna Charta was obtained ? Can // we forget the struggle between the Norman and the Saxon races , or the wars of the Roses ? Can we forget the violent confiscations of church property in the time of Henry VIII ? Can we forget the bloody wars of the seventeenth century ? Is it not notorious that it was not till England had gone through a series of improvements by " armed revolutions , " that she was in a position to make peaceful reforms ? Another argument of the writer is drawn from the anarchy of revolutions , and is expressed in the assertion that " to live under almost any authority is better than to live under none . " The fallacy here is almost too obvious to need pointing out . It is merely an ambiguous use of words . " To live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exist perpetually as a nation , but in the latter , to exist temporarily in the violent transition from one permanent state to another . Perpetual anarchy , if such a thing were possible , is worse than perpetual misgovernment ; for the farmer is only a more terrible despotism ; but , taking into view the whole character of a nation , the temporary evils arising from the overthrow of established government , may be trifling compared with what must be endured under continuous oppression . A day of revolution may be worse than a day of regulated tyranny , but not , therefore , worse than a century of unremitted evil . But the writer attempts to fortify this positicn by an induction of facts . He says , " Let any one calmly read and endeavor to realize the horrors of the Corcyrean sedition , Athens under the dominion of the Thirty , the state of Rome during the massacres of Sylla and Marius , England during the wars of the Roses , the condition of Paris under Robespierre , or the condition of Paris during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is the grossest thanklessness to talk of our having reached the maximum of misery-even in miserable Ireland . " Here then we are asked to compare the evils of revolution in the cases specified , with the evils of " almost any " government in the case of Ireland , which is doubtless brought forward as being in the view of the writer the hardest case of legalized misery which is to be found . We might object to some of the above examples as not relevant to the question , and we might ask why the wars of* the Roses are brought in and the civil wars of Charles I. left out ; but we accept the alternative , even with the disadvantage that it is much more difficult to realize the sufferings of steady , unremitted , familiar oppression than the horrors of a day , which are made to flash before the mind by the genius of the poet and the historian . But under every disadvantage we are willing to meet the case , and we say that the famine of Ireland , which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the omnipotence of the British Parliament , under which eight thousand landlords own the entire domain of the countrythat // famine , sweeping off its thousands , and tens of thousands , and hundreds of thousands , whose days of vigor and usefulness were not half spent , hurrying others by thousands into emigrant ships to die of the almost equally fatal ship-fever , and sucking out from a whole nation the sap of intellect and heart and affections , - is a misery , before which the miseries of Corcyra and Athens and Rome and England and Paris all together are nothing . The writer speaks of the insurrection of June in Paris , in which it is now ascertained not more than fifteen hundred persons were slain ; but more than that number have perished in a single county of Ireland under the quiet , peaceful operation of the British government . are astonished at the readiness with which the civilized world has acquiesced in the charge which the British press has brought against the providence of God in this matter . The miseries which have resulted to Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British bayonets , will yet stand forth as the giant evil in the history of the sufferings of civilized man . But leaving the reviewer for the present , we proceed to state and defend our own views . There is a mighty struggle going on in Europe , between the people and the privileged classes . It is desirable that we in this country should understand the real causes and aims of this contest , and not be misled by the sophistries and misrepresentations of British writers . An answer to the question , What is the end of government ? will give an answer to the other questions , Why are the people in arms ? and What do they seek ? The end of government has been expressed in various ways . " The greatest good of the greatest number , " is a favorite formula with many even among our countrymen , and yet it contains the foundation principle of all aristocracies , and all slavery . The greatest good of the greatest number to whom the greatest possible good may be secured , realized in government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest possible number in the whole community , may leave an inferior class without any good , and in practice is American slavery . For , we may suppose it possible , on the one hand , that by neglecting the interest of a large proportion of the people , and accumulating all advantages upon a few , individual men may have the fairest scope for developing their powers and may thus possess the greatest good of which humanity is capable ; and , moreover , that the number of these cases should be the greatest possible ; or , on the other hand , considering the amount of good which can be secured , a fixed quantity , we might state the problem of government under the maxim to be , to determine the greatest number which could be safely excluded from a share in any good , so that the remainder might have a greater share in the whole good . Indeed , it is contended by the philosophical statesmen of South Carolina , that it is necessary to // the existence of a republic , that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the work which is unbecoming a freeman . Theoretically speaking , there is a proportion between freemen and slaves , by which the greatest amount of good possible under any government will be distributed amongst the greatest number possible of individuals . Nor need it surprise us that this maxim gives its sanction to systems so opposite as English aristocracy and slaveholding republicanism . For the systems are the same . rflhe English landlord holds that England and the English government were made principaliy for himself and , if for others , only as subservient to himself . The American slaveholder thinks that republicanism was made for himself , and slavery for republicanism . The systems differ only in degree , the question of difference being , which excludes the most from the benefits of government , and which imparts to the outcasts the least amount of charity . The ultimate end of government , is , in the most generic expression of it , to do good to man , to bestow benefits upon all within its influence . It excludes no Pariah class : it cherishes no favored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each individual , but that it aims with a real intent to do some good , and the greatest good it can , impartially to each . Not , that it never inflicts evil , but evil only upon the wrong doer . Not , that it does not bestow superior offices upon some , but this it does , not from favoritism , or because , so to speak , it has more kindness for one than for another , but from the necessary inequalities of men . Government is like the providence of God , " which makes the sun to rise on the evil and on the good , and sendeth rain upon the just and on the unjust . " Indeed , the best treatise on the end of government is the Sermon on the Mount . We see not how there can be any difference of opinion as to what government should aim to do ; what man , as an individual , owes to his fellow man , true benevolence to all without exception , that the government , which is no mysterious being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , owes to all , the lowest as well as the highest , the bad as well as the good , with the assurance , however , that in this way , if in any , men can be made good citizens . Of course we here speak of what each particular government should aim at , not what any actually attains . It is because men feel these sentiments deep in their hearts , because they feel that they are wronged in being shut out from blessings which should be common to all , that they rise with arms in their hands to take that which is of right their own . Hence we can see what revolution aims at . Not at the destructioii of government , but at the perfection of government . Revolution is a forcible change of bad institutions for good ones , unequal laws for just ones , the accumulation of all advan // tages and privileges upon a few , for their distribution among many , or all . It pulls down , not to keep things in ruin , but that a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to injure them , but that they may not continue to injure others . It confiscates property , not to destroy property , but to increase it by a more general diffusion . It changes constitutions , not for the pleasure of change , but that better may take their place . It impairs individual welfare , not from delight iu evil , but because government has brought things to such a pass that otherwise there can be no general welfare . Iu a word , revolution destroys , not only because that which is destroyed has become worthless , but because it is only by destroying , it can build . Revolution acts , indeed , by force ; it is really , however , force against force . Law , when it is just , commends itself to every man 's conscience , and exerts its appropriate , peaceful sway over the mind . But law , which is unjust and oppressive , acts by force . It makes itself obeyed not by the inherent influence of justice , but by the dread of external compulsion ; so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the design to secure the peace and tranquillity which are sure to follow just laws . It never proceeds from hostility to law and order in themselves considered . For , it is not the violence and outrage of individuals ; it is the movement of the people , animated as if by the spirit of one man , which constitutes a revolution . This distinguishes it from a mob , which is the mere outbreak of a few individuals , unsupported by the feelings or the judgment of the nation . There may be individual acts of outrage , for oppression drives even wise men niad ; but if the surface of the water is agitated , it is not from the fitful breeze , but because the fountains of the great deep are stirred . So far are revolutions from originating in hostility to law and order , that the order , which has proceeded from them , has ever been the most stable , and the laws , which they have established , the cherished inheritance of the nation . Napoleon in the height of his power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which regulated the descent of real property by will . We acknowledge , that there are in revolutions great sufferings , violent outrages , awful crimes . But , besides that they are " transient , and , being limited both in number and duration , are not to be compared with the steady oppression of a whole people for centuries , they are fairly chargeable upon the previous government . " The reviewer referred to the " horrors of the Corcyrean sedition ; " but had he read the philosophical historian with candor , he would have seen that he traces out these enormities as the necessary result of oppression working upon the natural character of man . Indeed , this position might be demonstrated by an induction of facts . The first French revolution was attended by // unutterable horrors , because men had been made fiends by the wrongs they suffered the revolution of 1830 , and the last revolution , inflicted much less evil , because men had suffered much less . But after all , these violences make up but a small proportion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which should comprise , in any fair estimate of what it effects , both the violence of the transitionary state , and the permanent establishment of better laws and government . Indeed , we hardly know a better illustration of the mischief resulting from the ambiguous use of language than is afforded by this very word . It may be confined so as to mean onLy the temporary act of destroying , revolutionary violence ; or it may include , in addition , the permanent state of things , which takes the place of what is destroyed ; as when Englishmen speak of the revolution of 1688 . This affords a fine opportunity for sophistry . For , was it mere simplicity in the London Quarterly Review , to ask , almost at the outbreak of the late revolution in France , " Is property more assured ? " " Are persons and life more secure ? " " Are trade and commerce more thriving ? " One might as well stand over a man while the surgeon was amputating a limb to save his life , and ask with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less ? Do you feel any better for this ? How was it in England during the first years of the revolution to which Englishmen trace the final establishment of their civil liberty ? It is well known that the prosperity of England was at its very lowest ebb . But would it have been wise on this account to go back to the legitimate and hereditary tyranny of the Stuarts ? rp he London Quarterly is constantly preaching up reverence for the venerable institutions of England , just as if the present government was not a revolutionary government , rising out of the murderous civil wars carried on by the English people against the despotism of the Stuarts ; or , just as if Queen Victoria did not sit upon a throne which was erected by Cromwell , and that too upon the ruins of one which had been overthrown by revolutionary violence . But we would not have our readers suppose that we regard revolutions as good things in themselves . We defend them only as " the necessary means of the greatest good , " taking human nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Eklinburgh Review , to whom we now return , in his estimate of the importance of reform as distinguished from revolution . Indeed , we hold that the principle of providing in the constitutions of states for peaceful organic changes , to renew what is decayed and to engraft what an enlarged experience may require , is the greatest single advance which has ever been made in the improvement of the condition of man  --  and we claim the honor of it for our own country . Written constitutions , providing for their own reform , originated here ; and here then can be no sue Vor* . VII . 21 // cessful revolution . Even in England , reform is not the easy and natural action of the government . Every one of the great changes which have been brought about there in modern times , has been accomplished more or less under the pressure of threatened force . Was not the reform bill forced through the House of Lords ? and did not this same Q*narterly Review pronounce its passage , an act of revolution ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despotism and aristocracies must be revolutionized , and more than once , it may be , before they can be reformed . We do not object to reform ; on the contrary , we claim it as the peaceful , conservative remedy of freedom and the peculiar honor of free institutions . Nor do we object to English writers endeavoring to prevent revolutions in their own country ; and we hope they may effect such reforms that they shall not be needed . Bnt what we object to , is , that the whole moral power of England should be brought to bear against revolutions for freedom in other countries , where there is no other hope of improvement . Indeed , John Bull seems to have a special repugnance against any body having a revolution but himself . He has had the satisfaction of killing his tens of thousands on the field of battle in the strife for freedom ; he has banished one king and cut off the head of another ; he has confiscated property enough to furnish domains for scores of noble families ; but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoil to himself . No sooner does any nation attempt to follow the example which he gave to the world , than the whole island . or rather the English part of it , is alarmed , and government and people , through newspapers , reviews and Lord Palmerston , set to work to negotiate , to argue , and to sneer . But we must proceed to apply the general  |p4nci|ples  which we have laid down , to the late revolution in France ; nor , in our opinion , is that event of very difficult explanation . The revolutions of 1789 , of 1830 , and of 1848 , had the same cause , a determination on the part of the people to have a better government . The revolution of 1789 , was a struggle between the estates of the Nobles and Clergy , on the one hand , and the third estate of the people , on the other ; between 150,000 , who enjoyed all the blessings of government , and 24,000,000 , who bore its burdens . It opened upon France without a constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even after the restoration of the Bourbons , with a constitution , with a parliament , with electors . It found a population of more than 24,000,000 , borne down by oppressive taxation , harassed by feudal servitudes , cast out from the regards of government , and treated as beasts of burden to serve an insignificant caste of lordly masters ; it left them protected by law . It found more than two thirds of the whole domain of France in the possession of a very few families ; it // left the soil free to be owned by those who till it . We can not go into detail . But there is one single change made in the condition of France by this revolution , which , in its far reaching blessings through future ages , will more than counterbalance all the horrors endured during the transition from slavery to freedom ; horrors , however , which are justly attributable to the previous degradation of the people . We refer to the fact , that there are 5,500,000 land-owners in France , making the proprietary class amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of the population . But not to dwell upon this , the revolution of 1789 in France , originated from the same ultimate cause , and aimed at the same end as the civil xvars of the 17th century in England ; and they wrought for France , we believe , even as great blessings as did those wars for England . The revolution of 1830 originated from the same cause , and had the same end in view . The government of the restoration was condncted for the sake of the rulers and a privileged class , and not for the people . The people , therefore , reclaimed the privileges which had been taken from them , and secured by a stronger guarantee , as they supposed , the protection of a free government . In principles , in aim and in the means used , it was precisely like the English revolution , which expelled James IL , and raised to the throne William of Orange . The revolution of 1848 , had the same cause and the same object . The king reigned for Louis Philippe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France . France had lost her confidence in his sincerity . She feared his cunning , and to defend with jealous vigilance her hard-won freedom , she drove him from the throne . It was only another manifestation of the determination of the people to continue to enjoy the blessings of a government made for the people . It was just such a revolution as England would have had long before this , if her nobility had not wisely granted the reforms which the people demanded . But there was another cause of the late revolution , secondary though important , which must not be overlooked . This cause was the conviction widely diffused in the minds of men , that the hired laborer does not receive for his toil a proportionate amount of the blessings of life , compared with what the employer receives for his capital . The question has been raised whether they who are hired to do the work which is necessary to the production of the material comforts and luxuries of life , are as well off as they deserve to be , and whether they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively better off than they deserve to be . The science of political economy , founding its principles on the ordinary motives under which man acts , has given scope for a wonderful development of the energies of the human race ; and every thing in modern society tends to give // facility for the accumulation of vast fortunes by individuals . But still there is a question whether the condition of the laborer is what it ought to be . We can not enter upon its discussion , but we claim that the question itself is neither insignificant nor absurd , but one of vast importance , worthy to be grappled with by the greatest minds , and commending itself to the purest philanthropy . We acknowledge that this question of labor was an important element in the late revolution . It is also a new element . The first revolution aimed to make more common the blessings to be derived from the ownership in real property ; the present , on the part of some of its supporters , to make more common the accumulation of personal property : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a monied one . It may be remarked , moreover , that the republicanism of France has always looked more to a social equality than our own . The French are not so easily satisfied as we are with a mere legal equality . We do not deny but that the social republicans , for we acknowledge the existence of such a sect , settled the question of a republic by their decision and energy in the early struggle against the king . But was this the whole of the revolution ? Was not the act of the whole people , in electing members of an assembly to forin a republican constitution , a part of it ? Is not the constitution itself , which they formed and which rejects the extravagances of the social reformers , a part of it ? Is not the recent election of a President by seven millions of votes , a part of it ? And are not these facts a proog that it was the determination of the people to have a government for the people , and not the visionary philanthropy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole movement ? Such , we believe , is a fair statement of the new revolvitionary element and of the part it played in the late struggle in France . We freely acknowledge that there have sprung up in connection with this question of labor , some of the most absurd schemes which ever entered even the wildest imagination . They were fair game and deserved to be laughed out of the world . We acknowledge , too , that the rash experiments of the Provisional Government merit grave rebuke  --  but not from English wi'iters , whose government did the very same thing in Ireland , the only difference being that the number of persons employed in the " Ateliers Nationaux " of Ireland was 800,000 , while in those of Paris , it was 120,000 . But since the people of France , in the election of members of the Assembly , which was the very first opportunity they had of expressing their opinions , repudiated both the theories and the practice of the Socialists , and since they have continued to do so till this hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can see no apology for // any one 's continuing to cast upon the French Republic the opprobrium of St. Simonism and Fourierism . We have thus stated what appear to us to be the causes of the last French revolution . We have not space to examine in detail the causes which have been alleged by the English reviews . The Edinburgh Review , in April , lays the whole blame upon the Socialists , but in July , after that party has been overthrown in the elections , it is manifestly very much puzzled how to account for it , but finally has recourse to that convenient refuge , a mob . We are willing to leave this opinion to rest on its own inherent merit . But we should have thought better of the writer if he had not been guilty of the dishonest artifice of trying to identify republicanism with socialism . With the Q*uarterly Review , the revolution is " a mob , " " a comparatively orderly riot , " " the accide tal audacity of a dozen obscure agitators , the spawn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or forty incendiaries , " another eruption of the volcano of 1789  --  a revolution without the pretext of a cause . " Of the revolution of 1789 there were visible and substantial causes , " - already we see the old revolution begins to grow venerable in the eyes of the Quarterly , and if it were a century older , it would be hoary enough , we doubt not , to be an object of prescriptive reverence ' - " for that of 1830 , plausible pretences ; for this of 1848 there were neither . " Has not Louis Philippe advanced the internal prosperity of France in a remarkable degree ? Was it not this " magnificent benefactor , " who renovated and repaired Versailles with such a profusion of expense ? Had not the people enough to eat and to drink , even more perhaps than the peasantry and operatives of England itself ? Were there not two hundred and forty thousand voters out of thirty-four millions of people ? Were there more than one hundred and fifty placemen and officials out of four hundred and sixty members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not " respectable persons " enough to fill these offices after that " the legitimist country gentlemen " had declined sitting in the new chamber ? And was not this being a great deal better off than England in the reigns of George I. and George II , when there were two hundred and seventy-one placemen in the parliaments of the former , and two hundred and fifty-seven in those of the latter , out of five hundred and fifty-eight ? And was not the amount of corruption under Louis Philippe as small as it conveniently can be under any government ? as small even as it is in England , if the secrets of Downing-street were to be revealed ? But after all there must be some cause even of a mob . And what does the reader suppose is the grand secret , which is to account for all the disturbances of the reign of Louis Philippe , and for his final expulsion from the throne ? He wanted that which can neither // be " won by courage , nor forfeited by weakness , " - he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , he wanted precisely what William of Orange and all his successors have wanted , and what the late Emperor of Austria did not want . All these articles in the Quarterly Review are written with point , and are extremely piquant and interesting . They are somewhat more courtly , but otherwise they are in the style of the better sort of our stump oratory , in a warmly contested presidential campaign . Every little thing is turned to account . Personal scandal is gladly caught at . A great many good hits are made , and there are some very felicitous perversions . For example , there came before the police courts a few cases of robberies committed in the Tuileries , while the people were in possession of it ; a good deal is made of this to discredit the revolution . Citizen Carnot , it seems , had given one office to his brother , and another to his cousin ; this to be sure is not forgotten , and it is not overlooked that in the lists of appointments there are " four Aragos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &amp;c . " We have heard almost as much said of President Polk . The crowds of hungry applicants for the spoils , are described to the life , and we must confess it came home to us as a satisfactory evidence that there is a veritable republic in France . The private letters of Louis Philippe and his family , it seems , have been published ; a good deal of proper indignation is expended upon the transaction . " No member of the provisional government had any more right to appropriate , either for his own party purposes or for the profit of a literary friend , the late Duke of Orleans ' private letters , than Boutron , le Parisien , had to the Duchess of Orleans ' necklace . " The writer then proceeds to make use of these same private letters , and with considerable dexterity , against Thiers and Lamartine . Would he also have taken in pawn the necklace ? But it is not our intention to mount the stump in reply . We can not , however , quit the subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewer advances in favor of " the inherent , hereditary birthright of legitimacy . " He is performing the part of a prophetic seer ; and beholding the republic destroyed , and the nation , wearied of revolution , returning to monarchy , he is not unnaturally solicitous to determine who the monarch should be , and as naturally conies to the conclusion that he must be the legitimate heir of the throne of Louis XVI ; and for reasons always powerful , but to which the expulsion of Louis Philippe only because he had not " the inherent hereditary birthright of legitimacy , " gives " unanswerable force . " He anticipates some opposition to this principle , and proceeds to answer what he supposes will be the chief objection . " Why , they ask us , submit to the rule of a woman or a child rather than select // the fittest man ? " He states the question in this way , we suppose , in order to embrace all the contingencies of the case , and yet he has left out the most important contingency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyrant , on which snpposition it might be somewhat harder to answer the question why submit to the rule of such an one rather than select the fittest man But taking his own statement of the question , let us consider the replies which he makes . We should thus submit , he says , " because , in the first place , experience has shown that nations may be great and happy under women and children . When was England more powerful than under Elizabeth and Anne ? When was France happier than when Fleury directed the counsels of young Louis XV ? " We acknowledge that the queens of England have been superior to her kings both in intellect and judgment ; and if a monarchy was sure of always having queens , or if a regency was sure of being always conducted by a Cardinal Fleury , it might diminish the weight of the objection . The writer proceeds : " And this objection has become still weaker in the modern exercise of constitutional monarchy by responsible advisers . " So far as regards " children , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . if there had been an infant on the throne at several periods in the reign of George III , England would have been spared many calamities , and would sooner have settled the question which her recent reforms have decided , and decided for ever , that the king of England is not a veritable man , but a man of straw . Our principal objection would be on account of the children themselves , for if we remember rightly some passages in the history of England , more than one has been made way with by the murderous hands of an usurping uncle . But the writer is not altogether satisfied with this reason , and he proceeds to what he calls a better one : " it is safer to accept from the hand of God the risk attending a woman or a child , than to incur the spontaneous danger of cutting one another 's throats in deciding who is the fittest man . " But have there not been a good many throats cut in England from first to last in determining which of two contending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ? We should have supposed that ' the wars of the Roses could not have been kept long enough out of the memory of the writer to allow him to pen the sentence . On the contrary , in well established republics , how much precisely is this danger of cutting one another 's throats . We in this country have made a selection several times without suffering such a calamity , although perhaps we have not always chosen the fittest man . Seven millions of voters have just done the same thing in France with entire safety to their throats , though the person selected may not be much better than the majority of heaven-descended rulers.
