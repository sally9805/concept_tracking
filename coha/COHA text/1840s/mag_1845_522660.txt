txt IN our country , individual success and eminence , and social improvement , have been to an indefinite degree retarded by two bad habits prevalent in all classes of society . One is the habit of entering upon an avocation or profession without a competent preliminary education ; the other , that of changing professions at pleasure , so that a man of seventy years of age xviii often have pursued from two to five or six different callings at different periods of his life . To these wasteful habits , there is a tendency to add a third , derived from the earliest and most barbarous ages , that o fcombiningseveral professions in the same person at the same time . Believing that these habits , and the notions on which they are based , are false in theory , and radically bad in practice , we design , in the present article , to maintain in opposition to them the following propositions : -1 . Every man ought to be thoroughly educated for his profession or calling , whatever it be . 2 . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 3 . No man should statedly exercise more than one calling at a time . These propositions may seem obvious ; yet our readers will see , we think , in the sequel , that they need reiteration and enforcement . I. Every man ought to be thoroughly educated for his profession or calling , whatever it be . We might make a general division of the different callings exercised in a community into mechanical and liberal , or those which are exercised chiefly by hand-labor , and those which are exercised mainly by mental labor , the results of which are made available by the voice and the pen-both classes equally necessary and honorable , both equally needing and rewarding mental energy and attainments , but differing from each other in their processes . For these callings there is , or ought to be , a preliminary education both general and particular ; and both are with sad frequency neglected or slighted . For professions exercised by handlabor , the general education is furnished by our common schools ; and they are very far from furnishing the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of education is worthy of the schoolmen of the Middle Ages , who deemed words , not ideas or facts , the prime objects of knowledge . A great part of the time spent at school is spent in the acquisition by rote of words without meaning ,  --  a process , in which no faculty of mind , except the memory , is exercised . For years , often , the scholar is made to recite daily from the Dictionary a series of definitions , frequently less intelligible than the words defined ,  --  not unfrequentlywholly void of meaning to the pupil , while he well knows the signification of the words defined . For instance , every child knows the meaning of the word network ; but not one gray-haired man in a hundred could deduce any possible signification from Johnson 's accurate definition of it : " Anything reticulated or decussated at equal distances , with intercesses between the intersections . " This example will show how much connection there is between the studying of definitions ( so called ) and learning the meaning of words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , results from what is called the study of Grammar , which a boy , six years old , is often obliged to commence , in which he has a weary exercise every subsequent day of his school life , and at length leaves school with no more idea of the purpose , for which his Grammar was written , than if it had been in Chinese or Sanscrit . The exercise is , at first , the committing to memory of a technical jargon , entirely beyond his power of comprehension ; and , afterwards , the mechanical repetition of certain stereotyped formulas , concerning the separate words in Young 's Night Thoughts , or Pope 's Essay on Man , ( commonly called parsing , ) whereas a fourth part of the time spent in conversation with his teacher , or in reading , or trying to write good English , would give him ten times the knowledge of his mother tongue , which he thus attains . Practical grammar is best acquired by the eye and ear-may be imbibed , without express study , by familiarity with good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain or weariness ; but the theory of grammar can not be attained by him who is conversant with one language only . Grammar is , no less than physiology , a comparative science , and the principles and laws of one 's own // language can be understood and accounted for only by him who has studied other languages in connection with it , and has thus formed an idea of what is essential to all languages and what is peculiar to his own . For this acquisition of hard , and to him unmeaning words , let us now see what the future farmer or mechanic foregoes . In the first place , he is generally taught nothing of natural history , or science . He is to earn his livelihood by directing the vital energies , or the mechanical or chemical forces of nature . Soils , earths , metals , woods , alkalies , acids- these are the materials on which , or with which , or to produce which , the labors of his future life are to be spent . Yet , in most cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been put in possession of a single fact or principle in geology , chemistry , or natural philosophy ; without any knowledge of the structure of his own planet , or of any of its component elements ; without the slightest comprehension of any of the laws or processes which nature lends to art , and by which alone the soil can be made productive , or handicraft successful . No wonder that our farmers so often dress and sow their land at haphazard , change crops at a venture , and transmit effete and sterile acres to their posterity . No wonder that , in American manufactures , colors so often fade , and cements part , andfabrics shrink . No wonder that the ill-made bears so alarming a proportion to the well-made , and that the honesty and good faith of the manufacturer are often Ao guarantee for the excellence of his wares . Another necessary element of education for the future farmer or mechanic is almost excluded from our common schools , namely-geometry , the science of measure and proportion , essential to educate the eye , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symmetry , tastefulness and elegance to the planning and finishing of innumerable products of industry ,  --  essential also , in many departments of labor , to a contractor 's preliminary crdcnlations , that he may defraud neither himself nor his employer . In the Prussian Common School system , both the departments of knowledge now named , are deemed no tess indispensable , than readingand writing ; and we trust that the time will soon arrive , when no District School in our own country will graduate its pupils without them . Another enormous deficiency in most of our common schools is , that they make no provision for instructing and exercising their pupils in English composition . This is indeed unnecessary for one who is willing to be a mere drudge of the farm or the workshop . But no young man should regard this as his destiny . Every one should expect to rise , by degrees , into the higher walks of his profession , to conduct its more extended operations , and to take his well-earned place among citizens of merit , standing and influence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , must write ,  --  he must write business letters , if nothing else ; and , if incapable of making a respectable appearance on paper , he may meet with countless drawbacks and embarrassments , may lose opportunities for improving his condition , and may be permanently kept back in the rear ranks of his calling or profession . But a well-indited letter is always a letter of recommendation for the writer , and has , in many instances , been the proximate cause of eminent success and good fortune . While , in these and other respects , those who are to exercise agricultural and mechanical callings ought to he well educated , let them also regard a prolonged and thorough apprenticeship to the future business of life as essential to ultimate success and respectability . In some of the countries of Europe , no man can establish himself in his trade , without having gone through a prescribed period and mode of apprenticeship ; and , in Germany and Belgium , it was formerly the universal custom , ( and it is still frequently done , ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade so far as his master could teach it , to visit the several places where his trade is best understood , and to work as a journeyman for a few weeks or months at each , so as to get an insight into whatever might facilitate the processes , or improve the manufactures , in which he was engaged . With us , on the other hand , the old rules and habits of apprenticeship are almost broken up . The seven years ' novitiate has dwindled into four , three , and two . Nay , we sometimes hear of a young man 's learning as much of a trade as he can in a still less period , and then establishing himself in business , with this fragmentary stock of knowledge and skill . Now there is no doubt , that the principal operations of every trade may be learned in a few months , and that , after a very short apprenticeship , one may seem to work suffi // sufficiently well to be his own master . But there are a thousand little things , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight touches , delicate finishings , which can be learned only by one 's laboring long under the eye of a man of experience and skill . They are things , which a master could not call to mind , so as to tell or show them to those under his instruction at any particular time , but into the knowledge of which the apprentice would grow gradually and almost imperceptibly . And these little things often colstitute nearly half the value of a well-made article . To take the item of cabinet furniture for an illustration , the actual value , as determined by their durability , of equally well looking articles , is nearly or quite doubled by the application of care and skill to minute details , which would be thought of only by a thoroughly trained workman . Every gentleman knows too , that a coat , made by a tailor who thoroughly understands his business , will wear and look well nearly twice as long , as one made by an awkward and inexperienced tailor . It is chiefly on account of difference in the thoroughness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , while others can get very little to do . These last have been found out . They are never employed a second time by the same person , whereas , two or three years more of boyhood devoted to the acquisition of their trades , would have made them prosperous for life . In agriculture , the sons of farmers commonly learn , during their minority , as much as their fathers can teach them ; but the general establishment of agricultural schools , with competent professors of natural science and its various practical applications , with model fields and experimental gardens , would be of inestimable value in raising the profession , both in an economical and intellectual point of view . It is no doubt known to many of our readers , that the most munificent provision has been made for the establishment of an agricultural school , on the plan of the celebrated Fellenberg Institution , in Switzerland , under the auspices of Harvard University , by the will of the late Benjamin Bussey , of Roxhury , Massachusetts . We are fully authorized by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the application of scientific principles and the use of improved modes of tillage , the cultivated lands of our Atlantic states , might , on an average , at less than twice the present annual outlay , be made to yield ten times their present annual revenue . We have thus spoken of the least education , which a farmer or mechanic ought to have . Let it not be supposed , however , that we regard the highest possible intellectual culture as misplaced , sunk or wasted in these professions . A thorough classical or literary education might not indeed enable one to increase his crops or to manufacture a better style of goods ; but it would contribute vastly to his personal happiness , to his social influence , and to the intelligent discharge of the various duties and trusts that devolve on him as a parent , friend , neighbor and citizen . We heartily wish that many of the graduates of our colleges , instead of swelling the already crowded ranks of the ( so called ) liberal professions , would turn their attention to the class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exhibit sound and various learning as the accomplishment of the individual man , and not simply as a prescribed routine of preparation for a particular walk in life . Should such instances hereafter become frequent , they would have a direct and irresistible influence in eradicating the absurd and antirepublican idea , imported from the artificial state of society in the old world , that a man 's respectability depends in anywise on what he does , and not on what he is . We pass now to the education of candidates for what are called the learned professions , which number , no doubt , as many ignorant and unqualified pretenders , as they do fit and worthy members , For these we would place the standard of general education very high ; and , as we must make a selection from among the many topics that present themselves , we propose to speak particularly of the importance of a thorough classical education to the members of these professions . We choose this topic the rather , because we apprehend that the current of general feeling is setting strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we might adduce the fact , that the oldest and best endowed literary institution in the county now suffers its pupils to suspend Latin and Greek , if they choose , after a single year 's study . Our age is utilitarian in the most grovelling sense of the word ; and the community at large can see no use in the consumption of months and years of study upon dead languages , and the literature of nations long since extinct . Let us then see what these languages // and their literature can do for the clergyman and the lawyer . They are to be both writers and speakers , and as such , should be accomplished in the arts of persuasion . To this end , they must he well acquainted with the structure , powers and resources of their native tongue , which no man can be , who is not conversant with other languages than his own , and , especially , who is not conversant with those classic tongues , whence the English has derived so many of its words and idioms . These languages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , derived from various and unlike sources , were fused by glowing ages of eloquence and song , into entire congruity of form and feature ; and , by being , in the popular phrase , dead languages , are endowed with an unchanoino* life , and therefore are more capabl* of rigorous analysis , and afford better illustrations of the laws of universal grammar , than the modern tongues , which still bear conspicuous marks of their miscellaneous origin , and which are varying their rules and idioms from year to year . Then , too , the public speaker needs a diction , at once concise and flexible , full of vigor , nerve and point , and at the same time adapting itself with ease to every class of subjects , occasions or audiences ; and how can he better acquire such a diction than by familiarity with those noble ancient tongues  --  the one hearing in every word the signature of a severe , majestic simplicitythe other , many voiced , yet never losing its identity , shaping its elastic idioms to every conceivable mode of grandeur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models in oratory , we know not how one who would rise above mediocrity , can dispense with the study of those old orators , who could hold in check , and sway , at will , the fierce , multitudinous democracies of Greece and Rome ; nor can the public speaker find , anywhere among modern writers , the minute , exhausting analysis of the kinds , modes , instruments , sources and topics of argument and appeal , which Cicero and Quintilian furnish , so that it is hardly too much to term their rhetorical works essential parts of the training of those , who , by speech or writing , are to mould the decisions , sentiments and characters of the few or the many . Again : Man should he the constant study both of the lawyer and the preacher . They both need a familiar acquaintance with the human condition and character , with the existing elements of civilization and progress , with the springs of public and individual sentiment and action . The preacher must know men as they are , to give aim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it is only by the same kind of knowledge , that the lawyer can adapt his style and topics of illustration and argument to the stupidity which he must penetrate , the prejudices which he must remove , or the sound sense and wakeful intellect which he must convince or persuade . Now , as each individual is the aggregate or result of all that he has been , so does the whole past enter into the present condition of the race . Nothing is so truly living as the past . It gives shape , and hue and breath to the present . Thought , once uttered , written or acted , never dies . The past , which is finished , interprets the present , which is unfinished . The present exhibits phenomena , the past shows whence they come and why they are . He then , who omits from his familiar knowledge , any extensive or emphatic chapter of the past , fails to comprehend the present . But the history and culture of Greece and Rome , next to those of Juden , do form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Greek , the Roman mind , each has left traces of itself , too deeply engrayen for time or change to obliterate them . We must study their records , that we may identify in our own age , their ideas and sentiments , the effects of their institutions , the fruits of their culture . There are peculiar reasons , why the teacher of religion should be a classical scholar . He is the interpreter of God to man ; and all God 's Scriptures should be his familiar study . God writes all history . Every chapter , every phasis of human condition , every political revolution , every form of culture , bears not only the impress of human wisdom or folly , virtue or guilt , but also the venerable handwriting of Divine Providence . In the condition and destinies of nations and of races there is as clear and full a revelation of the attributes of the Almighty , as there is in the vast and glorious works of nature . Thus , for religious teaching , the past holds to the present a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apostles . Viewed in this aspect , the finished records of Greek and Roman civilization , arts , science , domestic and social life , spanning as they do the most brilliant and eventful centuries of the world 's history , furnish an exhaustless repertory of religious counsel and wisdom-an expanded commentary upon Divine revelation  --  a vast , // 417 illuminated , authentic display of the eternal principles on which God governs the world . Again : there is an important sense , in which classical literature is in itself eminently religious . It is indeed full of darkness and of error , on the great themes of God , of human nature and the unexjilore* future ; and many of its pages consecrate vice , deify brutal passion , and minister to unholy appetite . But we look in vain through the classics for that religious indifference , for that entire exclusion of all reference to the higher relations and destiny of man , which marks so much of the literature of modern Christendom . We do not believe that , in times and lands characterized by secular civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifference is a possible thing . There must needs be , in such a state of society , an earnest craving and yearning for spiritual truth ,  --  a longing to penetrate the veil of sense and the darkness of the grave-to answer the questions , which cultivated man can not help asking , " Whence am I , and whither ? Am I the creature of chance , and the plaything of irresponsible fate , or the child of a Supreme Intelligence , and the heir of a higher destiny ? " These inquiries have been answered by an express mission from the throne of the Eternal ; and vast numbers now fold their hands in easy indifference , content to know the path of immortality without trea ( ling it . But of such questionings , the classic writers are full . Even the most licentious of them express a longing for light and truth , for a supreme law of ( luty , for a voice to break the eternal silence , and to reveal the vast unseen and unknown . Even those of them that are termed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of l ) OPular idolatry , and are endeavoring to construct out of the chaos of exploded superstitions and philosophies , some more rational and coherent exposition of the great mysteries of life and nature . Now it is to these writers , not to modern unbelievers , who have borrowed light from that Sun of righteousness , which they would quench ,  --  it is to the classics , that we must go , to learn what the religion of nature is . We find it written out in detail iu their history , their philosophy , their poetry ; and every item of it is pointed with an interrogation mark . It is , throughout , a religion of questionings , of yearnings ,  --  a " feeling after God , if haply they may find him , " a " longing after immortality , " an earnest desire for light upon the path of duty , nay , in some striking and beautiful instances , a confession of darkness , and a humble prayer that some guide for benighted man may come forth from the EternalThrone . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item of it pointed with a full stop , was given man as a counterpart to the interrogative religion of nature , to answer his questionings , to solve his doubts , to satisfy his longings . We can then hardly have a better guide in our study of the records of revelation , than the anatomy of the human heart in its days of darkness and of need . We learn from this anatomy precisely what man 's wants were , how various , how complex , how deep . We gain an accurate knowledge of the needs and demands , which revelation was designed and adapted to meet ,  --  of the ground which it was to cover . And , as human nature is the same in all ages , though its inmost structure is no longer laid bare to our view by its moral destitution and neediness , we may learn from this study what Christianity has done and is now doing for the soul of man , yea , even for the unthankful and rebellious , though a hundred fold more for the believing and obedient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value to set and formal theological treatises ; none whatever to bodies of divinity-aptly so called from their lack of soul . There are certain works of philology and archnology , which are essential aids in the critical study of the Scriptures ; but the next place to these on the clergyman 's table , we would assign to Horace , Cicero and Seneca . Not that they will he , in any sense or degree , his authoritative instructors in truth or duty ; but they will constantly suggest questions , which he will go to the Bible to have answered . They will reveal states of mind , doubts , difficulties , for which he must seek the solution in the records of inspiration . They will enlarge to his eye the scope of revelation . They will make him feel the folly of any system of baptized rationalism or naturalism . They will impress upon his mind the truth , to sound philosophy , of a simple , childlike faith in prophecy and miracle . They will echo in his ear the voice that came from heaven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " They will draw from his own heart the echo of the apos // tIe 's words , " Lord , to whom shall we go ? Thou hast the words of eternal life . " The lawyer too , for special reasons , needs this same classical training . Of many maxims , principles and rules of law , he can trace the history , only by going back to the laws of Solon , Lycurgus , or the Twelve Tables . The common law of England , the basis of our own legal precedents , though usually deemed of Anglo-Saxon origin , with accretions of Norman growth , bears not a few traces of Roman jurisprudence , and must date back its rude beginnings to the age when Britain was a Roman province . Then too , the civil law , which forms the basis of the jurisprudence of one of our States , and portions of which are fast working their way into the statute law of others , can not be studied or understood by merely reading the Pandects of Justinian . Law is never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of a nation is an epitome of its history . There was not a revolution of the Roman state , not a faction of the early republic , not a Latin epic poem , tragedy or comedy , not a phasis of Roman culture or refinement , which formed not a constituent factor of Justinian 's code . No man , then , can understand the civil law , except by entering into intimate communion with the mighty Roman mind in the days of its vigor and its glory . For the physician also , a similar classical training should be deemed indispensable . His profession has its technical phraseology , which he can understand only by conversance with the ancient languages . It has also its authentic history , which abuts upon -- its semi-fabulous yetinstructtive history , which spans  --  the classic ages . The physician 's business too , is with man , and not with man as a mere animal , but equally with the living spirit , with the unceasing mutual intersection of mind and body with the soul 's mysterious maladies ; and whatever reveals man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of his culture . Then too , the physician 's position in society , the intimate and delicate relation in which he stands to individuals and families of the highest purity of taste and refinement of character , the power , which , for good or evil , he may in ways without number exert by his speech and manners ; the necessity for his successful practice , that he should be confided in as an intelligent and cultivated man ,  --  these considera tions , and many others , point out for him a standard of general education not one whit below the highest . Indeed , if there be a class of men , on whom we have a right to look with contempt , those , who have enjoyed the professional services of physicians of large mind , and liberal tastes , and whole , warm hearts , can hardly fail to regard with scorn the too numerous class of mere adroit medical practitioners , who can blister , bleed and purge , but could not minister to a mind diseased ,  --  who make their profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manners of an Unnurtured boor upon scenes , where every utterance , gesture , thought and feeling should be gentle as the breath of heaven . From these remarks , it may be inferred , that we would place very far along in the course of a liberal education the point at which candidates for the learned professions shall diverge from each other , to commence special preparation for the business of their coming lives . Let the established and required course of professional studies be also prolonged , exact and thorough . The very nature and rank of these professions demand this . The clerical profession has for its text-book a volume , which claims and rewards the profoundest study of the longest life ; and , though its more obvious and essential doctrines and precepts may be promptly apprehended even by the unlettered , the teacher of religion should be able to interpret its dark passages , to defend its truths and its records from cavil and scepticism , and to hold them up for the adoring admiration of the indifferent and the scoiThr . There are indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good ; but they do harm also . They degrade , in the eyes of some , the religion which they make precious to others . Their rude rhetoric and lame logic put gibes into the mouth of the scoffer . Their feeble defences and unauthentic statements , while they satisfy the credulous and submissive intellect , drive those of keener vision into doubt and unbelief . " True it is , " writes a quaint old divine , " God stands in no need of any man 's parts or abilities ; much less does he stand in need of any man 's ignorance , incapacity , self-conceit and vanity ; nor has he anywhere encouraged the use of these latter qualities in the business of religious instruction , nOw that miracles have ceased , though he was once pleased by miracle to give elocution // to a stupid quadruped , to rebuke the madness of a wicked prophet . " The study of the law also covers a vast extent , and in its practice involves , not only the highest earthly well-being of the individual , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sources too , of the physician 's education are exhaustless and infinitely varied , while his personal life is full of emergencies , demanding all the available apparatus of scientific knowledge , and of the treasured experience and skill of those who have preceded him . But we must suspend our remarks on these professions ; nor have we space to speak in detail of mercantile education , which , both general and specific , can not he too extensive or too thorough . Commerce , conducted hy merchants worthy of the name , is , in the best sense of the words , a liberal profession , and has adorned itself in our cities by illustrious examples of intelligence , uprightness and princely generosity , while , when its escutcheon has been stained , it has generally been by intrusive members of the profession , who have embarked in it , with no fitness , either mental , educational or moral , to conduct its operations , or to subdue and scorn its temptations . There are three numerous and unlike professions , in which we , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the incumhents . Under one of these we would group the various classes of persons employed in steam navigation . It is universally conceded , that , in the application of science to steam navigation , our country is second to none ; and yet appalling and fatal accidents from steam occur among us with startling frequency , while on board of French and English steam-vessels they are extremely rare . This difference is not to be ascribed to the different characters of those to whom the management of this fearful agent is entrusted . In England and France , the qualifications of engineers , pilots , and commanders , are submitted to the severest and most searching tests , while , in this country , such tests are nowhere employed ; nor are there any means for enforcing their employment ; and , though on our Eastern routes of steam navigation , care is generally taken to select competent persons for the more important offices , if report speaks the truth , there is a vast amount of reckless and guilty negligence in this matter on our Western waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can judge only from report ; but of western captains we have had opportunities of personal observation . We have stood on the deck of a huge and crowded steamboat , with its freight of hundreds of precious lives pouring over the gangway , the furnace fires glowing and roaring , the steam fuming , snortin0 , and hissing , shaking its prison walls , storming every valve and orifice , like a maniac giant in a wicker cageand , when we have made diligent inquiry for the chief keeper , whose word , whose every look should control every underkeeper , and check every movement of the prisoner 's fiery pulse , we have seen him the most insignificant man on board , of stolid countenance and slouching gait , his whole bearing and manner pointing him out as fit to be but a mere woodheaver , or man of all work , fore and aft With such a commander , we have felt that the lack of one controlling voice and mind , might , of itself , tell the whole shameful story , should scattered limbs and bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a. profession involving such tremendous risks , the most peremptory legislation ought to scourge ignorance , incapacity and stupidity , from every place of trust and control , and to put there only those who can count and calculate every throb in the giant 's veins , as the skillful physician does the pulses of his patient . Another very different profession , of which we have almost no properly educated members , is , that of the statesman and legislator . The Athenians chose their generals from the mass of the people by popular election ; arid a shrewd philosopher once proposed that they should vote their asses horses , so easy did they find it to transform men by their vote . We make statesman and lawgivers out of anything , and everything ; and seem to think , that because a man has been successful and eminent in any profession whatever , he is therefore , fit to make or administer our laws , and to adjust the most complex international relations . " He has made glass , or cotton goods , " we say ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes ,  --  he has treated patients ,  --  he has slaughtered Indians ,  --  with eminent success ; therefore , let us send him to Congress , or make him Governor or President , Secretary of State , or a Foreign Envoy . " In point of fact , a man 's eminence in any one profession , is proof positive that he has so concen // trated his energies on that one , as to be well fitted for that alone . Even the successful lawyer , as such , is no statesman . Because he can interpret , he is not therefore capable of originating laws . Because he can manage the interests of a simple client , he is not therefore fit to guide the state . Because he can convince a jury of plain , sober , honest Yankees , it does not follow that he can play at fast and loose with the practised diplomatists of St. James and St. Cloud . It is because our statesmen are made as the Athenian generals were , that we have such reckless tampering with laws and vested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our public affairs - such daubing with untempered mortar of every seam and cranny in the ship of state . We have not the faith of a hackneyed partisan in the total depravity of this or that political party . But we have unlimited faith in the incompetency of public agents , chosen without reference to their attainments in political history and science . On the floor of Congress , there are gravely debated , every session , points in political economy which have been deemed seftled beyond dispute , among those versed in the science of government , ever since the days of Adam Smith . The law-maker , the statesman , the diplomatist , ought to be acquainted with the history of governments and of theories of government , with the principles and the postulates of international law , with the whole science of political economy , and with the legislative action of former times and other nations . Were our people once to demand such men for the places in their gift , the demand would create the supply . The same men , who now leave no stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upturned , would then seek place and its emoluments , not , as now , by canvassing votes and swelling the breeze of popular clamor , but in the seclusion of libraries ,  --  - in tranquilizing , elevating communion with the mighty dead , and with the illustrious living-by dignified communicationsthrough the press , in which the wisdom of the past and the present would be solicited to solve the knotty points at issue between contending parties , to balance precedents , and to establish the right and the true . However solicitous to rise , they would then bide their time , and wait , perforce , to be sought ought , and to have office tendered them as the due meed of patient self-culture and well attested merit . For my third instance , I would class , as belonging to one profession , the various subordinate public functionaries connected with the collection and disbursement of our revenue . To make their offices a party football , is to put them , with every change of administration , into less and less faithful and competent hands : for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon find cut that the prize is not worth the game . We charge the greatly increased losses of government , of late years , through mismanagement and default , not upon the profligacy of one or the other political party , but upon the introduction into these branches of the public administration , by one of the great political parties , of a system under which no party can be well served . It is fit , indeed , that the leading and responsible places near the executive chair be filled by those who sympathize with the Chief Magistrate in his political theories . It is fit , also , that those connected with the various branches of revenue , and thus brought into contact with all classes of citizens , should not be obtrusive , or brawling politicians . But there is no need that they think alike on mooted points of national administration . These points have no connection with their specific duties  --  but they ought to be men of approved business education and habits , careful and accurate accountants , prompt and intelligent in the interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honest , trustworthy men in private relations and duties . These qualities , ( the last alone excepted ) can be ensured only by the education of public functionaries for their offices . And they might be educated by clerkships , or placed , by way of probation , at less important posts , and promoted as they were found fit for promotion . Were the tenure of such offices for good behavior , they would not lack annual recruits from among the choicest youth of the country ; nor can any other system but this redeem our financial administration from the inroads of growing profligacy and corruption . But we have dwelt so long on our first proposition , as to leave hut little space for the discussion of the other two . Nor do they need much ; for they are virtually included in the first . We shall not , therefore , trespass far on the patience of our readers , in the separate remarks which they seem to demand . II . Our second proposition was , that a man ought to continue through ife in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to say , that a man should not rise in the world . We would have him aim constantly at the highest places in his profession , and assume them as fast as he is lifted for them ; hut we would have him rise in his calling , and raise that along with himself . Why do men leave their professions ? Chiefly for four reasons . 1 . On account of incompetency , growing almost always out of defective education . They find themselves unfit for what they have undertaken . They can not command patronage or satisfy employers . Such men generally have recourse to some position in which incompetency can he veiled from sight . They often betake themselves , not to commerce , ( for that needs both ability and previous training , ) hut to buying and selling on a petty scale . A very large proportion of the keepers of little huckster shops , fruit stalls and tippling houses in all our towns and cities , are occupying these paltry places , simply hecause for lack of training they are fit for nothing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . Many , too , seek to hide their incompetency in public offices , where any lack of skill or tact or intelligence is easily atoned for by a double measure of partisan zeal . 2 . Many men change their professions for the sake of ease , and generally from the mistaken idea , that where the hands are not employed there is no labor or fatigue . Now , in point of fact , no vital and useful member of society leads an easy life . One may indeed occupy a sinecure , but that is only a living burial , and no man , who respects himself , will commit self-annihilation for the sake of ease . But every man , who occupies an actual place among living men , must pay its l ) rice by diligent , arduous labor . There is no profession in which a respectable standing can be attained and kept without toil . Nor is there , as regards bodily ease , any essential difference between headwork and hand-work ; or if there be , it is in favor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a sound night 's sleep will carry off , bears no proportion to the derangement of nerves and the chronic lassitude that result from an overtasked brain . Those who change professions for the sake of ease are almost always disappointed . They find that an increase of risk , care and accountableness a larger draft upon the functions of the brain , and a less entire relaxation of mind during hours of repose , are more than an offset for the release from handlabor. 3 . Another class change professions from false notions of respectability . True respectability , not only in the eye of heaven , but in the esteem of every man of common sense , consists not in the place one holds , but in his fitness for it , and his fidelity in it . It is not the place that makes the man , but the man that makes the place , great ; and no being in the universe holds a higher rank , than he who fills with conscientious industry and usefulness one of the least conspicuous stations in society . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shine with his fair example , and , though small His influence , if that influence all be spent In soothing sorrow and in quenching strife , In aidin , helpless indigence , in works From which at least a grateful few derive Some taste of comfort in a world of woe ,  - -  Then let the supercilious great confess , He serves his country , recmpenses well The state , beneath the shadow of whose vine He sits secure , and in the scale of life Holds no ignoble , though a slighted place . " On the other hand , a man , by changing his profession , frequently sinks while he thinks he is rising ; for there is no object more grotesque and ridiculous than a person occupying a situation out of keeping with his talents , education and habits . If a certain small and narrow-minded portion of society , if here and there a silly girl or a brainless fopling does see fit to stigmatize some honest and useful professions as less respectable than others , even this is in great part chargeable upon the readiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ callings . But if men will only remain where Providence has placed them , there is indefinite room for the elevation , mental , moral and social , of every lawful avocation ; and each will take rank in the esteem of the community , in proportion to the fidelity and uprightness of its members . If a man he actully a genius , a great man , he may show himself great , without forsaking his calling . He may bring the resources of his genius to bear upon that calling , either in mechanical or economical improvements , or in intellectual impulses transmitted from his mind through a constantly widening circle of commanding influence . Dr. Franklin continued a hard-working mechanic long // 422 after he was second in reputation to no man in America , or in the scientific world . Where are the names more honored than those of Arkwright and Fulton , whose greatness was achieved in paths of enterprise and skill , that lie open to every mechanic and artizan. 4 . Yet another class of men change their professions in the hope of increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than respectability , with the place which one occupies . In what are called the humblest spheres , the richest and most spreading harvest of duty and benevolence is often reaped ; and results are frequently the greater for the obscurity of the agent 's situation . You can no more suppress the outflow of a good example and a salutary influence , than you can smother fire with linen garments . The story of the Dairyman 's Daughter has been translated into nineteen different languages , and more than four million copies of it have been circulated , making her simple faith and piety the means of the highest spiritual benefit to thousands of her fellow-mortals . Had that girl forsaken her father 's cottage to seek a more commanding sphere , she would probably have failed to fill it , and her life would have been a blank and a waste . From the nature of its functions , the clerical profession is made to suffer most seriously from the false notions of usefulness now under discussion . Its great bane in this country has been the intrusion into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with hardly any qualification , except sincere piety and an earnest desire to be useful-men of the humblest powers , the feeblest presence , the dullest speech , who yet might have done much good in their original spheres of duty , by example and private influence , as teachers of their own families , as guardians of the moral well-being of their respective neighborhoods and social circles . But they have been accustomed to identify preaching and doing good , and therefore were resolved upon preaching , no matter how stupidly , ignorantly or foolishly . There died in Portsmouth , England , some four or five years ago , at the age of seventy-three , John Pounds , by profession a mender of shoes , who exercised his calling for half a century or more , in a little shop eighteen feet by six . He was one of the greatest philanthropists of the day , and his name will go down to posterity with those of Howard *and Oberlin . Had he , when in middle life he first felt his mission to be useful , left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , at his age and with his scanty education , he could have made himself a burning and shining light in the church . But he did what he could , instead of assuming an office for which he was unfit . He gathered in poor children by scores from the lanes and the wharves of the city , taught them the elements of human learning and of religious knowledge , gave them good principles and habits , sought employment for them at a *suitable age , and , by pursuing this course for many years , rescued hundreds of children from hopeless degradation and ruin . He , by remaining in his profession , has given the world a most glorious demonstration , that the power of eminent usefulness is not limited to a few favored walks in life , but that the true and loving heart can do good anywhere and everywhere . The above are the principal grounds , on which men change their professions ; and we trust that our readers are prepared to acquiesce with us in the application to secular pursuits of the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abide in the same calling , wherein he is called . " Where this rule is followed , one has a steady and uniform growth in intelligence and influence . His standpoint remaining the same , his mental horizon is constantly enlarging itself , and new objects readily adjust themselves to his mind by their bearings and relations to long familiar objects . But the horizon , often changed , never expands . The influence also of him , who abides in his first calling , gains with every year accumulated power , in the same circle , in the same directions , for the same ends ; whereas one can not carry with him into a new walk of life and among new people , the weight of character and influence which he previously possessed , hut must build up for himself a new character and reputation . ILL . But we leave this point , to say a few words in defence of our last proposition , namely , that no man should statedly occupy more than one profession at a time . Nor do we care how minutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether in the mechanical or the liberal professions . It is admitted on all hands , that the division of labor is justified by its economical results-that more and better work is done in consequence of this arrangement . A man loses time by chang // ing works , nor can a person be so well skilled in several operations as in one . One man , says Adam Smith , could hardly make twenty pins a day , while ten men , engaged in as many different parts of the work , can make forty-eight thousand in a day , which would he equivalent to forty-eight hundred for one man . But , says Sxv , " To have never done anything hut make the tenth part of a pin , is a sorry account for a human being to give of his existence . " We would reply , By no means , if , while making the tenth part of a pin , he has lived as an intellectual , moral and accountable being ought to live . That the minute division of labor , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the old world heen connected with mental and moral degradation , we admit ; but we deny that the connection is a necessary one . The degradation of which we speak has resulted from the fact , First , that the operatives have been destitute of education , and , Secondly , that they have been overworked . But educate a man well at the outset , and then so arrange his hours of labor , that he shall daily have seasons of leisure for reading , study , reflection or social intercourse ; and he may , in a life of the merest routine , still be a constantly improving man , and may work out the highest ends of his intellectual and moral being . The growth of a man 's mind does not depend on the extent of terrestrial surface , or the number of outward objects , with which he is conversant . The most contracted sphere of life has enough within it , to call forth and satisfy centuries of mental activity . Said an eminent naturalist , putting his hand upon the ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what my hand now covers . " The common objects , the familiar scenes , the daily events of life , are sufficient educators of the mind which has once received a stimulus to self-improvement . In the mercantile and liberal professions , it will be readily admitted that the subdivision of research , practice and euterprise still leaves those engaged in the respective branches , sufficient scope for the exercise of the best powers of mind . In the mechanical professions , what a man does , either demands the constant exercise of ingenuity or skill , or else is a work of mere routine . If the former , there is in his very business a direct opportunity for the practical application of whatever mental power he may have ; and he may also reap its outward rewards , in fame and money , as an inventor , or discoverer of ' improved modes or processes . If the latter , let him only bring to the routine of labor a well furnished intellect ; and his mind may be active in digesting and arranging its accuniulated treasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affections warm , and the inner man may be daily renewed , and carried onward in the path of eternal progress . Indeed , for mental and moral growth , it is of prime importance that a man have a fixed center of thought and of activity . Then , an infinite number of concentric circles of constantly growing diameter will mark the symmetrical and uniform progress of his intellect ; and all his past acquisitions will he included within his present mental orbit . But if he has , in three , or four , or half a dozen different professions , as many different centers of mental action and expansion , the circles perpetually intersect each other , and the mind is driven round in a confused and tortuous path , in perpetual ignorance of its bearings and its distances . But it is time that we brino. these remarks to a close . One chief ' object that we have had in view in penning them , is to represent all labor as honorable ,  --  to ennoble and dignify toil . Let the ban of society go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rags . But let industry , diligence , thrift , give every true laborer , whether with head or hand , an honored place as a vital , worthy , precious member of the body politic , living in harmony with the law of God , and in the only condition of spiritual well-being , dignity and progress.
