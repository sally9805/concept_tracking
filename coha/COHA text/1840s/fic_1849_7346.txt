ALBERT SIMONS : OR , THE MIDSHIPMAN 'S REVENGE . A Tale of Land and Sea . BY LIEUTENANT MURRAY . BOSTON : PUBLISHED BY F. GLEASON , AT THE FLAG OF OUR UNION OFFICE , CORNER OF COURT AND TREMONT STREETS . 1849 . Acknowledgment Entered , according to Act of Congress , in the year 1845 , BY F. GLEASON , In the Clerk 's Office of the District Court of Massachusetts . PREFACE . For us , and for our tragedy , Here stooping to your clemency , We beg your hearing patiently . It is too much the practice of our miscellaneous writers to seek a plot for their tales either in distant climes and countries with whose peculiarities and belongings they know little , and oftentimes even less than the readers themselves , or in such places as are but partially known to the class for whom they write , thus giving themselves a scope and latitude they would not otherwise possess in matters of description and romance . Now we humbly believe that one need not go out of the boundary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and truthful matter too , which if related so as to bring it in its proper light before the public , would create a greater degree of interest in the perusal as well as the instruction it would afford , than all the romances of the present writing , laid in unknown regions , and in time of which history itself dare not speak too confidently . Who will doubt for a moment that a picture of every day life , of the times we live in , and of a plot that is ready wrought to our hands by the occurrences of the very hour we write in , is not of more interest and practical worth than a love story of some Eastern Seraglio , or a Tale with a Moral ' laid in the Emerald Valley of Cashmere ? We have a heart full of love for this Tri-Mountain city , and could write a volume in its praise ; of its commercial advantages , its truly hospitable and peculiarly New England customs , of its liberal institutions and advantages , and in short of its fitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its early history is of itself a romance of truth , so to speak , and affords an inexhaustible treasure to the novelist and historian . We should have commenced by saying that we were born in Boston  --  the reader would then have excused this digression at the outset . Main text FROM THE FLAG OF OUR UNION . THE ADOPTED SON : OR , THE REWARD OF CHARITY . BY PAUL CREYTON . CHAPTER I. The Worldly Heart . One cold , dreary , windy day in the month of November , 1843 , a tall , dark individual might have been observed passing to and fro , in a mysterious manner , in one of the most retired streets of the city of Boston . His finely-made form and handsome features were disguised by the folds of a spacious cloak and scarf , which he had assumed for the double purpose of concealment and defence against the cold . Several times had this strange individual walked up and down the street , like one abstracted . But although he seemed to have no object in view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deeply interested in some object he saw , or wished to see , in a cottage over the way ; for his dark , piercing eye was turned in that direction continually . At last , as the stranger was approaching the house in one of his rounds , a lad of about twelve summers , pale , and poorly clad , came out of the door and ran lightly down the steps into the street . The stranger paused , but as the boy ran on before him , he followed , quickening his pace , and was soon led by the unconscious youth into a more busy quarter of the town . The two kept on at a rapid pace , the stranger gradually nearing the boy , until the latter suddenly turned into a large , crowded building , composed of offices devoted to the use of lawyers , brokers , and other business men . The lad mounted a broad flight of stairs , and entered a side door , which he had scarcely closed when the stranger followed him in . There was but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk with a newspaper in his hand . He looked up as the two entered , and after glancing at the stranger , who coolly took a seat near the stove , motioned the boy to approach him . The lad was embarrassed and seemed afraid to speak . With his cold , numb fingers , he played with the buttons of his coat , while his eye turned- alternately from the stranger to the man at the desk . The latter was a middle-aged man , with a cold , hard , calculating look , such as chills the heart unused to the selfishness of the world . Well , William , ' said he , turning to the boy with the mockery of a smile  --  it was so cold and heartless  --  well , William , has your father sent me the money for the rent , as he promised my clerk , when he called on him the other day ? Speak out , William . ' He sent me , ' said the boy , after some hesitation , to tell you that he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hopes to be able to get it for you before next Saturday . ' The man at the desk scowled darkly . Tell your father , ' said he , in tones of harshness , that I can put up with this treatment no longer . I have been put off now day after day with promises and protestations , until I am tired of the same eternal lingo . However , I will let things remain until Saturday , when , if the rent is not paid , I shall be under the necessity of adopting measures that would be unpleasant both for him and me . ' But father is very sick , ' began the lad , his eyes glistening with tears . He would have said more , but sobs choked his utterance , and he hurried from the office into the street . I said the man at the desk scowled darkly ; but when the boy was gone , and his eye fell upon the stranger seated at the fire , at the sight of the dignified bearing of the latter , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his brow brightened with a smile . Excuse me , ' said the stranger , approaching the door ; I perceive I have entered the wrong place . But will you tell me whether or no that lad is the son of Mr. Jonathan Harding ? ' Ay , that 's he father 's name , ' replied the other , politely . What a reverse of fortune that man must have met with ! ' the other with a sigh . If I remember right , he was once one of the richest and most influential in Boston . ' True , ' replied the man at the he has lost all his property by ment . I knew him well five years he was in the height of his . He failure was quite unexpected , and very unfortunate , for by strange on his part , his everything , and left him poor . Of he has been , and he has even been brought as to be unable to pay the of of my houses . ' Low , sighed the stranger , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two children , a girl of twenty and the boy you here . The girl , I am , supports the family by the has . ' And no ? ' No accepted ones . Many of the first class , however  --  young men of fortune and family  --  have offered themselves , but it seems she prefers a life of and poverty to a good match . ' Indeed ! ' Strange , you think ; but there is a reason  --  though a one  --  for her foolish . You she is young and romantic , like other silly girls at her age , and herself on wealth . The truth , for a young man who , if he is like other young men , thinks no more about her now than as if he had never seen her . ' Who is he ? ' I will tell you . Many years ago , Mr. Harding , who is a kind- man enough , picked up a little orphan boy in the streets , and took him and warmed , and , and clothed him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the boy grew up like one of the family until he was eighteen . At that time  --  this was five or six years ago  --  Harding 's daughter , Julia , was about fifteen , and a very pretty girl , I assure you . Well , things turned out as might have been expected . The youth was warm-hearted and full of spirit , and the girl was a delicious , bewitching creature , and altogether too rich for him to withstand . In short , the poor orphan and the rich heiress loved each other , and became engaged before the old man knew anything of the matter . He found it out , however , and of course he took measures to break off the unequal connection , by putting the boy in the way of making his fortune abroad , that the two might forget each other . The thing must have had the desired effect on one side , for the boy has never been heard from since ; but on the other hand , Julia seems to cherish the hope that he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . She 's foolish there , for the boy has seen something of the world by this time , and lost some of the romance by which youths now-a-days are infected . If he should come back , it is n't probable he would think of marrying the daughter of a poor , broken-down merchant . ' Thus did the worldly man run on , talking from the coldness of a heart that was a stranger to all the kinder feelings of man 's nature , and flattering himself that he was speaking the sentiments of a philosopher and a man . The stranger heard him out ; then making inquiries concerning the amount of rent due from Mr. Harding , abruptly took the sum from his purse , laid it upon the desk , and requested , or rather ordered , the other to make out a receipt which he could forward to the merchant . The worldly man looked at the stranger in surprise , but seeing how stern and forbidding he appeared , simply asked his name , made out the required paper , and passed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket-book , turned his back haughtily upon the astonished landlord , and hurried from the office . CHAPTER II . Mysterious Providence . When the boy , whom the worldly man dismissed so harshly from his presence , had reached the street , he brushed away the tears that gushed from the fullness of his bursting heart , and hastened back to carry the cruel message to his father . Having reached home , he hesitated before he entered , fearing , in the goodness of his young and untried heart , the effect his errand might have upon his invalid parent ; but at length , summoning his resolution , he passed quickly in , and stood , pale and shivering , in the presence of his family . He was in a small , but neat and comfortable apartment , scantily furnished , yet not without some manifestations of taste . Near the fire sat an elderly man in an arm-chair , his eyes closed as if in sleep . He was paler even than the boy himself , and his emaciated limbs and sunken cheeks showed the unmistakable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boy . His mother sat near  --  a patient , care-worn woman , in humble but neat attire , who occasionally rais ed her eyes from her work to her husband 's face , as if her joy and sorrow were centered in him . At Mrs. Harding 's side sat her daughter , Julia , of whom the reader already knows something , through the conversation of the worldly man with the stranger in his office . Although the landlord 's account had been colored by his own views of the world , it had been in the main correct . Possessed of rare intelligence , a fair form , and such a countenance as rivets our gaze as if by some magic influence , she was in every respect a lovely and lovable woman . I said the old man 's eyes were closed as if in sleep ; but the moment the boy 's light footstep was heard upon the threshold , he turned his head quickly , and cast a hurried , inquiring glance at his son . William ! ' The boy stepped forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? ' In a few words the boy delivered his message , softening as well as he might the harshness of its import . His parents and sister listened eagerly , their countenances changing as if in disappointment and despair . Saturday , ' said the old man , musingly , when the boy had ended . Saturday  --  and to-day is Tuesday . ' Thursday , father , ' said Julia . Thursday ! Is it possible ? How time rolls by , unconsciously to the invalid ! Thursday ! Heaven help us ! We can not raise the money this week . ' But will Mr. Maxwell carry his threat into execution ? ' asked Julia . He is a hard man ! ' murmured Mr. Harding . But Henry , his son  --  ' began the boy 's mother . Do not mention his name ! ' exclaimed the old man , somewhat impatiently . His son ! What can we expect from him ? True , he professed , and still professes , to have an attachment for Julia ; but when he offered her his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bitterly , father , ' interrupted Julia . You know I could never love Henry Maxwell , and that I would scorn to marry him for his riches . ' You are right , ' murmured the old man , more kindly , quite right . I would not have you wed him against your will to save us from the lowest stage of poverty . No  --  no ! Let fate do its worst ! ' The old man paused , for there was a ringing at the outer door , and William hastened to admit the visiter . Henry Maxwell entered , a young man possessed of all the selfishness of his father , but less of his calculating coldness . When Mr. Harding saw him approach , feeble as he was , he stretched forth his emaciated hand , and with a flashing eye told him of the message sent by his relentless father . The young man made no attempt to excuse his parent , but protested he had known nothing of the affair of the rent until half an hour before , when he happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . And he had hastened , ' he said , with much apparent feeling , to put the old man 's mind at rest ; assuring him that no demands should be made on him for rent due heretofore . ' This is generous ! ' exclaimed the old man , grasping his hand feebly . You are not like your father , and I am glad of it . You have , then , paid the rent yourself  --  trusting to my ability to repay you at some future time ? ' Mr. Harding said more , but Henry seemed not to hear him , for without making any reply , he turned to speak with Julia . Half an hour after the young man left , having made a more favorable impression on the minds of the family than he had ever done before . About the same time the postman rang and dropped a letter , addressed to Julia , who hastened to her room and read it eagerly . Twice she glanced her eye over its contents , which produced a confusion in her brain I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she laughed ; then she wept and laughed together , as if the epistle had been a strange mixture of good and evil intelligence , that inspired her with alternate joy and sorrow . Poor Julia was very nervous during the succeeding half hour , and could neither work , nor talk , nor think . Her mind was on the contents of the mysterious letter , which she re-read half a dozen times before the half hour expired . Then hastily but stealthily she attired herself to encounter the roughness of the weather , and with a beating heart stole from her father 's house . We will not follow her , but simply state , that on her return she appeared more gay than she had been before for months . Her parents saw the change , and questioned her , but she answered them evasively . What could have happened to produce the alteration , that she should hesitate to unfold at once to them ? Days passed , and the Harding family were provided for unexpectedly and strangely . Julia would go out and make purchases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have them sent to the door , that she might enjoy her parents ' and little William 's surprise .  --  The hearts of these three were filled with gratitude to Julia , and their love for her increased , if that were possible , when they saw how she denied herself to comfort them . But by what means was Julia enabled to make the purchases she did ? How got she so much money ? When asked these questions by her friends , she would reply that she was paid more for the lessons she gave on the piano than she was before ; that her French pupils were increasing ; and that the funds she procured in various other ways , when put together , amounted to no despicable sum . But still there was a mystery , which , if she understood it herself , she did not choose to clear up to their satisfaction . One day , after Henry Maxwell had been at the house , where he exerted himself not a little to please Julia and her parents , Mr. Harding , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was so prejudiced against the young man , and inquired if there was any other she preferred . You forget , ' said Julia , timidly , that Theodore Alliston pleased me more than any other . ' The old man sighed . Theodore Alliston ! ' he murmured  --  the lad I brought up  --  after snatching him from a pit of degradation into which he had been thrust  --  for he was too young to choose or struggle against fortune  --  the boy who grew up under my roof , and repaid me for my cares and kindness by aspiring to win your affections and your hand  --  ' But he was worthy , ' interrupted Julia . Well , there was nothing bad about him , I confess . Perhaps I treated him too harshly in banishing him from my house ; but in doing so , I gave him an excellent opportunity of making his fortune abroad , which I hope he has profited by  --  for I really had a preference for the boy . But what I was going to say  --  ' Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he loved you . Yet it is foolish in you to cherish his image as you do , as if he remembered you the same . It is not at all probable that he has any affection left for his old companion , nor do I believe he would think of renewing his engagement with you , should he ever see you again . You must reflect that we are poor now ! ' And would that make any difference with him ? ' asked Julia , fixing her large dark eyes with an expression of mournful reproach upon her father 's face . The old man sighed again , but answered not . Throwing his head back upon a pillow Julia arranged for his comfort , he closed his outward eyes , looking with those within  --  the spiritual sight  --  back upon the past , all shadowed as it was by sorrows and vain regrets , and forward to the future , which appeared more dark to him than either the past or present . More than a week had passed , dating from the opening of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with comforts , which seemed procured through the influence of a mysterious providence , for none could divine how the girl became possessed of the means to make the purchases she did . I am convinced , ' said the old man to her then , that you procure money from some source which you keep concealed from us . Answer me now plainly : Do you get all your money by teaching ? ' No , ' replied Julia , blushing and smiling as she blushed . I do not . ' How then is it obtained ? Speak , for I can endure this mystery no longer . ' But I am not at liberty to tell you now , father . Wait patiently , and I assure you that all shall be explained to your satisfaction , I hope , by four o'clock to-morrow . Wait till then . ' The old man regarded her with an expression of perplexity and wonder , but did not urge her more . CHAPTER III . Finale . At the hour appointed on the following day , the little family of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julia was there , ready to explain the mystery , and her parents and little William were anxiously waiting for the moment to arrive when their curiosity was to be gratified . You are expecting some one , Julia ? ' said the old man . Yes , sir . ' Who ? ' You will soon learn . I can only tell you that it is one to whom we all owe much  --  ' He who has helped to provide us with the comforts we have enjoyed of late ? ' The same . ' At that moment the door-bell rang , and Julia , very much agitated , hastened to admit the visiter . But little William was at the door before her , and to the surprise of her parents , he returned almost immediately , accompanied by Henry Maxwell ! Feeble as Mr. Harding was , he sprang to his feet , and grasped Henry 's hand warmly . It is you then ! ' he cried with emotion it is you that have been a friend to us in our misfortunes ! As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our assistance  --  paid our rent  --  ' Do not mention it , ' interrupted Henry with an air of modesty . You do not deny it , ' pursued Mr. Harding ding . No , you admit it . And you have since done more for us than I could have ex-lb pected even of a son ! ' Henry Maxwell was bowing and stammering , scarcely audacious enough to admit the old man said , and unwilling to undeceive him , when he was startled by a soft voice beside him . Father ! ' They all looked up  --  Mr. Harding , his wife , little William , and the rejected suitor , Henry Maxwell . Julia stood before them ; her features surpassingly lovely , covered as they were with blushes , smiles and tears ; and in her trembling hand she held the hand of a tall , dark , manly stranger , who cast a serene yet anxious look about him as he entered . Has not the reader recognized the young man introduced at the opening of our story ? It was the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to whose generosity you are indebted ! This is he who first paid your rent , unbeknown even to me , and afterwards , having sought an interview with me , provided me with the means to supply us with the necessaries and comforts of life . Do you not know him , father ? It is Theodore Alliston ! ' The old man sank upon a chair , and Julia , sobbing at the excess of her emotion , threw herself at his feet , burying her face in his out-stretched hands . Theodore knelt beside her , and drew her hand in his . The old man looked at them for a moment , while the tears ran down his cheeks , but uttered not a word , until Theodore and Julia , raising , as if with one consent , their eyes to his , asked his benediction . Theodore !  --  Julia !  --  My children ! ' he sobbed , and drew them together to his bosom . When the excess of emotion had subsided , and the young and happy pair arose to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel exceedingly uneasy , slunk from the house , never to enter the presence of Julia or her family again . Then was there a scene of a nature it seldom falls to the lot of man to witness ; such as can never fail to improve the heart by the holy influence it sheds around ; such as brings a tear of sympathetic joy into the eyes of angels ! Every heart was overflowing with happiness  --  every face was suffused with joy . Strange contrast ! There was a smile on every lip and a tear in every eye . For Theodore , the noble , the spirited , the generous and true  --  Theodore had returned ! Not with all the riches of the Indies in his possession , but with a competency procured as much through industry and probity as the favors of fortune , and with the same true heart and noble soul which long before had won the love of Julia . When we hear of two such hearts as Theodore 's and Julia 's  --  hearts that have stood the test of absence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that have loved each other notwithstanding the opposition of friends and the allurements of newer objects ; and that have at length , after years of separation , returned to each other with all the purity and freshness of earlier age ; when we hear of two such hearts , I say , we need not be told that there is truth , and depth , and endurance to their affection , never to be destroyed . And Julia became the bride of her own Theodore , who took her , with her prrents , to a home he had provided for them , and devoted himself henceforth to prove his gratitude to Mr. Harding for what he had done for him in his boyhood , when he was a friendless orphan , and to promote the happiness of his young and lovely wife . THE END .
