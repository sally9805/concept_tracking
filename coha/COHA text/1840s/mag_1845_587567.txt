txt THE design of these expeditions was a military examination of the country between the Mississippi and the Pacific Ocean , on the line of the Great Platte , the South Pass , and the Columbia , with a. view to the maintenance of the national rights over a remote and interesting region . The military examination was the first object , but science came in for a share of the commander 's attention : and sextants , refracting circles , chronometers , barometers , thermometers and telescopes , as well as rifles and the howtxer , formed a part of the young officer 's equipment . The result of the combined objects is an immense collection of geographical , botanical , geological , and meteorological information , mixed up with the details which would enable a general to march an army , or an emigrant to move his family to Oregon ; and from which a statesman might judge the value of the country , and a farmer choose a residence in it . Two expeditions have been made , the first in 1842 , terminating at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1844-b , extending to the tide-water of the Columbia , and thence south by a vast circuit through the unknown region of the Al/a Cal*Jbrnia ; - forced forward , when once involved in them , by mountains and by deserts which carried the expedition far out of its intended course , and exposed it to perils and sufferings only to be compensated by discoveries full of strange and romantic interest , among people and countries never before described . The journals of the two expeditions , printed by order of each House of Congress , as a public document , have just issued from the " Globe " and " National Intelligencer " offices ; and it is these journals which we propose to review . A third expedition , to complete the objects of the first two , has just commenced and in the course of one year more ( should the adventurous young explorer be as successful as heretofore ) the public may expect to be gratified with a full view , under all its various aspects , of the vast region from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which faces the setting sun , and towards which the tide of emigration is now rolling , the eyes of Europe and America turning , and for the dominion of which diplomacy is now weaving its webs , and war sounding its alarms . The design of these expeditions-the general plan of their execution  --  and a glimpse of their results-are briefly sketched by Capt . Frdmont himself in his modest " Notice to the Reader , " prefixed to the publication ; and this preliminary view is too important to the understanding of the expeditions to be omitted , and too brief and comprehensive to bear abridgment . We , therefore , present it entire " The Senate of the United States , and the House of Representatives , having each ordered ten thousand copies of the reports of the two exploring expeditions conducted by me , to be printed together , I have deemed it regular and natural to place the report of 1842 first in the order of publication , although heretofore printed ; it being first in the order of time , and first in the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the second being a continuation of the first , and the two constituting parts of a whole , which will require a third expedition , now commencing , to comf ) lete . The first terminated at the Rocky mountains , and at the two points of greatest interest in that ridge-namely , the South Pass , and Fr6mont 's Peak ; the former being the lowest depression of the mountains , through which the road to Oregon now passes , and the latter the highest elevation , from the base of which four great rivers take their rise , and flow in opposite directions , toward the risin , and the setting sun . The second , after approaching the mountains by a different route , connects with the first expedition at the South Pass , and * Report of the Exploring Expedition to the Rocky Mountains in the year 1842 , and to Oregon and North California in years 1843-4 .

The third expedition , now commencing , will be directed to that section of the Rocky mountains which gives rise to the Arkansas , the Rio Grande del Norte , and the Rio Colorado of California ; and will extend west and southwest of that section , 50 as to examine the country towards the Pacific ocean , ascertain the lines of communication between the mountains and the ocean in that latitude , and complete the examination of the Great Salt lake and of the interesting region which embosoms it . " The map which illustrated the report of 1842 is now extended to illustrate the entire expedition of 1843- ' 44 , so that a view of both expeditions will be presented together . This map may have a meager and skeleton appearance to the general eye , but is expected to be more valuable to science on that account , being wholly founded upon positive data and actual operations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and traversing in the wilderness which lies between the frontiers of Missouri and the shores of the Pacific , almost every camping station being the scene of astronomical or barometrical observations , furnish the materials out of which this map has been constructed . Nothing supposititious has been admitted upon it ; so that , connecting with Captain Wilkes 's survey of the mouth of the Columbia , and with the authentic surveys of the State of Missouri , it fills up the vast geographical chasm between these two remote points , and presents a connected and accurate view of our continent from the Mississippi river to the Pacific ocean . " To this 0eographical map , delineating the face of the country over which we travelled , there is added another in profile , showing the elevations , or the rise and fill of the country from the Mississippi to the Pacific . East of the Rocky mountains , two of these profile views are given ,  --  one from St. Louis to the South Pass , the other from the mouth of the Great Platte to the same point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it does , the regular descent of the river , and being seven hundred miles west of the Mississippi , it may be that the eastern ter'minu* of this line may furnish the point at which the steamboat and the steam-car may hereafter meet and exchange cargoes in their magic flight across this continent . These profile views , following the travelling routes , of course follow the lowest and levellest lines , and pass the mountain at the point of its greatest depression ; but to complete the view , and to show the highest points as well as the lowest levels , many lofty peaks are sketched at their proper elevations , towering many thousands of feet above the travelling line . It may here be excusable to suggest that these profile maps here exhibited are , perhaps , the most extended work of the kind ever constructed , being from St. Louis ( according to the route we travelled ) near sixteen hundred miles to the South Pass ; from the mouth of the Great Platte to the same Pass , about one thousand more ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Oregon ; in all , about four thousand miles of profile mapping , founded upon nearly four hundred barometrical positions , with views sketched and facts noted in the field as we went . " In the departments of geological and botanical science , I have not ventured to advance any opinions on my own imperfect knowledge of those branches , but have submitted all my specimens to the enlightened judgment of Dr. Torrey , of New Jersey , and Dr. Hall , of New York , who have kindly classified and arranged all that I was able to submit to the*m . The botanical observations of Dr. Torrey will be furnished in full hereafter , there not being time to complete them now . The remarks of Dr. Hall , on the geological specimens furnished to him , will be found in an appendix to the report ; and to his pah*ontological skill I am indebted for the discovery of an oolitic formation in the region west of the Rocky mountains , which further examination may prove to assimilate the geology of the New to that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before been discovered in either of the two Americas . Unhappily , much of what we had collected was lost by accidents of serious import to ourselves , as well as to our animals and collections . In the gorges and ridges of the Sierra Nevada , of the Alta California , we lost fourteen horses and mules , falling from rocks or precipices into chasms or rivers , bottomless to us and to them , and one of them loaded with bales of plants collected on a line of two thousand miles of travel ; and , when almost home , our camp on the banks of the Kansas was deluged by the great flood which , lower down , spread terror and desolation on the borders of the Missouri and Mississippi , and by which great damage was done to our remaining perishable specimens , all wet and saturated with water , and which we had no time to dry . Still , what is saved will be some respectable contribution to botanical science , thanks to the skill and care of Dr. Torrey ; and both in geology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // the profile view showing the elevations at which the specimens were found , and the geographical map showing the localities from which they come . " The astronomical observations , taken with good instruments , have been tested , where they were most important , by a three-fold computation ,  --  one by Professor Walker , of Philadelphia , whose astronomical reputation is so great ; another by Mr. Joseph C. Hubbard , a promising young mathematician from Connecticut ; the third by myself ; so that the correctness of the longitudes and latitudes may well be relied upon . " In sketching the topographical features of the country , a branch of science in which he had been professionally educated , Mr. Charles Preuss had been my assistant in both expeditions ; and to his extraordinary skill , supported by the pleasure he felt in the execution of his duties , I am indebted for the continuous topographical sketches of the regions through which we passed , and which were never interrupted by any extremity of fatigue or privation . " The barometrical and meteorological observations were carefully made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the minute deviations inseparable from such operations . " The third expedition , now commencing , is undertaken with more ample means than the two former ; and being directed to a region so interesting in itself , and so new to science , can hardly fail to requite the enterprise which explores it . " The report , or narrative , of this extended expedition , like the maps which illustrate it , will be strictly confined to what was seen , and to what is necessary to show the face and character of the country , and to add something to science while fulfilling the instructions of the government , which chiefly contemplated a military topographical survey . A greater degree of popular interest might have been imparted to it by admitting a greater latitude of detail , but it was deemed best to adhere to the rigorous character of a report , and to present nothing , either in the narrative or in the maps , which was not the result of positive observation . " The journals both open in the same way , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expedition , and their means of prosecuting it , and accomplishing its objects . About thirty men , one hundred horses and mules , some light carts to carry the instruments , some aettle to be killed before reaching the buffaloes , and some supply of coffee and flour , with good rifles and powder and lead , and some store of presents to conciliate indians , constitute the equipment . The men are engaged for the occasion-backwoodsmen trained to the perils and hardship of mountain and prairie life , able and willing to hold existence by the tenure of the rifle , to find theirdaily food before they eat it , the earth for their nightly bed , some bushes and a blanket their shelter from " the peltings of the pitiless storm , " and who find cornpensatioii for the dangers and sufferings they endure , in the excitement which it creates . Looking over the names of these men , we see those of many nations , French , American , German , Spanish ; the French coming from the Canadian and Louisiana stocks . The time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young grass is far enough advanced to sustain the animals ; the point of departure is the western limit of civilisation  --  the frontier of Missouri-near the mouth of the Kanzas river . rrhe order of the march and encampment is described , and is always the same , except when increased danger requires increased vigilance ; for the whole expedition , from the moment of leaving the frontier , is a progress of danger , in which vigilance , and courage , and constant readiness to make defence , are the price of the traveller 's safety , and his only security for life and property . A day-break rising of the camp  --  a sunrise breakfast  --  and an hour by sun commencement of the march-was the daily order of movement ; and then the moving camp assumed the form of a military procession . Mounted scouts ahead and on the flanks , to perform the double duty of videttes and hunters-a front and a rear division of the men to he ready for battle either way , with the baggage in the centre-such was the order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and four things were necessary to constitute a good one : water , grass , fuel , and a delensible position . The rule was to halt an hour before sunset , to have time to arrange and secure the camp . Two guards were immediately formed ; one called the horse-guard , from its duty to guard the horses while feeding round the camp ; the other to guard the camp at night ; and in places of more than ordinary danger , the one-third , or even the one-half of the men would be thus // employed . The camp would be arranged into a square , or circle , the carts forming angles , or exterior lines , and barricades of trees or bushes often added , and sufficiently large to contain the horses and cattle , as well as the men . At nightfall all , except the camp guard , were collected within the barricades , the horses being picketed , i. e. , haltered to a picket eighteen inches long , driven into the ground , and with a sufficient length of halter to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to feed on the grass during the night . On this feeding during the night and pickings during the day , the horse was to live and keep himself in order for service ; for from the moment of leaving the frontiers of Missouri until he gets back , or dies , a farewell  --  a long farewell-is bidden by the horse to all the accommodations of the stable , and to all the supplies of the rack , or the trough . Fortunately , and this fact will receive an astonishing developement and an immense application in the course of the expeditions , this grass , within a few days ' march from the frontiers of Missouri , becomes so nutritious in quality , and so abundant in quantity , that any number of horses and cattle may be subsisted upon it for any distance of march , and any length of time , summer and winter , quite out to the Pacific ocean . The camp guard watches without the barricade , while the men and horses sleep and feed within ; but every man sleeps on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in perfect order and well loaded . The iiight over , the return of the day brings a return of the daily routine of early rising and early moving , which is never intermitted , except , when for some cause there is a day or an interval of repose . The military view of this subject was , of course , the first object of the explorer 's attention. , and in this the result of the examination has been entirely satisfactory . It had been supposed , and even affirmed by leading authorities in Europe and America , * that distance* mountains , hostility of Indians , and the impossibility of subsisting men and horses in so long a march , would present insuperable obstacles to a military expedition from the United States to Oregon . All these impossibilities have vanished before the facts of Capt . Fr6-mont 's Report . The distance , counting from the frontier of Missouri to the tide water in Oregon , is only about two thousand miles ; the mountains are easily passed ; the whole way is practicable , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an abundant and nutritious grass furnishes food to horses and to beef cattle ; and as for the Indians , it is on proof that twenty-five men , with rifles and a howitzer , may move in safety , in spite of the hostility of any tribe . So minute and particular is the Report , and that illustrated by maps , that an army may be marched upon the Journal as its guide , finding all the particulars of ground , grass , water , and fuel so minutely stated , that , with the book in hand , each day 's march , and each night 's encampment , may be laid down beforehand , and confidently relied upon with all the certainty of absolute knowledge . With this minuteness of topographical information , are given some enlarged views of the military strength of Oregon as a country to be defended ; and from the peculiar structure and configuration of the country ; its iron-bound coast and double range of mountains ; its single communication with the sea , by the mouth of only one river ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a great valley , surrounded by mountains and by deserts , the conclusion is drawn , and the opinion expressed , that Oregon is the most impregnable country in the world ! The Captain uses the word impregnable , which implies defence , and imparts strong emphasis to the advantage of a first possession . The British government seem to have been aware of this important fact , and to have availed themselves of their Hudson Bay Company to do for them in Oregon what the East India Company have done for them in Asia . Connected with the military view of the country , or rather as the basis of all military operations from the Mississippi to the Pacific , Capt . Fr*mont prominently and perseveringly presents the seemingly insignificant article of grass . At one hundred and fifty miles , or a week 's march , from the frontiers of Missouri , the short , rich , nutritious and abundant buffalo grass sets in , equal to // our domestic provender for horses and cattle , and equally good in its green or dry state ; being thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rocky Mountains , and is even found in those mountains at a elevation of ten thousand feet . Beyond those mountains another species of grass sets in , longer , and of a different character , but not less valuable than the buffalo , and endowed with the remarkable property of a second growth , coming on in the fall after the death or destruction of its first growth . This is called bunch grass , from its form , growing in clusters ; and , like the buffalo , it loves the mountains and elevated plains . It seems to be universal on the western slope of our continent , as the buffalo grass is on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains ; and was found sufficient for the sustenance of their horses , even in the dead of winter-even in the months of December , January , and February-in the deep gorges and on the lofty peaks of the Sierra Nerada ( snowy mountain of California ) , whcn the wind had blown the snow from some exposed point , or the sun had melted it in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colossal pines and cedars , had melted a circle in the deep snow about the camp . It was also found in the Great Desert of the Lower California wherever there was water to sustain it , and forms the only support of the annual caravan of many thousands of wild horses which are driven from the coast of the Pacific , in the latitude of Monterey and Puebla de los Angeles , to Santa F* , and the northern parts of Mexico . This universality and excellence of these far-western grasses , may give a new character to warlike operations in that quarter , dispensing with the immense commissariat of European armies which always impede and encumber , and frequently frustrate the movement of armies , and assimilating it to Asiatic and Tartar expeditions , which are always sudden and rapid , the grass feeding at once the horse which carries the man , and the ox that feeds him . Transportation and subsistence , the two great clogs and expenses of modern armies , are thus reduced to the simple element of grass , costing nothing , and being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view it is considered by Capt . Frhrnont , and constantly spoken of by him . An Asiatic , rather than an American structure of the country , im pressed itself upon his imagination ; and from this similarity of structure is already arising a similarity of 114e in c*mrnerce and travelling , moving in caravans , camping out , and depending upon grass to sustain the horses which carried the men , and the cattle which they drive along for food . Captain ( then Leutenant ) Fr*mont himself was seldom without cattle , taking thirty head at a time from the valley of the Sacramento , sometimes using them as fresh beef , sometimes jerked-i. e. , cut thin , and suddenly dried by the sun and fire . In the subserviency of the buffalo and bunch grasses of the Farthest West to the purposes of war , there is a profound military conception , of which future generals may make the application . The military reconnoisance , or reconnoitring , was , as has been remarked , the first object of the expedition , and the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Topographical Engineers ; and the Report made upon the line of march from the frontiers of Missouri to Oregon , showing the nature vtnd practicability of the country between , and the proper places for temporary camps and permanent stations , with the means of conquering or avoiding obstacles , would have been sufficient to have satisfied all the obligations which military duty imposed , and to have commanded the approbation of the government . But this limited performance of duty did not satisfy the laudable ambition of the young explorer . Science came in for her share of his attentions ; and a large share she received . Geography . geology , botany , meteorology , each seems as if each had been his sole pursuit ; so incessantly and so minutely is everything relating to each noted and described ; while the popular view of the country , for the benefit of the statesman and for the information of the current reader , was also everywhere kept up . Seldom has it happened that any journal has been crowded with such masses of material , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectable contributions to the general intelligence of the age . In geography , the additions to our knowledge are great ; much of it entirely new . The country from the frontiers of Missouri to the Rocky Mountains , on the line of the Kansas and Great Platte , is shown to be arable and inhabitable , // instead of being desert and barren , as often heretofore represented . The Rocky Mountains , which Capt . Fr&amp; mont crossed at four different places , instead of being desolate and impassable , are shown to have many excellent passes ( of which the South Pass is the finest ) , and to embosoin beautiful valleys , caves , and parks , with lakes and mineral springs , rivalling and surpassing the most enchanting parts of the Alpine regions in Switzerland . The Great Salt Lake , one of the wonders of nature , and perhaps without a rival in the world ( being a saturated solution of salt , of an hundred miles diameter ) , is for the first time revealed to our view , by one who has surveyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley , with its rich bottoms , fine grass , walled-up mountains , hot springs , mineral springs , soda fountains , volcanic rock , volcanic crater , and saline efflorescences , and four thousand five hundred feet above the sea , is for the first time described . The same of the . Sierra Nevada-of the rivers Sacramento and San Joaquin , which constitute the waters of the bay of San Francisco  --  and the same of the Great Desert , and its Arab inhabitants , which lies south of the latitude of that bay , and extends many degrees east towards the Rocky Mountains . None of these objects have heretofore been described by any traveller . On the other hand , the famed Buenaventura river , which has had a place on so many maps , and a line of such great length traced for it from the Rocky Mountains to the sea , is proved to have no existence-that no such river does , or can , come down to the sea from tho , e mountains , the lofty Sierra Nevada interposing an insuperable obstacle-that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our continent from the mountains to the sea  --  a fact which gives to the Columbia , as Captain Frdmont well remarks , a great additional value in the eyes of nations . The form and character of the valley which hotds the waters of the bay of San Francisco , is now , for the first time , made known , with the important fact that it connects with the Oregon Territory by its main river , the Sacramento , which heads north of latitude 42 , in the table land which holds the romantic lake , or meadow , called Tiamath , from which Fall River proceeds direct to the Columbia . But the greatest and most striking of all the geographical discoveries and descrip .. tions is that of the Great Basin , or vast interior plain which lies between the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains east and west , and between the Blue mountains on the Wahsatch on the south , and embracing an area of five or six hundred miles diameter . The elevation of the Sierra Nevada , being more lofty than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basin , as Capt . Fr*mont calls it , and of which he is the first to announce its existence to the world . A basin , which may hold such a kingdom as France , and which has for its rim a circle of mountains whose summits penetrate the region of eternal snow , is certainly a new and grand object to be revealed to our contemplation ; and its non-discovery heretofore can only be attributed to its position in that part of Spanish Ameri* ca ( the Californias ) from which Spanish jealousy excluded every foreign eye . Its existence is now established . Captain Frdmont was in it and round it-eight months getting round it  --  and never out of sight of snow-capped mountains , its own elevation being upwards of four thousand feet above the sea . His description of it will be read with profound interest , and FREMONT 'S BAsIN is assuredly the name which justice and propriety would bestow upon it . Botanical researches were evidently a favorite pursuit with Capt . Fr*mont . Not a day passes that he does not note the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the characteristic plants and flowers . From the zeal with which he sought them  --  the cordiality with which he saluted the new and beautiful , and the vast collections which he made , and which were still considerable after the loss of a mule-load in the Sierra Nevada , and the damage of others in the great flood of the Kanzas when almost home , it is evident that he found in this delightful study of the works of Nature , in one of her most elegant and attractive departments , a luxurious enjoyment of the mind , which compensated and relieved the toils of the body . With characteristic modesty he satisfies himself in gathering and bringing in these rare and beautiful productions , and leaves it to the professional science of Dr. Torrey , of Princeton , to classify his specimens , and give them to the world . This the doctor has // done in an appendix to the Report , which will be read with great interest by the friends and lovers of botany . Geology came in for a full share of attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly inspected for what it presented externally , but all opportunities were seized in bluffs , cliffs , chasms , ravines , river banks , and in the sides and gorges of mountains to discover what the disruption of the earth , the abrasion of the waters , or the tumbling of avalanches might have revealed from the interior . Characteristic soils and rocks are specified ; fossils and minerals enumerated ; and specimens brought in of what was new or rare . Of these specimens , one of fossiliferous rock , having an o*litic structure , and found in the rim of the Great Basin on the side that encloses the Great Salt Lake , will attract the attention of learned men both in Europe and America ; as will the fluviatile infusoria found in the lofty escarpements of the Cascade Range on the lower Columbia . These specimens , and numerous others , were referred to Dr. Hall , of New York , and Professor Bailey , of West Point , whose skilful classification and erudite temarks illustrate all the geological collections of Capt . Fr*mont , and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon , and night , the thermometer was in hand to ascertain the degree of heat or cold . As the country rose or fell-mountain , plain or valley , lake or river  --  the barometer was applied to tell the elevation above the sea . Every clear night the telescope was pointed to the heavens , and occultation of planets , and immersion and emersion of satellites , watched , and all the astronomical observations made which give the latitude and longitude . Every day the weather is noted ; and the almanacmaker may construct an almanac for the Rocky Mountains , Oregon and California , from a perusal of this Report . Wind , rain , snow , sleet , ice , clouds , sunshine , heat , cold , temperate-all are noted on these crowded pages . In fact , they make a clear exhibition of the climates of the different regions , and must have both use and interest to those who study the character of these remote countries , or contemplate a removal to them . Thus marching , and working , the expedition arrives at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point its du ties terminated . The survey was coniplete from the Mississippi to the Pacific . The expedition of 1842 had carried it to the South Pass in the Rocky Mountains : that of 1843 carried it to the Lower Columbia , and there met the survey of Captain Wilkes . A great work was then accomplished . Our Continent was surveyed through its interior . All the materials were obtained for a map , and itinerary of the road to Oregon , with all the information which war , science , or commerce could require ; and , in addition , all the barometrical observations made for the construction of a profile map which could give a view of the elevations of the country upon the whole line of travel . The work of duty was accomplished , and the expedition might have returned upon its track with the approbation which was due to success . But such was not the temper of its young and adventurous leader . He had no desire to make tracks where he had made them before , or even where any .. body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new-something beyond orders-beyond duty : something that should add to the stock of useful knowledge , and to his own fame . And , late as the season was ( 20th of November ) , he determined to explore a new route , and to return to the United States by an untrod path , through regions unvisited , and which vague report filled with deserts , mountains , rivers , lakes , and strange tribes of Indians who had had no intercourse with the whites . It is at page 196 of the Report that Capt . Fr6mont states this determination , and his reasons for it , which we give in his own words : " The camp was now occupied in making the necessary preparations for our homeward journey , which , though homeward , contemplated a new route , and a great circuit to the south and southeast , and the exploration of the Great Basin between the Rocky mountains and the Sierra .2Vevada . Three principal objects were indicated by report or by maps , as being on this route , the character or existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as landmarks or leading points , on the projected line of return . The first of these points was the Tiamath lake , on the table land between the head of Fall river , which comes to the Columbia , and the Sacramento , which &gt;*ocs *o tie bay of San Francisco ; and from which lake a river of the sam3 name makes its // 75 way westwardly direct to the ocean . This lake and river are often called Kiarnet , but I have chosen to write its name according to the Jndian pronunciation . The position of this lake , on the line of inland communication between Oregon and California ; its proximity to the demarcation boundary of latitude 420 ; its imputed double character of lake , or meadow , according to the season of the year ; and the hostile and warlike character attributed to the Indians about it ,  --  all made it a desirable object to visit and examine . From this lake our course was intended to be about southeast to a reported lake , called Mary 's , at some days ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on southeast , to the reputed Buenaventura river , which has had a place in so many maps , and countenanced the belief of the existence of a great river flowing from the Rocky mountains to the bay of San Francisco . From the Buenaventura the next point was intended to he in that section of the Rocky mountains which includes the heads of Arkansas river , and of the opposite waters of the California gulf ; and thence down the Arkansas to Bent 's fort , and home . This was our projected line of return  --  a great part of it absolutely new to geographical , botanical , and geological science-and the subject of reports in relation to lakes , rivers , deserts , and savages hardly above the condition of mere wild animals , which inflamed desire to know what this terra incognita really contained , it was a serious enterprise , at the commencement of winter , to undertake the traverse of such a region , and with a party consisting only of twenty-five persons , and they ofmany nations-American , French , German , Canadian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under twenty-one years of age . All knew that a strange country was to be explored , and dangers and hardships to be encountered ; but no one blenched at the prospect . On the contrary , courage and confidence animated the whole party . Cheerfulness , readiness , subordination , prompt obedience , characterized all ; nor did any extremity of peril and privation , to which we were afterwards exposed , ever belie , or derogate from , the fine spirit of this brave and generous commencement . The course of the narrative will show at what point , and for what reasons , we were prevented from the complete execution of this plan , after having made considerable progress upon it , and how we were forced by desert plains and mountain ranges , and deep snows , far to the south , and near to the Pacific ocean , and along the western base of the Sierra Nevada ; where , indeed , a new and ample field of exploration opened itself before us . For the present , we must follow the narrative , which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the eastern base of the Cascade range , to the Tlamath lake , from which , or its margin , three rivers go in three directions-one west to'the ocean ; another north , to the Columbia ; the third south , to California. ** From this time until it recrossed the Rocky mountains , in the month of June , in the following year , the expedition became one of novelty , boldness , perseverance , peril and suffering , seldom paralleled in the annals of adventure , and never surpassed by anything that we have read . Everything is new and strange , both of people and of countries . The Tlamath Lake , and its inhabitants  --  the descent into the Great Basin-the progress along its rim , i. e. , the Sierra Nevada , on the right-lakes and deserts on the left-Indians who had never seen white people , and who fled , filling the country with the barbarian signal of alarm , columns of smoke from hills and mountains-crossing the Sierra Nevada - arrival at Nueva Helretia ( Sutter 's settlement ) and the beautiful valleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jesuit missions-crossing the Great Desert on the confines of the Lower Californiaits Arab inhabitants employed in robbery and murder-meeting the warlike Utaks lying in wait for the great California caravan-combats between the Utahs and Arapahoes , in the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains-urged to join each party , and forced to fortify against each : such were the leading events of an enterprise which consumed eight months of time , and some four thousand miles of travelling , and which traversed regions of which no account had ever before been published . In this long line of bold and successful adventure , where every movement was attended by some new and strange interest , the crossing of the Great Sierra Nevada must stand pre-eminent for the hardihood of its conception-its successful execution-and the perils and sufferings it imposed . It was the 30th of January , and after having been nearly three months out from the Columbia , struggling in snow and ice , men suffering for food , and horses famishing for grass , that Capt . Fr6mont became satisfied that any further progress towards the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed eastwardly must be attended by the probable destruction of the party . To change his course , and reach some Californian settlement , became the imperious alternative . Correct instruments , and astronomical observations informed him that he was in the latitude of the Bay of San Fra isco , and that , at one degree west , was the Nueva Ilelselia of the Swiss emigrant , Capt . Sotter . But that degree comprised the lofty ridge of the Sierra , called Snowy ( Nevada ) because eternal snows rest upon its summits . He determined to attempt the passage of this mountain in opposition to all the remonstrances of the Indians , now become tame and familiar from the kind treatment they had received , and who pointed to the skies to show the height of the mountains , and to the trees to show the depth of the snows , and indicated great chasms and gorges into which themselves and horses would slip and fall . It was all in vain . The attempted passage was resolved upon ; the captain and his men ( by whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the energies of the white race , to conquer difficulties insuperable to others . They did it , but at an imm*nse cost . Above thirty horses and mules perished : several men became delirious , and remained for days deranged : horses , mules , dogs , acorns , pine-nuts , were eaten : an elevation of nine thousand feet was conqnered : snows of twenty feet were passed : and all without a guide , no reward being sufficient to hold any of the Indians to their engagement when they approached the frowning Sierra , its sides black with walls of volcanic rock-its summits white with everlasting snow . All deserted , and left American enterprise to work its way alone to what , as it seemed to them , was inevitable destruction . After twenty days exertion the summit was reached , and a view had into the far below valley of the Sacramento ; but the descent was yet to be made , and though less laborious was , as intimated by the Indians , more perilous than the ascent . It was , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the descent was not easy ; and in fact , the heaviest losses and greatest sufferings were sustained in this getting down from a mountain of volcanic impression , in which the sides were walls  --  the projections rocks  --  the chasms filled with snow  --  and the gorges roaring with plunging cataracts . It was not until the 8th of March-forty days after these modern Titans had commenced climbing the formidable Sierra on the east-that they cleared its western base , and emerged upon the astonished vision of the vaqueros of the Sacramento , to whom they looked more like spectres than living men . It was from this point , and by way of Monterey and the Pacific Ocean , that the expedition was heard of , for the only time from leaving the Columbia in November in 1843 , until it reached the frontiers of Missouri in August 1844 : and certainly , it may be said , that a more bold and perilous crossing of an unknown mountain , in an unknown country , three thousand miles from their own homes , was never accomplished by such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Capt Fr*mont does not indulge in theories and speculations . His Report is a daily narrative of facts , uncolored by opinions ; but , before leaving the western slope of our continent , and when approaching the base of the Rocky Mountains , he very naturally took a retrospective view of the general form and face of the country over which he had been tracing his devious way for eight long and eventful months . This is briefly and graphically done , at pages 274-7 , mixed with a few enlarged military and commercial conceptions , and a comparison between the Atlantic and Pacific slopes of our continent , which can not be abridged or omitted without impairing the general representation or picture of his labors , which we are now endeavoring to exhibit to the reader 's contemplation . Accompanying the Report are various drawings to illustrate different places and objects , and two maps , one geographical , the other in profile . Both are essential to the understanding of the narrative ; and the profile map especially deserves the study of all who wish either to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to compare it with other continents , or to judge the feasibility of a railroad to Oregon . It will be seen that Capt . Fr*mont looks upon the mouth of the Kanzas ( 400 miles beyond St. Louis ) or the mouth of the Great Platte ( 700 miles beyond that city ) as the probable points of commencement of such a road , when there shall be a population on the way and at the other end , to use // and to take care of it . This map , too , made by a scientific and practical man , who has travelled the whole distance ,  - -  compass in hand , taking courses ; harorneter in hand , measuring elevations ; telescope in hand , determining longitudes and latitudes ; pencil in hand , sketching the country ; pen in hand , writing down the character of hills and vales , of plains and mountains , of rocks and earths , of trees , grass , and flowers , of rivers , creeks , fountains , lakes , and branches ,  --  this profile map , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspection of those Oregon railroad projectors , who lecture in cities , and propose an expedition along the route which , if perchance prolonged as far as proposed , may have the merit of approaching within seven hundred miles of the place where the road ought to begin ! The personal merits of Capt . Fr6-mont , in these expeditions , have been great , and evince high talent for command and for enterprise . With an average of twenty-five men , and no officer to aid him , he has made ten thousand miles of march among tribes of savages , without ever being exposed to surprise or defeat , providing for the subsistence of men and horses , and preserving order , subordination , and cheerful obedience throughout his command . Without the aid of scientific assistance , he has so enriched his Report with science as to seem to have been the work of professional savans . He has taken no copy-right in his maps or Jolrnal , but placed all in the hands of the Government , for the benefit of the country ; and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has hastened off to commence a third expedition . The honorary reward of Brevet Captain has been bestowed upon him Lewis and Clark received something more substantial ,  --  double pay , sixteen hundred acres of land each , promotion to generals , appointment of governors , commission to treat with Indians , and copy-right in their Journal . Certainly , as first explorers , they were entitled to great merit ; but they lack the science which Capt . Frhmont carried into his expeditions ; and , returning on the same line by which they went out , their discoveries lack the breadth and variety which distinguish his . His work was lacking to complete the view of the great region from the Mississippi to the Pacific ocean ; and it has come at the exact moment that it was most wanted , and will be most useful . Great events are impending , of which Oregon is the subject . American honor , as well as American rights , are at stake ! and the civilized world pauses to see-perhapsthe issue of the third great contest between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anglo-Saxon race . We assume to say that the publication of this Report will increase the emigration to Oregon , and will sharpen the appetite of two great nations for the possession of a river whose mouth happens to be the only outlet to the sea-whose valley is the only line of communication across the North American Continentand whose heads touch the only passes which open from the Rocky Mountains into the Valley of the Mississippi . As a literary composition , it would be unjust to analyze the Report . It is evidently the transcript of the notes made in the field ; and is what such notes would naturally be , a brief and rapid delineation of all that was seen , and in the order in which it was seen . No attempt is made at fine writing . In place of that we have truth and vigor. and the fresh , vivid , and sudden descriptions which come from a man in the midst of action , and who has something else to do besides talking . Still , many passages are powerfully written ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelty and importance of the matter . The whole can be read with pleasure , as well as benefit , by the man of taste and education . On the return from the third expedition , it is to be hoped that the Reports of the three expeditions may be published together , and with the care which is due to a national work so wisely conceived , so skilfully executed , and so modestly given to the public.
