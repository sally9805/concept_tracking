txt Dear Sir ,  --  You will probably recollect , that during , a fever with which I was visited three years ago , I experienced some singular illusions , connected probably with a peliar state of the aptic nerve . I gave a short account of these in a sermon . soon after in th college chapel , and published in my " Wreath for th Tomb . " Within the last fortnight , it has pleased Providence to prostrate m again with the same disease , viz , a fever , connected with acut inflammatory action in the intercostal muscles . The same peculiar impressions , connected with vision , occurred at an early stage of my disease , and have been carried so much farther than before , as to lead me to address you at this time . You are well aware , that my time is chiefly devoted to physical science , and that I make no pretensions to skill in psychology . When these hallucinations , therefore , commenced , and I saw that they were becoming interesting , I resolved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mental science , to ask you to furnish me with some rules by which I might make experiments upon myself , that might be of some service to science ; but I quickly saw , that in the excitement of a fever , such a course must be hazardous . Yet , as these visions * It will be perceived , that this article consists of a corre pondence between Profs . Edward Hitchcock aud N. W. Fiske , of Amh rst Colle* e . It having fallen into our hands in the state in which it was written , without any view to publication , and being too long for insertion in a single number , we have taken the liberty of omitting personal compliments , moral reflections , and other parts not directed immediately to the explanation of the phenomena in question by the known laws of mind. - Ed. were very numerous , and I did perform a few experiments , I venture to give you the details , with the request that you would furnish the philosophy of the subject ; if , indeed , the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general principles ; and I seize the earliest moment in which I am able to dictate a letter , to make out the descriptions , as I find these scenes are rapidly fleeing from my memory . It will probably be an important preliminary to state , that during my sickness , my mind has been apparently free from any tendency to mental derangement . Except for a short time at the outset , I have felt scarcely a pain in my head , and a degree of clearness has existed in my mind , certainly as great as in health , although incapable of continued application , from bodily weakness . When the phenomena under consideration began to occur , I looked at them with as much curiosity and calmness , as if I were an indifferent spectator . Here Prof. H. introduces a certificate from Dr. Dorrance , his attending physician , to the effect that he manifested no signs of insanity during his sickness , but appeared constantly able to reason correctly respecting the visions and every thing else-Ed . I judge it important also to state a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed during a few months past ; for , if I mistake not , they have formed the principal materials out of which fancy has constructed those very structures with which she has filled my mind . During our long winter vacation , most of my time was occupied in delivering lectures on scientific subjects , before large assemblies , in several of our cities and // larger towns . They were the most delightful auditories that I ever addressed . During these lectures , I was constantly traveling from place to place , chiefly on railroads and in steamboats , and along the most crowded thoroughfares in the land ; and this too at all hours of the day and the night . My imagination , therefore , could not but be deeply impressed with the idea of rapid motion , and of every place teeming with inhabitants . Nor ought it to he forgotten , that in traveling nearly one thousand miles in this manner , I met with no serious accident , to fill the mind with images of terror . It should be stated , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently was , the wonders of Science compared with the wonders of Romance , and that I gathered together , in this production , the most splendid facts which modern science could furnish . In one of my drawings , too , I exhibited the famous fossil Iguanodon of England , not less than seventy feet long , as well as other extinct monsters . You will see , therefore , from these statements , that my imagination , during the winter , has been not only most actively , but most agreeably exercised . Nay , at no time had it been more exerted than during a few days previous to my sickness ,  --  brought on probably in a great measure by the over excitement of those days . These visions did not commence in the present , any more than in my former sickness , until several days after the attack , and when drastic medicines had subdued the severest part of the inflammatory action . In both cases , however , they succeeded the application of mustard to my side , which always produces extreme irritation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but think it rather increased the tendency to these hallucinations . Opium was not admitted in any of its forms , except occasionally as it exists in Dover 's powders . The first peculiarity in the state of my vision that I noticed , was precisely the same as that observed in my former sickness , viz , a disposition to connect almost every irregular object , on which my eye rested , into a delineation of the human countenance . This effect of course ceased as soon as the eyes were shut , and it was increased by the indistinctness of objects . Thus , a phrenological bust , about as large as life , stood upon a cupboard before me , as much as eight feet from the floor . A white flannel gown having been thrown over the foot bed-post , between me and the cupboard , the whole was converted , in the evening , into a beautiful bust , of colossal height , with the folds of the drapery arranged as gracefully as if done by the chisel of Canova . The only want of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The most perfect examples of the vision that floated before me , I can hardly doubt should be referred to genuine dreams , in which waking consciousness was more or less entirely gone . And had they been confined to such a state , I should not trouble you with any further descriptions . But they occurred in every state , up to the fullest and most wakeful consciousness , in which there could have been nothing like what we call sleep ; indeed , I strove in vain to excite the least tendency to sleep . In regard to my dreams , those which occurred in the early part of the night were of a much duller and grosser kind than those which closed my slumbers usually about the dawning of the day . The two great elements of these dreams were motion and crowded masses of people , most of whom were also in motion . They seemed apparently to interfere with one another , and yet no actual interference occurred . I seemed to join one of the moving masses , and though the area around me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by rocks , trees , and mountains , yet no actual obstruction seemed ever to be in my way ; but with a quiet and delightful motion , and with no jarring or collision , I seemed to be brought to the spot to which I was destined . Yet I never could see exactly how I moved ; nor did I ever get sight of a steamboat , a rail car , a carriage , or , except in one or two instances , of a horse , and scarcely saw any water , and yet , the splendid landscapes frequently presented before me appeared to be situated upon the coast . In no case but once , do I recollect to have parted from terra firma . In this case , a party of us in a barouche seemed to come in sudden proximity with a barouche of ladies dressed in white , whom I understood to be from Saturn , and my impression is that we met somewhere near the orbit of Jupiter . In making our mutual salam we came near overturning our barouches , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were very large , about being tossed into our vehicle , awakened me . I ought to confess that on the afternoon previous to that night , I had been persuaded to do what I had not done for ten or twelve years , viz. to take a cup of weak black tea ; and I presume that had I taken only water , as usual , imagination could not have got me farther off than the orbit of the moon . I have been surprised at the pleasantness of nearly all the images that passed before me , and the absence of almost every thing disgusting . It is true that during the early part of the night they were often rather coarse ; such sights for instance as a man often sees as he passes along the outer parts of a city when the tide is out , and dirty timber , old hulks , and often dirty sailors may be seen . Still it did not revolt the feelings merely to pass in my strange vehicle along such places , when in the next mo ment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees and mountains in the distance , appeared . In one instance the physician had administered assafo*tida , in order to put a stop to these flights of fancy , and I went to sleep in the expectation that if my visions occurred , they must be of a disgusting kind . But instead of this , I fancied myself in some oriental land , ( probably from the known origin of the drug , ) in a sunny day , on the shores of an indented bay , reposing upon a sofa as in feeble health , while all around there stood in respectful silence , many well dressed in Turkish costume , as well as some Franks , and at a little distance I saw the French servant of some man of distinction coming to me with a message , who proved however to be Mrs. H. with a cup of medicine , and all my oriental magnificence vanished . I had fallen into a slumber more deep than any during the severer part of my sickness . Mrs. H. made slight efforts to awaken me . She also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I was conscious of , was a sudden commotion extending through all nature around me , which produced a cry , " the greatest discovery of the age . " It seemed as if all nature had been bound together immovably , and the discovery consisted in a fluid which loosed her bands . It was the water applied to my mouth which gave a start to the wheels in my system , which had almost stopped ; and this gave the idea of nature being bound together . But I doubt whether such cases have in them any thing of peculiar interest . I therefore proceed to other details . In the following cases , the dreaming state appears to have entered into the waking state . Mrs. H. brought me some medicine my eyes were closed , but turning frequently in their sockets , and my head also was moving . At length I opened my eyes and said , // " I have been trying to examine a center table covered with coral , more beautiful than any I ever saw . " She asked me if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments before ; I answered , No . My impression is , that the first view of the coral was in a dream , and that upon returning consciousness I was endeavoring to examine it in a manner to be more particularly described hereafter . As I awaked , I was looking down a large valley where was an immense quarry of limestone . I kept my eyelids closed after consciousness returned , in order to look at it farther . I saw that the strata were made up of alternating layers of white and dark color . On opening my eyes there lay before me a piece of bed-ticking , which appeared like the alternating beds of limestone in miniature . I awoke one morning in the midst of most wild and magnificent scenery . The morning sun had just risen upon it , and the shadows of the mountain peaks were intermingled with bright streams of light , and the graceful curling of the fog up the mountain sides produced one of the grandest panoramas that I ever witnessed . After consciousness had returned , I tried to retain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than usual , especially in getting a full view of one of the grandest mountains the imagination could conceive . It rose in solemn majesty from a deep valley ; the fog still lingered about its summit , and its aspect was darker than the mountains around . As I gazed upon its stern and awful front , I could not but feel that I was looking upon Sinai . In order to render the remaining cases more intelligible , I must make some preliminary statements . At that stage of my complaint , when irregular objects began to assume regular forms upon the retina , I noticed that both , by day and by night the images which surrounding objects made upon the eye , remained for a considerable time after closing the eyelid . Presently , I perceived that those images began to change their figures into objects and scenes as unlike the original as possible . This was especially the case when I directed the attention of the mind to the light that seemed directly before me . So long as the mind concentrated its attention upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know not but I might have followed the succession of images for hours , had I dared to do it . From the particular image before me , I could form no idea of that which would succeed . And yet one scene would graduate into another in the easiest and most natural manner . I soon found that after my eyes were closed , the more entirely the external light was excluded , the more distinct would be the images , and the more rapid the changes of scene . Hence I usually placed my hand or a handkerchief over my eyes . If questions were put to me while examining the images , it seemed to produce some confusion , but simply by withdrawing the attention . Rolling my eye-balls in their sockets did not increase the power of vision at all . I ' went about the examination of these objects with as entire freedom from drowsiness , and with as perfect a command of all my powers , as ever I possessed in my life . In a few instances , after closing the eyes for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this I think rendered the vision more distinct . Withdrawing the attention from the object would usually end the illusion , even though the eyes continued shut ; but sometimes , especially at night , it would continue as long as the eyes were closed . An examination of these images produced no more fatigue than it would to look over a collection of pictures in a gallery-probably not as much . // The chief agent in producing the changes of objects before my mind , appeared to be internal motion among the particles . The figures , say of the paper hangings of the wall , or of the landscape abroad , usually at first became smaller and smaller , until the surface appeared granulated , very much like what I have frequently seen upon the screen of the solar microscope , when a menstruum was in the focus , containing a salt which was just beginning to crystallize . The next step in the process was usually a rising of the particles and rolling round an axis , just as I have seen a whirlwind raise the dust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along the surface : or sometimes the whole body before me would pass away in a continuous current , and another succeed . After these motions , objects would usually begin to assLlme. mote regular forms , and there came before me mountains and valleys , cities and temples , and human beings . They were almost always however in motion , scarcely lingering long enouot a for me to get a distinct conception of them , especially , as in almost all cases the light seemed more like that of twilight than like that of midday . Frequently , vast rocks and even huge mountains came moving towards me , and I seemed to pass under them . They came apparently within a few inches of my eyes ; and had I believed them real , I should have trembled as I saw myself about to be ground to powder . But so perfectly conscious was I of the illusion , that it merely amused me to see them approaching , because I loved to see how , by their curious convolutions , they would pass me unharmed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exactly resembled that which we witness among the clouds when a thunder storm is rising and contrary winds are curling the vapor in every direction . Though such was the usual mode in which a change of images was effected , yet sometimes the change took place without any visible intestine motion mong the particles , and no less perfectly . the only thing approaching the apparent motions above described , which I witnessed with my eyes open , was this : In the evening the ceiling of the room sometimes appeared as if numerous threads of white silk were suspended at various points and hung in festoons ; appearing indeed exactly as if numerous cobwebs hung in the usual manner from the ceiling , and were strongly illuminated . There was , however , among them no apparent motion . Finding myself possessed of the extraordinary power above described , I could not resist the temptation to make a few experiments , partly to relieve the tedium of those who were watching at my bed-side . I told them that if they would record my descriptions , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fancy . I did not dare to prolong my excursions much ; but such facts as were thus recorded I will now present , as recorded by the individuals who acted as amanuenses . I will only say , that never in my life am I aware of having been more perfectly awake , and of possessing more entire control over the faculties of attention and observation than during these examinations , although all my powers were weakened by disease . The following notes were made on Tuesday evening by Mrs. Hitchcock , and did not constitute a continuous series of examinations , but are the record of a few striking facts as I mentioned them from time to time . And the same indeed is more or less true of all the cases subsequently described . Tuesday evening , Feb. 1. - " I see beautiful clouds that appear to be produced by the glimmering of the // candle in the room , falling upon my eyelids . " " I am in a room hung round by fine paintings . " ( Interrupted . ) " I seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York richly furnished . " " I am looking into a cedar swamp during a snow storm . I see also a deep rail road cut in granite ; and the whole scene appears to inc to be on the Boston and Worcester rail road a little east of Westborough . " " I stand at the east end of a large hall filled with a great variety of articles . The whole reminds me somewhat of a fair in Boston last December , which I attended for a few moments . " Wednesday morning , Feb. 2. - " I stand now in the piazza of a large circular house , with a circular fence before it and brick walks . " " I am upon the sea coast , examining some large masses and walls of granite . The rock resembles that in southeastern Massachusetts . On one of the walls which does not face the ocean , but forms the bank between a small creek and the ocean , I see four colossal carved figures represented as wrestling , two and two . " Afternoon. - " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon closing my eyes , a strong impression of objects remains upon the retina . This has slowly changed into a long room , with pillars on one side indistinctly seen ; and now it opens on one sine and at the end , and appears to be a piazza . Till this moment* I had not covered my eyes ; but on placing a thick handkerchief over them , objects become much more distinct . I now stand at the east end of the piazza , and before me is a landscape : on my right a hill , apparently pasture ground , partially covered with snow , and its top more or less with trees . Towards the left is a valley partially wooded , and down this valley the strongest light seems to conduct me . I have now come to an enclosure , where I see indistinctly large masses of timber laid up with a good deal of regularity . I now see them more distinctly , and they are two ships upon the stocks . I now withdraw my attention and open my eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had passed through my mind . I closed my eyes after looking a moment steadily upon the paper hangings on one side of my room , which had on them numerous small spots and figures of a reddish or buff color . As they began to change their aspect , I accidentally rubbed my head , when the changes became more rapid . The experiments lately detailed in the newspapers , in which particular phrenological organs were mesmerized and rubbed , recurred to my mind , and I immediately rubbed my head in the region where I supposed the organs of benevolence lie ; although I confess I know too little of phrenology to fix upon the precise spot . Immediately the surface before me assumed the appearnnce of a piece of sole leather ; which soon enlarged , so as to cover an acre or two , swelling up into numerous little hillocks , and appearing just like an Indian corn field in the spring , with cracks running among the hillocks . On one side of the field were shelves , on which great numbers of these little hillocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole field , to be loaves of well baked bread . I waited to see what the organ of benevolence xvould do with this large supply of the staff of life , when I found myself on one of the poorest and most dreary parts of the coast of New England ; which I will not name , because I am not sure that I recognized it . Whether the bread was to be distributed at this place , or some other , I did not see , as some one entered the room and withdrew my attention . What a striking proof was here of // the truth of phrenology and mesinerism ! Just about as good , it seems to me , as the following brought near rae , a most distinct petrifaction of the heads of two large reptiles appeared , that seemed to have perished in combat , the tusks of one being interlocked with those of the other . As I looked upon the curious specimen , a change came over it ; the rock slowly melted down ; and in a short time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granite or gneiss , alone remained . Now I suppose in this case , as well as in the phrenological one just described , imagination made use of such materials as she found existing in the mind : and had I known nothing of the mesmeric-phrenological experiments detailed in the newspapers , nor of the metamorphic theory in geology , the above visions would never have existed . Wednesday night . ( Record made by Mr. Josiah Stearns , of the Junior Class. ) - " The space around me is mostly filled with huge rocks , moving past me in all modes , full of caverns , but too dark to be well seen : they hang over me now and look splendidly ; some of them appear to be serpentine . Some of the caverns in these rocks seem a hundred feet long . " Against the side of a wall I see three young ladies sitting and laughing ; lighted candles are before them , and chairs , machinery , &amp;c. , around them . " " I lie in a vast cavern ; the rocks are rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my face ; some are sandstone and some granite . " I have a glimpse into a large city : but a carriage-maker 's yard , full of rubbish , almost entirely obstructs my view . " " I see half a dozen negroes , men and women , dressed in oil-cloth , waiting at a corner ; some of them with striped clothing . " " I see a negro apparently tending a saw-mill : now lying down on a board , which seems to me not more than five feet distant . " I think I recognize a street in Salem , and see an individual whom I have seen before . " " A pine wood on a hillside is before me ; on the ground I see several small chickens , and some children , apparently on their way to school . " " I am now in a street of a city , full of carriages and men , and very muddy , appearing like the streets of New York , or Boston , about the heads of the principal wharves . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have tried in vain to pass through it , and look at the articles offered for sale . At the lower end of it I see some strange looking men , who appear like American Indians . " " Slightly drowsy , which gives much greater distinctness to objects . I see large rooms , " &amp;c . " Continual change of scenery : now streets , with people passing , dressed in white . I am now looking into the valley of the Connecticut , on a beautiful June morning , when the flowers are in bloom and the birds singing . " The preceding examples recorded by Mr. Stearns , were all given by me at a single examination : that is , after closing my eyes , and placing a handkerchief upon them , I did not open , them till the images had all passed before me , with many others not recorded . How long I might have continued this play of fancy I know not , but thought it prudent to open my . eyes . Thursday evening . ( Mrs. Hitchcock recorder. ) - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granite pillars in front ; the floor of marble , covered with a moss resembling Cenomyce rangiferina . The back part of it is less splendid , and of a reddish // color . It extends back to a hill of red sandstone . " Miss Catharine Hitchcock , recorder. - " I have just bathed my forehead in sulphuric ether , which always renders my visions more distinct . I seem now to be looking upon a vast plain which gradually changes to an ocean , and over its whole surface the vapor is beautifully curling upwards in fantastic shapes : now it has changed to land again and a large temple rises in the distance : now it seems mostly rock , having the aspect of new red sandstone . " Mr. Jeremiah Taylor , of the Junior Class , recorder. - " I see a large tree across a brook , with limbs extending far from the trunk and enlarged by a succession of smaller branches . Thousands of men appear around some of the branches and in the top of the tree . " ( Qu . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming over me : now there opens among them a dry valley , exceeding dry : its craggy sides are now in front of me . Now the hills and valleys seem made up of volcanic rocks and cinders : now I am in a shop , full of iron : now I am passing through a valley : now among coarse homely brick walls : now the country around is smooth and level . " You will observe in the concluding details above given , the images become more and more dull . In fact , I scarcely experienced any farther visions of this kind after Thursday night ; and soon all power to produce them was gone . The question , however , often came up in my sickness , whether any one desirous of trying experiments of this sort might not acquire the power . Let him first yield to the operation of rather powerful medicines ; then let him remain two or three days without eating ; then let him apply irritating applications to his surface , and if need be take opium or morphine . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect that without that unknown something , called fever , he would torment himself without reward . I have written this letter while yet in so feeble a state that I dare not make much mental effort , and therefore , you will find the style slovenly , though I hope intelligible . Whether you can make any use of the facts in your favorite science , or explain them by the rules of mental philosophy , I leave for you to de cide . EDWARD HITCHCOCK . Amherst College , Feb. 20,1842 . Highly respected and dear sir ,  - -  Gratefully sensible of the respect you show me by asking me to " furnish the philosophy of ' the subject " of the phenomena occurring in your sickness , I am at the same time pained by the conviction that you are to be disappointed when you find so little philosophy furnished in return for so interesting a collection of facts . It has perhaps sometimes happened that for a fine selection of mineral specimens sent to an amateur or a collector , you have received in exchange but a poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friends , ( a mineralogist now eminent in our country , ) was wont , in his youthful humor , joining as he said a Greek and a Latin in philological marriage , to call by the name of jactalite , Q*tOo ; and jacio . ) So now , your rare psychological specimens bring back to you only what you may without any slander call a cheap fragment of common-place metaphysics . All the philosophy to be expected as to the subject of what you have called your " hallucinations , " must consist in reducing the phenomena as mere facts under other mere facts more general ; or in other words , in finding their due place in a classified arrangement of mental effects . Such an arrangement , in part at least , you have yourself made . Three classes of phenomena are // evidently presented in your narrative , on the FIRST of which , I will now proceed to offer some observations . You say , " the first peculiarity in the state of my vision that I noticed , was precisely the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to convert almost every irregular object on which my eye rested , into a delineation of the human countenance . " No respectable psychologist or physiologist , I suppose , now maintains that by original and direct vision we see either the figure , the size or the distance , of external objects . Color alone , or at most , color attended with some indefinite notion of expansion , is the only property originally perceived by the eye ; all else that we seem now to sce as instantly as we do color is truly the result of a process ; a process consisting of a series of conceptions and judgments . The rapidit5* of this process must in some cases be prodigious ; in all cases it is such that no person can testify to his being directly conscious of the successive acts of the process . Yet it may be proved to the satisfaction of any person , that whenever he sees the distance , magnitude , or figure of an object , there is such a process ; and that what he seems to see is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides what he truly and properly sees , includes also a series or comhination of inferences , conjectures , or conceptions , which are totally different from the visual sensations , and which really arise from them , but arise so instantaneously that the sensation and these subsequent or accompanying mental acts or states can not be distinguished from each other in their occurrence . Thus vision may indeed , as Swift humorously says , be defined , as " the act of seeing things that are invisible . " Even in the most common instances of sight , the visual sensations are combined with certain mere concep tions of our own minds , derived wholly from other senses , and the union is so instantaneous and so close that the complex whole appears to ourselves to consist of direct sensation and perception . Now I apprehend that your visions of human faces in every case were but the result of this principle , which is involved in the most common vision . In all instances of vision , mere conceptions are combined with sensations . And the chief peculiarity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viz , that to the usual combination of sensations and conceptions made in ordinary vision , there were joined additional conceptions , awakened so instantly and so vividly along with the visual sensations and the conceptions forming the usual combination that they entered as parts into the same seeming whole , and therefore appeared to be matters of real perception as truly as do the conceptions which are combined with visual sensations in ordinary sight . Is then this peculiarity any thing anomalous ? I think there is a principle or general fact under which it belongs as a particular instance along with other analogous cases ; that general fact or principle , is perhaps , correctly enough for my purpose , expressed in the following words : there is a great tendency in the mind so to combine with its real perceptions the mere conceptions and imaginations which are awakened in immediate connection with them , as to invest the blended whole with an illusive appearance of reality . 1 . This fact or principle is vast in its comprehension of particulars , embracing an immense variety of most interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a host of popular superstitions ; by it may easily be solved any story of ghost or apparition without impeaching in the least degree the integrity or sanity of the reporter . To the // same cause may be ascribed those overpowering emotions which are often awakened by the presence of some memento of a departed friend . Whenever conceptions the most purely imaginary are immediately combined with actual perceptions , the former are invested in greater or less degrees with the reality belonging to the latter . The principle holds in reference to all the senses , but is most frequently and strikingly exemplified in that of sight ; and its application to the peculiar cases of your experience may demand a more full illustration . 2 . It is worthy of mention here , that children of a lively turn of mind frequently amuse themselves in imagining resemblances to natural and artificial objects presented among those infinitely varied forms which may be seen upon the panes of the window on a frosty morning . Every one will remember how , at times , in maturer life , his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemblances in the changing clouds of an evening sky . The fact here mentioned Beattie recognizes , in those verses of his poem , in which he represents the young Minstrel as on the shore of the ocean , and viewing the clouds that skirt the distant horizon , " Where , mid the changeful scenery ever new , Fancy a thousand wondrous forms descries , More wililly great than ever pencil drew , Rock , torrents , gulfs , and shapes of giant size , And glittering cliffs on cliffs and fiery ramparts rise . " Cowper , in a beautiful passage of his Task , represents himself as often finding representations of various objects , even in the embers on the hearth : " Me oft has fancy ludicrous and wild Soothed with a waking dream of houses , towers , Trees , churches , and strange visages ex-pressed In the red cinders , while with poring eye I gazed , myself creating what I saw . " 3 . It is the same principle in a higher degree , which , as I suppose , produces that singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on looking down from the vessel into the sea , beholds the images of objects left at home . Cowper refers to the same remarkable phenomenon in the following lines : " Nor yet the mariner , his blood inflamed With acrid salts ; his very heart athirst To gaze at Nature in her green array , Upon the ship 's tall side he stands , possess 'd With visions prompted by intense desire ; Fair fields appear below , such as he left Far distant , such as he would die to find ; He seeks them head long , and is seen no more . " 4 . Other instances of the operation of this same principle are furnished by the well known cases where objects that are seen in a fog or mist , or in twilight , assume a shape just such as the mere conceptions of the observer may happen to impart . The visible object will vary in appearance very much according to the observer 's prevailing habits of conception ; and if the observer be of a timorous or superstitious temper , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this variety of cases , the conceptions and imaginations are often so perfectly combined with the perceptions , as to create the most full belief of reality , a belief too which , in many cases , is never broken up . It has been remarked as a curious fact , that ghosts never venture abroad , either in the light of day or the darkness of midnight . The solution unquestionably is , that in the daytime objects are seen too distinctly to allow any such conception to arise , or if any do arise , to allow a harmonizing union of them with existing perceptions ; and in full darkness there is no visible object to furnish the actual perceptions around which the mere conceptions may cluster , and thereby gather the requisite degree of seeming reality ; but in twilight , objects are seen really , yet indistinctly , and the indistinctness // greatly favors a harmonizing of the perceptions and the conceptions . Precisely of this variety of illusions was your vision of " a beautiful bust of colossal height , " with the folds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstance I have mentioned as contributing to strengthen such illusions , you bring to view by stating that " the effect was increased by the indistinctness of objects ; " and the very circumstance which wholly hinders this form of illusion you also exhibit , when you state that " the effect ceased as soon as the eyes were closed . " Visions and illusions of this sort every person has seen ; most persons have had them in great abundance , both agreeable and painful . 5 . The same general principle is the secret of various optical illusions , which you know it is easy to create artificially . There is an instrument of very simple construction , by which you may be made to think you see an object through another perfectly opaque ; and you may make the experiment for the ten thousandth time , even after the whole contrivance has been explained to you , and you will yet have , in the moment of looking , precisely the belief which you had the first time , just as fully too as he who looks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this case , the judgment , even when amounting to the most perfect knowledge , is not able to counteract the strong tendency of the mind to receive for realities any mere conceptions which it may be led to combine in harmony with actual perceptions . The same thing is manifest in those surprising illusions which may be produced by placing an object in one of the foci of a concave elliptical mirror . After receiving a full explanation of the appearance , according to the laws of optics , and even when the original object and the mirror are both wholly in your sight , you can not help feeling a momentary belief that there is also an actual object in the spot where the image is formed ; and if that image were of a dagger or a lion , and should be made to approach you suddenly , ( as might easily be done , ) you would shrink away from it . That very remarkable natural phenomenon called the " Spectre of Brocken , " is said to be produced in the same way as these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gigantic figure , which is sometimes seen at a distance upon the highest peak of the Ilarz mountains , in the kingdom of Hanover in Germany ; and , although the spectator may know that the spectre is nothing but the image of himself , ( as has been ascertained , it is asserted , from careful observations , ) yet this knowledge does never divest the giant on the mountain top of his seeming reality . 6 . Every well executed painting produces an illusion , and it is done on the principle I have been illustrating ; i. e. by securing a harmonious union of the actual perceptions and the awakened conceptions ; and just in proportion to the facility and the completeness with which such a union is produced , will be the effect of the picture upon the beholder . Hence every contrivance , by the position of the picture or the manner of looking at it , which tends to increase the harmony between the actual sensations and perceptions , and the rising conceptions and imaginations , will add to the illusion . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend or companion excites in our mind , by a remark , some new conception or imagination , as we look on some certain part of a picture , that conception or imagination becomes indelibly stamped on the picture , so that , although we before saw no such representation in the light and shade of that spot , yet we never after can look there without seeing the very thing which was first conveyed to // us through the ear instead of the eye . Thus , in that engraving which some years since was very often found in the family sitting-room , and called , if I rightly recollect , Napoleon looking into his grave , ** you saw at once the grave , and two trees contiguous , but no image or likeness of a man did you find there or think of , however long you looked at the picture , until some one spoke to you of the figure formed by the space artfully included between the two trees ; yet the instant the conception of a man was thus , chiefly if not wholly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man became stamped upon the paper ; and you could not afterwards turn the slightest glance upon the engraving without seeing there the lonely conqueror pensively look . ing upon the narrow house in the ground ; although the actual sensations from the light and shade were still the same as when you first looked upon it , yet your apparent perception was completely changed . 7 . It can not be necessary to dwell longer upon the principle . All the various phenomena above noticed both illustrate and confirm the principle , viz , that awakened conceptions , when intimately combined with harmonizing perceptions , obtain thereby a greater seeming reality* a seeming reality too which often is not perfectly destroyed by the fullest knowledge that they possess no actual reality . And this principle obviously explains the chief peculiarity in the visions belonging to the first class of phenomena explained by you ; the phenomena were analogous to those above presented , and form new instances of the same general fact . The conceptions and imaginations excited in your mind in connection with the sight of the visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear for the moment like realities . 8 . There was , however , a minor peculiarity in those visions which must not be overlooked , and it is the one which , although really a minor circumstance , may , in the view of some persons , seem to be the most important , or at least the most wonderful , viz , that the awakened conceptions were such as " to convert almost every object on which the eye rested into a delineation of the human countenance ; " that is , the conceptions awakened in your mind at the time were chiefly conceptions or imaginations of human faces . I shall not undertake to affirm precisely why conceptions of this particular species or variety , rather than any other , were chiefly suggested ; yet those who are familiar with what are termed in mental science the secon'dary laws of simple suggestion , will think that the reason obviously lies in the fact mentioned by you , that for six weeks just previous to your sickness , you had been very frequently addressing large and splendid auditories ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes in circumstances calculated both strongly to impress the nerves , and highly to stimulate the imagination . Every one knows the fact , that sensations , thoughts , feelings , which have recently been in the mind , are more likely to be suggested and revived , than those experienced at a remoter period : this fact is what is meant by the secondary law of recency . In your former sickness , there was a similar tendency , however , in your mind , to conceptions and imaginations of human faces ; in that in* stance , the reason just mentioned did not , I believe , exist . According to Dr. Rush , the rise of such conceptions is nothing uncommon in sickness attended with nervous excitement ; and he remarks that persons in such cases are apt to conceive most vividly the features of dear friends , especially of those that are deceased : it is hence obvious why it is that the departed usually visit // their surviving relatives in times of sickness , if at all . It is not an absurd conjecture , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the optic nerve an affection similar to that which is produced in looking at a human face ; such an affection of the nerve would naturally occasion some corresponding sensations , and these sensations would naturally awaken the perceptions and conceptions that had been associated with them formerly ; indeed I think the sensations thus caused , would awaken the associated conceptions as certainly as if the sensations were caused by looking at a portrait . Every one knows how vivid a conception of some familiar face may sometimes be awakened by the faintest outline in profile , and even by the slightest sketch of a single feature , as the eye , or nose , or lip . In all such cases two or three slight sensations similar to those produced by actual sight of that face , awaken a conception and remembrance of the whole . Now if a disease or any other influence whatever , should by some excitement or affection in the nerve occasion these same few and slight sensations , why would not the same conception and remembrance follow ? Or if the disease or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the sight of some forgotten face had once produced , why should not similar conceptions be awakened , ( being suggested either by previous association or by analogy , ) and thus present to us not indeed familiar and well-remembered features , but a vivid delineation of some human countenance ? It is , I believe , commonly supposed that those remarkable phenomena which have been classed under the name of false perceptions , are usually caused by some diseased action in the nerves which form the sensorial organ . And it will probably be found by any one who will examine the subject , more difficult than he at first supposes , to draw any exact line of separation between false perceptions and mere conceptions accompanied with a strong momentary belief of the reality of the objects conCeived . The SECOND class of the phenomena evidently consists of dreams , as you yourself remark . " The most perfect examples of the visions that floated before me , I can hardly doubt should be referred to genuine dreams , in which waking consciousness was more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last one , appear to me to exhibit only the common characteristics of dreams ; although they are truly interesting illustrations of certain established principles . Especially amusing is your almost fatal and yet harmless salam to the ladies in white near the distant orb of Saturn ; I doubt , however , whether you are under any particular obligation to the black tea for the nature or extent of that excursion. - One of the general facts in the philosophy of dreams is , that they usually take their character from recent strong impressions . This principle is strikingly illustrated in your dreams ; as their " two great elements , " viz. " motion and crowded masses of people , " were the very elements to be expected from the manner in which you had been engaged for some time immediately preceding-Another principle is , that dreams are often occasioned immediately by impressions on the senses . Your imagination of yourself reposing on a sofa surrounded by Turks and Franks in profound silence , and a servant approaching you with a message from some man of distinction , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise from sensations through the eye , caused by the approach of Mrs. Hitchcock to your bedside . The discovery of a fluid that loosened all the bands of // nature was an instance of the same kind . Those " three cases , " in which you say " the dreaming state appears to have extended into the waking state , " were all probably mere dreams originated in the same way . The vision of the strata of limestone in " alternating layers of white and dark colors , " was doubtless a mere dream occasioned by the sight of the bed-ticking ; the whole train of thought having actually taken its rise after that sensation and before you had fully recovered the waking state . Numerous cases like these are recorded by Abercrombie and others , who have noticed the phenomena of dreaming . And the splendid vision of the mountain , so far as it presents any peculiarity to exclude it from the same variety of dreams , will belong to the third class of phenomena mentioned in your statement ; and , as the vision evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seem to have retained their vividness after the judgment had been so far exercised that you knew them to be mere illusory images and not realities , this case naturally suggests the idea that some of the other visions , those forming the third and most remarkable class , had their first origin also in mere dreams . Your own confidence that you were perfectly awake during the whole time when with your eyes shut you had these visions , permit me to say , can not be proof that you were so in fact , since every person who has attended much upon the sick knows , that the patient will very often feel perfectly confident that he has not sl*pt at all for an hour , or hours , although he has during that time repeatedly been asleep a few seconds at a time. * * Prof. Hitchcock replies to this suggestion , in a letter to Prof. Fiske , that he can not believe it possible he should have been asleep during these visions , since at that time he was not in the very weak state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most interesting views in which I have contemplated your peculiar visions , is that which exhibits their analogy to the more common phenomena of dreaming . In noticing therefore more particularly the THIRD class of phenomena experienced by you , I would observe , as a general remark , that any causes that might produce a train of dreaming images would be adequate to produce the phantasms you witnessed . The existence of the phantasms themselves is to be carefully distinguished front your " knowledge " that they were me-e phantasms ; which knowledge you think was never for a moment wholly lost . But in order to communicate properly what I mean by saying that the images constituting your visions might be produced by any causes which are adequate to produce the images of dreams , it will be necessary to discriminate two things which I include in the statement , and to exhibit each of them more fully . I. The first is this The same general principles of mental phi . losophy , which are applied to explain the rise of one image after another in dreams , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of your visions . Images in dreams rise in succession according to those well established principles which have been called " laws of association , " and more properly " laws of simple suggestion . " These laws are concerned in every waking train of thought ; occur-being able to raise himself in bed , and even to sit up an hour or two . He was also in that painfully wakeful state - known to most persons who have had a fever-in which sleep is quite out of the question . He felt more anxious to get to sleep than to perform the experiments . And a consideration till more decisive is , that he did not report to the recorder the visions of his silent ruomenis , but those only which were passing before hita at the instant he related them . Hence he always used the present tense : " I now see , " not " I have seen . ' - Ed. // but their influence is modified by the agency of the will and the reason or judgment , so that the train of images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would if formed by the laws of simple suggestion operating alone and unchecked . In dreaming , the agency of the will and the judgment is usually if not always suspended , and the train flows on by mere simple suggestion , one image following another in rapid succession . It is unnecessary here to go into a.y detail respecting these laws ; suffice it to remark , that there are three principles which all agree in considering as the grand primary regulators of the train of thought , viz , resemblance , contrast , and previous co-existence or association . By the law of resemblance is merely meant the general fact , that one image in the mind suggests another which more or less resembles it ; e g. a piercing black eye may suggest tile image of Daniel Webster ; by the law of contrast , the fact that an image suggests another at contrast with it or opposed to it ; e. g. a cottage suggests a palace ; and by the law of contiguity or previous co-existence , the fact , that an image or thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind or been associated with it ; e. g. the image of a friend may awaken a conception of the house in which we have visited him , or the city or place where we last saw him . These primary laws are modified in their influence by certain circumstances which have been classified and termed secondary laws , but which need not be stated here. - Some notions ( or conceptions as some would term them ) are , in the first instance in which the mind has them , suggested intuitively or indistinctly in connection with some sensation or other mental state . With this exception , an exception so inconsiderable that it is commonly overlooked , every conception or image in a simple train in the waking state is doubtless introduced in accordance with one or other of the principles above mentioned . Often we are unable to trace the succession , it being impossible to discover how the mind was led from the last image or thought remembered , to the next one remembered ; the reason probably is , that intermediate thoughts or images actually existed but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it took place , we should see each step to have been connected with the preceding by one or other of the three laws , by resemblance , or contrast , or previous association . And there seems to be abundant evidence that in dreaming , the train of images goes on , one image suggesting another according to the same laws . But if the laws of simple suggestion are adequate to explain the suc* cession of images in dreams , they are adequate to explain the succession of images in your visions . You had not a power to produce those images in any other sense than you now have a power to produce the images or conceptions which enter into any ordinary train of ideas . All you then did voluntarily , was to shut your eyes , and remember , and tell to your reporter the images that appeared . The images themselves came or arose one after another , not because you willed any one of them ; for the very supposition of your producing them in such a sense involves the absurdity of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in perfect accordance with the laws of simple suggestion above specified . You will perhaps allow me to adduce some facts from my own experience in verification of these remarks . What visions I might be blessed with should I continue my efforts I can not tell ; but my experiments have convinced me that I could not very honestly magnify // the office of a seer , since they too plainly show that wonderful visions are after all not very wonderful . I will state two of these experiments . First , I looked upon the paper or the wall of my study directly before me , fixing my eyes upon the border , which presented a small circular figure about two inches in diameter , of a yellowish brown or tawny color , with shadings such as to give a shaggy appearance , and around this figure a stripe of greenish color perhaps an inch wide ; I looked , wishing to think of something it might resemble soon it suggested a lion 's head with a fillet of grass over it . I then closed my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but found it exceedingly difficult , or rather impossible to do it , because the conception of a lion 's head with the fillet was so vivid as to hold predominant sway . I then resolved , keeping my bodily eyes still closed , to notice what images might come in view of my mind 's eye , ( in other words , what conceptions might successively arise ; ) the lion 's head was soon converted into a large bullock with horns bent downward ; soon there appeared a small picture of a bullock led towards an altar accompanied by priests and sacrificial instruments ; next appeared an oblong room with some indistinct pictures in it , and a man using a hand-saw upon a box ; next was a vivid conception of a wagon with several large folios packed in the body and a countryman taking out one of the volumes in a street with buildings on each side , and persons passing both ways ; next I seemed to be myself sitting at a table with a number of pictures before me in a low square room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transported me to another place , where I was at a table in a smaller room in company with two persons , a gentleman and lady , who each offered me something to eat : I then opened my eyes and suspended the experiment . Second : After tea I looked at a tall glass lamp with its lower part black , that stood before me , and then shutting my eyes resolved to endeavor to get a vivid conception of it and notice what conceptions might subsequently arise in my mind ; quite soon the object noticed was a black serpent about as tall as the lamp and occupying the same place on the mantle-piece , resting upon its tail with its head upwards and body twisting spirally ; it was immediately converted into a larger figure of two serpents twined around a rod or stick , like the wand of Mercury ; next there appeared a man writhing on a cross ; then came a crowded throng of men like a triumphal procession , bearing various utensils lifted above their heads . The door of the room was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had entered to remove the tea things . As she left the room I again closed my eyes , resolving to notice what conceptions would follow her image in my mind ; instantly I saw in conception a picture of a company of Indians , performing a dance with the most antic attitudes and gestures ; very soon , instead of this living scene , was a large placid lake with a very singular rock by its margin slightly resembling an urn ; soon it was a lake with a fleet sailing in the distance ; but instantly the ships were augmented in size and stood nearer to me and became half enveloped in smoke as if from the discharge of their broadsides in battle ; soon was presented a small body of troops moving along a river or shore of a lake towards a considerable village near by ; the next thing was a pretty vivid conception of the buildings of our own college ; and then I concluded that my excursion had come to its end and I opened my eyes . The succession of images in the cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and would to // any one else , very singular and unaccountable ; the train seems as incoherent as a dreaming train , and I presume you will not be able , except in a few instances , to imagine what connection there was between any image and its predecessor in the series . In these cases however , I was able on reviving the trains to trace the rise of each image out of the one going before it , so as to see that every part accorded with the laws of simple suggestion . *J7o give the explanation here would be useless ; indeed it could not be given without a tedious detail of items of my own personal history . But these trains of conception must have appeared to me very strange , if I had not been able to recall the circumstances of personal history to which I have alluded . A few such experiments as I have above suggested will show , that precisely the same remarks may he made of the series of conceptions going on in the waking state . You remark that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before my mind appeared to be internal motion among the particles . " But this seeming motion , in which the surfaces of the images " appeared granulated " and there was a rising of the particles and rolling around an axis , " &amp;c. , had nothing at all to do with producing one image out of another ; and it was itself merely the result of the pressure of the eye-lids upon the eye-balls . Just close your eyes at any time and you will at once notice an expansion or surface appearing granulated , with a rising and rolling of particles , before you will conceive definitely any object ; and if you form a tolerably vivid conception of any visible object , it will seem as if forming itself out of , or dissolving itself into the particles thus in motion . This motion is doubtless modified by the peculiar condition of the organ of sight , as being more or less weak and irritable , and also modified by the peculiar circumstances at the moment , as to the state of the light and perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not a phenomenon at all peculiar to your visions , and the only reason that it was not noticed by you at one time as well as another was I doubt not , the mere fact that your attention was sometimes wholly turned to other impressions . I would repeat it then , that just so far as the laws of suggestion will explain the succession of images in dreaming , they will also explain the succession of images in your visions . And the seeming strangeness and incoherence of the combinations , both in usual dreams and in your visions , are but the natural result of these laws operating without being checked or modified by the influence of the will . But an interesting question still remains : viz , what caused the peculiar vividness of the images ? The vividness was so great , that while you knew them to be not present realities , but the mere fabrications of your own mind , they had nevertheless the seeming reality of objects actually seen . This leads me to specify the second thing which I intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate to produce a dreaming train of images would be adequate to produce your visions . It is the following : II . Any physical condition or influence , whether affecting the brain , the nerves , the stomach , the intestines , or other parts of the bodily system , which could occasion the vividness of the images of dreams , might occasion the vividness of the phantasms described by you . This is evident , because in the phantasms , considered in themselves as distinguished from your judgment , recognizing them at the time as phantasms , there was nothing which appears different in nature from the images of common dreams ; they were all // representations of visible objects , and they do not seem to have been in any instance more vivid than those of dreams . Indeed , your narrative indicates that they were usually less vivid ; and that their vividness was increased in proportion as the vigilance of the judgment was remitted , since on a particular instance you have the following remark : - " slightly drowsy , which gives much greater distinctness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more general remark ,  --  " in a few instances after closing the eyes for some time I began to feel slightly drowsy , and this I think rendered the visions more distinct . " And you further say , " the most perfect examples of the visions that floated before me , I can hardly doubt , should be referred to genuine dreams . " It is therefore , reasonable to consider the waking visions and their peculiar vividness as resulting from the same physical causes that gave rise to the dreams you had while asleep ; i. e. so far as either the dreams or the visions were the result of mere physical causes . If psycho-physiology is yet sufficiently advanced to authorize any exact specification of the immediate causes , it is more than I know , and what I do not believe . All that can yet be scientifically affirmed is included in such bare statements as the folluwino ' ; " in sickness , especially in fevers , peculiar dreams are produced . " To say that " febrile excitement " is the cause of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define , nor in the least degree indicate the precise bodily states which cause the mental states ; and to talk of a " febrile gas , " ether , or fluid , is no better ; especially as there is yet no proof of the existence of any such element . The phrenological and phrenomesmeric theories do not solve the question , even allowing their assumed principles to have been satisfactorily confirmed by observed facts . Your phreno-mesmeric experiment , should it be known to some " facthunters , " would probably be to them a valuable testimony . the experiment was as perfectly fair and accurate as any such experiment can well be , although you seem to doubt whether you rubbed exactly where you ought to . On the supposition that there is a portion , line , or point of the human skull , that covers an " organ of benevolence , " you unquestionably rubbed in " the region where it lies , " if you really rubbed any portion of your head instead of your belly or back ; and if you rubbed merely with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limits that might be reached by moving the finger at its second joint , some of the rubbing must have been upon " the precise spot , ' * since it is impossible for one at all acquainted with the phrenological delineation to get two full inches out of the way even on the greatest amplitude of skull ever subjected to human paimetration . Besides , as the manner in which mere rubbing of the skull affects the brain within , is through vibrations first produced in the bone itself and then imparted to the organ , and as the slightest vibrations produced in any pait of a hard substance are immediately conveyed through its whole extent , there can be little doubt that even if you rubbed the pericranium at a point the most distant from the organ , you did nevertheless induce an action of the organ itself as truly as if the digital operation had been performed on the very apex of the " mound of good-will ; " or should it be considered probable that the sutures in the skull might interrupt the vibrations , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you certainly sought the region near the sagittal suture , and it could make no difference which side received the friction , since " the organs are all double ; " a structure exceedingly // convenient , and in exact analogy with every thing in our bodily system , in forming which nature has shown herself so exceedingly fond of bestowing pairs , that in the few instances where she has seemed to make a member single , it may hereafter he discovered that she has truly given a pair of halves . Whether the fact , that in your visions " the changes became more rapid " when the head was accidentally rubbed , tends to confirm the phreno-mesmeric theory or not , the most stubborn opposers must acknowledge , that all experience proves that any sudden impulse on the skull , such e. g. as when one strikes his head against a beam , or receives a blow from a cane or ferule , if the shock be not too great , serves considerably to quicken the ideas , and often produces very vivid images . Nor ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ascertained by adequate experiments whether any such effects result from the sudden contact of other parts of the body with external objects coming upon them with a suitable momentum . Possibly something of the nature of evidence might be gathered from the experience of those boys and girls in the country who are obliged to go barefoot in summer ; something too from the domestic history of those , whose parents have partially regarded the precept of Solomon in family government . Your experiment is not to be cast out for any want of skill in the performance . Nevertheless , there is a small difficulty in the way of any inference from it in favor of phrenomesmerism ; for , although instantly upon the rubbing , a seeming work of benevolence did commence ( certainly it looks very much like a work of benevolence to change " a piece of sole leather " first into " an acre or two " of Indian corn , and then into " loaves of well baked bread , " and afterwards carry " this large supply of the staff of life " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon interrupted , and there is unfortunately , therefore , room for questioning what would have been finally done with the collected provisions ; so that a dark-hearted cynic may insinuate , that the next image in the vision might have been such as to prove the whole movement to be one of supreme selfishness . And there is another difficulty , which to some may appear nearly as great ; it is , that while benevolence is a disposition or desire to do good to others , in your experiment no new affection , wish or desire was aroused by the rubbing ; before the rubbing you had a desire to see what would follow the exciting of that organ ; - you rubbed in order to excite it ; you then " waited to see what the organ would do , " and you saw certain images ; your narrative does not indicate that any new desire or wish whatever arose after the rubbing or during it ; the only desire you had was the one that previously existed , viz , to see what would take place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that in this supposed excitement of the organ of benevolence , while there was no manifestation of that desire which constitutes the mental exercise of benevolence , there actually did exist other states or exercises , images or conceptions , which on the phrenological system could result only from the excitation of the organ s of color , of size , and of comparison . But to speak more seriously , aside from such difficulties , and all the difficulties which some imagine to lie thick and tangled over the whole system , it furnishes nothing better than other systems to explain the peculiar vividness of the images in your visions , or the still greater vividness of the images of a dream . That the peculiar vividness of your conceptions in the sickness , so much greater than that of the ordi // nary conceptions of daily life , was occasioned in some way by the action of certain parts of your bodily organization , I have no doubt , and it is possible , that in a case of such visions occurring again , the vividness might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according as different stimulants or sedatives were applied to the system ; thus you state that " bathing the forehead in sulphuric ether , always rendered the visions more distinct ; " yet I should not expect from the experiments any important aid or new light in ascertaining precisely what organic or nervous action of the body held immediate connection with the vividness of the mental conceptions . The intrinsic obstacle in the way of settling such questions I have particularly mentioned in my former letter .  --  but since the tenor of your narrative makes it certain that the images in your visions were less vivid , or at least never more vivid , than those of dreams , I feel no hesitation in saying that what . ever is adequate to produce the vividness of images in a common dream , the same was adequate to produce the vividness of the images in your visions ; and therefore , in accounting for that vividness , it is after all unnecessary to suppose any physical influences differing either in nature or degree from such as operate on the mind when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose any at all differing from those connected with the more perfect dreams which you had in your sickness . Notwithstanding the length to which my remarks have been protracted , I will venture further on your patience , since you have asked me to philosophize , and will suggest that the peculiar vividness of the images forming your visions may be ascribed to a general fact in mental science , considered irrespective altogether of any physical influences ; I mean the fact , that the mere mental conception of an object is always accompanied with a momentary belief of the present reality of that object . The fact , that conceptions awakened in harmony with some actual perception , are believed to be perceptions of real objects , I have already dwelt upon . That fact is somewhat different from the one now stated , although that is but a resulting consequence of this . III . What I now offer ( and what may help to explain the vividness of the images in your visions ) is , that mere conceptions , conceptions of and by themselves , tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceived . I do not mean that in every case they actually do awaken this belief in so distinct and enduring a manner as to be remembered ; for in a majority of cases , indeed in almost all cases , the belief is so tran* sient as to escape entirely from recollection , and the person is ready to affirm that no such belief had existed ; but I mean , that the belief is the natural accompaniment of the conception ,  --  that in all cases the mere conception tends to produce the belief , and that in all cases , were not the belief instantly dissipated and destroyed by rapid counteracting judgments , it would be distinct and enduring , and be clearly remembered by the mind , as a part of its consciousness . If there be such a tendency in the mere exercise of conception , it is obvious that the question which really demands answering is not , Why are mere conceptions in some cases so vivid , that the objects conceived possess a seeming reality , and appear as if they were actually existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always thus vivid ? That such is the tendency , appears to me to be sufficiently evinced by this one consideration , that in all cases where the mind is hindered from detecting , by some exercise of the judgment , the unreality of the objects conceived , it does // take its own mere conceptions for actual realities . In the dreaming state , whatever attention the mind exercises is given to the conceptions themselves . The same is in great measure the case in the form of insanity above mentioned ; the patient 's mind is engrossed by its own imaginings ; whatever perceptions or other notions may arise , they receive no attention , but vanish instantly without any comparison of them with the imaginings or mere conceptions , and of course without any of those relative suggestions or judgments , which would disclose to the mind the real nature of these conceptions , and would show them to be its own fabrications and nothing else . A full belief in the reality of the things imagined must ensue ; and sometimes the deluded monomaniac or lunatic thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of material things and living beings , all the queer , odd , fantastic , beautiful , ugly or horrid combinations of his own prolific fancy . You will at once see the application of the principle here suggested , in its relation to your visions with the eyes shut . The mere conceptions , arising one after another by the laws of simple suggestion as before explained , were accompanied with that belief which , as I have just maintained , conception always tends to produce ; all volition , except to attend to these conceptions , was suspended , as you yourself testify those j ud gino nts , which usually check that belief so instantly as to hinder our noticing it , and thereby to hinder the seeming reality which our mere conceptions would otherwise possess , were not awakened so soon as usual , if at all ; in fact , there is not the slightest evidence in your narrative , that during the time of any vision there recorded , you had a single one of those judgments , or paid the least attention to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually describing at the time to another person what you seemed to see , so far from having any tendency to awaken such judgments , had precisely the opposite tendency strongly to hinder . them , and to increase that secret belief , which was imparting to the mere freaks of your own excited fancy the forms , colors , and motions of material objects and living creatures . The explanation here suggested is confirmed by the fact , that on opening your eyes the pictures vanished . Similar conceptions , it is probable , were continually arising in your mind , even while your eyes were open , at least during that part of your sickness in which you had the Visions ; hut the eyes being open , these conceptions were constantly intermingled with perceptions that instantly awakened those counteracting and corrective judgments which I have described ; the conceptions therefore secured no attention , had no peculiar vividness , and of course passed away just as the ordinary conceptions of common life ; you yourself being aware of nothing remarkable in your consciousness , except perhaps an unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you speak of the great clearness of your mind at the time . The above hinted explanation of the peculiar xividncss of your conceptions is further confirmed by the fact , that the vision ceased at once if your attention was in any way interrupted . For the attention would be likely to be interrupted only by present perceptions or by remembrances of former perceptions not harmonizing with the conceptions ; but the very existence of a remembranee would necessarily involve one of the judgments I have described . Thus it would appear , that the third class of the remarkable phenomena of your consciousness in your late sickness are explicable on established principles of mental science , being the very results to be // expected when the mind is active only or chiefly in attending to its own imaginings ; as then , by well known laws , conception after conception will arise and bring along with it that belief which constantly imparts to the conception the apparent nature of perception , while there are not those acts of judgment which are requisite to hold that belief in check . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange any one or each of them may have been , presents nothing but what accords perfectly with the primary and secondary laws of simple suggestion ; and their great vividness was but the natural result of there being at the time no check , or so little check , upon that tendency which mere conception always has to produce belief in the present reality of the object conceived . JV . But if you will have patience to bear with mc a little longer ; I will offer a conjecture respecting the mutual relations of the mind and the material organization with which it is now connected . It may be , that whenever the mind conceives any sensible object , there is a tendency in the appropriate sensorial organs or nerves to assume the same state as when the mind perceives that object . Suppose this to be the fact , and it is obvious , that just in proportion to the readiness and completeness with which the organ or nerves may assume the requisite state , the mere conception will seem to have the reality of an actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we may easily see that in one condition of the nervous system , the nerves of a particular organ ( the eye for instance ) might much more readily and completely than at other times be , on the excitement of a mental conception , put into the correspondent state . Thus in your own case , on the supposition now made , the various conceptions , being awakened successively according to the well known laws which I have above noticed , would be rendered vivid as they were , so as to seem objects actually pictured before you , because your optic nerves , being rendered peculiarly susceptible of changes by some unknown influence of your disease , did , on the rise of each conception in your mind , instantly and more or less fully assume the very state into which they would be put by the actual presentation of the object conceived . On the supposition here made , that the mere mental conception of an object tends to put the nerves into the same state as exists when that object is actually present and is causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied with some momentary belief of the present reality of the thing conceived , which I have already stated and illustrated as being a principle in mental philosophy . The supposition may also explain in general the vividness of our ideas in dreams . Taken in connection with one of the laws of habit , it also explains at once the well known fact , that most persons can conceive visible objects much more easily and vividly than they can conceive smells , tastes , or sounds ; it is a law of habit , that repetition of any action , bodily or mental , increases the facility of such action ; the action of no one of the organs of sense is so frequently repeated as that of the optic nerves ; hence results a greater readiness of those nerves than of others to assume the state , or perform the action , requisite for perception ; and hence , if mere conception has a tendency to excite the nerves , as above supposed , mere conception would excite the optic nerve more readily than those of the other senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , that illusions by the eye are much more frequent than by the other senses . The first intimation of a view like the one I have above suggested , that // I now remember having noticed in any author , is given by Mr. Scott , formerly professor of moral philosophy in King 's College at Aberdeen , in his " Elements of Intellectual Philosophy , " p. 51 , where he says , " when sensation is excited in the mind , it is generally in consequence of some impression first made upon the corporeal senses . But , in some instances , the cause originates in the mind , and is thence communicated to the bodily organs , while apparently an effect is produced precisely similar to that of the more usual kind of sensation . It is well known that the mere thought of pain in any particular part of the body is sufficient to excite the corresponding sensation to a certain degree ; thus the idea of sore eyes produces a certnin degree of pain in those organs , and the strong imagination of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensation of that taste or flavor . " Something similar is hinted in a passage of Dugald Stewart 's " Outlines of Moral Philosophy , " where , speaking of conception , he says , " this faculty has obviously a very intimate connection with the body . The conception of a pungent taste produces a rush of saliva into the mouth . rrhe conception of an instrument of torture applied to any member of the body produces a shock similar to what would be occasioned by its actual application . " Something more distinct is expressed by Prof. Upham , in his " Outlines of imperfect and disordered mental action . " lIe remarks , p. 81 , " it is probable , ( and in some instances is undoubtedly the fact , ) that a very excited and unnatural state of the mind may , unaided by the presence of an outward body , produce in some part of the sensorial organ the precise state or affection which the presence of such a body would produce . And the natural consequence of this state of things will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false sensations and perceptions . " But I have noticed no passage in either of the writers , which advances the precise view I have suggested , viz , that whenever the mind conceives any sensible object , there is a tendency in the appropriate sensorial organ to assume the same state or condition as when the mind perceives that object by means of sensation caused by its actual presence . But waving wholly this conjecture as to what may be uniformly or commonly the fact , it can not be doubted , that in particular cases of disease , the nerves of the several organs , or of some of them , are ( as Mr. Upham states in another place ) rendered so sensitive and active , that mere mental conceptions produce in them the very impressions which commonly result from the actual presence of the objects conceived . This is the fact , doubtless , in very many cases of false perception ; although in many other cases the nerves are probably thrown into this state , in part at least , by the disease itself , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delirium tremens , that horrid disease which is the drunkard 's sure reward , are probably produced chiefly in the former way ; the morbid irritation of the general system first exciting the mind to intense activity and force of conception ; and then the mere dreams of the xvretched sufferer 's imagination producing an action of the appropriate nerves precisely like that which ordinarily causes sensations , and thus inevitably awakening as perfect a conviction of their present reality as ever accompanies the clearest and fullest perception . If in this way mere mental conceptions may be rendered so vivid as to be permanently mistaken for real perceptions , it is easy to see that in the same way , mere conceptions arising by the common principles of suggestion might possess that somewhat less degree of vividness , which // characterized the images constituting your visions ; a vividness truly very great ; so great as to give them a seeming reality , even while you retained a general knowledge ( except for brief periods of time too small to be remembered by the mind itself , ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitation in stating my belief , that your " hallucinations " were occasioned in this way ; the morbid irritations of your nervous system occasioned a peculiar activity of the mind ; successive conceptions were excited , not in any extraordinary manner , but in accordance with what are called the laws of simple suggestion , the primary and the secondary ; these mere conceptions were followed by a correspondent action of the optic nerve , which in its morbid sensitiveness assumed more or less exactly the condition ordinarily caused only by the actual presence of the objects conceived ; this action of the optic nerve produced more or less exactly the sensations ordinarily existing when such objects are seen ; and these sensations as a matter of course produced that instantaneous reference of them to outward causes which ordinarily accompanies sensation ; thus mere conceptions become as vivid nearly as actual perceptions ; or in other words , mere conceptions were converted into seeming perceptions ; or you seemed to see what in truth you only imagined . I have only to advert to the circumstance to which I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viz , that morbid irritations of the optic nerve might greatly modify the conceptions successively awakened , by forming the reason why one set or combination of mere conceptions should arise rather than another under the same primary laws . If disease or any phy sical influence whatever produce irritations in the optic nerve , and these irritations cause a few very slight sensations similar to the sensations once produced by the actual sight of an object , it would be entirely according to the established principles of suggestion , that these few slight sensations should awaken a conception of the object itself , whether a human face , or any thing ' else . V. Finally , let me remark , that if we suppose the conceptions constituting your visions were originated thus from slight sensation , we shall have a reason for their being vivid , without adopting the conjecture that conception operates refiexly upon the nerves and so tends to convert itself into false perception , and also without admitting the principle that mere conception tends to awaken a belief of the reality of what is conceived ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in harmony with perception ; the perception being indeed but false perception , yet having the essential nature of perception as a mental act , viz , a reference of actual sensations to some outward cause ; so that the belief , which , as all know , invariably accompanies the perception , would be extended over all the associated conceptions . But if we suppose the conceptions to have been first suggested by certain actual sensations , and also admit the principle respecting the tendency of conception to awaken belief , and especially if we admit the conjecture respecting the tendency of conception to act reflexly upon the nerves , we shall find ample reasons for the vividness of your visions ; as then we may consider them as resulting partly from false perception and partly from disordered conception . Very sincerely , your friend and servant@@184069446.txt Jr is a circumstance which we think augurs well for the cause of Greek learning in our country , that many of its most distinguished scholars are expending their labors on the works of Homer . It was hut recently we saw announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editions of the old hard from Prof. Elton , Prof. Crosby , and the Rev. J. J. Owen , all of whom have become favorably known to the public by their labors in the department of classical Iearning. * Here again , besides a complete Lexicon of the Homeric Poems , translated from Crusius by Prof. Smith , we have another edition of the Iliad , or rather of a part of it , from that indefatigable scholar , Prof* Anthon-marked by the same general features which have so strongly characterized his other works in the same department-accuracy and ripeness of scholarship , united with a copiousness of explanation and illustration , which leaves the student nothing to desire , and we had almost said , in the way of original investigations , nothing to do . Our object in the present article , is not to discuss the question respecting the best mode of preparing text-books for the use of students in the earlier stages of their classical course . We may however he permitted to suggest the inquiry , whether the utility of Prof. Anthon 's criticisms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek and English Lexicon of the Poems of Homer and the Homerid* , from the German of G. Cli . Cmsins : translated hy Henry Smith , Professor of Langoages in Marietta College . Hartford , LI . Huntington .

Would not the student earlier become an independent scholar , and be prepared sooner , sine cortice , to launch out fearless and alone into the broad current of classical learning , if , in his incipient efforts , he were not so entirely sustained by supports derived from the Professor 's hand ? Be this as it may , in common with all who are interested in the progress of sound learning , we feel under obligations for this new contribution to our means of study , in a department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors . Among the Greeks , the author of the Homeric poems was known as 6 7TOt7jT1** the poet , while other nations have united in designating him as the father of song  --  a distinction awarded to him , not more because of the early period at which he lived , than on account of the intrinsic merit of his productions . In every age since they were collected , they have been studied not only as monuments of genius venerable for their antiquity , but admired as rich and exhaustless repositories of whatever is noble in sentiment and beautiful in diction . To the Greek philologist they are invaluable , because they present the stmple and early forms of his favorite language . To the lover of classic lore , they are commended as the original fountains from which have sprung many of the streams of Grecian and Roman literature . The poet recognizes in them some of the most perfect models of the poetic art , while all who are able to discern and appreciate their excellences , unite in giving them the highest place in that department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not without reason , that // 217 these poems occupy so prominent a place in our courses of academic and collegiate education ; and the fact , though remarkable , is yet one in which we think all have occasion to rejoice , that the ablest scholars of our own times are finding for themselves a profitable employment in preparing new editions of an author , whose age transcends the limits of recorded history , and whose very place on the records of the world can not with certainty be assigned . Had the several books of the Iliad and Odyssey , as they have descended to modern times , a common author ? What are their leading characteristics as poems ? And what has been Their influence on Grecian literature ? - are questions interesting to every classical student , and yet in general , questions foreign from the plan and aims of those who prepare editions of Homer for common use in schools and colleges . Without aiming at a full discussion of these questions , it is our purpose briefly to notice each of them in the present article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeenth century , that the first of these questions was seriously raised . A theory appears then lo have been suggested in France , which has since been developed and defended with great learning in Germany , wholly at variance with what had previously been the universally received opinion of the learned on this subject . The history of this theory we shall quote from Prof. Fisk 's translation of Eschenburg 's Manual , where is found a concise view of the leading points in dispute , as well as the names of those scholars who have most distinguished themselves in the controversy . " The first doubts , whether Homer was the sole author of the Iliad and Odyssey , seem to have been expressed by Perrault in his Parallele des Anciens et des Moderns , ( Paris , 1688 , ) in which it is sug. gested that they are but a collection of many little poems of different authors . This suggestion was enforced by F. Hedelin , who went so far as to deny the personal existence of Homer , ( 1715 . ) Dr. Bentley expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct songs and rhapso. dies composed by Homer , but not united in an epic form until five hundred years afterwards . The same idea was more fully developed by an Italian author , G. B. Vico , ( Naples , 1744 . ) A bolder position was taken by Robert Wood in his essay upon the original genius of Homer , published in London , ( 1770 , ) viz , that Homer could not have committed his poems to writing . In 1795 , Wolf published his Prolegomena ad Homerum , in which he maintained that the Iliad and Odyssey are not the production of Homer or of any other single author , but a collection of rhapsodies composed at different times and by different persons , and subsequently and gradually wrought up into the form in which they now exist . At the close of the year , ( 1795 , ) Heyne , who then had the reputation of the first Ilellenist in Germany , while Wolf was acquiring that of a rival to him , published a review of Wolf 's Prolegomena . Jn this review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught the same general doctrine respecting the Homeric poems . This was resented by Wolf , and occasioned a controversy between these champions* not as has often been supposed concerning the genuineness of these poems , but concerning the merit of priority in starting the new theory of their gradual formation . This contest for the honors of originating the doctrine had great influence in deciding general opinion in favor of it in Germany . In 1802 , Heyne fully avowed and supported the theory in the *xcursuses in his edition of the Iliad . The theory was // 218 The Homeric Poems . attacked in France by St. Croix . In England also a powerful opposer of it has appeared in Granvelle Pen . ( 1821 . ) Sch6ll gives a glance at the history of this question , and plainly intimates that he does not embrace the Wolfian doctrines . Posterity , ' says he , will judge of their solidity , ' and we will only add that while in Germany the views of Wolf are generally received , they are almost as generally rejected in England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were firmly resisted by Ruhnken , one of the greatest critics of the last century , and by the celebrated Villoisort . " From this statement it will be seen , that the question under consideration is not to be settled by an appeal to mere authority ; because the highest authorities have been divided . It may indeed appear to savor of presumption , to argue against the opinions of Heyne and Wolf . And yet we should regard their opinions as of more weight , if they had not been propounded at a time when skepticism was the prevailing tendency of the German mind ; and when it was the fashion of the most distinguished German scholars to rest their claims to distinction , not so much upon the profound learning which they possessed , as the startling and paradoxical theories which they should themselves be able to defend . It should not indeed excite our surprise , that Heyne and Wolf were inclined to question the authenticity of the Homeric poems , while men of equal distinction were denying that of almost every book of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all established opinions . Nor , in estimating the opinions of such men , should the fact escape our notice as one of which the records of literature afford many illustrations , that the habits of mind induced by long-continued and exclusive attention to mere verbal criticism , do not always prove most favorable to soundness and comprehensiveness of general views . The acute and learned Bentley , it is known , proposed to find interpolated passages in Paradise Lost , and under the absurd assumption , that Milton had been imposed upon in his blindness by his amanuensis , actually made some hundreds of emendations in the application of his own canons of criticism . Barnes too , the learned commentator upon the works of Homer , ascribed to them a Jewish origin , and gravely taught that they were the productions of King Solomon . It surely can be no demand of reason that we should respect such opinions , because Bentley and Barnes were the highest authority of their times in matters pertaining to verbal criticism . We can conceive that even Heyne and Wolf , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may have been poorly prepared to judge of his productions when contemplated as complete works ; and this for the same reason that an artist often shows himself capable of executing with exquisite taste , the minute ornaments which adorn the various parts of some magnificent temple , who is yet utterly incapable of appreciating the relation of those parts to each other and to the entire structure . Respecting the origin of the Iliad and Odyssey , no doubts appear to have been entertained among the ancients themselves  --  or none which prevented their general ascription to the same author . Thus Longinus , who may be regarded as speaking the prevailing opinion of the ancients , supposes the Iliad to have been the production of Homer 's earlier years , while the Odyssey was that of his old age , and accordingly , he beautifully compares the one to the mid-day  --  the other to the setting sun , and remarks that in the Odyssey , though in some degree divested of its heat , the genius of Homer // 219 appears to have lost none of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his second epistle , after speaking of the author of the Iliad , alludes to the other poem . " Rursus , quid virtus , et quid sapientia possit Utile proposuit nobis exemplar Ulixen , " etc . In opposition to authorities like these , we deem it of little avail to assert that " while the similes and topographical allusions of the Iliad mostly relate to Asia Minor , those of the Odyssey are characteristic of the Peloponnesus , that the differences of language in the two poems are not inconsiderable , and that they appear more like a regular development of some of its forms than the admission of provincial idioms-that the manners and customs and arts , show the same gradual progressiveness , and not the mere casual usages of various tribes in a more backward or mature state of advancement , and that the differences in the mythology of the two poems are still greater . " On the ground of even such objections , admitting them to be well founded , we do not feel prepared to set aside the opinion , respecting the authorship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great mass of modern scholars have been accustomed to acquiesce . If , as affirmed by Longinus , the two poems were composed at widely different periods of life , it can not be difficult to account for the differences which have been alluded to . During the wanderings of a long life , it would seem natural , that from the Jonian cities and isli*nds upon the coast of Asia Minor , the bard should extend his journeyings into various parts of Greece . If so , the differences in question , so far from being inexplicable , are what we should expect , as the result of his more extended observation , and his greater intercourse with men . It is not to be supposed , that in all parts of Greece , there existed but one version of the many fables of her romantic mythology ; nor that in all places among that most versatile people , there was to be found a stereotyped language , or manners of one unvarying mould . the very opposite of all this is known to have been true ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obviously that of the author of these poems , should furnish evidence of this fact , accords with what reason and common sense would lead us to expect . Had the darkness of antiquity cast its shadows upon the history of the great epic poet of our own language , as it has upon that of Homer , we doubt not questions , as to identity of authorship , might have arisen respecting Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained . Still more do we believe , that under similar circumstances , such questions might have arisen , respecting the origin of Childe Harold and Don Juan . With the progress of life and experience , the minds of poets , as of other men , are subject to change , and it is but natural that we should meet traces of this , in the habits of thinking , and in the modes of expression , presented in their successive productions . But the same theory which denies the Iliad and Odyssey to have had a common origin , requires us also to regard the different parts of the Iliad itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirm , that " whether any such person as Homer ever lived or not , the Iliad wars not composed entirely by him , or by any other single individual ; but is a compilation , methodized indeed , and arranged by successive editions , but still a compilation of minstrelsies , all having one common theme and direction . " To this we might again reply , by referring to the authority of the ancients themselves . To the acutest minds among the Greeks  --  to say nothing of the Romans  --  the supposition seems never to have occurred , that in the Iliad they possessed the // 220 The Homeric Poems . verses , not of one , but of many bards ; and that theirs , consequently , was the glory , not of one , but of many Homers . We deem it , however , worthy of more special notice , that the leading argument by which the theory in question has been supported , is an assumption of what we can not but regard as in the highest degree improbable-viz , that alphabetic writing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Iliad and Odyssey , should have been produced by one person without the aid of writing , is justly deemed improbable , and in order to obviate this difficulty , resort has been had to another , which must be regarded as much the greater of the two  --  the supposition that independent and unconnected minds should have produced , on the same general subjects , fragmentary verses capable of being so united , as to form the two poems in question . But why the assumption that in the 1-lomeric age , alphabetic writing was unknown in Greece ? Five hundred years or more previous to this age , letters are supposed to have been introduced by Cadmus . It was singular indeed , if during this long period they continued in use , without any such advancement in the progress of written language , and in the invention of writing materials , as to afford adequate facilities for the composition of extended works . That compared with the times of Pindar and *Eschylus , or even of Herodotus , the I*ather of Grecian history , the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be doubted . But that it preceded those improvements , which usually accompany alphabetic writing , is not only in itself improbable , but contrary to evidence furnished in the works of which we are speaking . What supposition indeed can appear more improbable , than the one , that works which the most cultivated times have regarded as models of excellenceworks characterized by such beauty and smoothness of versification , such variety of mythological and historical detail , and such exhaustless stores of poetic imagery , should have originated in times of ignorance and barbarism , and without those aids to composition which the art of writing only can afford . A supposition like this is contradicted by all analogy . It represents the Grecian poetic mind in its first movements , as bursting forth , with the strength , and beauty , and completeness of mature existence . It makes the infancy of Greece , what experience and history have shown to be the manhood of every other people . But it should also be observed , that the German theory is based upon an inadequate estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of style and language , which the iliad every where displays-its prevailing modes of expression-its perpetually recurring epithets , descriptive of character , office and appearance ; as well as its general unity of design . These all mark it as the production of one mind-fixing upon it an impress of uniformity , utterly at variance with the theory in question . For illus* tration , we may refer to a well known case , in another department of Grecian literature . The three great tragic poets of Greece , while nearly cotemporary , also at times selected the same subjects for their dramas-as for example the story of Electra . And yet , how perfectly at all times does each poet preserve his own individuality of thought and style ! No one surely , who had so much as crossed the threshold of Grecian literature , could ever mistake the characteristics of one for those of the others . We may hence form some idea of the visionary character of the theory in question . It supposes not three bards merely , but many , to have composed songs upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pertains to their // style , that when united they seem like the production of one person . While it represents them as having introduced the same personages , it supposes them further , to have formed the same conception of their characters , and to have preserved it , not only in the parts which they are made to act , but in the descriptive epithets which are employed . All conceived of Jupiter as " the cloudgatherer , " of Juno as " the whitearmed , " of Aurora as " the rosy-fingered , " and of Hellen as " the dietnest of women , " etc . Did our limits permit , we should be glad to exhibit the evidence derived from this source , by a reference to particular passages . To those who are inclined to pursue it , we recommend the study of Homer 's epithets , and also , a comparison of such passages as the following . 1 Book 465 with 24 B. 623 ; 2 B. 110 with 9 B. 17 ; 2 B. 26 with 24 B. 132 ; 2 B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 B. 769 ; 1 B. 362 with 18 B. 73 ; 1 B. 84 with 18 B. 187 ; 9 B. 122 with 9 B. 264 ; 4 B. 20 with 8 B. 457 ; LB.590 , xvit* 15 B.22 ; 1 B. 468 with 23 B. 56 ; etc . But the considerations now presented , will gain additional force , if we contemplate also the unity of design manifest in the Iliad . The conclusiveness of this ground of argument has been questioned by some modern scholars , and altogether denied by the advocates of the theory in question . It is however worthy of notice , that Aristotle , after defining with logical precision what is to be understood by unity of design , has referred to the Iliad and Odyssey , as illustrations of his doctrine . Whose authority is most entitled to respect in this matter , we may see from a brief examination . In the opening of the Iliad , the wrath of Achilles and the consequent evils to the Grecian host , is given as the poet 's theme  --  and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found to be the center , toward which every thing tends , and around which both its incidents of battles , truces , and embassies ; and its machinery of gods , heroes , and warriors , are made to revolve . The cause of this anger is also given , viz. the wrong done to Achilles , by Agamemnon , the commander of the host , in violently taking from him the female captive Briseis . In consequence of this wrong , he withdraws with his friend Patroclus to his tent , determined to absent himself froth the war , until satisfaction had been made for the injury . By the intervention of Thetis , a prom . ise is obtained from Jupiter , that he will aid the Trojans in the conflict , and send disaster upon the Greeks . These incidents are detailed in the opening of the poem . In the second book Jupiter is represented , in accordance with his promise to Thetis , as deceiving Agamemnon with a dream-beguiling him with the expectation of at once terminating the war . A council is hence called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the book t*rminates with an enumeration of the forces on both sides . The details of the war which ensued , are extended through the 8th hook . In accordance with the promise of Jupiter to Thetis , the war is represented as , on the whole , tending to the discomfiture of the Greeks , and the triuml ) h of the Trojans . Agamemnon is thus at length convinced of his folly in having wronged Achilles , and by the advice of Nester is represented in the 9th book as sending an embassy of chiefs to the hero-offering , on condition of his return to the army , the most ample compensation , besides a restoration of his favorite captive . His offers are rejected , and the war is renewed . As before , the Trojans are victorious , until at length , as represented in the 12th book , the ramparts of the Grecian camp are assailed , and the gates forced by Hector . From // this point the plot is made to thicken and steadily to increase in interest , by the part which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the 13th and 14th books , the Greeks are made successful by the aid of Neptune . In the 15th , the scale is again turned in favor of the Trojans , by the help of Apollo . The Greeks are driven to their camp , and their ships are on the point of being consumed . In this extremity Patroclus , the friend of Achilles , is induced to mingle in theebattle , but falls by the hand of Hector . Achilles is thus brought , by the death of his friend , to the point toward which the whole action of the poem has been tending . He lays aside his wrath , and again shows himself in the Grecian ranks . rphe relation of these incidents , bring the action of the Iliad through the 18th book . In the 19th , he becomes in a formal and public manner reconciled to Agamemnon , and with other gifts receives back the maid Briseis  --  the original cause of their strife . Achilles having thus again joined the host , and Jupiter having fulfilled his promise to rhetis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to their partialities on different sides . The conflict is renewed . Achilles is made triumphant . Hector is slain , and with his funeral rites the poem is concluded in the 24th book . Such are the plan and leading incidents of the Iliad . If they do not exhibit unity of design , we know of no poem in which this quality can be found . Is it then conceivable , that a work thus one in its sub . ject as well as in its language and style , should have been the production of several different and uncon. nected bards ? Is it to be supposed that fragmentary poems , by differ . ent authors , upon the same general subject , could be so modified and shaped as when united to present a model of unity in design and action like that here presented ? And even if this be deemed not incredible , what is to be thought of a phenomenon so remarkable , as that which it implies ? With all the advantages which Grecian culture and Grecian arts could lend , Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , produced but one poet , who holds among Roman bards , the place which the suifrages of all ages and all nations have assigned to Homer among the Greeks . The Italians , besides their Dante , have their Tasso . The English can boast of but one Milton . The Poi-tuguese of but one Camoens . But it was the singular felicity of the early Greeksif we are to believe the advocates of this theory  --  to possess a constellation of poets of the Homeric grade . At a period when she possessed no written literature , and when she was without the means of even recording the events of her national history , and still less of preserving and rendering permanent her own improvements in letters , she is represented as having produced a race of poets , whom all subsequent bards in the same department have been content to foll*xv , but have never aspired to equal . In attempting to enumerate some of the leading- characteristics of the Homeric poems , we notice as first deserving attention , poetic beauty in sentiment , style , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pertainin to the various elements of the poetic art , which in no small degree has united the suifrages of mankind , in assigning to the Meonian bard that position which lie holds among the poets of all times and places . He is admitted to stand pre-eminent among those whose names grace the records of poetic fame , not because his works exhibit a mind exhaustless in its stores of poetic sentiment-nor because his is a command of imagery , rich and various as nature with her countless forms of existence could make it-nor yet because his language flows in numbers // the most sweet and harmonious , and yet the most lively and vigorous-but it is because in the rare combination of all these , he is seen beyond any other author to come near that ideal standard of beauty which existed in the minds of the Greeks , and which , with every cultivated people , constitutes the true criterion of poetic merit . The works of Homer are one continued illustration of what we have now said . Every where , in his own expressive description of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " From his tongue , sweeter than honey , the language flows . " But with the characteristics here noticed , there is also united a freshness and originality of conception , no where surpassed but in the poetry of the Hebrew scriptures . These qualities are doubtless in no small degree to be attributed to the early period in which the works of Homer were composed . They are the peculiarities of one whose mind was thrown upon its own resources , and made to follow its own direction . For as yet , Grecian literature had not so far advanced , as to possess any thing like a fixed character . Public sentiment had not even begun to verge toward the establishment of a standard of taste , or the adoption of universally received canons of criticism . Society had not reached that stage , in which individuality of character begins to be broken down ; and where its distinctive features are lost , by being merged in the general mass . It 5 consequently with the author of the Homeric poems , as with the chieftains whose exploits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line bespeaks a strongly marked and original genius . In drawing the characters of gods and heroes , and in detailing their exploits , he advances not only as if he had entered an unoccupied field of poetic thought and imagery , but as if conscious in his own strength , of ability to explore its utmost limits . It is hence , that when we have gone back to the works of the Homeric age , we seem to have ascended to the original heights of poetry . There is a freshness in their language , and conceptions and imagery , strongly savoring of the pure air and the sweet waters of Helicon itself . But these works are also peculiarly marked by another quality , which , like those just named , is strongly characteristic of the times in which they were composed , viz. great simplicity of thought and expression . The manners of men , as well as their habits of thought and modes of speaking , were then plain and unsophisticated . The arts of navigation and war had made comparatively but little progress . Contending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Troy , depended more for success upon physical strength and individual prowess , than upon those principles of military tactics which modern experience and science have served to develop . In point of mental cultivation and advancement , society had not reached that point at which it is accustomed to lose its relish for the marvelous , and when the public mind is prepared to correct the pictures of a luxuriant and glowing fancy , by the dictates of sober judgment and experience . It is hence that we find the Homeric poems so stron crly characterized by simplicity of thought and style . Nothing surely can be conceived of more simple , or more expressive of the natural workings of the human heart , than are the language and the illustration of character and of manners , which are presented in their almost endless and varied details . In order rightly to appreciate such works , it is plainly necessary that one should divest himself of whatever conventional associations and feelings are the mere product of modern habits and tastes . // But the variety of character and of incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of notice . It must have been not only a mind almost exhaustless in its stores of poetic thought and imagery , but of pre-eminent versatility , in its powers of arrangement and description , which produced the ever-varying scenes of these poems . For while they present that uniformity which is demanded by correct principles of unity in style and action , they are yet characterized by all the diversity which the most correct taste could require , in the nice accommodation of language and imagery to the numerous characters delineated and the various scenes described . In regard to the Iliad , this feature appears the more remarkable , because its subject , and the time embraced in its action , and the place to which its leading actors were confined , are such , it would seem , as to render great variety a quality difficult of attainment . A less skillful hand would have shown this difficulty , by the vagueness of general and unmeaning epithets , by the blending and confounding of characters , and perhaps too by confusion and needless repetition of scenes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that in his great epic he rarely betrays faults of this character . Notwithstanding the embarrassments which must have arisen from his subject and plan , every thing is made to stand out clear , distinct and prominent , like pictures upon the painter 's canvas , or images beneath the chisel of the sculptor . But the Homeric poems are also characterized by singular truth and fidelity in the delineation of human passions and feelings . To this feature Horace alludes , and intimates that Homer surpasses the philosophers themselves in that which properly belongs to their own department . No poet certainly has shown greater power in exemplifying the various feelings of the human heart . We know of none who abounds more in scenes of deep pathos ,  - -  scenes presenting not indeed strained and labored appeals to human sympathy ; but scenes full of those incidental and apparently undesigned strokes of deep feeling and tenderness , which at once find their way to the heart , and reach the place of uncontrolled emotion . Of this character is the often quoted passage , descriptive of the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we hardly know which to admire most , the conception by which such a scene of domestic love is contrasted with the strife and the carnage of the battlefield , or the masterly skill by which it is wrought up into a picture of such surpassing beauty and tenderness . We envy not the man his heart , who can read this description without feeling the deep fountains of emotion flow within him . The Iliad and Odyssey abound in passages exhibiting the same power over the human heart , and the same skill in unfolding its most secret workings . But these poems do not more abound in deep pathos than in high-wrought sublimity . In relation to this characteristic , it is interesting to know the opinion of so acute and refined a critic as Longinus . " The distance from earth to heaven , " says he , " bounds the sublimity of Homer , in his description of Discord . " O*sc*v4i * x4* , xcd mi *tovi f3cL ( vu . And this , it would seem , from the frequency with which , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Iliad , was his common standard in estimating the l ) oet 's genius . With what propriety this standard was applied , we might show , did our limits permit , by a multitude of examples . In conclusion of this part of our subject , we can not resist the temptation to adduce a single one , which we select from the battle of the gods , as translated by Elton . // But when th ' Olympian habitants came down Into the throng of men , strife fierce uprose , Stirring the people 's hearts . Minerva stood Beside the deepend trench , without the wail , And shouted : and anon upon the sands Where dash 'd the roaring waves her shout was heard , Far distant , like a gloomy whirlwind . Mars Stood on Troy 's highest turret , and exclairn 'd , Cheering the Trojans on with cries of war ; Or running with swift feet cours 'd Simois banks , And steep Callicolone . So the blest Of heaven mix 'd indiscriminate the hosts , Spurring their rage , and havoc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and men Thunder 'd from heaven on high . The ocean God Heavd from beneath th ' immensity of earth , And shook the mountain tops . The roots of Ide And all its fountain-gushing summits reeld Tiny city and the navy of the Greeks llock 'd as in earthquake . Deep beneath the ground The Monarch of the dead in darkest hell Felt fear and leap 'd aifrighted from his throne , And shriek 'd aloud , lest he that strikes the shores Should cleave earth 's vault asunder , and the scene Of those drear mansions glare upon the sight Of Gods and men : a dismal wilderness , Hoary with desolation , which the blest Behold , and shuddering turn their eyes away . Such clang arose while Gods eucounterin* strove . There is another topic connected with this subject , at which we can here only glance , but to which much consideration is due , from those who would form a just estimate of the Homeric poems . We refer to the relation which they hold to the various departments of Grecian literature , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aside from those causes , which existed in the genius of the people , and in the peculiarities of the climate , country , &amp;c. nothing , it is believed , has exerted so much power , in fixing upon it that peculiar impress which it bears , as the works of Homer . We find indeed this influence distinctly ascribed to them by Aristotle , as it respects the two great departments of dramatic poetry . " As in the serious kind , ' * says the great philosopher and critic , " Homer alone may be said to deserve the name of poet , not only on account of his other excellences , but also the dramatic spirit of his imitations , so was he likewise the first who suggested the idea of comedy , by substituting ridicule for invective , and giving to that ridicule a dramatic cast . For his Margites bears the same analogy to comedy , as his Iliad and Odyssey to tragedy . " We stop not here to inquire , whether the drama be thus correctly ascribed to Homer in its origin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that not only in dramatic literature , but in all the departments of Grecian letlers , the influence of the great epic bard was very great . Compared with these departments , epic poetry was greatly prior in the time of its development . Jt was while as yet the Grecian mind was preparing for those achievements in poetry , in eloquence , in history , in philosophy , and the arts , which were afterwards made , that the poems of Homer were recited and admired throughout the Grecian states . That a people , so alive to beauty in every form , should have been charmed by their flowing numbers and glowing images , and that a new impulse in almost every direction of mental effort , should thus have been given to their energies , can not be deemed singular . The ways in which this influence was exerted were doubtless many . It is our purpose to notice three of the most important . In the first place , the Homeric poems served to give a fixed and permanent form to the Greek language . They appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of language , when its amazing powers of expression had become fully developed , but when its laws of construction and of idiom were still somewhat fluctuating and nnsettled . The Iliad and Odyssey became permanent repositories , in which were stored its verbal forms , while the combinations into which they were wrought , by the transcendent genius of Homer , gave to them , as vehicles of thought and senti // ment , a perfection which they had never before assumed . At a very early period in the history of Grecian literature , these poems thus assumed the place and the authority of a decisive standard , and this too in a form fitted to give to them the highest possible influence . This influence indeed must have been great , even when the people were acquainted with them only through the medium of the early minstrels . But it must have become pre-eminently so , when , after the labors of Pisistratus , in collecting and arranging their scattered parts , they existed in such a form as enabled all who wished , to consult them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The influence which they were thus made to exert upon the Greek language , was not unlike that which has so often been ascribed to the common English translation of the Scriptures upon our own . They fixed and made permanent its foundations . But , as storehouses in which were gathered the numberless creations of the Greek mythology , the Homeric poems have inconceivably enriched and adorned the various works of Grecian literature . Before the time of Homer , the Greek mythology was in a state not unlike the condition of the Greek language , already formed , but its various parts unsettled and widely scattered among the people . As disjointed fragments of a great and beautiful system , they were every where floating upon the surface of the public mind . It was by the author of the Iliad that they were gathered up and fixed in a settled and permanent form . The evidence of this may be found in the machinery of gods and goddesses , so constantly employed in the action of the Iliad and Odyssey , in the epithets so habitually used descriptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tales of supernatural incident and adventure , with which , in the form of episodes , the poet has so often adorned his pages . Thus embodied , and in a form so captivating , the Greek mythology became the grand source from which the Greek as well as the Roman poets of subsequent times borrowed their materials . Its elements have been wrought into innumerable forms of poetic beauty and enchantment . Its fictions of celestial romance have , in some shape , been transferred to almost every department of ancient poetry . In this way it is , that almost every department bears evidence of the influence which has been exerted by the Homeric poems in shaping the poetic mind of ancient times . But the works of Homer also presented to all subsequent poets true models of poetic genius and taste . In the earliest times of Grecian recorded literature , they fixed in the Grecian mind a correct standard , not only of speech , but of composition . They exemplified , in the most pleasing and captivating form , the wonderful powers of expression and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poems , sthsequent authors recognized productions which were not merely finished and beautiful in their separate parts , but which , as whole and complete works , were deserving the most profound study . To the poets of Greece , of all later times , they became what the Apollo Belvidere and the Venus de Atedici are now to the sculptor , and what the most finished productions of Raphael 's pencil are to the painter . With such models before them , the Grecian writers could not fail of aspiring after high degrees of excellence , both in the conception and in the execution of their works . Without approaching , in some degree , to the standard which these models had created in the public mind , they could not hope to prove successful as authors . They must forego that meed of glory , in the approbation // and applause of ' their countrymen , which to every Grecian mind was the highest motive to effort . The surpassing beauty and excellence of Grecian literature is hence , in no small degree , to be ascribed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as models of taste in composition . It became the aim of the dramatist and the orator , of the historian and philosopher , to become , each in his own department , what the Meonian bard had been in epic poetry.
