txt THE enterprise , the history of which Dr. Alexander has presented so much at large , originated in a desire to benefit the colored race both in this country and in Africa , the slave as well as the free . It was meant to serve the free , by providing a home where they should not he oppressed by those associations of contempt and injury which hang round them here and prevent their rising ; and to help the slave , by showing that his condition can be improved by emancipation , which is now doubted by many , and not without some reason . It was believed that there were those who held slaves from a feeling of necessity , and because they considered themselves responsible for their welfare , - retaining them in their service not from selfish motives , hut from the sincere impression , that to dismiss them , under ordinary circumstances , would do them more harm than good . Such persons undoubtedly there are , quite as many as would be found , in the same relation , ' in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said , to the disadvantage of our country , of the glory which England has gained by her West Indian emancipation , no one believes that there would have been more Treedom at this moment in Jamaica than in Louisiana , had it depended there , as it does here , upon the // masters . Those persons must be largely blessed with faith and charity who can look over the social condition of the British empire , and believe that the English are more alert than all the rest of the world in surrendering evils and abuses which they are interested to maintain . Here and elsewhere , there are some who , from reasons of humanity , desire to escape from the unnatural relation of master to slaves others who deplore its effects on character , both in themselves and their children ; others yet who live in dread of the consequences and changes which it may possibly bring . These all , acting from various and perhaps blended motives , are willing to surrender their charge , if they can be sure that they are removing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system is intended to answer this natural and reasonable demand . But there is an impression in many minds that the plan originated in selfishness , and that the whole operation of the system is selfish from first to last . The best way to determine this point is to consider the character of those with whom it began ; unless there is something which they could have expected to gain by it , there can be no ground for the suspicion . The well known divine , Dr. Hopkins , of Newport , first suggested it . Though , in his day , the relation of master and slave was not questioned as it is now , and it was not so generally admitted that man can buy no right to man , it was evident that the boudman was at the mercy of his lord , that they who have unlimited power will sometimes abuse it , and that , even if the slave should be humanely treated , it is only physical comforts which such kindness can supply , since , in order to reconcile him to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus closing the only window through which heaven 's light can reach his soul . Dr. Hopl*ins thought , too , that the colored race might be made the means to carry light and civilization to their African brethren , who have always been so difficult to reach . Surely , no one can ascribe his zealous philanthropy to any mercenary designs . Some years after , Dr. Thornton , a native of Virginia , brought forward a similar plan , and published an address to the free people of color in Massachusetts and Rhode Island , inviting them to go with him to Africa to establish themselves in the land of their fathers . He failed for want of means ; but what earthly end could he have // gained from it but labor and sorrow , had it succeeded to his utmost hope ? Dr. Finley , of New Jersey , called the first meeting which ever was attended in this country to consider the subject ; and he , Dr. Burgess , and Samuel J. Mills , who went forth to explore , and found his grave in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men can be from the suspicion of using philanthropy to veil selfinterest and ambition . And it may be said in general , that those who have taken up this object have struggled against wind and tide , having no loud voices of encouragement to cheer them , and yet persevering against contempt and resistance , when it was impossible to account for their selfdevotion , except by admitting that it came from the heart . But it is said , that there are those who sustain this enterprise , not from any desire to serve the slave or the African , but simply with the view of making slavery safer and more permanent by removing the free colored people from our shores . Undoubtedly it was free men whom they expected to remove . It was not understood that any should be compelled to go ; if they went at all , it must be by an act of freedom on their own part , by using the power of choice . Even had it been otherwise , had the slave been compelled to go , we can not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impression that slavery is a bitter state , and that whoever takes a man out of it to a land where he can breathe the air of free moral existence renders him a service , though perhaps against his will . When we see a man in the fire or the water , we may be forgiven if we do not ceremoniously ask his consent to draw him out ; and if he should prefer remaining in either element , it should not be accounted inhumanity on our part , if we consulted his welfare more than his will . It may be , that some have exerted their power as masters in a last act by compelling their slaves to go ; but if there have been such cases , we do not know them , and we apprehend that they are very few . That the system has been advocated by some Southern statesmen on the ground that it makes slavery safer and surer , we readily admit ; but certain it is , that the men who hold extreme opinions on the subject , believing slavery intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies of colonization , because they feel that the whole matter is brought under review and made to agitate the public // mind in this form , when it could not be introduced in any other . If , therefore , colonization could be put down , they think that it would close the only avenue through which light can reach the minds of the masters , and prevent all discussion of the right of man to man . There is no doubt that this is a correct impression , and in all these cases the question is not , with what views is an enterprise supported , but what is its effect likely to be . Every extended movement enlists a variety of interests and feelings ; some , who are perfectly indifferent to it in one point of view , may be warmly interested when they see it in another . If one of its advocates presents it to one set of men as favorable to their interests and views , and to another set , having different interests and opinions , as favorable to theirs , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no excuse for his double-dealing . And so , if the appeals and reports of any association hold different language according to the point of the compass to which they are addressed , offering colonization to the South as a means to perpetuate slavery , and to the North as an instrument to undermine it , no man in his senses will undertake to excuse or defend them . The case is different , when the plan is simply presented , and each one left to judge for himself what purpose it will answer , and why it should have claims to his friendly regard . The reasons which have weight with them may be different ; they may sometimes be directly opposed to each other ; one advocate , who takes one view of it , may present that view , and another , at his side , or in a distant region , may hold forth an opposite doctrine , without any moral inconsistency or prevarication . In every thing else , there is the same contradiction . Some friends of temperance are in favor of restricting laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create more intemperance than they suppress . Some opposers of capital punishment deny the right to take life , while others maintain the right , but would not exercise it , because it gives a murderer the aspect of a victim . Thus it is that men travel in different paths to the same result ; and it is no reproach to a cause , if it should be sustained from views and inducements various and even contradictory , since it has been so with every enterprise since the world began . But while the scheme of colonization presents itself in // various aspects to different classes of its supporters , and we are not aware that its advocates lie open to any charge of perverting or suppressing the truth , though it is not seen alike by all , it is well known that a great prejudice has been exerted against it , and that , too , in a part of the country where it might have expected the warmest welcome . It was not so in the beginning ; the friends of humanity and freedom in New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open precisely the way that was wanted , in which philanthropy could touch the subject of slavery without throwing off constitutional restraints , or calling up the fierce resistance of the masters . For a time , the only objection made to it was the poverty of its resources , and the vastness of the work which it proposed to do . This objection was met , by showing that all beginnings must be small it is only by slowly and heavily piling one stone on another , that foundations are ever laid ; that it was far better to make thorough , even if lingering , preparation for the work , than to have a multitude thrown into the new colony at once , without a mass to receive them in which their ignorance and barbarism could be melted down . Discouraging as such beginnings are , it is evident , in looking back on every such enterprise , that their hopelessness at first has been their greatest blessing , calling out patient hope , inspiring successive as well as strong endeavours , and giving the new elements time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight that shall afterwards come . As to the work which it proposed to accomplish , it was not supposed that mere efforts of private liberality would remove the vast slave population of the country , increasing every year , as it does , by tens of thousands . If the States interested would consent to the surrender , and the nation put its energy to the endeavour , no doubt it could be done ; but no one ever imagined that a voluntary association , however extended in its numbers , or liberal in its contributions , could any more relieve this continent from its burden than they could dip the ocean dry . Still , there was something which was entirely within their power ; they could make an experiment , to show , that , under favorable circumstances , the emancipated slave could throw off his degradation , expand to the frill proportion of intellectual manhood , form an energetic and practical character , and learn to respect him-24* // self and command the respect of others ; yet more , that , with his powers thus drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a moral , well ordered , and free community , with wise laws , administered by efficient members , and not indebted to the white man for counsel or guidance ; and , reasoning on common principles of human nature , it was believed that such a colony would send an inviting light across the deep , that slaves would hear of it and be earnest to go , that masters would feel that there they might safely send them , and thousands would find their way to it unaided and of themselves , as men always succeed in arriving at any destination which they strongly desire to reach . In all this there is nothing visionary . The slender resources of the colony , though a discouragement , have proved a blessing ; the cornerstone has been slowly and surely laid ; and the time is not distant , when it shall be a matter of attraction , and interest , and rejoicing to the colored race in this country and the world . These objections , which met the plan in the outset , being answered , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of slavery was kept before the public mind , and inquiry began to be made concerning the foundation of the master 's right to the slave . If the possession came by inheritance , the father could not transmit to the son a stronger claim than he had himself ; if he bought from the slave-dealer , the trader could transfer only his own title ; and this came originally from the African chief , who destroyed and plundered some village , that he might sell his wretched captives for gunpowder and rum . His only claim was that of the robber to the goods he had stolen ; so that , on looking into the validity of deeds , it became tolerably clear , that , if the slave was a man and not an animal , he had the best right to himself , - a right of which he could not be dispossessed by any act of power . By such processes of reasoning , the idea of the right to emancipation became familiar to the public mind ; and any thing which appeared to deny that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a condition to claim it or be the better for it , was looked on as an excuse for injustice and oppression . All at once , an attempt was made to persuade those who took a humane interest in the subject , that the colonization scheme maintained the unfitness of the slave to be free , and discouraged the hope that , under any circumstances , he could rise to the dignity and station of a man . // It was not easy to understand how this suggestion could gain credit , when the whole object of the society was to make him free , and to place him in circumstances propitious to the full development of his powers . To he sure , it went on the supposition that , as things are now , there is no place in this country where he can he situated thus . Go where he may , he encounters a cruel prejudice , which weighs him down like a millstone , excluding him from the honors and comforts of life , and reminding him , with perpetual insult , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingrained in the public mind , that many , who are kind and generous in other relations , are hard as the rock in this . Now , the question is , what shall he done for his relief ? Shall he submit to these heart-breaking sorrows in silence , waiting till the time shall come for a general change in the public feeling , which may not come till long after he is in the dust ? or shall he take advantage of a way of escape that opens , and relieve himself , by passing to a more favored region , where none can stand above him or trample him down ? His master is desirous to send him to such a country , and he is desirous to go . Why should they not he gratified ? What possible advantage can result to any one from keeping him in bondage , when he may as well be free ? If it be said , that these cases of occasional release exert an influence adverse to the more extensive deliverance which might give the same blessing to greater numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one can , by any imaginable effect , be unpropitious to the manumission of all . It should be remembered , that sending the slave to Africa is in itself an act of emancipation ; and , so far from being predicated on the idea that he never can be a self-sustained and energetic man , the whole theory of colonization is founded on the idea , that it is only his present condition which debased him , and if that can he changed , he will be intelligent , energetic , and happy as any of the sons of men . It really affords almost the only mode of immediate emancipation , recommending it as wisdom in the master and justice to the slave ; and yet there are many , who , for no reason except that some one has told them so , will maintain to the death , that colonization and emancipation are inconsistent with and hostile to each other . We are well aware , that the free people of color in this // country have now a great prejudice against expatriation . This , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should they leave it ? Ay , why should they leave it , if they can find an inducement to stay ? Egypt was the native land of Moses and the Israelites ; but their native air was not particularly good for their constitutions , and though they sometimes sighed for it in their discontent , they would doubtless have been sorry enough to have been taken at their word , and sent back again to the flesh-pots , cucumbers , and melons , not to speak of the brick-yards . We can not see the especial fascination in any part of this country , which should make a separation from it so heart-rending . We apprehend , that , if our portion in it was like theirs , we should sound a retreat at the first opportunity , and without incurring the penalty of Lot 's wife by looking hack on the forsaken home . It passes our comprehension to discover what they can find here , in the way either of enjoyment or hope , that should be so difficult to resign . It is true , that better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would seem as well to go to better days wherever they can find them , even if beyond the sea . But this is matter of taste ; and if the colored citizens of America prefer their present condition , such as it is , no one asks them to leave it ; they are at perfect liberty to remain to the end of time , if such is their pleasure . But there may be those who see better prospects opening before them in other regions , who , even if the chance of improving their condition were less than it is , would gladly embrace it , being strongly convinced that any change must be for the better . There is no more reason why they should be forced to stay than why others should be compelled to go and yet this constraint is imposed upon them , if they are deprived of this place of refuge . Should the colony be put down , they would be obliged to content themselves with what they have in this country , where , so far as we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninviting as ever fell to the lot of man . Now , while we should abominate the compulsion that forced any one to go , we can not see that there is any less hardship in being required to stay unwillingly , as they must , if the wishes and predictions of many with respect to the colonies were made good . It is as a kind of emancipation that we are most interested in it ; it has the advantage of being consistent with the law , acceptable to the masters , and , // as these considerations are not wholly disregarded by reasonable men , is more likely than any other form to be generally adopted . There is a common impression , however , that these plans of colonization increase the prejudice against the colored race . Whether this impression is held by any in good faith , or simply given to others , it is not easy to say ; for how any one in his senses can trace such an effect to such a cause is more than we can tell . Undoubtedly , the scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none lament it or suffer from it more than the colored race themselves ; but to say that colonization excuses , defends , or has any tendency to maintain it , is very much like the popular faith of childhood , which ascribes the origin of the wind to the agitation of the tree . It allows and deplores its existence , we mean so far as our observation and sympathy extend there may be those who think the prejudice natural , and not to be overcome ; but this view of the matter is not ours . We look on colonization as the only means at present existing to place the colored man where he shall not be crushed down with its weight , and it is chiefly for this very reason that we wish it success , and aid it with our best endeavours . If the inquiry be made , why we do not give battle to this prejudice , we answer , it is not because we do not condemn and deplore it , but because we have never seen prevailing ideas and feelings suddenly changed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help out those who are struggling with the waters , than to dam the current , or wait for it to run by . Besides these objections , which are made to any plan of colonization , and which one would think would have as much force in reference to the British provinces as in their African application , much has been said in opposition to the colonial settlements now existing . ' We are told that they are unhealthy , and that great sacrifice of life has attended the efforts to plant them . It is true , that , in former days , many have perished in consequence of being suddenly transferred to a climate the peculiarities and demands of which they did not know . But it would not be easy to find a region on this earth where people will not sometimes die ; had there been such , it would by this time have been tolerably well peopled by emigration , as well as by its own supply . But while it is true , that the common doom of mortality extends // to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waste of life is greater than , under similar circumstances , it would be in any other land . We find , when the facts are known with respect to the death of many enterprising travellers , that they became sick in consequence of thoughtless exposure to the nightly chill . So , in the colonies , while insufficient preparation was made to receive the emigrants , and physicians had not learned the proper treatment of local diseases , there was as much sickness and loss , perhaps , as at Plymouth in the earlier days . But as the settlements extend their accommodations , and medical men make themselves acquainted with the complaints which at first were new to them , the danger disappears , and the prudent are in as little danger as in their American home . Another objection to Liheria is , that the inhabitants have not devoted themselves as much to the cultivation of the soil as might he desired . It is undoubtedly true , that this employment is more favorable to a healthy moral state than any other , though less attractive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hebrew commonwealth , men engaged in agriculture are more likely to have that social equality , and that independence of feeling , which exert propitious influences to make and keep them free . But while any friend to a young republic would desire and recommend this employment for the great body of the people , it is obviously impossible to force it upon them ; they will , according to the common experience of human nature , turn their attention to the pursuit which promises immediate gain . If traffic and commercial advantages are within reach , these will at first prove most attractive ; they will bring with them tastes not the most favorable to content , industry , or moral improvement and elevation . It is not till the sorrowful experience of many shows that every one can not succeed in these pursuits , and that many blanks will be drawn to a single prize , that the quiet culture of the soil will be estimated as it deserves . But there is a stage of social progress in which the common illusion on this subject passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many are withdrawing themselves from the dusty and crowded paths of common life , from unprofitable trade and thronged professions , where the chances are many to one against them , to seek a subsistence in those agricultural pursuits , which , if less gainful in // respect to wealth , are more apt and sure to yield returns of the higher treasures of character , mind , and heart . There are some , too , who have the impression , that the Liberian experiment has been a failure ; that the inhabitants are neither prosperous nor happy ; that the tone of morals is low among them ; and , although some of them have become wealthy , that the greater number are poor and degraded , having gained nothing , but rather lost , if that is possible , by their translation to Africa . If this were so , it would be conclusive evidence against their power of rising ; so far as it went , it would show that they are wholly unfit for freedom , and need to he under the authority of others ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race have said of their natural inferiority and their necessary dependence ; for one can not imagine how the experiment should be tried under more favorable circumstances , and if it has not succeeded , there is no hope that it would prosper if tried again , in this land or in any other . But so far from finding this depressing view of Liberia confirmed , on examination , the weight of testimony is entirely on the other side . Some disappointed persons , doubtless , there have been ; some white men who have left the colony in disgust , and published unfavorable representations of it . But on looking into the matter , it does not appear that they were so sick of Liberia , as the colony was of them . The colored persons who have abandoned the undertaking became disgusted at finding that they must exert themselves there as at home , and that , unless they labored for their subsistence , they must suffer even more than in this country , since there was no master on whom they could lean . But by far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been given by those who never saw them , and who have no light whatever on the subject , except what a predetermined and deadly hatred gives . On the other hand , evidence is given in favor of Liberia by the officers of our navy , by masters of trading-ships , by residents who have returned , and by more colonists than one can number , - men who could have no motive to mislead the public , and whose characters forbid the suspicion of falsity . These all bear witness to the moral habits and social order of the people , their prevailing activity and intelligence , the abundance of talent and energy which they manifest , and their rapid advance // in all the improvements of civil and domestic life . The churches and schools are well attended , the Sabbath is observed more faithfully than in any city of our land , the courts of justice are in steady and successful operation , the interests of the mind are properly regarded , and religion holds a place as high in the general respect and affection as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is not determined never to believe , can resist the conviction , that all the promises and predictions of the founders have been made good . Considering the materials of which the colonies necessarily consisted , it is wonderful that they have come forward in civil and moral strength so soon . Neglected by friends and resisted by angry opposers , they have laid the foundations of an enlightened and powerful state , and the walls are already rising . We can not understand how it is , that any , who wish to prove that the colored race are capable of manly action and self-sustaining energy , should reject the evidence which this history affords them . They may look in vain in other directions to find any testimony so satisfactory and convincing ; and if they say that they need no such testimony , they must remember that others do , and that their doubts and sneers can only he answered by showing what colored men have done . Where can such illustration be found in successful action , except in a field like this ? One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect it will have on the continent of Africa , not only by affording a starting-point and place of protection for missionaries , which otherwise they could not find , hut still more by its tendency to suppress the slavetrade , that most accursed of all sins and evils , which nothing else hitherto has been able to reach . The British government has exerted itself , apparently in good faith and feeling , to put an end to these horribleadventures ; but it is freely confessed , that their maritime power , great as it is , can hardly reach . this traffic , and that it has continued to thrive and grow under all efforts to put it down . So long as the gain of such voyages is great , wretches will be found everywhere to fit out vessels for the trade and to man them , and if they are detected and pursued , their living cargoes , which might have testified against them , are drowned in the depths of the sea . But while the fleets of great nations are baffled in their endeavours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having sympathy for their brethren , are able to say and to maintain , that the slave-trade shall not pollute their ground their influence with the natives goes far to prevent their engaging in it ; and the avenues of fair and innocent commerce which they open withdraw the natives from violence and blood . It is made clear , by successful experiment , that where such colonies are established the slave-trade can not come . Since every other attempt to suppress it is hopeless , and this is the only one which promises any success , every one who wishes to put an end to it must rejoice in the prosperity of these settlements , and give his willing aid to extend them . The only objection that can be made is , that they are not strong enough for the purpose , and this should be a reason for enlarging their means and numbers , and thus giving them more power for the work . The history of this enterprise , as it is here recorded , is one of great interest even now , though the results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its consequences can open upon us , it must have reached its full stature . It has not yet passed through its childhood , or at most its forming state . But enough already appears to make it certain , that it will maintain its existence ; that it will be a strong and flourishing republic , and , like other republics , with all its faults , it will be a refuge for the oppressed ; that it will have power to drive the slave-trade from its borders , and to send the light of humanity into the darkness of the continent , where it stands , like sunlight on the edge of a black cloud , giving promise that the shadow shall pass away . They who are disposed to ascribe its origin to selfishness should remember that it was commenced by private liberality , not that of slaveholders , but principally of those who could derive no advantage from it beyond the gratification of their benevolent feeling . Some of the States , also , have taken measures to establish colonies for themselves , and it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national government , somewhat embarrassed perhaps by the relations in which it stands , has done nothing for it which is entitled to the name of patronage ; and pert and conceited officers of other nations have shown a disposition to tyrannize over it , by the exertion of brief authority in some unreasonable ways , which it is hoped that their superiors will disavow . The streams of private charity have been largely and liberally flowing , and // efforts the most constant and unwearied have been made by its disinterested friends . No popular enthusiasm has lifted and borne it onward , but everywhere it has been sustained by the thoughtful convictions of the wise and good . More than once , it has encountered a tempest of resistance which would have destroyed it , had it been less firmly set in the conscience and affection of its supporters , - but which , as it is , has given it a deeper root , a mightier bough , and a richer depth of foliage , to shelter those who sit under its extending shade . Any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to consider how many martyrs have laid down their lives for it , - martyrs not precisely of the kind so popular just now , who stand at a sufficient distance from all danger , and abuse the sinner , instead of endeavouring to influence him to give up the sin , - but of the more genuine sort , who hold comfort , safety , and life itself in light esteem , if , by surrendering them , they can be of service to the cause of man . Samuel J. Mills , before alluded to , was a man of this description ; he poured his full heart into every work of love . His most earnest desire was to preach the gospel to the Africans , and it was with a view to this work that he became an explorer in the service of the society , and contracted the disease of which he died . He found much to encourage him in the intelligent views which some of the natives suggested . One of them remarked , that it would be well to have the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the neighbouring tribes would dread the encroaching spirit of the whites much more than that of their own kin . Another said , that , as soon as a colored man capable of the trust could be found for a chief of the colony , he ought by all means to be placed at its head ; - precisely the course which the directors have thought it wise to pursue . The next of these devoted men was Samuel Bacon , an Episcopal clergyman , who interested himself in the subject , and was employed by the government as agent to take care of slaves delivered from the slave-ships . The emigrants who went with hitn were most of them taken sick with the acclirnating fever ; his strength was exhausted by his unwearied attendance upon them ; his spirit was severely tried by their jealous and unreasonable upbraidings ; he found himself deceived by a native on whose faithfulness he thought he could // rely . But while all things seemed to be against him , and the prospects of the enterprise were dark and low , he declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he had actually seen Africans landed in America suffering as much and in the same manner as the emigrants there ; while the surprising fertility of the soil , the mildness of the climate , the commercial advantages , the great abundance of fish and wild animals , seemed like an invitation to the scattered children of Africa to return to their home . As for himself , he had counted the cost of the service , and had made up his mind to die in it , if necessary . It was not long before he was weighed down with anxiety and labor . In the sickness which followed , he had neither medical attendance nor proper care ; and it was not long before he died , with a resigned spirit , and with unbroken confidence in the cause for which he had left his native land . Another of these martyrs was Dr. Randall , of Maryland , a physician of great promise , who had been elected to a professorship in Columbia college . After the death of Ashmun , he felt it to be his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been interested before , and therefore , against the remonstrances of his friends , he resigned all prospects of success and honor at home for the sake of rendering service to his race . Unfortunately , his zeal outran his strength . He exposed himself to the sun by day and the damps by night in a fatiguing journey , and , thinking more of his duties than his dangers , he became a victim , not so much to the climate , as to his earnest desire of doing good . Mr. Erskine , also , a colored Presbyterian divine from Tennessee , went out with his family to preach the gospel to the Africans , but was soon taken from his field of labor , after having followed his wife and daughter to the grave . Dr. Anderson , of Maryland , was another who left bright prospects and warm friends at home to labor in the service of humanity abroad but very soon after he landed in the colony , he was called from his difficult station to his eternal rest . Many such examples there have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifested in this cause . It may seem like a needless waste of life , but almost all these physicians bore witness , that the unrelenting fever was not more alarming in Liberia than in our Southern States . And as for the expenditure of life , it seems to be ordered by // Providence that such shall be the history of every similar adventure . The loss of such friends becomes a gain to the enterprise , from the spirit which it awakens in others ; and there can be no loss to those who , with true philanthropy , lay down their lives , a willing sacrifice , in the cause of humanity and of Cod . But this interesting cause , besides affording examples of great self-sacrifice , has called into its service some men of extraordinary power as well as philanthropy , who , in a larger field , would have been admired for their talent and energy , and in their small circle manifested high gifts , and made efforts which will hereafter he remembered with honor and applause . The first of these was Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the ministry , he was wholly untrained for business and war , and was thrown at once into the midst of danger which threatened the existence of the colony . Its means and resources , inadequate at the best , were all in disorder , and he had no time to arrange them before the blow should fall . Much of the public property had been consumed by fire ; the emigrants were not properly sheltered , though the rainy season had set in ; defences there were none , and not three dozen persons were able to bear arms . He was worn down with sickness ; after nights of delirium , he was compelled to spend the day in labor ; and his wife , who had come to share his fortunes , was rapidly sinking by his side . Certainly such a state of things was enough to fill the strongest and most experienced with dismay . But instead of yielding to depression , he proceeded to arrange the public affairs , providing for responsibility and order in every department . He erected buildings for the emigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superintended their erection , while he armed and disciplined the few soldiers that the small settlement was able to supply . So far from finding at home rest and relief from his multiplied labors , nothing can be more affecting than the account of the death-bed where his wife lay , in a miserable hut , which could not be ventilated , with the rain falling through the thatched roof upon her pillow and bed , and he , scarcely able to support his own weight , was leaning over her , while she expressed her perfect and contented resignation to a Heavenly Father 's will . Surely the imagination can not conceive a state of things which would make a heavier demand on the energies of the mind and heart . // At length , the whole force of the neighbouring tribes was concentrated in a powerful assault upon the colony . This was bravely and successfully resisted . Again they came on with greater violence and numbers , while the ranks of the defenders were thinned and their strength exhausted with watching by night and labor by day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammunition of the colony was exhausted , the provisions nearly gone , the wounded suffering every thing for the want of surgical skill . Still , his confidence never failed , for it was reposed not in any human resources , but in the favor and blessing of the Most High . Neither was it disappointed ; for the cannonade of the last engagement was heard at midnight by the crew of a British vessel , which happened , as men say , to be passing , though there is no such thing as chance . Major Laing , the traveller , who was on board , inquired into the cause of the firing , and when he found the little colony struggling for existence against all the tribes of the coast , generously supplied them with the means of future resistance , and , what was better , exerted a mediating influence with the assailants , which resulted in a friendly treaty and an honorable and lasting peace . All this , one would think , was enough for one man ; but after all he had done for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the society at home ; in some way or other , injurious reports had reached them and awakened suspIcion . At the same time , the colonists were in a state of open mutiny , which it required all his energy to keep down . But he could not be driven from his post of duty by violent resistance or unmerited reproach . By inflexible faithfulness , he compelled the rebellious to submit to his authority , and his employers to do justice to his name ; and it was not till his character stood not only clear but highly honored , and all acknowledged the cause to be more indebted to him than to any other man , that he returned to his home , not to enjoy his honors , but to die almost at the moment of reaching his native land . Eleven years after the death of Ashmun , the colony was happy in securing the services of another remarkable man , Thomas Buchanan , who was appointed by the government as agent for taking charge of the recaptured Africans . The several colonies were now united @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Liberia , of which he 25 * // was the executive head . From a timid and despondent condition , it had grown into firmness and strength , and what it wanted was a clear mind to arrange all its elements and resources , and a powerful character to make its influence felt and understood . Buchanan 's first act was to seize a vessel under American colors , which hovered on the coast in such a manner as to give the impression that it was a slaver . This was a hold step , and exposed him to serious consequences , if he should have mistaken her character ; but when he considered the detestable effect of the trade upon the races near him , he did not shrink from the most determined acts of duty . He also directed a slaver , who had established himself at Little Bassa , to leave the place . The colony claimed jurisdiction there , though its right to the soil was questioned . An English trader , at the same time , established a factory there , and when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this example , the slaver , who had promised to depart , determined to remain , and carried on his vile business more openly and largely than before . Mr. Buchanan took with him a military force to the spot , and after a sharp engagement destroyed the factories , seized the goods , and compelled the native chiefs to give up the slaves who had been carried into their countries to escape his reach . These vigorous proceedings against the slave-trade exasperated some of the native princes , and Gatoomba , one of the most powerful of their number , made an attack on some of the more exposed settlements , one of which was defended in a remarkable manner by three brave and resolute men . Finding that both colonists and natives were to suffer from this marauder , who was so savage and daring that two peaceful envoys who were sent to him were murdered in cold blood , the governor marched with a force against him , broke up the foundations of his power , and deprived him of the means of carrying on his work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the colony , from the claim of the Methodist mission , which had been permitted to receive its supplies from home in goods that were admitted without paying duties . He was willing that all articles intended for the personal use of the missionaries should he imported thus , but would not consent that they should enjoy an unrestricted privilege , which might throw the whole trade of the colony into their hands . In all these cases , some of which were severely trying , he bore himself // with a manly decision , which commanded universal respect and confidence . But just at the moment when the colony was receiving the greatest benefit from his services , he died . He had had time , however , to prepare the way for delivering over the chief authority into the hands of colored men , to whom , on all accounts , it is desirable that it should in future be confided . It is still more interesting to contemplate the examples of colored men who have distinguished themselves in this history , because they prove the truth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that color does not strike inward , - that , place the African in favorable circumstances for putting forth his energies , and he will not be found wanting in any respect , either in activity of mind , or in strength and determination of heart . The most distinguished illustration of this truth - we do not speak of the living - was Lott Carey , who had so strongly impressed Mr. Ashmun , no common observer , with a sense of his merits , that , when he returned to his own country , he left his office in Mr. Carey 's hands , earnestly recommending him as his permanent successor . This person was originally a slave in Richmond , Virginia , rather corrupt and profane in his habits , till , at the age of twenty-six , he became a Christian believer . Feeling the disadvantages of his ignorance , he learned at that age to read and write , and , as he had much natural eloquence , he addressed his brethren with great force on the subject of their religious duties . Meantime , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was employed , that he was soon able to buy his own liberty and that of two children , and the salary paid him for his services was eight hundred dollars a year . But prosperous and respected as he was , he determined to go where , as he said , he should be " estimated according to his deserts and not his complexion . " He felt hound , also , to use his advantages to do something for his suffering race . After he had been ordained as a preacher ac'cording to the usage of the Baptists , he proceeded to Liberia , where , retiring as he was , he soon made his real character felt , and was treated with the respect which he deserved . At the time when most of the colonists were in favor of breaking up the settlement . and retreating to Sierra Leone , on account of the dangers which beset them , he declared his fixed // purpose to remain , and thus encouraged them by his firm example . When they had no physician among them , he undertook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his good sense and experience , he was able to inspire full confidence in his patients , and , in a very extensive practice which was thus forced upon him , he met with great success . The only exceptionable part of his history was his joining the seditious persons who set Mr. Ashmun 's authority at defiance and seized the public stores . But when the governor publicly represented to them the true character and tendency of their proceedings , Mr. Carey came forward at once , openly confessed his error , and ever after was among the friends and supporters of law . All this while , he did not neglect his original mission , but gave his attention to the establishment of schools and churches , and particularly interested himself in teaching the recaptured slaves . He felt himself under obligation to Africa also , and went far into the interior , founding places of instruction , where the natives could be taught the language and religion of the colonists , which many of them were earnest to know . His death was occasioned by an explosion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the colony , and drive off a slaver who had established himself within a few miles ' distance ; and even the loss of Ashmun was hardly more felt than his . During the six months of his administration , he had borne himself with great dignity , inspiring respect at home and abroad . lie was perhaps more welcome to the settlers than any other person could have been , because he was a living example to show that the colored man was equal to every trust of duty or of honor . Happily the same confirmation is now afforded by Governor Roberts , whose able and satisfactory management of public affairs most of our readers know ; and who we hope will long be spared to the community over which he so well presides . If such examples can be found among those who were born in bbndage , and therefore were most unfavorably situated for cultivating and bringing out the powers that were in them , who can doubt that the coming generation will afford innumerable more ? The atmosphere one breathes is very important to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of miracle if the system reaches its full vigor and proportions in a corrupted air , and such cases // prove much more than if found in a different condition . When we find men formerly slaves conducting the public affairs of the colony , filling the places of trust and honor , firmly maintaining its rights , bravely defending its borders , managing its correspondence with Europeans in such a manner as to inspire respect and confidence , and , what is more , showing that the intellectual and religions interests of the people are near their hearts , it seems to us to afford volumes of eloquent pleading in behalf of the slave , and to establish the fact , that such a field of action and improvement is one which the colored race are blind to their own interests not to prize . They may say that they know their own interests best ; it may be so ; but men , before now , have mistaken what was good for them , when they thought they saw it clearly . We do not perceive that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others possess ; and to us it seems clear , that , in disowning Liberia , they indulge a suicidal prejudice , which their children , if not they , will remember with sorrow in future days . We do not say that other places may not be better , but we do say that this commonwealth fully answers the purpose for which it was founded , by showing that the colored race can he efficient , self-sustained , respected , and happy , without needing the aid or counsel of white men , and in a republic entirely their own . How it is that the free colored race can look with complacency on their condition in any part of this country is more than we can understand . True , it may be better at some future day than it is now ; we hope and trust that it will . But we speak of it as it is now , and surely there is no immediate prospect of a change for the better ; and we can not comprehend why they should wish to detain those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more favored land . No community , one would think , can afford a better home for the free colored man than Boston ; and yet , in comparison with Liberia , what story has Boston to tell ? " By an authentic document in the nature of a report rendered this year 1837 to the Boston Union for the Relief and Improvement of the Colored Race , ' we are enabled to run a statistical parallel between the people of the colony of Liberia , in Africa , and the free people of color in the city of Boston , in // America . In Liberia , more than one in every four of the inhabitants are church-members ; in Boston , less than one in every seven of the colored people are church-members . In Liberia , there are five hundred and eighty pledged members of temperance societies ; in Boston , there is not one , as appears from the tabular view . In Liberia , every child of sufficient age , of the families of the colonists , was at regular school ; in Boston , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really not comparable . In Boston , a primary school for colored children had to be discontinued for want of scholars ; in Liberia , fifteen schools could not satisfy the people , clamorous for the education of themselves and their offspring . In Liberia , the inhabitants support , both by their pecuniary and by their literary contributions , an ably conducted paper , - they can not only generally read , but can generally write and compose in a correct and manly style , as our quotations therefrom abundantly testify ; in Boston , scarcely any of the adults were able to read , and of children so reported some discount must be made . ' In Boston , a majority of all classes of them attend public worship very irregularly* ; in Liberia , the people are a peculiarly church-going people , nor could love or money influence any of them to labor on the Sabbath . " - p. 543 . Some may think that the colored persons would not be the better for connection with the churches ; some of their friends have been exceedingly busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus have done fatal injury to those whom they probably meant to serve . But to the eye of common sense , the fact just stated tells very much in favor of the home beyond the sea . In Boston , the colored race are diminishing , * and the number of unmarried persons is great , a fact which bodes no good to the coming generations . In Liberia , the inhabitants are increasing , and the state of society is encouraging in every respect of prosperity , and morals . Now , it seems to us , that , if we were of their number , and the lines had * Mr. Lemuel Shattuck 's able report on the census of Boston taken in 1845 contains a table , on page 43 , from which we borrow the following facts . In 1742 , of the whole population of the city , 8.39 per cent . were colored persons ; in 1800 , they were only 4.7 ; in 1825 , 3.29 ; in 1835 , 2.24 ; and in 1845 , but 1.61 per cent . In 1840 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,988 ; in 1845 , the number was reduced to 1,842 ; yet , in these five years , the total population of the city had increased from about 85,000 to 114,366 , or 34.54 peT cent . // fallen to us in our Northern capital , we should strike our tent with all possible expedition , and proceed to a more genial home . If we were reminded , that we were born in America , we should answer , that it was quite sufficient for us , and we should take care to die in some more friendly and favored land . This , however , is matter of taste and opinion , which each one must determine for himself ; but we lament to say , that , as the prejudice against them grows out of the memory of their hondage , even if slavery should come to an end to-morrow , it must be a long time before the impression of their inferiority and all the associations connected with it would be done away . We recommend this work to those who desire to know something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is true , its history is young , and the events here recorded have been passing before us ; hut we think very little of such incidents as they are served to us piecemeal in the public prints ; it is not till we see the whole movement at a single view , that we can understand its greatness , or form any conjecture as to its results in a future day . It has yet much to contend with ; as our government can not take it under its full protection , it must depend in a great measure upon the sense of honor and right which prevails among the nations of the earth . We wish it could place more ample confidence in this moral sense ; but , if the conscience of nations is weak , there is nothing which any one of them could gain hy injury to Liberia , and this is a guaranty on which it can more safely rely . Sometimes a small naval officer may glory over it , in the wantonness of power which has been committed to his unworthy hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be prevented , if not censured ; they can not be permitted without reproach to the nation which allows them . Our ' own officers have done themselves great honor hy the kind and manly interest which they have manifested in the colony , and the open testimony in its favor which they have been ready to give . We hope that it will be strong enough to work out its own results in peace . Prejudice itself can not well point out any harm which it can do ; while there is good reason to hope that it will afford a refuge for the oppressed , and he the means of making to injured Africa some late atonement for its numberless wrongs. // We say again , then , that we support this enterprise as a measure of emancipation . We look upon it as allowing the claim of the slave to be free , urging on his master the duty of releasing him , and expressing full confidence that he can be enlightened , happy , and free , when removed from the operation of that prejudice which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prejudice in question has any foundation in truth and reason , we think it baseless and unjust ; and we see no means so efficient to remove it , as to give the slave a chance to show the world what his energies , exerted for himself , can do . If we could see or imagine a way in which colonization would prolong the existence of slavery , it is the last thing in which we should he interested but while we do not doubt the sincerity of those who ascribe this effect to it , we can not trace the steps of their reasoning , nor understand the state of mind in which these impressions are welcomed as true . To our apprehension , it is clear , that whatever keeps this subject before the public mind , without exciting bad passions , is favorable to the progress of truth . It is well known that this form of emancipation is tolerated and practised where no other would be possible . If any oi7le sends his slaves to Liberia , it is a declaration on his part either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he thinks they can he better off elsewhere than in the house of bondage . In both cases , his testimony is favorable to the cause of freedon ; others will be influenced by it ; and thus a sense of the value of liberty , and the right and capacity of the slave to enjoy it , will gradually make its way from heart to heart . All may not travel up to this conviction in precisely the same way ; but this is of little importance , if they only arrive at the truth , that every man should be his own master , and that all have a right to be free.
