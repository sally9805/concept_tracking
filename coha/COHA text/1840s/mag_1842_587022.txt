txt PHILOSOPHy is the science of Life . Its problem is to find the Ultimate from which we may explain the origin of man and nature , determine the laws of their growth , obtain a presentiment of their destiny , and become inspired with a pure and noble zeal to live and die for the glory of God , and the progress of mankind . There is and can be no higher pro ' . biem than this ,  --  none more worthy to engage the whole force of our minds and our hearts . It is the problem of problems ; it includes all other probleins ; and on its solution depend all other problems for theirs . We have answered no question , whether of man or nature , of society , religion , or morals , till we have traced it to the Ultimate , beyond which there is no question to be asked , or to be answered . But the Ultimate for ever escapes us . It recedes always in proportion as we advance ; and is never seized save in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , transcends , and for ever must transcend , the reach of our powers . All that we can do , and all that we should attempt , is to obtain the solution that shall meet the wants and satisfy the heart of our own epoch . This solntion , though it must one day needs be outgrown , as we outgrow the garments of our childhood , will , nevertheless , bring us a measure of peace , become the point of departure for new inquirers , and pave the way for new and more adequate solutions . Philosophy is the creation of the human understanding , naturally or supernaturally enlarged and enlightened . All begins and ends with Thought , our only medium of knowledge , whatever its sphere or its de*ree . Thought is , for us , always ultimate . We can not go before nor behind Thought ; for VOL . XI. - NO . LIV . 72 we have nothing but thought with which to go before or behind it . What , then , is Thought ? What is its reach ? What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locke , " that the first step towards satisfying certain inquiries the mind of man was very apt to run into , was to take a survey of our own understandings , ex.a mine our powers , and see to what things they were adapted . " Thought implies both Subject and Object , that which thinks and that which is thought . What , then , is the Subject ? What is the Object ? The SUBJEcT is the me , that which I call myself , and express by the pronoun I in the phrases I am , I think , I will , I love ; or by the pronoun me , when I say of some particular thing , it pleases me , grieves me , injures me , does me good . I do not know myself by direct immediate knowledge ; I come to a knowledge of myself only in the phenomcnon , in which I see myself reflected as in a glass* I am never my own immediate object . " The understanding , " Locke very properly remarks , " like the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , takes no notice of itself ; and it requires art and pains to set it at a distance , and make it its own object . " This , if we substitute no direct notice for " no notice , " is as true when affirmed of me , as when affirmed of my understanding . I never stand face to face with myself , looking into my own eyes . The Seer and the Seen , the Subject and the Object , are as distinct in psychology as they are in logic ; and they are distinct in logic , because they are distinct in the nature of things . Yet some modern psychologists , misapprehending the fact of consciousness , have questioned this statement , and // contended that the Subject may be its own object , and that I may know myself by direct , immediate knowledge . But if this were so , I could know at once , and prior to experience , all that I am , and all that I can do or become . I could know myself active without having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt . I should know beforehand the nature and the reach of the passions ; - love without having ever loved ; hatred without having ever hated ; grief without having ever grieved . I should know at once all that I ever can know , whether of myself or of that which is not myself . But it is only God who can know himself by direct immediate knowledge ; for only that which is independent , self-existent , and self-living , can contain in itself its own object . No man knows thoroughly himself , or can say , till enlightened by experience , what he is able to do , or to become . Even they who best obey the injunction , " Know thyself , " are but slight proficients in self-knowledge . The bulk of mankind are grossly ignorant of themselves . Moreover , we advance in the knowledge of ourselves . Every day reveals us to ourselves under some new aspcct . The older we grow , the more varied our experience , severe our struggles , and tryin* the vicissitudes of life , the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did we know ourselves by direct , immediate knowledge , what room would there be for this prog ess ? and how could this varied experience , and these stru*oies trials and vicissitudes , be * , co* *e the medium of advancing us in the knowledge of ourselves ? it were , my own eye , I should be to myself as if I were not , did I not think . When I do not think , I do not exist to my own apprehension . How know I then that I exist at all ? I can not prove my existence ; but I have no need to prove it , for whenever I think , I always find myself in the thought as THAT-wHIcit-TiIiNKs . As certain as it is that I think , so certain is it then that I am ; for I always think myself as the subject of the thought . I do not infer my existence from the fact of thinking . I do not infer it at all ; but in the act of thinking I find i ' . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with establishing it . I can not prove my existence , neither can I deny it , nor doubt it . To doubt is to think . But I never think without finding myself as the one who thinks . Consequently , in doubting my existence I should find it . I can not deny my own existence ; not only because in denying it I should logically affirm it , by affirming the existence of the denier , but I should be conscious of myself , in the act of denying , as the one who makes the denial . This finding of myself in the phenomenon , or as the one who thinks , is precisely what is meant by the term conscrousxzss . Consciousness is not a faculty , nor even an act of a peculiar sort . It is simply a higher degree of what philosophers call perception . As its name implies ,  --  cum scientid ,  --  it is something that goes along with knowledge , or something in addition to simple perception ,  --  od-pcrceptio , apperception ,  --  and is easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple phenomenon , or rather a sincrle act of the mind ; hut , in addition to the perception of the rose , the object of the thought , I recognize , but as an integral part of the same phenomenon , myself as the agent thinking , or the one who perceives the rose . This recognition of myself is the consciousness . All acts in which I so recognize myself as actor or thinker , are called by Leibnitz APFERcuvvio*s . All thoughts are properly apperceptions , for they all include in the view of the thinker , both the subject thinking and the object thought . But , though I know not myself by direct , immediate knowledge , yet I know myself mediately , indirectly , through the medium of my acts . Whenever I think , I find myself as one of the elements of the thought . I never think without knowing that it is I and not another that thinks . This is the meaning of the " Cogito , erg6 sum " of Descartes , " I think , therefore I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer , as he himself expressly tells us , an argument for his existence ; hut merely stated the fact in which he found it . Not being able to see or to But according to this , consciousness recognize myself in myself , to see , as is not , as is sometimes supposed , the // immediate perception of myself in myself . I am conscious of myself only in the phenomenon , and even then only under the relation of its subject . I can speak , I can think , or even conceive of myself only as the subject of an act . I can define myself only hy referring to my acts . I express myself , indeed , by the personal pronoun , hut never without joining it to the verh . I , me , taken alone , without a verb , expressed or understood , means nothing . It must be always I am , I do , I think , I will , I love , or I bate . In my essence , save so far as my being is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . I find myself never as pure essence , but alxvavs as cause , and as being only so far forth as cause ; that is to say , I find myself , exist to myself , only in my efforts , productions , or phenomena . I am conscious , therefore , of myself only under the relation of subject or cause ; and , therefore , it is only under this relation of subject or cause , only as projected into the phenomenon , that I can be my own object , that I can study myself , and learn what I am and of what I am capable . But the phenomenon is never the SOLE product of the subject . There is and can be no thought with a single term . It is impossible to think without thinking an OBJECT as well as a subject . I never think without encountering an object , and only in concurrence with the object . But in the act of thinking where I find myself , and where only I find myself , I always find myself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always , invariably opposed to the subject , and , therefore , nevet as me , but ALWAYS AS NOT NE . IL REALITY OF THE OBJECT . I RECOGNIZE myself , am conscious of my own existence , am able to affirm that I am , only in the act of thinking . But I can think only on condition of encountering in the phenomenon an object which , as opposed to the subject or me , must needs be not me . Then II can never find myself without finding at the same time , and in the same phenomenon , that which is not myself . But I do find myself in every thought . It follows , then , that both myself and that which is not myself , the me and the not me , are given in each and every thought , in the first and simplest , as well as in the last and most cornplex . The highest degree of certainty I ever have or can aspire to , is that of my own existence . This is merely the certainty I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought . But the certainty I have , that in thinking I encounter an object , which is not me , is precisely equal to this . Consequently , the certainty I have of the existence of the Object , in all cases as not me , is precisely , obje ively and subjectively , the certainty I have of my own existence , that is , my highest degree of certainty . This conclusion is of immense reach in philosophy , lit settles the question so long agitated concerning the objective validity of human knowledge , and puts an end at once and for ever to all IDEALISM , and to all SKEPTICISIE . The object is no creature of the subject ; for it is as essential to the production of the phenomenon we term thought , as is the subject itself . Where there is no subject , of course there is no thought ; where no object , equally no thought . Since the object precedes thought as one of its conditions , it can not be a product of thought ; since its existence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , it must be independent of the subject , and therefore not me . If not me , it must be what I find it in the phenomenon ; that is to say , it must be in itself what I think it , or what it enters for into the thought as one of its elements . For , if it were not what li think it ; if it entered into the phenomenon for what it is not in itself , it would not be not me , but me ; and therefore not object but subject , which were a contradiction in terms . Every thought contains an object ; and this object , whatever it be , is therefore not me , but exists really out of me , and independent of me . The object I think then really is ; and is , not because I // think it , but I think it because it is , and could not think it , if it were not . What* ever then I think exists , and independent of me . If I think an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finite , then is there the finite ; the infinite , then is there the infinite ; God , then God is . This is no forced result . It is asserted when we assert that every thought contains an object , and that the object is in all cases not me . But if we accept this result , we are saved no little labor . The passage from the subjective to the objective ceases to he that long , circuitous way commonly imagined , and the great problem which has vexed philosophers in all ages , is found to be no problem at all . The great problem*with philosophers has always been to establish the objective validity of our knowledge ; that is , the existence of the not me . We are conscious of our own feelings , beliefs , and convictions ; but is there anything out of us , and independent of us , to respond to these subjective affections ? How know I that God and nature are not mere modes or affections of my subjective life ? How know I that aught exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I that the outward universe , with all its wondrous beauty and variety , is anything more than myself projected , or taken as my own object ? Here is the problem which has always in some form or other tormented the metaphysicians ; and yet this is a problem that can not he solved . There is no passage possible between the subjective and the objective . There is no possible equation between me and not me , by which one may be obtained from the other . it is impossible to conclude from my own existence to that of another . There is here no room for lo* , ic . Logic can operate only on data previously assumed or established ; and it never does and never can operate with only a single factor* Unity multiplied by unity , ives unity , and nothing more , is as true in logic as in arithmetic , which is only a special application of logic . With the me alone , or with the not me alone , logic can obtain no result . God , man , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in fact the necessary bases of lo , , ic , and must be found , or assumed , before logic can commence its process of demonstrating them . Nevertheless , the human race has contrived , some way or other , to open relations with the objective world . From the first day of its conscious existence , it has not ceased to believe itself in strict relation with a world out and independent of itself . God and nature have been and are realities to it , as much so as its own existence . Strange ! The human race , the savage in his forest , the shepherd on his hillside , the rustic following his plough ,  - -  all believing what the inetaphysicians have hitherto been unable to demonstrate , and what the more sober-minded among them contend can not be demonstrated ! This fact should have induced them to inquire , if , after all , they have not erred in assuming any demonstration to be necessary . When Dr. Johnson was asked what answer he would use against those who denied the reality of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stone , This reply was not logical , but it was philosophical and just . It recognized this fundamental fact , namely , that I find myself only in opposition to that which is not myself ; and directed the inquirer to the simple fact in which originates all faith in external realities . Tn striking his foot against the stone , Dr. Johnson had as positive evidence that the stone was not himself , and therefore that it was im* relation to him , an external reality , a he had that it was he and not another who performed the act of striking his foot against it ; or that the act of striking his foQt against it was followed by an affection of his sensibility . The cause of this error of the metaphysicians , in seeking a passage where none can be found , and where none is possible or needed , must be looked for in their assumption of a false point of departure of philosophy . They have supposed that philosophy must begin either with the subject , that is , with the me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the not me . But when we begin with the subject we can never get to the object , as Hume and all the skep // tical philosophers but too easily demonstrate . When we so begin we necessarily end in Idealism . When we begin with the object , the not me. , taking our point of sight in God , as do the larger part of theologians , we necessarily end in Pantheism , with Spinoza ; or taking our point of sight in nature , the effect , we end necessarily in Atheism with Evhemere and D'Holbach ; for it is as impossible to go from the object to the subject , as from the subject to the object . The true point of departure of philosophy is never in BEING , in the EssE , DA5 REINE SEYN of the Hegelian whether of the subject or of the object ; but in LIFE , which is the manifestation of Being . And in LIFE , according to what we have established , THE sueJECT AND OBJECT , ME AND NOT ME , ARE ONE AND INDIsSOLUBLE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Critique , has with masterly skill and wonderful exactness , drawn up a complete list of the categories of Reason . His analysis of Reason may be regarded as complete and final . Cousin has followed him , and , with true metaphysical sagacity , reduced these categories to two ,  --  the category of 5TJB5TANCE , and that of cAU5E ; or , as I prefer to say , the category of BEING and that of PHENOMENON . Whatever we conceive of , we must conceive of it existing either as being or as phenomenon . Being or substance , in itself , transcends the reach of the human mind : we can know it , can conceive of it , only in the phenomenon ; or , as M. Cousin would say , only under the category , or relation of cause . I find myself , as we have already seen , only as the subject of the phenomenon ; that is , only so far as I do something . In like manner do we know or conceive of nature never only under the relation of cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , in the phenomenon. ,  --  - *- as the object which opposes or resists the subject . God is never seen or conceived of in himself . He is to us only in his DoING , only as cause , or creator ; though as wise , holy , good , and allpowerful Cause or Creator . The category of substance is then conceivable only in the category of cause : that is , we know being only as cause , and only so far forth as it is a cause . We seize it only in the phenomenon , the manifestation , not in itself . The manifestation of beinir , that is , being putting itself forth in the phenomenon , is what I term Li * and when this life is so intense that the subject recognizes itself as well as that which is not itself , I term the phenomenon , THOUGHT , or apperception . Now Thought , and , as we shall hereafter see , all Life , is the JOINT PRODUCT of both subject and object . I know myself indeed as subject or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the CONCUBRENCE of that which is not myself . In other words , the subject , as we have seen , can not manifest itself without an object ; and the object can not manifest itself without a subject , which , of course , relatively to it will be object . Now , as the phenomenon is single and indissoluble , and yet the joint product of both subject and object , it follows that both subject and object are , though distinct , one and inseparable in the phenomenon or fact of life . Here , in the phenomenal , in the fact of Life , where only we are able to seize eithor the subjective world or the objective world , the subject and object are given , not as separate , not one to be obtained from the other , but in an INDISSOLUBLE 5YNTHEsis . This is wherefore I call philosophy not the science of BEING , but the science of LIFE ; and also wherefore I add to it the epithet , SyNTHETIC . If metaphysicians had begun in the fact of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EssE , the REIN SEYN , they would have found , as data already furnished to their hands , both the objective and the subjective ; and finding them both in the indestructible synthesis ot thought , they would never have conceived the problemThe one being given , how to obtain the other ? In point of fact , the problem is really inconceivable , and philosophers have been for ages asking , not so much an unanswerable , as , if we may so speak , an unaskable question ; for the one term is never found without the other , or conceived of , save in conjunction with the other . This is what we must mean when we say that we never find ourselves but as the subject of the phenomenon , and never as subject // without finding ourselves in conjunction with that which is not ourselves , as object . There has been no error in asserting the existence of God , man , and nature . We are not to arraign the faith of mankind in this three-fold existence , because philosophers have been unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have erred only in attempting to legitimate it . Mankind believe in God , in themselves , and in nature , for the best of all possible reasons , BECAUSE THEY THINK THEM , AND CAN NOT THINK WITHOUT THINKING THEM . Here is the whole mystery of the matter . The profoundest philosophy can add nothing to this , and take nothing from it . All that philosophy is called upon to do in relation to it , is simply by refLection to place the fact that the me alone is incapable of generating a single phenomenon , in a light so clear that none can mistake it . Taking this view , there ceases to be any discrepancy between philosophy and what is called common sense . Humanity is never a skeptic . Even the skeptical philosophers themselves , are practically no skeptics . Hume , notwithstanding his philosophical doubts , believes as firmly in God , nature , and the necessary connection between cause and effect , as his great opponent , Dr. Reid himself . Both admitted that the reality of this connection , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both also contended that neither could be disbelieved . The only difference there was between the skeptic Ilume , and the realist Reed , was that the former thought the demonstration in question essential to a scientific belief , while the latter stoutly maintained , but without showing any great reason for so maintaming , that it was not . There is much misconception about this matter of proving or demonstrating . Nothing is more absurd than to conclude that whatever can not be proved true , must therefore be regarded as false . That which is less evident , is proved by that which is more evident . But when the fact alleged is of itself of the highest degree of evidence we can have , it is incapable of proof . What is more evident than the circular appearance of the sun ? Yet bow can I prove to myself or to another , that the sun appears to me of a circular form ? But facts of this kind need no proof . EVERY FACT 15 INCAPABLE OF PROOF JU5T IN PROPORTION TO 1T5 CERTAINTY . A proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or by being shown to be involved in another proposition beld to be true . But when the proposition is itself ultimate , when there isno proposition more ultimate into which it can be resolved , or from which it can be obtained , it is , and must needs be , incapable of demonstration . But then it needs no demonstration . It is certain of itself , and one of the grounds of certainty in regard to other propositions . Now , the ground we assume is that both the me and the not me are ultimate , and both being found in the same phenomenon as the essential conditions of its production , are incapable of demonstration or of proof , but are sufficiently evident without either . III . RELATION OF SUBJECT AND OBJECT . THE subject and object can not meet in the fact of life without generating a result . Their shock one against the other can not take place without an echo . This echo adds another to the elements of thought . Thought may therefore be defined to be a phenomenon with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; no one of which can be abstracted without destroying thought and the possibility of thought . These three elements are , 1 . SUBJECT ; 2 . OBJECT ; 3 . Fo*ii . The Subject is always in ; the Object always NOT ME the Form is the NOTION , or what the subject notes , in the act of thinking , of both subject and object . Subject and object are the bases of thought , and necessarily precede the phenomenon . The subject must exist before it can think , the object before it can be thought . Neither then is produced // by thought . Both do and must remain in themselves what they are , be the notion the mind takes of them , or the Form of the thought , what it may . The subject generates neither , nor determines the office of either in the generation of thought , for it can not think without including both as the necessary conditions on which it thinks . But with the FoaM of the thou , ht , or Notion , it is altogether different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed of the subject alone , as free , voluntary cause ; but of the subject acting in conjunction with the object . It is the view which the subject takes of both itself and the object , and according to the conditions of thought can not be produced without the presence , and so to speak , cooperation of the object or not me . But the intelligence that notes , views , or perceives , is the subject exclusively . The conjunction of subject and object can generate thought only on condition that the subject is intelligent . In thought there is always intelligence ; as we have seen , always direct perception of the object , and a reflected perception of the subject . This intelligence is the subject . The form of the thought , being the notion which the subject takes of both subject and object , is therefore the product of the intelligence of the subject , only of the subject displaying itself in conjunction with the object . The subject taking note of both subject and object , in the fact of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself perceiving that which is not myself , and recognizing myself as the agent perceiving . It is not one thing to perceive , and another to be conscious . It is not correct to say that I am conscious of my perceptions . Consciousness is not a phenomenon separate or even distinguishable from perception , unless it be in the fact that it marks a certain degree or intenseness of perception . Both perception and consciousness are the subject displaying itself in conjunction with the object ; both are maifestations of one and the same intelligent subject . In every fact of consciousness I perceive ; though I am not conscious in every fact of perception . But those perceptions in which I am noyonscious , differ from those in which I am , that is , from my thoughts or apperceptions , only in being feebler , more confused , less marked or distinct . They , in like manner as thought , imply both subject and object , but in them the subject perceives the object , without any reflected perception of itself as the percipient agent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to give them form , or to note distinctly what they reveal of either subject or object . Add another degree of perception , render the perception sufficiently vivid and distinct to be what I call thought or apperception , and it is instantly clothed with a form ; the mind notes , marks or distinguishes both itself and the object . It follows from this that the Form or Notion is merely that higher degree of intelligence which includes in one view both subject and object , and therefore is identical with the fact of consciousness . The Form of the thought , or notion , is often taken for the whole of the phenomenon . Thought is indeed impossible without form , and where there is no notion of either subject or object , or of both , there is no thought ; but if the form , or the notion , were the whole phenomenon , thought would be a mere empty form , a notion where nothing is noted . Locke called the form of the thought or notion , Idea , which would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of intermediary between the subject and the object . Locke does not teach that we perceive the object , but an idea or notion of the object . This was his fundamental error . We perceive the object itself ; never a notion of it , for the notion , instead of being the immediate object of the perception , is simply what , in perceivin* , we note of the subject and the object of perception , the form which by virtue of our intelligence we are able to give to the perception . In the fact of consciousness , or under the form of the tboubht , are always , as has been said over and over again , both me and not me . Then under the form of every thought , even the simplest , the feeblest , lies always absolute truth . Me and not me , these two certainly embrace all reality . These both are essential to the production of the least conceivable thought . All reality lies // then under every notion as its conditions . God , man , and nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts , and each one of our thoughts reflects them all three . Without the combined activity of them all , no thought , nor even possibility of thought . How wonderful a creation then is thought Of what inconceivable grandeur ! Before it the wise stand in awe , or bow down and revere as before the transparent symbol of the Almighty . But , if absolute truth enters into every thought as its basis , is essential to its production , yet no more of this truth is expressed by the form of the thought than comes within the scope of the intelligence of the subject . This intelligence , in the case of all beings hut One , is and must be limited . Man is an intelligence , or else he could not think ; but he is a finite intelligence . His light is a true light , as far as it is bright ; but it is feeble and dim . It shines only a little way into the darkness , and even that little way merely as a sudden flash , permitting us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon to enable us to see what they are . It can not enlighten all reality . It can enlighten only that side of reality which is turned towards us ; that turned from us it throws into shade . The smaller body can never illumine at once all sides of the larger body . Man , therefore , can not comprehend the infinity which lies at the bottom of his thoughts . Always thea must his xovoxs , or views of that infinity , partake of his own feebleness , and be inadequate , dim , and partial . With these dim ' , inadequate , partial , one-sided views , man constructs , and must construct , his systems of religion , morals , and politics . Compelled by the necessities of his nature , to con* dude from the luminous to the dark , from the known to the unknown , the certain to the uncertain , error is the inevitable consequence , and his systems reared with honestest intention , and infinite pains , can be , even while they stand , little else than monuments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between his ambition and his strength . But this , while it may well humble pride , and check theoretic presumption , need not alarm , or dishearten the inquirer . Thought , owing to the finiteness of the human intelligence , is always inadequate , and therefore has and must have its face of error ; but since it necessarily includes under its form both the NE and EOT lOE , and therefore the infinite , the absolute , it must also have always its face of trntL Man , moreover , as will hereafter be demonstrated , is a progressive being . He stands indeed on the borders of a universe of darkness , hoping , tremblind , half-longing , half-fearing to plunge in ; and never will that universe wholly disappear ; but it shall ever recoil from his glance , and leave a larger and a larger space within the circumference of his vision . Nature as a whole , and in its parts , is in a state of uninterrupted progress . Man goes on with it , and by its aid . His faculties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his whole being becomes elevated and expanded , enabling him to penetrate farther and yet farther into the darkness , to enliUhten a larger and a larger portion of the infinite , and to give to his thoughts clearer and more adequate forms . The face of truth is thus ever becoming bro*ider and more radiant , while that of error is continually diminishing . Iv* FORMULA OF TAx ME , Ott STJB5EcT . I A*t reve led to myself only as the subject of an act , that is , as agent or actor . We find ourselves only in acting , and only so far forth as we act . To act is to cause , create , or produce . The ME , then , since it acts , must be a cause , a creative or productive Force . If a cause , it must hen real , substantive being . That which is not , can not act . In order to do , it is necessary to be . Being necessarily precedes Doing ; but it is only in Doing that Being is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I necessarily recognize // myself to be a real existence  --  a limited , relative substance , no doubt ; but still a substance capable of supporting accidents or phenomena ; and , therefore , not myself a phenomenon , nor a collection of phenomena , whether of matter or of spirit . The substantiality of the me affirms its UNITY . If I am substantial , I am one substance ; for two substances would be two mes , instead of one . Moreover , I am always revealed to myself as one . My l ) henomena may vary , but I do not vary with them . They may pass away , but I survive . We never confound ourselves with our phenomena . We think , but are not the thought ; are pleased , but are not the pleasure ; are pained , but are not the pain ; nor do we become it when pained . There is always unity of consciousness . The me that wills , knows , feels , is always one and the same me . The me , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being , cause , or force . But I am not a mere naked substance ; that is , a mere abstraction . I am a living substance , clothed with attributes . I find myself in the act of thinking . But to think is to perceive , no less than to act . An unintelligent actor would not be a thinking actor . No being but an intelligent being can think . The lIE , then , since it thinks , must be INTELLIGEET . I am also capable of feeling . The naked conception of substance does not necessarily involve the power to feel ; nor does it imply that of intelligence . The fact that I am intelligent is learned by experience , not deduced from the nature of being or substance , considered apart from its manifestations . There is no particular substance or being whose attributes or properties can be known , i priori . The naked idea of being  --  the reine Seyn of Hegel-is simply the idea of something which is , and does not necessarily suppose the being to possess any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being able simply to be . From this idea , some philosophers have , indeed , attempted to deduce , logically , the universe , with all its infinite variety of phenomena . But from being , nothing but being can be obtained ; and the universe conVOL . Xt. - NO . Liv . 73 structed with this simple idea would be the veriest abstraction , and in the last analysis identical with no universe at all . The faculties of the particular being in question must always be learned empirically , and be taken as facts of experience , and not as facts of reasoning . It would not be difficult to conceive of beings created with the simple FORCE or power of acting without thinking or feeling . But such a being is not man . We may add to force intelligence , and conceive of a being capable of acting and knowing , and yet incapable of feeling . Such a being is very conceivable ; there may be , for aught we know , many such beings ; but man is not one of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , joy , grief , hope , pleasure , pain , are among those phenomena which nobody questions , for they are facts of every one 's experience . Man , then , is not only a substance , but an intelligent and sentient substance ,  --  a being that ACTS , xnows , and FEELS . From this it follows that man has three faculties , which may be named , 1 . Activity , 2 . Intelligence , 3 . Sensibility . Activity is the power of acting ; intelligence the power of knowing ; sensibility the power of feeling . There may , for aught we know , be beings endowed with more than these three faculties ; but these are all that we have found ourselves to possess , and all that we can conceive it possible for us or for any other being to possess . But the me has already been shown to be a vnrTv ,  --  one and indivisible . This distinction of faculties , then , implies no division in its essence . There is not one part of it that acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that feels . It is all and entire in each one of its faculties ,  --  a simple substance , with the threefold power of acting , knowing , and feeling . It must then act in knowing and feeling ; know in feeling and acting ; feel in acting and knowing . This follows inevitably from the fact that I am in myself a cause . I find myself always as a cause , and never under any other character . I find myself in all my phenomena , in those of intelligence and sen* // sibility , no less than in those of activity . Then I find myself in them all as a cause . Then I am active in them . Since I am a unity , and therefore must act ever as a whole , in all my integrity , I must act in them all with my threefold power of acting , knowing , and feeling . According to the Formula now obtained , man is a bein that acts , knows , and feels , and ALL THESE IN THE 5AME PHENOMENON , AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a living type of that sublime doctrine which lies at the bottom of all Christian theology , and not only the type , but in some sort the origin and basis . Two facts here must never be lost sight of ; tbe DEITY and TEIPLICITY of the me . Man acts always as a unity , but with a threefold power of activity , or rather with a capacity of giving to his activity a threefold direction . We can discover in his nature tbe distinction of faculties , but no division of essence . There is a broad distinction between an action and a cognition , between a cognition and a feeling , and between a feeling and an action ; but in actual life there is no separation . Tbe faculties desib nated are essentially the ME , and the activity displayed in them is the activity of the one invariable and indivisible subject . We can not say that activity acts , intelligence knows , and sensibility feels ; for this would be to separate the faculties from the me , and to give them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always the product of the lIE displaying itself in its unity and triplicity ; therefore of the simultaneous and joint action-so to speak - of all the faculties . This fact is important . Neglect of it bas generated much confusion , and no little false philosophy . Psychologists have mistaken the facts of ItEixtoIIY for the facts of cON5CIOII5N*55 . The facts of memory may 1 ) 0 dissected , decomposed , and distributed into separate classes . As the soul has three faculties , and each of these faculties performs an office in generating the phenomena , we may detect the part of each , and distribute the phenomena into classes corresponding to the distinction of faculties , In the analysis of these facts , activity will he found to give us actions , intelligence cognitions , and sensibility sentiments or feelings . We may distribute them , then , into actions or volitions , cognitions or ideas , and sentiments or feelings . But this distribution , however true it may be to me as studied in the products of my past life , will not be true to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * o together . There is no action which is not at the same time a cognition and a sentiment ; no cognition not at the same time a sentiment and an action ; no sentiment not at the same time an action and a cognition . But , losing sight of this fact , psychologists not unfrequently transfer to otual life the classifications they obtain by studyin* our past life , and therefore destroy the me , by resolving it into its attributes . In the facts of memory there is no living unity . That living unity has left them behind , has passed on , and is now merely looking back upon them . That living unity is the HE itself , and being no longer in them , but merely contemplating them , as it were , at a distance , can not , of course , find itself in them . They are to it what the dead body is to the living . There being , in fact , no unity in them , reflection can not find it , any more than anatomy finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled all the functions and gave a common direction to all the activities of the living body . The me obtained by studying these facts exclusively is necessarily multiple and not simple . Taken , then , for the in of actual life , it gives to the me of actual life no unity , separates it into parts , into independent hem s , and , instead of a me that at once , hy virtue of its own nature , acts , knows , and feels , gives us three separate , and in some sort independent mes ,  --  a me that acts , another me that knows , and still another that feels , displaying themselves sometimes in concert , sometimes one after another , and sometimes , as it were , one in opposition to another . But the faculties do not exist independent of the me . There is not a me and by its side a power to act , a power to know , or a power to feel . The threefold power is the me , and the me is it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my essence active ; intelligence // does not know , I know because I am by my nature intelligent ; sensibility does not feel , I feel because i am in myself sentient . In consequence of transferring to the living subject the classifications we have obtained by studying the dead subject , or facts of memory , we have supposed that we could perform actions or generate phenomena which should not necessarily imply all our faculties . Thought , which expresses the highest activity of the soul , has been regarded as a purely intellectual act , and intellect has been defined to be the thinking faculty , as distinct from activity or sensibility . Thou , , ht is looked upon as something dry and cold ; and a " man of thought " would designate a man without soul , without heart , destitute of love or sentiment , living only in abstractions . But there are no abstractions in actual life . A purely intellectual being may , as has been said , be conceived of , but such a being man is not . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but thinking and knowing in such a being could not and would not be what they are in us . Man is in his essence sentient . He can not divest himself of his sensibility , for he can not divest himself of himself . Always and everywhere , then , must he feel . When he acts , act where or to what end he will , he must fi*el . He can perform no dry , cold , intellectual act . Even the metaphysician , porin* over his abstractions , withered and dry as he may seem , is still man , and has a heart ; and when , after days , weeks , months , and years of painful watching and laborious study , truth at last dawns on his soul , and he *rasps the solution of the problem which had tortured his heart , he too is moved , and in a sort of rapture exclaims , " I have found it , I have found it ! " The me never acts as naked cause , as pure intelligence , nor as pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is . Thought , then , since it implies the activity of the me , implies the me with all its essential attributes . It implies sentiment as well as cognition . The me , it has been shown , enters into every thought as subject . It enters then as a whole , for it can not leave one half of itself behind , and go forth and act with the other half . Thought then covers the whole phenomenon of actual life , and instead of being the product of pure intelligence , it is simultaneously and vitally **25;338;TOOLONG . The various distinctions introduced into the phenomena of actual life by psychologists or rather psycho-anatomists , of facts of activity , facts of intelligence , facts of sensibility , facts of reason , facts of understanding , of a higher nature and a lower , of a moral nature and a religious , however convenient they may be for certain purposes , are really inadmissible , and while they recognize the multiplicity of the me , tend to make us lose sight of its unity . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere of its activity , or tendency of its action . It has but one nature , and it is always by virtue of that one nature it does whatever it does . If a man be base and grovelling in his propensities , worthless or vicious in his life , it is not a lower nature that is at work within him , that is at fault , but the man himself misdirecting his activity ; if he aspire to the generous and the heroic , to the pure and upright , it is not a higher nature , nor a nobler faculty of his nature displaying itself , but the man himself conducting with greater propriety and in stricter conformity to the xviii of his Maker . All the , e distinctions go to destroy the unity of the soul , to perplex and mislead our judgments . The distiucflon which has latterly been contended for between the moral nature and the religious is unfounded . Man is not moral by virtue of one set of faculties , and religious by virtue of another set of faculties . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only difference there is or can be between religion and morality is in the direction man gives to his activity . Nor is there any distinction between the faculty by which man knows what some call the truths of the reason , and what are termed truths of the understanding . There is not a reason taking cognizance of one class of objects , and an understanding taking cobnizance of another . To know may indeed have various conditions , but it is always one and the same phenomenon , and by virtue of one and the same intellectual power . The whole me acts in knowing , // let it know wherever it will , In knowing material objects it uses material organs , but the faculty by virtue of which I know through these organs is , as will hereafter be shown , the same as that by virtue of which I know in the bosom of consciousness itself . The pretence that sensibility is the faculty by which we know material objects , and reason the faculty by virtue of which we know spiritual objects , is arbitrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , our senses would be as the telescope without a seeing eye to look through it ; without sensibility , we never do , if we ever could know , even spiritual truths . To raise men to a perception of what are called the higher truths , it is always necessary to purify and exalt sentiment . Beethoven carries us nearer to God , than Kant or Hegel . Without love man can not soar ; and without that exaltation , that enthusiasm which goes by the name of Inspiration , there are few truths of an elevated nature that are discoverable . Man acts ever with all his faculties , in the least ns well as in the greatest of his actions.
