txt IN 1838 , when the capital of the then existing banking institutions in Mississippi amounted to forty five millions of dollars , the legislature of that state incorporated the Mississip*4* Union Bank , with an additional capital of fifteen and a half million dollars . The funds of this latter institution were not to be furnished by stockholders , but were to be supplied by the state . For this purpose bonds to the amount of five millions of dollars , executed , as we suppose , in the usual form , and bearing date , June , 1838 , were delivered under the law incorporating this institution , by the governor of the state to the managers of the bank . The managers sold these bonds in August , to Mr. Biddle , the president of the United States Bank of Pennsylvania . The credit of this last institution was then unshaken , and these bonds were thrown immediately into the European market , and were there speedily dis posed of to a large amount to purchasers ; a small amount being at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the proper form , pledging the faith of the state on their face , and there was nothing on their face which could induce the purchaser to inquire whether any conditions which had been originally prescribed by the constitution or laws of the state , as precedent to the validity of their sale and transfer , had been in fact complied with . The great body of these purchasers became so undoubtedly bona Jide , buying the bonds at the fair market price , and they were thus as they supposed , both equitably and legally , the creditors of the state . When the interest which was semi-annually payable The signification given to this word throughout the following article , has be . come so popular and almost technical , that no apology is supposed to be necessary for having adopted it here . // upon these bonds became due , the pecuniary resources of the state had become deeply embarrassed , and it was already apparent that her connection with the Mississippi Union Bank was to be disastrous rather than beneficial . Certain of her leading politicians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McNutt , was foremost , soon began to broach and then openly to defend the notion , that this interest ought not to be paid , and that the entire sale of these bonds should be considered fraudulent and void . This was unhappily soon made a party question , and a decided majority of the people of the state were speedily persuaded to sanction this notion . The legislature which was afterwards elected , refused to make any provision for the payment of the interest upon these bonds ; and the governor subsequently declared in a correspondence with Hope &amp; Co. , of Amsterdam , that the state would never pay either the principal or the interest . To this declaration , the state has thus far literally adhered . Events such as these could not occur , without producing a deep sensation both in our own country and in foreign lands . For a state to violate its plighted faith was an almost absolutely unknown event , the Yazoo purchase , in which the legislature of Georgia were the actors , being the only other instance . And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was set , and none of the sister republics had ventured to follow the example , it was universally deemed , as the lawyers say , an anomalous case  --  to be neither defended , nor cited . When then the legislation of Georgia was thus revived in that of Mississippi , and this latter state thus openly proclaimed that the contracts which had been made by one legislature might be nullified by a subsequent legislature , the least reflecting looked on in surprise and perplexity , " doubting whereunto this micht grow . " The first and , as was to be expected , the loudest of the complainants were the purchasers of the bonds . These , as has been already said , resided principally in different countries in Europe , and they were composed of persons of every condition in life . Among them were literary men , officers on half pay , and other persons whose resources were limited , most of whom bad bought these securities with as full confidence in the safety of the investment as if they had been depositors in a savings bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relying on the good faith of the state ; they had made a fair market purchase , and as confidently expected the interest to be paid as do the creditors of the national debt of England . And when their debtor , the state of Mississippi , in the exercise of her sovereign pleasure , had thus pronounced her own public acts to be void , and had proclaimed her own bonds to be nothing better than brown paper , it was not strange that they should denounce these prnceedings as a system of fraud . What participation , they exclaimed , could be charged upon them in any unfaithfulness or bad management of the agents who had originally disposed of the stock ; and what was this pretense of the state , but a mere cover for its own dishonesty ? Nor was the feeling of our own citizens any less equivocal , so far as it found expression . One mode of utterance has been that of the press , and its voice has been that of almost uniform condemnation . Party spirit seems happily to have slumbered upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple standard of right and not by that of momentary expediency , and they have come accordingly to the same conclusion . Several of the legislatures of other states have also adopted solemn resolutions , virtually // condemning the legislature of Mississippi , and have thus repudiated Repudiation . And no formal , disinterested attempt has been made , so far as we are aware , to defend their conduct . If there have been apologies , they have been offered by the parties directly concerned in these proceedings ; or if others have stepped forward , the very de - fense has shown that the champion was ashamed of his cause . So far as the national feeling can be inferred from such indications , the American pulse has generally beat full and true , the people of Mississippi have been " left alone " with their " glory . " Even in the halls of Congress , not a voice has been raised in her behalf , except by her own representatives . We can scarcely hesitate to assert , that not a native citizen east of the Alleghany Mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his country , has as yet undertaken the perilous effort of defending these proceedings . Every man , except the mere demagogue , has mourned over the reproach which he was con*cious would be thus cast upon the country , and has sought to free himself personally from the stigma , by condemning them . While thus affirming , we are also aware that sinister omens of a similar nature have been subsequently visible in other quarters of our political hemisphere , but the voice of the country has undoubtedly spoken in decisive tones here . So strong has been this feeling , so unenviable the notoriety which the state of Mississippi has thus acquired , that her estimable citizens must have often blushed to be recognized as such in other portions of the country . And the public credit of the state is destroyed . Let her now attempt to obtain a loan on any security , any pledges whatever that she can offer , and she could not procure a dollar . A town pauper 's promissory note would be regarded with as much respect by our moneyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still more decided has been the condemnatory voice from abroad . The great bankers and other large dealers in public stocks in Europe disposed of the Mississippi bonds , with the same confidence in the good faith of the state which they had so often previously given to that of the United States , or of the crowned heads of Europe , when concerned in similar transactions . The Barings of London , the Hottinguers , and the Hope &amp; Co. ' s of the continent , doubtless as little anticipated that the bonds which they transferred to purchasers would be ever declared void by the state of Mississippi , as they anticipated their own personal repudiation of debts which themselves had contracted . When then her legislature refused to pay the interest upon this debt , what other epithets could these " merchant princes " who give the law to commercial credit and character throughout Europe , attach to the state and her agents , but dishonest and fraudulent ? And the different nations of Europe , so far as they have become acquainted with these transactions , have hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the French , or the Dutch , have spoken , it has been the same . And were this reproach confined to the people of Mississippi alone , who could have felt surprise or regret ? But instead of state dishonor , it has become national dishonor . Most of the inhabitants of the different countries in Europe , even those of England , are too little acquainted with the peculiar structure of our national and state governments , to be cornpetent to distinguish between them ; an Austrian and a Parisian , nay , many a London merchant and knight of the shire , are as unable to separate the two as to define the jurisdiction of the different popular tri // bunals of ancient Athens . And the enemies of free institutions , even where well informed upon this subject , have been ready to blend the state and the nation together . Here was one of the united republics of North America publicly falsifying its own acts , violating its own engagements , and this was warrant sufficient for an outcry against the whole . Here was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained , and this was sufficient occasion for the friends of despotism to exclaim-Punica Jides ! Perhaps no single transaction has ever equally soiled the brightness of our national escutcheon , as seen by men on the eastern side of the Atlantic . Defects , or incongruities , in our system of government would by many be overlooked ; the republican directness , if not bluntness , of our manners would be pronounced characteristic ; even the dark blot of Southern slavery might be partially veiled ; but a direct refusal by one of our states to pny the debt which her own legislature had contracted , admitted of no apology , no explanation . This is not the language of exaggeration . The English presses during the last two years have been speaking more indignantly and bitterly than this . And our own countrymen , whether residing or traveling abroad , hear similar remonstrances and reproaches . Till within a few years , an American traveler needed not but to proclaim his country , to secure consideration wherever he went , even though personal good will might be withheld . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and he is often constrained to blush when he avows his native land . lie may tell the true history , and then insist , that as a citizen of Massachusetts , or Connecticut , or Ohio , he is not responsible for the misdeeds of a state at the opposite extremity of our vast country-that national character is not to be thus forfeited . And he may be civilly heard , and the devoted friends of free governments may accept his explanation , but with most of his auditors this plea will not avail . It is easier for them at three thousand miles distance to confound than to discriminate , and they have chosen to pronounce it all a national act , by which every American has been dishonored . And the wound thus given to our honor has equally reached our credit . As the state of Mississippi has disabled herself from obtaining the smallest loan here at home , so neither other states whose credit is here unshaken , nor the United States , can now procure a loan abroad . Successive attempts of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ineffectual . Foreign capitalists will not undertake to dispose of stock , for which foreign purchasers can not be found . We view personally these proceedings of the state of Mississippi as unjust , as a direct breach of her plighted faith , and as therefore only dishonorable to her character . We deem every defense of this doctrine of repudiation , if we may term it a doctrine , as nothing more nor less than a justification of public fraud . Every legislature , state and national , is thus invited to break its solemn contracts , whenever it may be inconvenient to fulfill them . Let such transactions be only regarded with indifference ; let any language respecting them except that of condemnation become popular , and we shall soon behold their frequent repetitioa through the Union . True it is , as has been already remarked , that the legislature of Mississippi have as yet found but few responsible apologists ; but true it also is , that in other states which are burdened with debt , repudiation has been broached as the only available policy . Indiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Maryland the measure has been so warmly recoinmended // as to excite disquietude , and the course of Pennsylvania also has been sufficiently equivocal . While professedly denouncing repudiation , her legislature have made no provision for the payment of the interest due upon her public debt for the last year . Fearful of the effect upon their own popularity , were a system of direct taxation to be adopted , or otherwise criminally insensible to the duty of preserving inviolable the faith of the commonwealth , they have adjourned , and left their most momentous trust unperformed . Are not these occasions for alarm to every thoughtful mind that loves its country ? Are not such clouds om* inous of a tempest that may hereafter sweep away the very foundations of our national polity ? And if but a tithe of such apprehensions is warranted , a somewhat free examination of the subject may be seasonable in the pages of the New Englander . We shall accordingly consider the most plausible defenses that may be offered for these proceedings of the state of Mississippi , and after having exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are intimately connected with the general subject . One defense which , we fear , is secretly deemed by many as valid , although few are as yet hardy enough to avow it , is this that a state , a legislature , is not subject to the moral laws which bind individuals . This would be termed , substantially , a plea to the jurisdiction inforo conscientia ? ; it denies that a political body is morally amenable . There are few indeed , even among the veriest demagogues and their partisans , who venture openly to assert this principle ; but is not the number of those who have privately espoused it rapidly increasing ? The tendency of our free institutions , under the working of that depravity which is natural to man , is , as every attentive observer has noticed , towards the side of licentiousness , and never towards that of restraint . The danger ever is , that the standard recommended will be that of expediency , and not that of justice . And when men , whether they are legislators or private citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are members is sovereign , that it is independent , not only of foreign governments , but also of the United States , except within the granted powers of the constitutiUn , it requires no great increase of self-complacency to believe , that the state and those who represent its sovereignty are virtually independent of the moral law . What other explanation than this needs be given of the unquestioned fact , as melancholy as it is notorious , that the annual sessions of Congress , and of many of our state legislatures , are notorious for their corrupting influence upon the communities in which they are held ? Men who , as private citizens , show some regard to personal character and to public opinion , often become regardless of both when sent to Washington , or to the capital of their own state , to aid in making the laws . The law has exempted them from all responsibility to man , for aught which , as legislators , th ey may say or do , and this they construe as a release from all accountability to God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last twenty years explicable on this principle ? Have not many acts of obvious injustice or impolicy been passed , and many a demand of equity refused or neglected , under its sway ? The practical conviction of the legislator has been , that his personal responsibility was at an end ,  --  as a public functionary his private character was for the time lost , or himself , as a unit , was merged in the multitude by whom he was surrounded . This is an opinion which has been every where rapidly gaining ground , and , as the consequence , whatever may be the proceedings of a legislature , there are many who are more or less // ready to justify them , or , if this can not be decently attempted , to refrain from condemning them . Who can doubt that the repudiation of Mississippi was thus vindicated by multitudes of her own people , or that there is a secret willingness felt by many in every other portion of our country , to advance the same plea ? But what shall be pronounced as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moral laws which bind individuals ? The citizen or the subject responsible to the government of God , but Congress or the despot not responsible ? We have but two questions to ask here . Has God prescribed moral laws for the obedience of man , and if so , which of those laws releases the ruler from obedience , while it binds the ruled ? Even the infinite Lawgiver himself is pleased to observe the very laws which he has given to his creatures . His adherence to justice , to truth and faithfulness , and to every other moral obligation , is perfect and unchangeable . If the legislature of Mississippi could thus violate the plighted faith of the state , they might on the same principle disregard every other act of former legislatures ; they might destroy all the rights which had been thus vested , and overthrow all preceding legislation . Here was a contract into which their own predecessors had deliberately entered , entrusting to them the work of providing for its fulfillment at the due time . What could they plead , either in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state consitution , or in the laws of God , which could release them from the performance of this trust ? If not bound sacredly to observe every moral law , that of justice for example , then they were bound to observe no such law . In the exercise of their own supremacy they might rightfully enact that every man wearing a cocked hat should be capitally punished , if they might rightfully nullify the contracts of their predecessors . The absurdity and the criminality of such a principle are so obvious , that a formal reply appears like an impeachment of the common sense and morality of the reader , and yet we deeply fear that its hold upon multitudes is too strong to be thus shaken . The legislative omnipotence , or the power to pass any laws whatever , which Blackstone virtually ascribes to the British parliament , many of our legislators are assuming as their own prerogative , so far as the constitution does not sternly prohibit them . They are answerable to no human tribunal , and the only question which they feel constrained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not whether it will be right , but will it be popular ? It was popular in Mississippi , for the moment , to refuse to pay the just debt of the state , and her legislature refused accordingly . And were it a popular measure throughout our country , to exclude that state , by an act of legislation , from our Union , Congress might , on the same principle , enact that all her people should be henceforth hewers of wood and drawers of water . Never can the prince or the president or the senator escape from the least moral restraint , until he can escape from his personal identity . His artificial public relations are but a mere robe which never hides his personal character , and they only augment his responsibility before the last tribunal . A second defense ,  --  and it is that which was publicly advanced at the time , and that on which the main stress has been placed ,  --  is this : that the sales of the state bonds by the agents were vitiated by their unfaithfulness or their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may be compelled occasionally to use somewhat technical language , but we shall adopt it as rarely as possible . According to the allegation of Governor McNutt , in his celebrated reply to Hope &amp; // Co. of Amsterdam , these bonds were delivered by him to the managers of the Union Bank , under his express directions that they were not to be sold at less than their par value , and only for cash , and this the law which gave the bank the credit of the state , also required . They were in fact sold by the agents of these rnanagers to the president of the Un*ed States Bank , on credit , for the same amount to be paid in five equal annual installments , two millions of which , however , were paid within the first six months . These bonds were then sold in the market in the United States and in Europe , and were made payable at the agency of the United States Bank of Pennsylvania in London , in sterling money , and with interest there payable semiannually . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank and their agents , of these directions of Governor McNutt , and their equal disregard of the provision in the law just specified , and of an article in the constitution of Mississippi , forbidding the passage of any law authorizing a loan of money on the credit of the state , which are alledged as a justification of the subsequent measures of repudiation . The plain and decisive answer by the holders of these bonds to this plea , is its utter irrelevancy . How can their rights be lessened by any thing which occurred between the governor of the state and the managers of the Union Bank , six or twelve months previously ? How could they , by any possibility , become acquainted with the verbal directions respecting the sale of the bonds , that were then given by the former to the latter ? Whether these were legal or illegal , whether he had attached two conditions or forty , or none whatever , to the transfer , was immaterial to them . As little force has the allegation that the bonds were not sold at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law and the constitution required both . How could purchasers in London and Amsterdam know that such was the requisition , and that it had been disregarded by the mnnagers in the original sale ? All that they knew or could be supposed to know , was what was legible on the face of each bond itself , and on its back ,  --  the one being the engagement of the state of Mississippi to pay the sum of money there specified , the other naming the place of payment and the currency in which payable . Neither of these furnished any hint of the existence of what is thus alledged as a defense ; neither directed the purchaser to make inquiry as to the laws and constitution of Mississippi , prescribing the original mode of sale ; all was in the common form of similar securities . The purchaser bought them for a fair price , relying on the express promise of the state , and the state gave him no reason to suppose that the whole transaction a/i ' ovo usque ad mala was not constitutional and legal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be finally detrimental to the Union Bank and to the state ; if these agents were equally unfaithful and dishonest , the purchasers may still reply , " What is that to us ? These are matters between the state and its immediate agents , with which we have no concern . Punish these agents , as criminals , if dishonest ; hold them responsible in their private estates , if unfaithful ; but refuse not to pay us , honest creditors in Massachusetts and New York , and in Europe , on such allegations as these . " Still more evident is the irrelevancy of this defense , when we consider the original design of the issuing of these bonds . This was to procure a banking capital for the Union Bank , by pledging the faith of the state . The bonds were to be executed in due form , and were then to be sold , on purpose to procure that capital from the moneyed world , which Mississippi could not herself furnish . It // was one mode of procuring a loan on the credit of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5,000,000 . And had these qualifications respecting the sale of ' the bonds for cash , and at par value , been incorporated within the bonds themselves , so as to constitute a part of their tenor , no sale could have been ever effected to the amount of a single dollar . Not a purchaser in the United States or in Europe would have parted with his money , when , as a preliminary matter , he was thus informed that the security which he was invited to buy would prove worthless , unless it should appear at the time of maturity that these precedent conditions had been all complied with . When public stocks are transferred , no buyer thinks of first sending an express from London by a Liverpool steamer , or from New York by a rail-car across the Alleghanies , to the state of Mississippi , that he may first ascertain whether some unknown law or article in her constitution has been exactly obeyed by the state commissioners of the loan . State bonds and state credit would have but little to do with " cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above a minus quantity , if such were the condition . This professed justification has so little speciousness , that Governor McNutt , when alledging it to Elope &amp; Co. at a distance of five thousand miles , must have felt that all this wide interval was needed to screen him from their indignant looks and exclamations . Were the state of Mississippi a natural instead of a corporate person , a brief dialogue between these two parties would be in somewhat of the following strain : " Is that seal yours ? " would be the first interrogation propounded by the Amsterdam bankers , after taking up one of these bonds and pointing to its face , and her republican highness would be constrained to answer , " Yes . " " Was it originally issued by your own agents ? " would be the second question , and the reply must here also be in the affirmative . " The interest upon it has been now due for three years and more : will you pay it ? " would be the third query . And here " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one answer . Her incompetent or knavish officers she might indeed punish as they should deserve , turn them out of her house , expel them from her broad farm , confiscate their property , if they had any , and thus make them a terror to all future evildoers ; but her own just debts she must pay . Still a third defense , or semblance of defense , may be alledged . The state of llississippi was utterly unable to pay either the principal or the interest of these bonds , at the time when the latter first became due ; and she was thus compelled to refuse payment by absolute necessity . We suppose that this allegation is partly correct . The capital of the banks and of similar institutions existing in that state at the beginning of the year 1838 , amounted , as was observed at the commencement , to forty five millions of dollars ; and in addition to this enormous amount , the Union Bank was then incorporated with a capital of more than fifteen millions of dollars , which the state undertook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , whose population then exceeded that of Connecticut by a fraction only , and whose pursuits were almost wholly agricultural , attended probably with a still larger issue and circulation of bank paper : - what but a degree of ignorance in her successive legislatures , amounting almost to fatuity , could have created these institutions ; what but unmeasured borrowing , and then reckless expenditure , and then a general inability to pay , and then an all but universal bankruptcy , must have been the speedy result ! This fearful reaction had commenced before the onginal // sale of these bonds , and when the first payment of interest became due , the clouds were still blackening ; and had a demand been then made upon the state for the payment of the principal , to meet it would have been a literal impossibility . But the interest only was then payable , no part of the principal falling due before 1850 , and sorely crippled as was her strength , it is probable that this additional burden could have been shouldered without staggering . No pretense to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cited , and by this document as the plea of her chief executive officer , may she be fairly tried . The annual payment of but a twentieth of the amount of the principal , for the interest was but five per cent. , would have preserved untainted the credit and the character of the state ; and what efforts should not be put forth by any community to prevent the sacrifice of these priceless jewels ! The demagogue who panders to the basest passions of the populace , would indeed be recreant in such an emergency , and so would many a timid legislator who is honest in his private dealings ; but no man of strict integrity could hesitate . But admit that the payment of the interest was then impracticable , suppose that the state was for the time bankrupt ; what then ? Does this justify repudiation , or the refusal ever thereafter to pay any portion of the principal or interest ? Yes , just so far as the present insolvency of a private individual is , ipso facto , his final release from all indebtedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , which is to be denied to the debtor citizen ? The remedy , originally granted by the constitution to the private creditor of summoning a state as an individual before the national tribunals , has indeed been taken away ; but his rights are not thus divested , he has but lost the most effectual means of enforcing them . The indebtedness of the state , legal and equitable , evidently thus continuing , and thus irremovable by her own act alone , with at the same time an admitted inability to pay ; - are we asked , what should have been the course of her legislature ? The answer is obvious . First , to affirm the sacredness of the claims of these bond-holders to the full extent , principal and interest . Secondly , to proclaim the fixed purpose of the state to pay the interest at the first moment practicable . Thirdly , to give every bond-holder the proper additional security for the interest already due . If in addition to these primary measures , the legislature had at once entered upon a system of rigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposed some tax , however small , for the payment of the interest , all would have been then accomplished which could properly be asked . Scarce a foreign or an American creditor would have then parted with these bonds at a sacrifice , the faith of the state would have been untarnished , the character of the nation would not have been lowered abroad before friends and foes alike . And far more than all these , the first step in the beaten road of dishonor might not have been yet taken . Mississippi repudiation , with all its existing evils , and these are fearful indeed , is still to be dreadedmainly as a precedent . It is the first stain on a vestal 's fame : all was spotless before , but there is now a broad leprous spot  --  the harbinger of widely spreading disease . And there is the greater cause for fear , when we consider how peculiar is the sympathy which pervades the population of a great republic . Their very equality , their unrestricted intercourse with each other as individuals , their union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act in all public matters as parties , or masses , rather // than singly , are all auspicious in some emergencies , but they are ominous of fatal danger in others . Let but a foot of our soil he invaded , the heart of the nation heats high with patriotism , and the glow is felt at the most distant extremities ; and let but the doctrine of repudiation be adopted by two or three of our state legislatures , and no statesman can assure us that other states will not also enter on this precipitous path , until half of the Unioa may be seen hastening in company to dishonor and bankruptcy . Here , as in numberless other cases , communities , like individuals , are more easily persuaded to do wrong than to do right ; to break their faith , than subsequently to make full restitution . " Facilis descensus Averni Sed revocare gradem-hoc opus . " It is this fearful sympathy , this almost universal tendency to act in all public matters as communities or parties , rather than as individuals , which constitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his personal responsibility , because he acts with a great party ; public opinion is his opinion , and immense numbers rarely think of adopting any other standard . With such persons the inquiry is not , what does justice require in the particular case ; what does the will of God evidently prescribe ; but what has the legislature enacted , what ha* our party pronounced ; what is the course of public opinion ; what do certain political presses declare to be true , or expedient ? And when the answer is given , the question , however momentous , is in their view settled . There may be troublesome misgivings long afterwards , and under better influences many may be led to retrace their devious steps ; but they move at the time as men are borne along in the midst of a mob , to adopt incastires and do acts , from which , if alone , they would have tremblingly recoiled . Perhaps not one tenth of the legislature , or of the people of Mississippi would have approved of the repudiation of these bonds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but as soon as a few of her leading men had boldly recommended it , and the flame had begun to spread , all resistance became for the time hopeless . Her governor then affirmed , and the state has thus far sustained him in the affirmation , that Mississippi " will never , pay the five millions of dollars of state bonds issued in June , 1838 , or any portion of the interest due , or to become due thereon . " And should a majority in the legislature of Pennsylvania , which is to be chosen in the interval between the writing and the printing of these pages , openly espouse this Mississippi mode of dealing with the creditors of a state , then , unless the measure is at once indignantly rejected by great multitudes of the people , and demagogues are for the time terrified into silence , the legislation of that great commonwealth may be made to sanction the rightfulness of state frauds . We say state frauds , because we insist that a state or a nation , when it has once contracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her indebtedness , except by actual payment . We say , if the debt has been actually contracted ; and the fact of indebtedness depends not on the consideration , whether the state itself has received a full equivalent , or any equivalent . If she has induced individuals , within or without her jurisdiction , to part with their own property in consideration of being subsequently repaid by herself , then she is the debtor , and they are the creditors . Whether some articles in her constitution , or some provision in the particular law authorizing the sale of her bonds or other securities , has been observed , or // disregarded , is a perfectly irrelevant question , provided there is no reference to such article or law on the face of the securities themselves : the purchasers have bought , trusting to the explicit promise of the state , and the state can not be permined to assert that the promise is not absolutely binding . Now how can a state , when thus indebted , be ever released , except by a full payment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what is called parliamentary omnipo*ence , may profess to affirm or to nullify the contract , just as they may profess to nullify the laws of Congress , or to release the citizen from the obligations of an oath . On the same principle , a giant may discharge himself from paying the debt which he owes to a dwarf . The dwarf has not sufficient physical strength to compel the giant to be honest , and perhaps the holders of her bonds can find no tribunal that will constrain Mississippi to pay either the principal or the interest ; but when we speak of a release from the obligation of a debt , we refer to some other discharge than that of club law . Right and wrong are still realities , justice-as between individuals respectively , or between a community on the one side and individuals on the otherbas a fixed moral , and not a conventional , meaning ; and we accordingly ask once more , how can a state , when indebted , be ever released , except by a full payment to the creditors ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of utter bankruptcy , alters not the fact of her indebtedness ; she will be justified in not paying while this inability continues , but she is still a debtor , and as soon as her solvency returns payment must be made . We are here arguing , it will be seen , upon the assumption that the rights of the creditor are equally sacred , whether the debtor is a natural or an artificial person , a single citizen , or a sovereign state . And what can render these rights less sacred in the latter case than in the former ? The words , right and obligation , are perfectly reciprocal terms . If a state can sustain the relation of creditor , it can also sustain that of debtor ; if she possesses all the unquestioned rights originated by the one , she can assume all the obligations which appertain to the other . The remedies may indeed be different in the two different cases , but the rights and obligations will be reciprocally the same . Can then the individual debtor be ever released from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creditor 's voluntary relinquishment of the debt ? We know , as who does not know , that every commercial country has its bankrupt laws , and insolvent laws , and statutes of limitation , and we mean not to assert that such legislation is unnecessary ; but what do all such laws truly affirm ? That the debtor has been thus released from the obligation to pay his creditor-is this their declared intention ? Or is it this ; that while the obligation on the one side and the right on the other continue the same , the state will not assist the creditor by the process of her courts to enforce his rights ? It may be expedient for the commonwealth or the monarch to enact such laws , the complicated relations of commerce may render it indispensable , but , as has been already said , these laws take away the remedy merely , they do not and they can not lessen the right nor the obligation . Suppose the insolvent or the bankrupt should again accumulate property ; is he not as sacredly required to pay his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sense to discharge him ? His obligations to his creditors were created by the eternal principles of justice , and not by the acts of a legislature or the rcscripts of a despot ; how then can // any human legislation set him free ? He contracted his debts , not as a mere member of a political society , not as a citizen or a subject , but as a man , as a moral being ; and whence does civil government derive the power , we ask , to extinguish such obligations ? If the state can release him from the duty of paying his debts , it can release him from the duty of speaking the truth ; for the obligations of justice are as absolutely sacred as those of veracity . If it can lessen in the least degree the sanctity of any one right and of it corresponding duty , it can abolish all rights , it can release from every duty . And are we then asked , why , if such views are to be sanctioned , does so much misapprehension on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released from all indebtedness by the operation of these specific laws ? We will give a twofold answer : most men are willing to adopt the laws of the land as their own standard of morality ; and but very few men are strictly , absolutely honest . Twenty generous , kind , amiable persons can be found , as we believe , where there is one strictly honest man . Theirs are the virtues of impulse , or of instinct ; but his is the virtue of immovable principle . Did the limits which we have prescribed to ourselves permit , we could pursue this train of illustration at length ; but we must close . The subject in many of its aspects , is indeed most unwelcome ; but our motto , although we rest on other hopes than those of the ancient Roman , is- " never despair of the republic . " Mississippi herself appears to be awaking , slowly indeed , to a recognition of the dishonor which she has thus attached to her own name . So large a body of her ciizens are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will ere long , as we trust , become the majority . And the justice , the equity , of the whole matter is so apparent , that even her partisan politicians must in mere shame retrace their own footsteps , when the tempest which they have temporarily excited shall have passed away.
