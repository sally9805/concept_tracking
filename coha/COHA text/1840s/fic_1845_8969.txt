Thus , while fond Virtue wished in vain to save , Hale , bright and generous , found a hapless grave ; With Genius ' living flame his bosom glowed , And Science charmed him to her sweet abode ; In Worth 's fair path his feet adventured far , The pride of Peace , the rising hope of War ; In duty firm , in danger calm as even ,  --  To friends unchanging , and sincere to Heaven . How short his course , the prize how early won , While weeping Friendship mourns her favorite gone ! Pres. Dwight 's Conquest of Canaan , Book I. DRAMATIS PERSON . Nathan Hale .

Officers , Servants , &c.; Main text ACT I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Battle at Lexington ; a Citizen in the Chair ; meeting already organized , and subject under discussion . First Speaker , First Speaker ( a timid man. )  --  My friends , let me say a word after what has been spoken ; though I do n't like what the British have done before now , yet war is such a dreadful thing , I can not think about it . O how many have been killed ! And what shall we do ? What shall we do ?  --  for one , I say , let us submit ; for if we resist , there will come such dreadful war  --  our sons will be called away to be killed , and our houses burnt up . We had better be oppressed some than be shot down ; fellow-citizens , we had better stop , or we shall be all killed . Second Speaker . Second Speaker  --  This is a time for every body to speak out his mind : but I hardly know what to say ; I do n't like this oppression , but I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies are scattered , separated by mountains and great rivers , and under different governments  --  nothing can be gained by these little riots , and how can our forces be combined ? And if all did get together , the English arm could crush us . I do not , I never did love the old British Lion one bit , but I am afraid of him , for if we fight with him he will tear us . My advice is , what ca n't be cured should be endured . Third Speaker , Third Speaker ( an important Squire. )  --  Fellow-citizens , we are here on a great occasion ; most as great as the Town meeting when news came about the old French war . I was one of the speakers then , for I always loved my country , and was ready to do anything I could for her except fight . I never could fight , because the smell of powder made me sick , and I had sprained my ancle when a boy  --  but I was ready to say all I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word now . I love my country , as I said , and am glad to help her any way but fighting ; I wish the glorious sun of freedom might rise and shine on us all . If powder did n't trouble me so , and if I had n't sprained my ancle thirty years ago , may be I would go and fight myself ; but , my friends , let me urge you all to go ; go serve your country , make her free , and immortalize your names . Some one Some one aside .  --  The old Squire is ' mazin cute ; that lame foot is a lame excuse ; he likes to talk , but wants others to fight  --  powder smells so bad ! ha ! ha ! good , but he can go out gunning a whole day and shoot woodcocks ; must be British powder , with a bullet before it , turns his brave stomach ! Fourth Speaker , Fourth Speaker ( a Lawyer , intelligent but fearful. )  --  Gentlemen , fellow-citizens , the oppressions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul to think that we , come from the Plymouth Pilgrims who fled injustice , should have it pursue us to this wilderness home , they scarcely dead ! And more  --  these , we may well fear , are only the beginnings of evil . What we can do I see not ; it seems our fate to be oppressed , and we must make the best of it . To resist the mighty mistress of the ocean seems too fool hardy . She has at her call provisions , arms , money , and men , to any amount  --  can flood us with hired Saxon soldiers  --  with the great rough foot of war she can tear up our fair soil , our towns burn , our ships sink , our citizens butcher in our streets , and strip from us every shred of freedom . Our own town may yet suffer , and yonder fort at Groton resound , it may be , with the groans of some of us , inhumanly butchered within its walls . Could I see in resistance any chance of success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw off this yoke  --  but the struggle seems too desperate . By rebellion we shall only give our tyrants an excuse for binding us with heavier chains . This present evil let us bear , waiting patiently till we have gained more strength  --  then , at some time , an hundred years to come perhaps , our children may achieve that for which we are now too weak . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  Friends , too young to teach , I would rather learn from your experience  --  but a full bosom will have utterance  --  a bosom full of a sense of wrong received at the hands of a cruel mother country , which , instead of nursing us in our infant weakness , has rather fastened on us like the horse leech , to suck our life blood . The last breeze has just come heavy with the noise of weapons and the work of death . At Lexington now , the ground is red and wet with the blood of our brothers , spilt at their own doors  --  and why spilt ? Because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses ; because they began a resistance to unjust taxation , which we must all make , or become the poorest slaves . The voice of these brothers ' blood calls to us from the ground  --  let it not call in vain . Yet none can fail to feel the force of what you have spoken , worthy friends . Danger surrounds us , we must give battle to the greatest nation on the globe  --  but what is the alternative ? ' t is to lie down an easy prey to royal swindlers , who will drain our purses to fill their own ; it is to be crushed slaves , to wear our chains , and leave to our children after us the base inheritance . This is the true question ; shall we , in view of it , submit , or rise and do our best at resistance ? Several voices . Voices  --  Submit no longer  --  let us resist , cost what it may ! Hale . Nathan Hale  --  Aye , let us resist , let us be men . They that oppress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ; but we are not powerless  --  we can count ourselves by millions , three millions : if in all these bodies beat the hearts of the Plymouth Rock Pilgrims , England could never conquer us ; ' t is not numbers , but courage we want . Besides , braver soldiers never carried guns than ours . How they showed their mettle in the old French war ! At Braddock 's defeat , the Colonial troops , under Col. Washington , saved their British protectors from destruction . But further , we are at home , and to fight for home . And then above all , there is a just God who will befriend us , and raise up helpers . We are told to wait , but we must not wait  --  every day the chain grows heavier . We have waited  --  we have remonstrated , and the answer has been a standing army to keep us from doing worse . When shall we be stronger ? When in every town there is a garrison ? Friends , we must resist now or never ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a standing army will seize us by the throat , while she robs us of our birthright as men . And besides all , to look back it is now too late  --  the war is begun  --  our brothers have taken the field  --  we can not leave them to stand alone  --  even to talk of it is to desert them . Think of it , ye sons of noble sires ! British balls have already drawn blood from American hearts ! British swords have already mangled the flesh of our victim brothers , and another breeze will bring tidings of new bloodshed to your ears ! While they are suffering there , shall we sit counting cost and labor here ? No , we must rise and help them , though all perish in the attempt . Soon as possible let the regiment be under arms , and march to the place of strife ; let such a wave of opposition flow from all parts , as shall show the invader we will not bear wrong , that while life remains we can not be enslaved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and set apart my life and strength to the liberation of my native soil . The sword has been drawn ; away let the scabbard be thrown , until the proud bird of freedom , bearing the olive-branch of peace , alight upon its hilt . Fifth speaker , Fifth Speaker ( a solid farmer. )  --  Though I am a plain man , yet I do love the soil I till ; and this advice is what strikes me as just right ; from the whole land let one loud note of opposition be heard ; let it echo from town to town , from house to house ; it will frighten the enemy and cheer ourselves ; old as I am I will march right off , and with my brave young countryman here do my best , or die in trying to do it . Many voices Voices  --  Agreed  --  agreed . Chairman . Chairman  --  Let the regiment muster to-morrow at nine o'clock ; till then we adjourn to make preparation . SCENE II . School room  --  several lads present . Enter a lad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Several . Several  --  No , what is it ? First scholar . First Scholar  --  Why , the British have been killing a great many people in Lexington ! Second scholar . Second Scholar  --  Killed them ! Why , what for ? First scholar . First Scholar  --  For nothing only because they would not pay taxes to old King George . Third scholar . Third Scholar  --  Well , I wish the good-for-nothing old red coats had staid at home , to mind their own business . What right have they go to come across the water , and worry and kill our people ! Fourth scholar Fourth Scholar enters .  --  Hurra , boys , no school to-day ! Master is going away . I went to town meeting last night , and Master Hale made a tearing down good speech  --  he stirred them all up , and they are going right off to help the Lexington folks . Father has got out his soldier coat and cap and sword  --  uncle Bill 's cleaning up his old musket  --  Lawyer Brown , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training horse  --  every body is awake , even old Sam Jackson says he ca n't mend shoes any more , he means to fight for freedom ; and Master Hale says he ca n't stand still and see his friends shot ; so he means to start right away . First scholar . First Scholar  --  How I do wish I was big enough to go along , and fight the old red coats ! Enter Hale . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  Good morning , my dear boys ; to-day there will not be any school . I go away , and never may see you again perhaps . I love you all , and have with pleasure instructed you , but can teach you no more ; you know how some of our people here in New England have been killed by British soldiers , and everybody who can must go to stop this enemy . Much as I should delight to remain here with you , my country calls me to another more toilsome post . Second scholar . Second Scholar  --  I wish you could stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , we all love you . First scholar . First Scholar  --  Yes , that we do ; and we do n't know but they will kill you too , and we shall never see you again . Third scholar . Third Scholar  --  And if they should kill you , how sorry we should all feel ! Hale . Nathan Hale  --  True , my dear pupils , I may be slain , but I hope not ; yet at any rate , if I knew I must die , still must I go , and act the part of a true son to my suffering country . Fourth scholar . Fourth Scholar  --  Dear teacher , I wish I could go along and help you . Others . Others  --  So do I , so do I. Hale . Nathan Hale  --  Well , you must wait a few years , and you will then be old enough , and strong enough , to fill the places of the fallen : for a long while , for years to come , this war may not be ended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zeal and courage in a cause so good . And in peace or war , my boys , never forget this is your country ; the land of your birth ; your forefathers sleep in its bosom ; feel that you never can do it too much good  --  whether it reward you or not , do it all the good you can . If this war end , then live to make your country happier and better . This foe conquered , strive against others  --  vice , intemperance , and irreligion . Many can huzza for liberty , and boast of love to their country , whose manner of life and speech are every way corrupting  --  but do you have its welfare at heart . Lead others to ways of obedience to law , to justice , to honesty and virtue , by walking in those ways yourselves  --  for while these things prevail , freedom will live ; but the murky air of vice and crime will stifle her . Let the nation 's sons be enslaved to corrupt passions , and they will be easily enslaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my boys . We may never meet again on earth  --  may we all meet in heaven ! Once more , I say , live for your country , serve her while you live . and dying bequeath to her the rich legacy of a good , a noble example ! Fourth scholar . Fourth Scholar  --  We shall try to remember , dear teacher , all you have said . Hale moves to go . Third scholar , Third Scholar ( following him and grasping his hand. )  --  We will try to do it , to grow up good men , that we may be good citizens . First scholar . First Scholar  --  But I am very sorry you must go away . Hale . Nathan Hale Dear boys , I am sorry ; it is hard to leave you , but I must begone , and so again , farewell . Goes out , the boys following close . ACT II . SCENE I. Hale Nathan Hale enters .  --  My excellent father , how shall I bear to leave him ! He has cared for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age ! though his noble bosom will give but one response to my request , yet doubtless conflicting feelings have banished sleep from his pillow the whole night long ; my hardest trials are yet to come  --  to part with such a parent ; and with her , the fair and fond maiden whom I love , and to whom my troth is pledged . But here comes some one else . ( Enter Adkins. )  --  Good morning , cousin Samuel  --  are you prepared to start with me in this good cause ? Adkins . Adkins  --  Well , no , Nathan , I do not think I am . Why shall I fight against my king ? We have enough to eat , and to wear  --  houses good , and farms  --  are we not now happy enough ? our king is as good a king as I want . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  To be sure now we have all these comforts of which you speak  --  but how long shall we have them , is the question . If the king would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist , not aid rebellion to his authority . Look at the measures which he has urged for now a quarter of a century . Carried out , they would make slaves of us . Hear him calling for taxes we had no hand in voting ; see him enforcing the call with bullets and bayonets , when we made bold to remonstrate at the foot of his throne . England , Scotland , and Ireland are represented in Parliament  --  but we , bone of the English bone , are shut out  --  Parliament makes our laws , and votes away our property without a check  --  yes , to save its own purse , it may vote away these very houses and lands of which you just now boast , and leave us beggars  --  nay , slaves . Adkins . Adkins  --  O ! well , it has not done that yet ; when it does , it will be time enough then to resist . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  But it has already begun  --  look at the tax on every drawing of tea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tell me what is all this , but voting away our property without our consent ; and if it would take one dollar thus , then why not every dollar ? Adkins . Adkins  --  O ! well , we wo n't be scared before we are hurt ; wait till something worse is done , and then it may be I will rebel . I have no notion to risk being shot without good cause . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  Wait ? waiting is ruin ! would you say to your brother , wait till the lion has his paw upon your throat , and then seize your rifle  --  wait till some savage foe has bound you hand and foot , and then defend yourself ? Why then tell us to wait till our task masters have bound us , and made us unable to resist ? Resistance now is in our power  --  made now it will save us  --  but delay will only rivet heavier fetters on us ; a licentious soldiery will live upon us , and feed at our tables , while they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never . Now let a valiant blow be struck by her every son , and America is free . Adkins . Adkins  --  Well , it is a fact , there is something in what you say  --  but you know that to jump out of the pan into the fire , is a very poor trick . As colonies , we have now the king 's protection : standing alone , France and her Indian helpers will overwhelm us with ruin . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  The king 's protection ! that is rich ! we can lose all he ever did for us , and not lose much . If he would he might befriend us greatly , but he will not . It was the king 's authority that drove our Pilgrim sires from their homes , nor did he aid them in their perils till the hope arose that they would yield a revenue . In the French war of ' 56  --  England 's own quarrel , not our own  --  when that torrent of French and Indians swept over us from Canada , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No !  --  he sent just troops enough from home to see ours do the fighting , and bear away the glory our own valor won . Talk not of kings ' aid  --  so far we have done without it , and still can . Adkins . Adkins  --  O well , Nathan , let that go : but we can not do anything . This little bonfire of rebellion Britain will put out in a year at most  --  will hang the leaders , and let off the rest , perhaps , if they beg for life . Do you take my advice  --  keep quiet in your school , and do n't be anxious to grace the gallows . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  I quiet ! I can not , and will not be , when I hear my brethren battling for the freedom which I love , and count not dear at any cost . My personal welfare is as nothing when the great question is  --  shall the future millions of this wide land be slaves or freemen ? Adkins . Adkins  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckoning ; listen to me , and you will see you are . If you lose , as no doubt you will , in this affair , you will be stigmatized as rebels  --  as rebels be hunted , killed , shot down , or hung  --  in history you will go down as rebels , and that very posterity , the object of so much regard with you now , will laugh at you as zealots , hot headed and crack-brained for freedom . But grant you gain all of which you dream , you will then but have your labor for your pains , and no more . Having spent the prime of life , and wasted your best strength , you will come out from the contest yourself , a man broken in health and fortune , while your countrymen , reaping the profits of your pains and toils and wounds , will forget your sufferings and yourself , and will leave you to wend a weary pathway to an unmarked grave . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  Some children , it is true , forget the parental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants of their waning age . So , no doubt , many will forget us  --  but all will not . Some there will be , many brave men , high-minded men themselves , who never can forget those brave patriots at whose hands they shall have themselves received the rich legacy of freedom . The esteem of such , I covet ; it is worth ambition 's struggle  --  but mere fame , the empty breath of adulation , I do loathe , and most when it comes from those selfish cowards , who only give praise as they get profit . But I have other motives  --  the course I have resolved upon is the course of duty , duty to God , to my country , to the world  --  and whether those benefitted shall ever know their obligation , and knowing it , shall love my memory or not , I shall have done my part , and shall lie down pleasantly to sleep in the grave , not having lived in vain . Adkins . Adkins This all sounds well ; but you are on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are bent on fighting , take sides with your sovereign  --  then will you gain the day  --  then promotion is your 's and a pension . But this wild-goose chase of freedom will , if you fail , bury you in disgrace ; and even if you win , will bring you in only a life-income of poverty and neglect . Exit Adkins . Hale . Nathan Hale A fig for such time serving notions ! With some men honor , wealth , applause , are every thing , their inner and their outer world . For these they live  --  than the puff of noisy breath they know no other motive . But I would rather die for freedom , battling in the last trench , than live to bask in the richest gifts of tyrants . No , give me liberty , to serve my God , to act the man , with a conscience unstained ; and crouching slaves are welcome to gilded robes , high titles , full-handed wealth , and every badge of royal favor , which glitter only to hide from them their real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Deacon Hale Conflicting feelings rack my mind ; within my bosom the parent and the patriot strive to sway the vacillating will . I would save my country , but I would also save my son . The anticipated support of my declining life , how can I spare him ? Still the nation must be rescued from bondage , and rescued by some sons who must leave home and loving friends to brave war 's risks and hardships ; and if some sons , why not mine ? Do I love him dearly ?  --  but so do other fathers love their sons . Have I looked to lean on him when infirm with age ? other fathers have done the same . Let all , because they love their sons , or need their aid at home , refuse them to the country , and who will go ? Then I give up my noble boy  --  the self denying pattern I will set , and lay my son  --  my Isaac  --  on my country 's altar . ( Enter Hale . ) Ah ! there comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , are you well this morning ? Deacon H. Deacon Hale  --  Pretty well , for my years  --  though I have had but broken slumbers through the night . Hale . Nathan Hale I was afraid my proposed movement would wear upon you , and drive repose from your pillow . Deacon H. Deacon Hale  --  It does trouble me  --  you know to ask an aged man , who has passed the autumn and entered the winter of years , to give up the son on whom he looked to lean , is no small demand . I hesitate not because I love my country little , but because I love you much , and much need you here . Nature in her fond weakness will be heard ; for while mine is a patriot 's bosom , ' t is also an old father 's . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  Best of fathers , what a delight it would be to fulfil your cherished hopes , to make return for the long care of youth and childhood ! No gains of wealth , or honor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naught but the sacred cause of country tempt me hence . Deac . H. Deacon Hale  --  Much as I need you , my son , I am well aware that your country needs you more ; for this cause with a melting , but whole heart , I bid you go and serve her . Serve her without stint of body or of mind ; dear as you are to me I give you all up , till the oppressor 's yoke is broken , and we are free ; through all dangers may God keep you . Yes , my son , go , and bear the blessing of a father , who would , if strong enough , go with you  --  and who at home will ever pray the great God for your success , and for your country 's . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  Would there were many such to invoke His aid from whom alone success can come ! Deac . H. Deacon Hale  --  Yes , there our confidence must be placed ; if by divine aid our point we gain , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amid the sunshine of that lawful liberty of which the world has never tasted . But if we fail , then hope 's last ray for centuries departs  --  perhaps forever . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  Father , my lot is hard  --  scarcely , now you have consented , can I bear to leave you ; would that I could remain to enjoy your counsels and example ever ! Deac . H. Deacon Hale  --  So , too , would I  --  but the private wish must yield to public good . Urgently your country calls , and every true son should speed to her aid ; therefore tarry no longer , but hasten to the spot of strife ; enter the ranks of freedom for the entire war ; pay or no pay , for the entire war . There be strong , and show thyself a man  --  before the tyrant cowering never . Think you I love war ? no , my son  --  it is the curse most awful that comes on men ; but come it sometimes must in self defence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the invader must be driven back . As with imprisonment and death society doth punish the single handed disturber of its peace , or slayer of its citizens ; so , when bloody foes band against a whole nation , such nation may , and faithful to itself , it must , withstand these foes , with arms and war . Go then , strong in the justice of your cause , and bear you this my old and trusty sword . Twenty years ago it served the colonies against the French and their savage allies in your father 's hand ; never , while mine , was it drawn in a bad cause ,  --  may it never be while yours ! Hale . Nathan Hale  --  To wield it bravely , as worthily as my father did , shall be my constant effort  --  it will be my hope to bring it back covered with double glory , having in your hand helped to free this land from savage butchery , and in mine from the cruelty of an unnatural mother country . Deac . H. Deacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have had you followed out your own desire , and have proclaimed to men the gospel of the Prince of Peace ; but for the present , at least , this privilege is denied you . Still go where you may , in no place , and at no time forget  --  neither in camp nor counsel , nor in the din of battle , nor in moments of repose  --  forget not you are a christian . Be not a coward , but be not a boaster ; be not too tender to do your duty , but be not cruel ; use the sword as of necessity , and not of choice . As a soldier , temptations will assail you new and strong ; pleasure , passion , ambition , malice , will at once beset ; therefore , in the fore front , bear your christian principles , against which , as on some stout shield , each arrow of temptation shall strike vainly . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  Thanks for such fitting , paternal , christian counsels ; I will bind them to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deac . H. Deacon Hale  --  Come , now for the last time we will break bread together at our morning meal . Then having bid the rest farewell , you shall resume your journey . Good old Cato wishes to bear you company , and I consent . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  One moment , father , and I will be with you . Lo she approaches with whom , a short time , I fain would be alone ! Deac . H. Deacon Hale  --  Ah , Alice ! observing her as she approaches , she to whom your hand is pledged ! My blessing on you both !  --  Son , I leave you , but see you bring her with you to our morning meal . Deacon Hale retires , and Alice slowly advances . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  Good morrow to thee , Alice  --  ' t is sweet again to see you , though , if I could , I would have spared myself with you the pang of a new parting  --  storing in my heart those fond words with which last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I then stole from your flowing locks , as like most young lovers , we sat gilding our bark together for the sea of life . Alice . Alice  --  Gild our bark as we will , Nathan , it is destined , I fear , for a stormy sea . I know all  --  you leave us for war  --  a war to which no one can see an end  --  leave home , kindred , and myself , for a struggle which is so dark , so uncertain , that , in spite of all I can do , it seems to me as if I should never see you more . Hard indeed it is , that now , just when you have begun life so fair , and when I have learned to love you as my own , you should be called off to the fierce scenes of battle , and I be left to mourn not only your absence , but perhaps your untimely loss . Yes , fortify my mind as I may , there will come to it visions of bloody steel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fight , lying perhaps amid a heap of the slain , or perhaps dying desolate and alone on some errand of danger . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  Nay , nay , Alice , I shall be back , I fondly trust , to redeem the pledge I have given you of my deep and lasting love , and to start our little bark happily together on the sea of life . Think how quiet and beautiful this sea will be , when the sons of liberty , who are now leaping to their arms all over the land , shall have driven from its bosom all the pirate ships of King George  --  that tyrant who after in vain attempting to wrest from us our property , is now striving to take from us our lives ! Think how fairly the breezes will blow for us when they come loaded with the air of independence ! Think how sweetly the sun will shine for us when its light is reflected from sea and shore , mountain and valley , rock and river , that are everywhere vocal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , my dear girl , they exist  --  but God blesses a just cause , and gives strength to the patriot 's arm , and covers him often with the gis of safety , and will , I trust , protect and save me in all the dangers I may have to encounter  --  will save me to breathe awhile the loved air of that freedom for which I now go to strive  --  will save me for my country , that I may live for her peaceful service after the war bugle is no longer heard  --  will save me for you , that the young bud of our affection may become the rich and perfect flower  --  though had I a thousand hopes like these , I would give them all , all up to save my bleeding country from its present bondage . Alice . Alice  --  O Nathan , these sentiments are worthy of you  --  so noble , so patriotic ! Would that every man in this land , and woman too , felt and exulted in them as you do ! Then indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be soon gloriously free . Think not I come to blame your choice  --  no , I would not fill your ear with one womanly repining . I know the cause in which you engage is the great , the holy cause of liberty . It is your country that calls you , and heaven forbid that I should lure or warn you back  --  but  --  Hale . Nathan Hale  --  But I am a woman , you would say , and have nourished hopes on which war throws a cloud  --  have looked to love and wedded life , and Nathan by my side , and Nathan side by side with fortune too . For these you have now the pang of parting , and sights and sounds in prospect of blood and carnage , and in their midst  --  myself . Think not longer , loved one , of these things . Think I shall be back again , to love and bless you . Think how , when absent , I shall wear you in my heart , next to my country the jewel that most I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even amid the darkness and dangers of the battle field . Think of the good fame , the love and gratitude , the life of honor and reward , which await the patriot soldier , and love me as such a soldier . And Alice , tire not in your love , as well you know I never shall . Not absence , not your destiny unheard , not charm of fame , not cloud of ill repute , not youth , beauty or tenderness in others , will ever succeed to tear your image from my bosom . Alice . Alice  --  Nor thine from mine , dear Nathan . I pledged you my hand when everything was fair and smiling in our prospects . We have been looking forward to a speedy and prosperous union . These prospects are now darkened  --  this union is now put off , delayed , perhaps forever . But my pledge is given , and shall never be recalled . Think it not a light bubble , to be blown away and dissolved by the first breath of adversity . No , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wherever you go , whatever your fate , it will follow you , and only you . Would that it could go with you with mystic power to guard your life , and like a fairy spell turn harmless from your breast each bolt of war ! Hale . Nathan Hale Fond , trustful , inspiriting ! This is as I would have thee , Alice . It is thus that I would think of thee when I pace the tented field  --  when through the night , from camp to camp , " The hum of either army silly sounds , And the fixed sentinels almost receive The secret whispers of each other 's watch . " It is with the thought of thee thus , following me with your love , and fondly and proudly waiting my return , that I would stir my soul , and nerve my hand in the dark hours of fight . But come , let us in  --  my father waits us for the morning meal , where we will all break bread together . This done , I must take my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retire arm in arm . ACT III . SCENE I.

Besides most valued officers , this defeat has cost twelve hundred men !  --  tremendous loss ! I know not how to spare them  --  and more than the immediate loss , I fear it will greatly damp the half-kindled resolutions of the people . However , let us avert our eyes from this darker side ; the strife shall not be given up ; we have crossed this river in safety , and can retreat much farther should occasion call . Knowlton . Capt . Knowlton  --  Dear General , that is true ; but at times all sides seem dark  --  look on these troops , half-starved , half-naked , unpaid  --  daily their discontent increasing . Look , too , how many citizens accept the offered pardon of the King ; my hope would pine , my courage wither , and heart fail from fear , but for the thought why they are in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cause which incites their bosoms is often all that cheers me ; I think it can not be that these men , goaded by a sense of wrong , and burning to be free , can be put down by any human power . Knowlton . Capt . Knowlton  --  So think I  --  and though for a time clouds bedim our sun of hope , brighter days may come . Dear General , while you lead it shall be mine to follow  --  and while life is ours we will never sheath our blades till victory crowns the struggle . Washington . Gen. Washington  --  I join you in your resolution , and may our countrymen be with us in it ; for we have power ample to shiver this foreign yoke to atoms . Let the nation be roused lion-like from its repose to its own defence , and not all England , nay , not all Europe joined could bind her down in vassalage . Besides , we 've been wronged too deeply  --  spurned too basely ; never will heaven bestow its smiles on those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up . But now the present need claims attention ; Long Island is in our foes ' possession ; where their next descent will be can not be told  --  their plans are all unknown . The call for information is imperative , and but one path lies open for obtaining it  --  this I dread more than all things else in war  --  it is to send a spy . Knowlton . Capt . Knowlton  --  A hazardous resort indeed , but of late it has to me seemed unavoidable . Washington . Gen. Washington  --  ' T is my sole alternative  --  some one must go ! can you tell me who will ? Knowlton . Capt . Knowlton  --  Yes , I will  --  send me , I am at your command . Washington . Gen. Washington  --  No , you I can not spare ; your regiment may have hard work to-morrow . Can you not name another ? Knowlton . Capt . Knowlton  --  In my company , for special service picked , there is a man , wise above his years  --  a patriot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call and he will stop at nothing . He is the very soul of valor ; his name is Hale , a favorite of all the soldiers . Washington . Gen. Washington  --  Hale ? And no less a favorite of mine . Right well know I his priceless worth , having long watched him with interest . Connecticut may well count him among the best of her many noble sons , who at this trying hour shed back a glorious lustre on their native soil . But it will be a dreadful risk to send him .  --  however , do you learn his feelings , and with all despatch inform me . Exeunt . SCENE II . Enter Hale . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  When shall these heavy sorrows of the land of my birth have an end ? When shall her brave sons ' blood cease flowing  --  when her daughters ' tears ! When shall smiling Peace , driven away by an unkind parent , come back again to perch upon her shores ! Alas ! my country ; thy sky is overcast with many a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days  --  thy sufferings will not , I hope , forever be thy children 's theme  --  the time will come when they shall sing with the big hearts of freemen Columbia 's song , hailing with joy , from year to year , the first dawn of thy returning birth day ! And if this may be  --  no matter what the present costs ; well were spent ten thousand lives to purchase such a boon as Liberty ! ( Enter Knowlton . ) Knowlton . Capt . Knowlton  --  Good morning , my dear Hale ; I hope your heart faints not in this dark hour . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  Dark it is , indeed , and my heart saddened by these late reverses  --  still my hope is strong ; may something soon be done which shall cheer our failing spirits ! Knowlton . Capt . Knowlton  --  There is a scheme on foot already , which to carry out I 've called to ask your aid . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  Is there ? well , let me know it ; I love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowlton . Capt . Knowlton  --  The relative position of each army is well known to you : our little handful stand in a crisis of extreme peril . There are the hostile troops by thousands , and there the fleet ready to co-operate ; ruin will o'ertake us , unless we either retreat farther yet  --  or some blow be struck , which shall change the face of war . If possible , some information as to the future plans of our foe must be obtained . To effect it , only two ways offer  --  we must learn from their deserters , or else run the painful risk of sending ourselves an emissary . Well , of the first there is no likelihood  --  many desert from us to them  --  craven souls  --  but none from them to us  --  the second is the sad and sole alternative . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  I understand you ; you wish that as a spy , I should inspect the enemy 's camp . Knowlton . Capt . Knowlton  --  Just so ; it will be an undertaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an even one ; and if you fail , you die . But be assured no reward within the General 's gift will be withheld from you if you succeed . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  Speak not my Colonel , of rewards  --  these may move the base mind , but I have a nobler , larger motive  --  if love for my country will not move me , nothing will . Yet I do shudder at the disgrace  --  a spy  --  a halter  --  a gallows  --  ' t is a fate dreadful to the soldier ! I could lose life or limb in open battle freely ; but to be hung like a dog , to wear a shroud of ignominy  --  to fill a grave of which the tombstone is dishonor  --  who , who can bear it ? Knowlton . Capt . Knowlton  --  Yes , the character and death of a spy well may be repugnant to the soldier . Still our actions take their hue from our cause ; what in our foes would be disgrace , with us would be true honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but through our bosoms burns the love of country . They fight for oppression , we for liberty  --  they would make us slaves , we would make ourselves freemen , and set a glorious example to the world . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  ' T is a sore case truly  --  but give me time to weigh the matter well . Knowlton . Capt . Knowlton  --  Well then , I leave you ; for yourself decide , and let me hear your answer . Exit . Hale Nathan Hale alone .  --  And now , erring and short-sighted as I am , guide me the unerring God , who from the outset can discern the issue ! Dread of dishonor , affection 's bonds  --  these counsel me to decline this office . But here is a nation bleeding  --  groaning  --  perishing ; her claims can not yield . But then suppose this war should fail  --  myself a rebel  --  what could I do for suffering friends ? Perhaps on this point hinges our whole contest !  --  At the worst , should I fall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hold me in disgrace , when that disgrace I risk for them ? Or will my comrades leave my then friendless friends to biting penury ? Nay , let me not for a moment think it of them  --  to the strong claims of gratitude such brave men can not be deaf  --  nor can their sons , unless they shamefully degenerate from noble sires.  --  It comes to this : my own dear land , in time of fearful need , calls for the risk , perhaps the loss of life  --  yes , the disgraceful loss , to save her . Shall she ask in vain ? No ! though grisly death , with hundred perils , block up the path ; though the murky mists of ignominy enwrap the way  --  I 'll enter it , if she but plead ! Begone all thoughts and hopes beside  --  come life , come death  --  come failure or success , I 'll go  --  God is my trust . Exit . SCENE III . Washington sitting at a table . Washington . Gen. Washington  --  How awfully important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interests beyond all computation hang on every passing day and hour . Future ages  --  uncounted millions yet to live depend on me for happiness or misery : upon me are cast all eyes  --  my fellow patriots , my country , wives , mothers , sinewy youths , gray-haired men and children , eager with interest watch my every motion . If by my faithlessness the cause of freedom fail , the present and future will join hands to overwhelm me with reproach , and an unresting conscience with sharper stings will never cease to goad my soul . ' T is the great crisis for this land  --  shall it stand , or shall it fall  --  this will ere long be forever settled . If we succeed  --  then rise , O race of men ! Sunken now far down below the station God designed you for , rise from your degradation  --  assert your rights , your birthrights  --  cultivate and use your noble powers . Broad land  --  mighty land ! rouse up in thy full strength , and rend off this slavish yoke ! to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valiant men , and over rich stored ships issuing from wealthy ports , thy noble flag ; and o'er the early days of happy youth I see science , virtue and religion shedding their joyous lustre . These all are fruits of freedom , and will be lost or won by me . May the Almighty arm uphold me ! Enter Knowlton . Ah , Col. Knowlton ! Pray what is your report ? Knowlton . Capt . Knowlton  --  Sir , on leaving you I stated your proposal to several who rejected it  --  the dark disgrace they could not hazard . Then I went direct to Hale , told him the scheme ; showed him our great need , at the same time owning frankly the peril to himself . In reply , he said all that he feared was the disgrace : but hard as the case was , he would take time for thought , on which request alone I left him . Washington . Gen. Washington  --  Then you have not brought his final answer . Knowlton . Capt . Knowlton  --  O yes ! for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed me ; and ere he spoke a word , on his own placid brow , and in his firm step , I could read the brave decision . Washington . Gen. Washington  --  What ! has he then consented ? Knowlton . Capt . Knowlton  --  He has , sir , and now waits his orders . But what a sight it is ! To behold a man thus on his country 's altar offer up himself  --  the young , the wise , the brave ! He is a rich jewel , and lost I know not who can his worth restore . Washington . Gen. Washington  --  Oh ! so too think I. And were there ought I could resort to else , gladly would I give up this plan  --  too well I love my officers to throw away , or even risk their lives ; but there 's no alternative . However , I will myself repair to his quarters , and try to settle it with him as reason best may dictate . Exeunt . ACT IV . SCENE I. Enter Hale . Hale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly doth it move ! Each moment seems a day ! For since the die is thrown , and go I must , would my departure were this instant ! My nerves are all full strung  --  my mind excited works at its hardest . I can not read , nor write , nor sleep , not sit  --  but would begone , and have the horrid peril over . Hark ! there 's a step  --  Knowlton , I hope , bringing my errand . Enter Washington . Hale Nathan Hale continues .  --  Washington ! my General ! what has brought him here ! Washington . Gen. Washington  --  My dear Captain Hale , I am at once glad and grieved to see you . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  Beloved General , the pleasure of your visit I had not expected . The joy this condescension gives I can not express . Washington . Gen. Washington  --  My young compatriot , say not so . Were you embarking on some enterprise full of peril , would you not look for your father to come and bid you farewell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would expect him ; but then you are so o'erburdened with a thousand cares . Washington . Gen. Washington  --  Still you must know my officers and soldiers are to me like sons and brothers ; they are partners of my fortune , sharers of my toils , members of my family  --  as such , their loss awakes my grief  --  our country , our cause , our aims , our hearts , all one ; they are not my servants , but friends and helpers . With these my true feelings towards them all , and you especially , I could not without an interview let you set out on such a path of danger . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  Dear General , yours has been a father 's kindness to me ever ; and my heart almost breaks to think I may never experience it again ; however , duty now calls  --  delay may prove our injury . I wait your directions . Washington . Gen. Washington  --  To make my designs and wishes known to you was my purpose when I came . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not meet it  --  for the present let us defer the scheme , perhaps relinquish it . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  Oh , sir , do not speak thus ! I am convinced my duty is to go  --  to go I 'm now prepared , with God the issue trusting . What think you ? Shall men whose heads are whitened by the winter of age , shall mothers clasping their infants , helpless children , and chaste , timid maidens , all join their supplications against this cruel enemy , and I stand mute , terrified by danger of a shameful death ? No , sir : give me now your wishes , and let me start immediately . Washington . Gen. Washington  --  Still I hesitate : were you not thus firmly bent , I would not dispatch you . But now take these directions , ( gives him a paper , ) which accomplished , delay not to return . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  If possible , all shall be done . Washington . Gen. Washington  --  And now , farewell ; two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shall pray that God will keep you . Hale .

A few more routs like this , will send them all limping to their homes , no more to growl and dream of freedom , but to pay up their taxes in obedience to their king . I have no idea that colonies planted by our hand and cherished by our care , should refuse to pay for the protection we afford them ; they should pay largely , perhaps all , for the support of our home government . Howe . Gen. Howe  --  True , they should and shall  --  but yet , without great outlay of money and men , they will not soon be subdued ; those stern New Englanders are like the rocks and hills they live upon , invincible ; their spirits will not break , nor even bend .

Marshal . British Marshal  --  No , you sha n't do that either  --  let him be alone  --  and get ready to die alone  --  if it will give him pain . Nobody shall see him till he 's strung up at the end of a rope . I 'll raise him high enough in the world , and give him all the freedom he 'll care for , I warrant you . Good night , Dennis ; sunrise , Dennis , remember  --  do n't sleep too late , or you 'll miss the sport . Exit Marshal . Dennis . Dennis  --  Well , Mr. Marshal , ye 're a cruel bloody unfeelin ' stone-hearted ould savage ; ye 're a proper child of your father , the divil , so ye be . Ye ought to be hanged yourself , ye wretched bloody ould blarrigard ye . But O dear , how can I ever see this man on the gallows , and a rope ' round his fine throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my busom ! dear , dear , what shall I do ? ( walks about . ) By the powers the Marshal said I 'd turn a ribil yet , and I 've a right good mind to agree with him for once  --  ( looks round , ) stop a minit  --  let me see  --  I will , I will , I 'll desart , so I will , and lave this wicked pack , and be gone to the American 's in a twinklin . I 'm lamintin ' how I ca n't see the young man , and spake good bye to him , tellin ' him how he has won me over to the ribils  --  but its no use ; so I 'll jist try my legs , an ' be off for the camp of Liberty  --  and the king may go to Ballyraggit with his tyranny . " Good bye Mr. Marshal , if ever ye catch Dennis O'Flannagin here again , ye may hang him too ; good bye , an ' bad luck to ye , ye miserable bloody villainous unfeelin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Gen. Washington present .  --  Midnight .  --  O Providence ! wise but unsearchable ! Dark and strange thy dealings often seem to mortals whose weak eye can not the future scan ! Yesterday the mid-day sun of fortune shone full upon our arms  --  joyous tidings were borne on every breeze , and hope spread her fair wings as victory succeeded victory ,  --  and soaring , perched upon the very topmost summit of our earnest wishings  --  a full and quick deliverance from foreign thraldom seemed just at hand . But now how changed are all things ! Across that sun there came a cloud , and then another , and another yet , till the whole sky was overcast  --  and then the sun went down , and shadows gathered deep , and ' t is now night , black night . And here , as if to make the midnight darker still , one of my choicest officers is gone . Brave Hale ! Worthy of a nobler doom ! Yet is not thy worth decreased , but rather magnified ; it was thy worth alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare thy pure bosom to receive the blow aimed at thy country ! Enter an officer . Here comes my officer . Colonel , are there any tidings more ? Officer . Officer  --  The sad rumor is too true ; he is gone ... and no hope of reprieve remains . He was the army 's favorite : I could not have loved a brother more . Washington . Gen. Washington  --  Our friends we only value fully when they are gone forever . The noble Knowltown 's heart has beat its last  --  and now his bosom friend , the darling Hale  --  soon will the radiance of this bright gem be hidden in the night of death . But yet he shall not die ; no ! in your heart he 'll live ; he will in mine ; his fellow-soldiers will all love his memory ; and in future time fathers will tell his virtues to their children , and bid them emulate him ; and many a noble youth , reading his history , will feel his soul enkindle with a generous fire of patriotic love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it ; nay , the page that tells his country 's history will borrow lustre from the record of his worth . And perhaps some monumental stone , raised by his loving countrymen in after time , will proudly lift its summit , gilded by the tale of his immortal virtues and untimely death . We can not give him aid now in his hour of woe ; him , therefore , let us imitate ? Officer . Officer  --  I trust we ever shall , and feel ourselves spurred on to nobler efforts in the same good cause by his example . But , Sir , the sentinels have brought in a man from the British camp who longs to see you . As I entered he was at the door ; I bade him wait till my return . Will you see him , Sir ? Washington . Gen. Washington  --  If you think proper , bring him in , for during this sad night I can not sleep . Exit Officer . Officer Officer brings in Dennis .  --  This , Sir , is the man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honor of spakin ' to Giniral Washington ? Washington . Gen. Washington  --  That is my name . Dennis , Dennis ( aside. )  --  St. Patrick ! I thought I 'd be plased with the man , but now I 'm sure I shall ! Washington . Gen. Washington  --  My good friend , what have you to say to me ? Dennis . Dennis  --  Why an ' it plase yer honor , long life to ye ; I 'm a poor Irishman : I kim over the water to fight for the king  --  but yer riverance , indade they be so cruel in hanging that poor young man that has fell into their bloody hands , I ca n't abide with ' em any longer at all , at all ; so ye see , yer honor , I jist took a mind to rin away and lave them , the unfeelin ' villains . Washington . Gen. Washington  --  Well , you are welcome , friend : and may be you can give some information . Dennis . Dennis  --  Arrah , Sir , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy for ye ; I know a dale about ' em the British ; besides a good dale more I do n't know , plase yer honor . Washington . Gen. Washington  --  Then you mean to be a soldier of freedom , do you ? Dennis . Dennis  --  That 's jist what I do , Sir , if yer honor will permit me . Washington . Gen. Washington  --  You are most welcome then ; this gentleman will provide your quarters , and to-morrow let me see and question you . For the present we must prepare some last sad rites in honor or of the lamented Hale . Exeunt . SCENE III . Hale alone , sitting . Early dawn . Hale , Nathan Hale rising .  --  Well , for the last time I have laid down and sweetly slept , and wake refreshed ; soon to lie down again , in the grave 's cold bed , and sleep till all awake to sleep no more . ' T is the last morning I shall spend below the skies . Eyes ! look your last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stream , whose every forest , rock , and shore , shares my warm love : death now will veil them from your view ere long ! O my loved country ! is it reality ? or do I dream that I must leave thee ? Thy freedom yet not won ; thy foes so many and so strong ; thy friends so few , and each one dying to thee a loss ! Merely to die is nothing , for the firm confidence with which my soul hangs on that Saviour , at whose holy altar I once hoped myself to minister , removes all fear , and rather makes the summons welcome , as a call to brighter realms and higher joys ; but the thought that I no more can help this bleeding land , nor prop its failing fortunes  --  this is my grief , my bitter grief . And then my aged father , how will he bear the tidings that his son has fallen ! May the divine arm be underneath him ! And she too , to whom my heart is pledged  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrill they haunt my memory now  --  " if thou unfaithful prove , my hand and heart shall never be another 's . " I have been true ; still I am hers , and she still mine ; and through her life she ever will be mine , her lone heart the casket of its own pure grief . God ! in thee may she a helper find ! Thus country , father , and my Alice , from you all I part  --  thus  --  but there comes the sun , bringing the fatal hour , and lo the marshal and his troop ! Enter marshal and soldiers . Marshal . British Marshal  --  Come now , Captain Freedom , the sun 's getting up , and it 's time for you to appear ; all hands are ready and waiting for you . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  They shall soon be gratified , and you not delayed . Marshal . British Marshal  --  I wonder now , Captain , if you do n't wish you 'd staid at home , and not made us this visit ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came ; though I regret the issue . Marshal . British Marshal  --  Well , now , do n't you think you rebels are in a bad business ? a poor half-starved , half naked crew ; you ca n't conquer ; you might as soon think to bail out the Sound with a pint mug  --  and if you should , you ' ll never gain any thing ; better all come over to the king 's side , as I did . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  Yes , and lick the hand that bruises you . Away with such coward meanness . The day will yet be ours  --  we shall be freemen , and though one half should perish in the effort , this would be a thousand thousand times to be preferred to living all in bondage ! Marshal . British Marshal  --  Well , you may believe all that , but I sha n't . Come now , get ready ; I 'll wait no longer . Hale . Nathan Hale  --  And now farewell to father , friend , and hold compatriots ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyrant power , but destined soon thyself to crush it  --  covered now with clouds , but sure of a bright morning  --  to thee , my loved , my cherished fatherland , farewell ! Would that I had another life to give thee ! Yes , to my brethren now struggling in the field , to the unborn millions who from this land in future shall send up their orisons of praise for liberty and independence ; to all who , free themselves , shall think of those who made them so , and bless me too , perhaps , among them , as a martyr-patriot ; to them all  --  now when death looks me in the face , in shape the most appalling , yet unappalled myself , and true as is the heaven in which I trust  --  these parting words I leave for legacy : Would that I had another life to give thee , O my country ! Joy it would be to live and nobly strive for thee  --  but other , wiser , braver friends , my death may raise up for thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrongs  --  his strong arm will save ! In his hands I leave my spirit , and leave thee ! Exeunt slowly .
