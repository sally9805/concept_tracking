txt /z/ The present little volume is intended , with one which preceded it , to form part of a descriptive history of the Progress of Civilisation , as far as it can be made interesting to Juvenile Readers , in a series of sketches of the life of races existing at present in various stages of advancement . In choosing a subject of this kind , I fear I am , in some measure , running counter to the fashion of the day , which , in direct opposition to the " useful knowledge " system of some years ago , seems inclined to receive with &vor; only what is , or claims to be , " imaginative , " and to reject all dealings with " matter of fiwst . " It is , however , precisely because a cultivation of the imagination  --  - of a sense of the beautiful and poetical , is of the highest value , that I regret the adoption of what I believe to be the surest method of extinguishing it . If we look into the history of those YUl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fullest and most brilliant development , we shall oflenest find that the contrary coarse has been pursued . The plainest and simplest aliment is likely to produce the soundest mental health ; and as poetry , the brightest flower of the human intellect , springs mostly from the most vigorous soil , the most thorough mental cultivation is probably the surest way to the attainment of the appreciation of poetical excellence . /z/ The condition of those whom we call savages , the lowest and rudest condition of human society , in which men live like the wild animals by which they are surrounded , merely on the precarious products of the chase , or what the earth untilled brinj forth , is one evidently not intended to be lasting ; but merely , like the period of infancy , to be a passage towards another and better. * For this progress , however , some communication with people in a superior state seems to be necessary , just as a child , for the development of his faculties , needs the instruction of those older and better informed . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of no instance in which nations have advanced quite unassisted to a higher stage of civilisation . The first inhabitants of the earth , we are told , enjoyed the advantage of direct communication with beings of a higher /z/ order ; but that is no longer necessary now , when nations exist capable of leading forward the younger branches of the human &mily.; It is a great step towards improvement , when men discover , that instead of killing and cTevouring immediately every animal they meet with , they can secure a far more plentiful and certain subsistence , by keeping flocks and herds ; that it is better to protect and cherish , than to injure other creatures . This state , which is called the pastoral Ufe , is generally found to be the easiest transition from that of the savage , and it is not till a still further advance has been made that men begin to cultivate the ground . When Julius Caesar first came to England , he found that the more civilized inhabitants of the southern parts of the country had abundance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; whilst the people of the midland and northern countries , who were in a much wilder state , lived only on their flocks and herds . With most of the nations of Europe , and the natives of temperate climates , this has been found to be the case ; but in many tropical countries the soil is of such abounding and exuberant fertility , that the slightest cultivation is sufficient to raise from it a plentiful supply of food  --  and this is , therefore , the readiest means for them to resort to , when , as the numbers of the people increase , the wild animals and spontaneous productions of the earth are no longer sufficient for their wants . The situation and character of some countries lead their inhabitants , in the first instance , to trade and barter . The bread-fruit and cocoa-nut tree to the islander of the Pacific  --  walrus teeth f /z/ and furs to the natives of the Frigid zones , afford the means of baiter with other nations for hatchets , nails , or whatever else they may require ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from savage life . Where , as in Central Asia , there are great grassy plains which affird abundant pasturage for cattle , and are extensive enough to allow of removal whenever it becomes scarce , the pastoral life is mostly continued for a very long period ; and this , though at first appearing as an advantage , has really been an obstacle to the improvement of the people who inhabit them , by afibrding a temptation to perpetuate a wandering mode of life . The industrious cultivation of the ground first really puts an end to barbarism . When a man has made himself master of a little spot on which he has bestowed care and toil  --  has built himself a fixed habitation , surrounded by fields and plantations  --  grounds to which he becomes attached by his remembrance of the past , and his hopes for the future  --  he soon begins to perceive the benefits of peace and order and mutual helpfulness , as welT as of law and government , as a means of obtaining justice ; and thus is laid the foundation of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an improvement of which we can see no end . /z/ Of all races of men who have passed the stage of merely savage life , the pastoral tribes of Siberia are , perhaps , in the poorest condition ; and when we consider the character of their country , and the terrible severity of their climate , we shall , perhaps , rather feel surprise that they continue to exist at all , than that they have not made greater progress . In some cases , indeed , their difficulties appear to have been insurmountable ,  --  for some tribes have died away altogether , and others have sunk back from the condition of the herdsman , to that of the hunter and fisher ; but this decline has mostly been owing more to the ill-judged measures of the Russian government than to natural obstacles . These are , however , great enough . In the dreary plains over which they wander , winter , the sternest and most ngorous , reigns during nine months of the year . In January , the intensity of the cold makes it difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the denizen of these polar regions , withdraws from the open plains , southward to the deepest recesses of the forests of birch and pine , and stands there torpid and motionless , as if deprived of life . The air is so sharp , as to occasion a most painful sensation in the throat and lungs ; the breath in the nostrils of horses forms icicles , so that , if not relieved , they would be in danger of sufifocation ; and the evaporations from their bodies are instantly converted into millions of needles of ice , that fill the air around them with a crackling noise . The frost bursts asunder the thick trunks of trees , with a report as loud as that of a cannon ; splits the soil into yawning chasms , through which water sometimes rushes up from great depths of the earth , to be instantly converted into ice ; rends away masses of rock from the cliffs of the arctic shore ; and extends its influence even beyond the earth , for the deep blue polar sky , with its hosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which their light is scarcely seen . Yet this terrible season is chiefly regarded as the most favorable time for travelling , for the surface of the ground is then hard ; while in summer there is often just warmth enough to convert it into an almost impassable swamp , by thawing it so far , that the horse 's hoofs sink through upon the perpetually frozen soil beneath . What is called the summer seems , indeed , often the drearier season of the two ; for over a /z/ great part of Northern Siberia the vegetation of the finest months of the year produces nothing more than a pale moss , which serves as food for reindeer . Further south , a few stunted plants make a faint struggle for existence , willow bushes put forth little wrinkled leaves , the banks which slope towards the south assume a greenish tinge , and in June a few berry-bearing plants blossom ; though even then an icy blast from the Arctic Sea will often destroy these blossoms in an hour . In July the air is clearest , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the shape of millions of musquitoes , which darken the air , and oblige every one to take refuge in the thick and pungent smoke of fires made of moss and damp wood . Even at this season , also , violent tempests and snow storms are of fi-equent occurrence on these unsheltered wastes ; and the traveller who thinks himself fortunate to find a refuge from them in some one of a few ill-built wooden sheds , which have been erected by the Russians at great distances from each other , often runs no little risk of suffocation from the smoke of his fire being driven in upon him from every side by the furious gusts of wind . The desolation of this icy wilderness is , however , in summer , relieved by the abundance of animal life . Not only wolves , bears , and arctic foxes , but sables , squirrels , and wild reindeer , in countless thousands , /z/ quit the shelter of the woods , and come down to the open moors ; eagles , owls , and mews , pursue their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in building their nests ; the ground is alive with snipes and snow fowl ; and the nomadic herdsmen come down with their reindeer to the sea-shore . In a country so extensive as Siberia , the scenery is of course not all of the same character . The southern districts abound in thick forests of birch , willow , juniper , maple , lardh , and other large trees ; and numerous little lakes , of the most regular oval forms , lying sheltered among their high wooded banks , the mirrorlike stillness of their sheltered waters , broken only by the occasional splash of the startled wild-fowl , have a very pretty effect . In these districts , also , are found several kinds of fruit ,  --  raspberries , blackberries , bilberries , currants , a species of cherry , and the nut of the Siberian cedar , which is much valued ; and the short but powerful summer covers the ground with flowers and aromatic plants . The principal pastoral tribes of Siberia are the Yakuts , Yukagirs , and Tungusians , whose only wealth consists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle . Of these the reindeer is the best adapted to the climate , requiring no shelter , finding its own food , and affording not only milk and meat , but , in its skin , bones , horns , and sinews , excellent materials for tents , clothing , and many kinds of utensils ; standing /z/ therefore in the same relation with respect to utility to the Siberian herdsman , that the buffalo does to the Indian of the North American Prairies , but with the great difference in favor of the former , that he has his herds of tame reindeer always at hand , while the Indian is dependent for the buffalo on the perils and uncertainties of the chase . Oxen give much trouble to their owners , as they have in this country to be fed on winter provisions for many months , and this can not be collected in sufficient quantities without many long and toilsome journeys . The dwellings of the wandering inhabitants of these desolate regions are of two kinds . In summer they are light , circular tents , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and covered with birch bark , which they strip in large sheets from the trees , and after softening them by boiling , sew them together . The outside being white and the inside yellow , these yurts have a very pretty appearance , looking , at a little distance , like tents of white canvas . The Yakuts sew the sheets of bark together , with thin cord made of horsehair , and sometimes ornament them by embroidering them along the seams . The Tungusians have also summer tents , covered with cloth or matting ; and those whose possessions are numerous , build little huts in the forests , where they leave behind such articles as are required only in the winter . During the summer , these tribes roam incessantly /z/ about in search of the finest pastures ; and , while their cattle are feeding , occupy themselves in collecting the requisite store of winter forage : but as the severe season approaches they return to the borders of the rivers and lakes , where they generally erect the more solid habitations , which are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often stout enough to last several years , being only abandoned in the s-ummer . These are huts built of thin boards in a pyramidal shape , and covered thickly on the outside with branches , grass , and mud . The snow is piled up high around them , to protect them from the piercing winds ; and two apertures are left for windows , which are covered with fish-skin , or thin plates of ice , and admit a scanty light . The floor is of beaten mud , and round the walls are banks which serve for sitting on during the day , and sleeping on at night . Outside is a shed for the cows , when there are any , although , in very cold weather , they are sometimes brought in to enjoy with the rest of the family the warmth of the fire , which is kept constantly burning ; but the horses are left to shift as well as they can for themselves . The insides of these jrurts are usually so extremely filthy , that the presence of the cows is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode of preparing their food , the wanderers of the northern woods and plains contrive often to make the keen frosty air almost as serviceable as fire . They cut in the autumn , long , thin slices of beef , and /z/ hang them on a sort of wooden scaffold , prepared for the purpose , where they are completely exposed to the action of the sun and the frost , and are not considered ready for use till the following spring . By this time , it is scarcely possible to guess of what substance they consist ,  --  the fat having assumed the appearance of snow-white wax , and the lean looking , when cut , smooth , hard , and shining , like glue , and tasting , it is said , quite as if it had been cooked . Fish is also frozen for winter use in pits prepared for the purpose , and , as among the Laplanders , a great deal is smoked . Whatever is eaten fresh , is usually prepared in the same primitive manner as in the Brazilian forests , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a fire ; but among all northern nations , the most common mode of cooking is that of boiling in a stone or iron kettle . The flesh of the reindeer , with the addition sometimes of a little salt , or a few roots , makes the principal food of these people , although it is sometimes varied by the introduction of some peculiar dainties which we would rather not describe . Some are in themselves disgusting , and some are made so by the manner of their preparation . Fortunately for travellers , who may be compelled to partake of the hospitality of a Yakutian hut , milk , either fresh , or prepared in various ways , forms a very important article in their housekeeping . The simplest plan of preparation , is that of pouring it into an open vessel , and /z/ leaying it to freeze , in which state it is chopped up and distributed like cheese , and even serves as a sort of money to exchange for other commodities . Cheese is made into large flat cakes of about half an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drink consist in the liquor remaining after the cheese and butter has been made , the broth from the meat kettle , and snow water . Brandy is of course welcome when it can be obtained , but the Yakuts know no method of preparing it ; and in making the well-known liquor called " Kumys/ ' from mares ' milk , they fortunately do not understand , as the Tartars do , how to give it an intoxicating property ; so that , as used by them , it is an innocent beverage . The accounts of the prodigious quantities of food that these people can consume at one time , appear so siirprising , that only the concurrent testimony of all travellers who have ever visited them , could render them at all credible . Both the Yakuts and the Tungusians make it a principle , it seems , to eat whenever there is food , and never to suffer anything which can possibly be eaten to be lost . A Yakut is also very liberal in his estimate of things that can possibly be eaten , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and similar delicacies . The pedestrian traveller , Captain Cochrane , once observed a Yakut child crawling on the ground and scraping up , with much relish , the drops of tallow grease that had fallen from a lighted candle . /z/ He offered it a whole candle , and it was eagerly devoured ,  --  a second , and a third ; several pounds of frozen butter , and lastly , a large piece of yellow soap , until the Captain desisted from his experiment , in the fear of committing murder . In confirmation of his statement , the Russian Admiral , Saritcheff , mentions that on one occasion , when an immense quantity of food had been eaten by the Yakuts who accompanied him , they nevertheless complained of the scarcity , and one of them asserted that he was in the habit of dispatching in the course of twenty-four hours , the hind quarter of a large ox , twenty pounds of fat , and a proportionate quantity of melted butter for drink . The Admiral feeling naturally some doubts of the truth of this assertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess of a thick sort of porridge , made of twenty-five pounds of rice , boiled with three pounds of butter , to be got ready for him ; and the man actually consumed the whole without stirring from the spot , or betraying any other sign of inconvenience than a somewhat increased corpulence . It is but justice , however , to remember , that these poor gluttons are extremely good-natured and hospitable , and always willing to share with a stranger the food , of which they stand in such need themselves for the satisfaction of their formidable appetites . These instances of gluttony , also , are related of such as had been exposed to frequent danger of famine , from the /z/ arbitrary interference of the Russian government with the mode of life that best suited their situation . The natives of Siberia , notwithstanding the many difficulties they have had to contend with , have for centuries past enjoyed the advantage of occasional commimication with nations more advanced than themselves . They have never been so isolated from the rest of the word as some races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of the primeval forests of America . From the earliest times , traders from the south have traversed their country in the search after fossil ivory , and the gold of the Altai Mountains , and have brought among the Siberian tribes the knowledge of metals , and of conditions of society different from their own . The severity of their terrible climate , where a constant battle with the elements is necessary to maintain mere animal life , and which would task the resources of civilized people to overcome , has probably prevented their more rapid advances ; but there are many important differences between the condition of these tribes and that of the absolute savage . In the first place , they have found means to secure a plentiful subsistence , and sufficient clothing and shelter . In their treatment of their women , they show far more gentleness and himianity ; they have a greater variety of ideas , and more activity of mind . The necessity of counting their flocks , has brought /z/ with it a considerable knowledge of numbers ,  --  at least as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habit of traversing extensive districts in search of pasture , in the absence of other guides , has led them to find their way by the stars , for the observation of which they have often ample opportunity , whilst , like the shepherds of old , " keeping watch over their flocks by night . " A traveller* inquiring of one of them if he knew what hour it was , was answered very correctly , that it was very late in the evening , but not yet midnight . The Yakut said he knew by the constellation of the Great Bear , which he called the Elk : that at sunset , at that time of year , the tail of the animal stood much higher than its head ; that at midnight they were on a level , and that at sunrise , the head would be by far the highest . To us , a clock that varied continually , according to the season , would appear exceedingly inconvenient . The position of the stars , which at one time would show midnight , would at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what meant half-past one o'clock in the morning at one season , would point to six at another ; so that no little observation and calculation must be requisite , to make even a tolerably accurate estimate of time by such means . /z/ In the intercourse between these people and the Russians , a kind of cypher writing has been invented , which they perfectly understand . It consists of six different kinds of figures , denoting various quantities of skins and their value ,  --  from five kopecks ( a small copper coin ) to a thousand rubles . During the negotiations , these cyphers are written down on paper , but the natives afterwards cut them on pieces of wood , and preserve them , as memorials of their trading transactions , in their huts . The first dawnings of poetry and the fine arts may be discovered , under however rude forms , amongst nations in the very earUest condition ,  --  among mere savages ; but these Siberian tribes not only turn into a kind of song any occurrences that strike the imagination or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a wild beast , or the desertion of a girl by her lover ,  - -  but they tell long stories , which , in many points , resemble the fairy tales still in use amongst us , and show notions of various things ,  --  such as walled towns , armor , &c.,;  --  never seen in their own country . We hear of gold and silver , of saddles and bridles , of houses and pillars of steel ; but there is an attempt to produce an efiect by enormous exaggeration , such as we almost always find in the stories invented by children , or childish nations . We are told of places so far oflF , that an eagle might fly seven years without stopping before he reached them ; of archers so skilful and /z/ Strong , that they can send an arrow through nine hills at once , and so on . The character of these stories generally confirms the opinion entertained by many travellers , that the races of people now inhabiting Northern Siberia once dwelt in more pleasant and fertUe regions , and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tartar conqueror . The Nomadic races of Siberia exhibit a nearer resemblance to a regular government than any savages . They are divided into clans , of which the eldest member of the family is usually the head , or chief , though in some cases a person is elected to fill the office ; and the possession of numerous flocks and herds , of great personal strength , extraordinary stature , or of a high reputation for wisdom will obtain this honor for an individual not belonging to the tribe . He is not chosen , as among most of the hunting nations , for the temporary purposes of war , which is of extremely rare occurrence among these people , but for the sake of maintaining some kind of order in the society . He interferes to settle disputes , to punish offences , and to maintain such laws or settled customs as exist among them . The inheritance of a father is divided amongst his sons , on whom devolves the duty of maintaining the mother and daughters . Should there be no sons , the widow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property of the nearest kinsman . As these tribes are in general strikingly free from /z/ the propensity to theft , so frequent among mere savages , disputes are not of very frequent occurrence . Where there is any difficulty in discovering the truth of an accusation , the chief may administer an oath , for which there are several forms . Sometimes the accused party stands forward , and , holding up a knife towards the sun , exclaims , " If I am guilty , may the sun cause disease to rage in my entrails , as if a knife were plunged into them . " Another form is for the accused to mount certain rocks ,  --  such as the celebrated cliff on the shore of Lake Baikal , and utter aloud the wish , that the loss of children , or cattle , death , or some other misfortune , may fall on the speaker , if what he utters be not the truth . A still more solemn form is to make a great fire , slaughter and roast a dog before it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sprinkled with the blood of the animal , may wither away like the dog , if he is speaking falsely . Duels were formerly common among the Tungusians , in which arrows were exchanged , and many formalities observed ; but these now only take place in secret , as they are apparently discountenanced by the Russians . Murder is not considered as a disgraceful offence , but the murderer is punished with blows , and compelled to maintain the family of his victim . Theft , on /z/ the contrary , is highly dishonorable , and is often remembered through the whole life of the offender . In the religious system , if it may be called so , of the Tungusians , we still find the Schamans , or conjurors , whom , under one name or another , we meet with among all nations in a rude state . They represent themselves as foreseeing the future , as interpreters of the will of the invisible powers , and mediators with them for less favored mortals . The deities recognized by the Tungusians are , first . Boa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and deputes all care of human affairs to subordinate agents . He knows all things , but never concerns himself about any , although he is benevolent ; never punishes any one ; and if men implore his aid , will dispose the inferior deities in their behalf . As no one has ever seen him , no image can be made of him , but the Schamans , who boast of possessing his favor , will sometimes bestow his name on a figure made to resemble themselves . The lower gods are partly good , partly malevolent . The former are seen in the heavenly bodies , or in various natural phenomena ; but there is no instance of the deification of any mortal , or of what is called heroworship . The sun , which is the most distinguished among these subordinate divinities , is frequently in oked and worshipped , in the form cvf an idol of wood or tin , with a human face . The moon and the night , from /z/ whom come dreams , are the next in dignity . Of the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protecting spirit , which has peculiar influence over his destiny . Rings , made of tin , are worn as symbols of these ; and the clouds , the rain , the hail , the rainbovr , the storm , the wind , are feared as well as thanked for their benefits , although never represented . Dunda , the earth , is a beneficent being , who bestoi ? vs all on man , although both she and the god of the waters , to whom fish are sacrificed , are compelled to endure the abode of evil spirits within their bosom . There are also gods of the mountain and forest , of the chase , and of health , of reindeer , of roots and flowers , of children , of women , and of the interior of the tent or home of the family . The evil deities are appointed to punish the wicked , in which office , as they take a pleasure in it , they sometimes exceed their commission . Over perfectly good people , indeed , they have no power , but these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on terms of great intimacy with the Schamans , who have , according to their own account , much to suffer from them , but for the price of this sufiering , gain vast stores of knowledge . They are exceedingly numerous , filling all the earth and the waters , but have no power over the life of man . The Tungusians look for another life , but expect that it will be merely a continuation or recommence- /z/ ment of the life of this world , and , therefore , place weapons and various utensils near the bodies of the dead ; bijt they have no fears for the future , saying they believe every man is as good as he can be . The idols of tin or iron in use among these tribes , are said strikingly to resemble the antique bronze ones found in Italy , and now preserved in the Vatican , and at Florence ; they are very rudely made , having often , when the human face is to be represented , nothing more than dots for the features , and a straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  bears , swans , geese , and ducks , &c.,; since these are supposed to be pleasing to the gods , who often appear in their forms . They are made by the Schamans , who wear great numbers of them dangling to various parts of their dress , and sometimes as many as ten will be hung about a single yurte or tent . In general there are few distinctions of dress among these tribes ; for where the climate is so severe as to overcome all minor considerations , there can be little or no choice . Reindeer skins , and different sorts of furs , are both more easily procured than any other material , and the only ones that would afford sufficient warmth . But the Schamans , aware of the effect of strange and peculiar appearance in impressing the imagination , have contrived for themselves a very striking costume . They wear three or four broad bands of iron across the /z/ back , furnished with rings , to which idols are attached , as well as to broad collars round their necks , and round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also covered with pieces of iron or tin , and decorated in a similar manner ; figures of large spiders or scorpions serve the purpose of buttons , and stuffed snakes hang down , by way of tassels . The sacrifices are offered at night , in the interior of the yurte ; and all who are to take part in them being assembled round the fire , the sorcerer prepares his tools , and begins his operations . The most important instrument is the magic drum ,  --  so much in use , time out of mind , among the witches of Lapland . It is made of an oval shape , about three feet long , and with a skin stretched only over one side , and a shallow brim ; so that it is more like a tambourine than what we call a drum . On the skin are painted various figures ,  --  stars , birds , snakes , and others , and it is struck with a flat stick . After this instrumental performance has continued some time , the Schaman begins to sing without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise man leaping all the while , and his tin idols and other trinkets making a prodigious clatter . When an animal is to be sacrificed , it is slaughtered by the Schaman , and the skin and some of the bones often hung up in the forest , on a sort of scaffolding of cross poles , to which a dead swan or duck , with outstretched wings , is fastened . Sometimes certain ani- /z/ mals are consecrated to the gods ,  --  the fact being pointed out by a piece of red rag attached to the ear or mane ; and , in some instances , the whole herd is thus devoted for a certain period , during which it is lawful to use their milk , but not to kill any of them . Since the mode of life , and the manners and customs of the native Siberian races are mostly such as have been in some measure forced upon them by the circumstances of their climate and condition , it is not likely they should be able to make much progress without the assistance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it is rather unfortunate for them that the Russians , by whom theii country has been conquered , should be , of all the nations of Europe , the one least capable of affording it . The blind have to lead the blind , and the injudicious and tyrannical proceedings of the Russian government , instead of helping forward the rude tribes of Siberia , have , in many instances , driven them back from the pastoral state to the wilder condition of the mere hunter and fisher . Some tribes , whose fires , it is said , were once as numerous along the banks of the Kolyma " as the stars of heaven , " are entirely extinct ; and districts , where five hundred miles may now be traversed without the sight of a human inhabitant , are shown , by the numerous tumuli , or grave hills , to have been , at no very remote period , * the dwelling-place of a considera- /z/ ble population . Stem and repulsive as the aspect of the greater part of Siberia is , also , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north to south by gigantic rivers , connected together by a net-work of small streams , such as scarcely any other country in the world can boast , and by means of which , rapid communication might be opened between different districts . The establishment of a few steam-boats on these rivers , would infuse new life into all the countries they traverse ; and even the desolate north possesses , in its vast accumulations of fossil ivory , the tusks of a huge animal called usually the Mammoth , and in its countless swarms of fish , something to exchange for the welcome produce of the south . There is evidently no inaptitude in the natives for receiving instruction ; they are mostly lively and intelligent , and possess an acuteness of the senses , which often supplies the want of advantages enjoyed by more cultivated nations . An instance of their astonishing power of sight is mentioned by M. Anjou , in the case of a Yakut , who pointed out to him the planet Jupiter , and said he had often seen that blue star swallow a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing that he must , without any telescope , have observed the immersion and emersion of one of Jupiter 's satellites . The natives found farthest to the north are wonderfully insensible to the cold , frequently setting off on long journeys with no other defence against it than their /z/ ordinary clothing , lying down to sleep at night in the snow with their feet towards a fire , their upper garment pulled off and thrown over their shoulders , and not unfirequently their half naked bodies covered with a thick hoar firost . All travellers concur in praising the goodness and kindness of disposition evinced by these wandering Siberians , and one instance of it , mentioned by Admiral Von Wrangell , does not seem unworthy of a place beside the well known and much talked of instance of generosity in Sir Philip Sidney at the battle of Zutphen . A party had been sent out into the Tundra , under the command of one of the Russian officers , M. Matiaschlin , and had suffered severely from hunger . ** By my reckoning , " he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , towards which we began our march , travelling on foot through ravines and over rocks , for twenty-five wersts , when we were too much exhausted to go further . A fire was lighted , and the kettle hung over it as usual , but we had absolutely nothing eatable to put into it . Whilst we were gathered round it in silence , one of the Yakuti called me aside , and taking a wild duck out of his haversack , unseen by the rest , he told me he had killed it with a stone , when he was behind the rest of the party . * There , ' said he , * take it , and eat it alone ; it is too little to do good to us all , and you are very tired . ' " /z/ It would be well for the civilized Christian nations of the earth , if such a spirit of disinterested charity and kindness , as dictated this offer , were common among them . /z/ The most complete examples of th full development of the pastoral mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be found among the nations of the Mongol family who occupy the Steppes ,  --  immense plains , or long waving hills , covered with rich coarse grass , which stretch like a broad belt across Central Asia , from the Caspian Sea to the Pacific , with so little interruption , that it is said an ox might eat his way through it quietly from Russia to China . It is a table land , appearing mostly like plain to those travelling upon it , but in reality of great elevation ,  --  often as much as ten thousand feet above the level of the sea , and rising in a succession of broad terraces to the foot of the Himalaya range , which contains the loftiest mountains in the world . No other country appears to offer such facilities to the occupa- /z/ tion of the herdsman and shepherd ; for besides its almost boundless extent of pasturage , it is the native home of nearly all the most useful species of animals  --  the ox , the horse , the camel , the goat , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have proceeded originally from these regions or those bordering upon them ; and as long as the inhabitants find abundant space and means of support for their countless flocks and herds , it does not seem very likely that they will exert themselves to change a mode of life , which they and their forefathers have followed from the earliest times of which we have any record . There is much , also , in the nature of the country , which , by inducihg them to wander perpetually from place to place , opposes obstacles to their further progress . Its great height and openness , and the general absence of woods , expose it to great extremes of heat and cold ; and to escape , as much as possible , from the suffering occasioned by these vicissitudes , it is usual for them to spend the winter only in the southern , warmer regions , to move northwards as the spring advances , to the colder climates , where grass is still abundant , even in the month of June , and in the hottest season of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible , for the low swampy lands on the banks of rivers or lakes . Other races , which have depended on their flocks and herds for subsistence , without having been compelled /z/ to this perpetual changing of their abode , have in time begun to improve the country ,  --  to dig wells , to drain marshes , to make water-courses , to build houses , and erect altars and temples to their gods ; but none of these useful labors , excepting only the first , to which they have been absolutely forced if they would not die of thirst , have these wandering hordes ever performed . Nothing like agriculture can be said to exist among them ; for though a few small patches of land , near the rivers , are sometimes roughly tilled , to raise a little millet or barley , it is done only by the women , or the very poorest classes , and never thought of as a regular occupation . They have , therefore , little or nothing of the love of country which is the beginning of so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like other nations , have , as we have said , remained nearly in the same state for thousands of years . Not only do all the races occupying these countries at the present day , and called by so many different names ,  --  Mongols , Kalkas , Tartars , Eluths , Kalmucks , and Ogars , resemble each other most closely , both in personal appearance and habits of life , but they have no less likeness to the Barbarian races , who overran Europe fourteen or fifteen hundred years ago . The description given of the person and tent of Attila , called by the writers of the time , from the terror he inspired , the " Scourge of God , " might pass for that of a Mongol prince of the present day . The Mongols /z/ have stout , squat figures , with high , broad shoulders , large , muscular bodies , and short legs ,  --  a disproportion that is probably occasioned by their passing so much of their lives on horseback , and sitting with their legs doubled under them . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among all the Esquimaux tribes , and they have swarthy complexions , broad , flat noses , and wide mouths , but mostly fine , white , regular teeth . The most remarkable difference between the Mongols of the modern times and their ancestors , is , that those of our days are described as well disposed and peaceful people , whilst the Huns and Scythians were warriors so fierce and terrible , that the writers of those ages seem unable to find words hard and dreadful enough to convey their idea of them . This is , however , a difference that may easily be accounted for by different circumstances , by the altered condition of the nations by whom they are surrounded , and by the character of their religion . Among the Mongols of the present day , although they manifest no ferocity of temper , the whole arrangement of society is still such as to be always prepared for war . Their country has been frequently described as a vast nursery for soldiers , consisting of many camps , equipped , provisioned , and ready to march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common or " black people , " as they are called , must have a horse and arms always in readiness to appear /z/ in the field at the command of his chief ; they are all assembled from time to time in a great camp , the old or ill-mounted dismissed , and replaced by others ; the whole body divided into hundreds and fifties , and leaders appointed for each . A hundred and fifty Mongol tents , or families , make a squadron ; thirteen squadrons a banner ; and a number of banners a horde ; governed by a Khan , or Prince : who is supplied by his subjects with a moderate contribution in cattle , as well as with the number of servants and shepherds necessary to guard his flocks and herds . Notwithstanding this military constitution of society , however , which has been continued from the remotest period , we hear little or nothing of wars taking place among them at present . The duties of the Khan are by no means confined to those of a miUtary chief ; it is his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in times of scarcity , which sometimes occur from extraordinary severity of weather , or disease among the cattle , the princes and rich families are bound to afford the means of subsistence to their poorer neighbors . On the occurrence of a marriage in his family , as well as on some other occasions , the Khan receives from his subjects , besides their regular , contribution , an additional one of a certain fixed amount ; for every ten families , or tents , one horse , and a wagon drawn by an ox or camel ; from every one who possesses three or /z/ more cows , a pail of milk ; from the owner of J &ve; cows or more , a pitcher of kumys , or spirit , distilled from milk ; and from the owner of a hundred sheep , a piece of felt . By the great hordes of Mongolia , a tribute is also paid to the Emperor of China ; some send every year a white camel and eight white horses ; some a certain number of sheep ; some fifty bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' heads ; others , falcons and dogs , eagles ' feathers , &c.; : but as these presents receive a handsome return from his Celestial Majesty , in tea , satin , nankeen , silver tea-pots , and ' other costly articles , they may , perhaps , rather be considered as expressions of good-will than tokens of subjection . On occasions of distress , also , when it is thought that the means of the rich are not sufficient to meet the demands made on them , a petition is sent to the Emperor of China , who usually despatches an officer to inquire into the facts , and a sum of money to purchase provisions for the necessitous . The dwellings of these pastoral nations are nothing more than tents , consisting of sets of hurdles of twenty or thirty poles each , and fastened together with leathern thongs , which can be drawn closer or stretched out wider at pleasure . The roof is made of a conical shape , with shorter poles , one end of which is drawn through a wooden hoop in the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurdles , planted in a circle , and /z/ tied together with ropes of camel 's hair or wool . The whole scaffolding is then smeared over with red marl or burnt ochre , and covered by the poor with skins , but by the more wealthy with carpets , obtained from the Chinese or Russians , or with felt coverings and rush matting , made by their poorer countrymen . A curtain , which can be drawn up at pleasure , hangs down over the entrance ; the roof has two or more coverings ; and a sort of funnel hangs down through the wooden hoop in the middle , and serves for a chimney . The wood-work of these tents will last about ten years ; but the coverings require to be renewed much oftener , and , indeed , are generally in holes before a year is out . The fire is made on the ground in the centre , and over it is placed a tripod , as a stand for a large shallow iron dish used for cooking , such as are made in great numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these Mongolian races . The rich sometimes have their cooking done outside the tent , and in the interior merely a brasier with glowing embers , for the sake of warmth . Opposite to the entrance of the tent is the couch of the master ,  --  a low bedstead , with pillows of thick felt , covered with Morocco or Russia leather , and filled with wool or feathers . Among the rich , the earthen floor is covered with felt , and the bedstead furnished with a curtain . On either side are piled up the chests and leathern bags , containing /z/ clothes and various property , all covered with carpeting ; and those who possess an idol hang it up near the head of the bed , and on certain festival days bum a lamp beneath it . On each side of the tent are the sleeping places for guests , as well as for unmarried sons and daughters ; and around hang the bows and arrows , guns , saddles and bridles , kc. , as well as the leathern vessels for milk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tables is supplied by low wooden benches , four or five inches broad , and raised very little above the ground ; and that of chairs by pieces of felt spread out on the floor for seats , but which , as well as the hangings of the tent , are filthy in the extreme , and covered , especially in the winter , with mud , ashes , bones , pieces of gnawed meat , and other indescribable things . The better kinds of seats are made of many folds of felt sewed together , and the best are covered with blue or green cloth , with a square piece of red in the middle ; but these are kept rolled up , and only used on grand occasions . Opposite to the entrance is sometimes placed a low wooden table , upon which stand copper idols and vessels used in their service ; and on ' the right side is the place of honor especially appointed for the wife ( there is seldom more than one ) ; it is a kind of sanctuary for her , whence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offend her to her heart 's content , or even to /z/ pelt them with any of her household chattels that may come within her reach . As long as she does not move from her place , these compliments must not be returned . Both sexes wear trowsers and long robes of nankeen or colored silk , confined by a girdle often richly ornamented ; and over it a short pelisse trimmed with fur , or in winter made entirely of it , and boots of Morocco or Russia leather . The men strengthen the soles with nails , or pieces of iron in the form of horse-shoes , and stick weapons in their girdles , as well as suspend from them their tobacco-pouches , tinder-boxes , and drinking-cups , which a Mongol always carries about with him . Silver and copper rings and buckles , strings of pearl and red coral , silken tassels , and various kinds of amulets , are worn as ornaments , and on grand occasions , even greater splendor is exhibited . A Russian Mission , which crossed this country in its way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Ourga , where they had been adoring the " Koukouktou " ( a religious ceremony to which we shall presently refer ) , and who made a very brilliant appearance . The chief was accompanied by his mother , wife , sisters , younger brothers , and a numerous suite , all armed with bows and arrows , and mounted on fine horses . They wore caps of sable , and robes of beautiful blue satin , with silken zones of interwoven silver ; and not /z/ only their dresses , but even their saddles , were decorated with large cornelians . The poorer classes of course do not share this finery , but are clothed in sheep-skins ,  --  in sufficient quantity , however , to protect them from the cold . In some seasons , sheep-skins are worn by all classes , on account of their great warmth . The Mongol cap , whidi bears the pretty little convenient name of " Chatschil " gamalachaiy consists of a sort of cushion , stuffed with wool , and covered with lamb 's skin , with a flat crown of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tassel . This ornament is considered indispensable , and those who can not afford it , supply its place with a bit of red rag , which equally well answers the intended purpose of pointing them out as disciples of Buddha . Rich women and priests wear the " chatschilgamalachai , " trimmed with costly fur , and have the crown profusely embroidered ; but notwithstanding all this luxury of attire , these people are little superior in cleanliness to the mere savages formerly described . Their under garments and trowsers are generally worn without washing till they drop off ; and as they eat their food with their fingers , and then wipe them on their boots , br on the ground , it may be supposed they are not in a very delicate condition . There are , however , beaux and belles among them , who never make a journey without carrying their whole wardrobe with them , and whose chief diversion on days of festival , is to disappear from /z/ the company and return as often as possible in a new dress . As the Mongols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered the great advantages of a division of labor in arts and manufactures , such as are practised among them are mostly carried on by each family for its own use . Of- these the most important is the preparation of leather , an article used for a great variety of different purposes , including the manufacture of milk-pails and tea-pots . It is wholly the business of the women , who , though by no means subjected to such severe toil as among savages , are regarded as domestic servants , and have to perform rather an unfair share of the work . The skins have to be washed and scraped all over , then soaked in sour milk , then dried and soaked again several times , and then worked and pulled in all directions with the hands and knees , till they are perfectly soft . Then comes the smoking , for which pits are dug and filled with damp wood , coarse grass , and whatever will bum with a thick smoke ; the skins are spread on a wooden frame over it , and after this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though for the thick leather , of which the soles of the boots are made , notched logs of wood are employed . The vessels to hold liquids , which are required to be as hard as horn , and very lasting , are made by sewing the fresh skins into the desired shapes with the sinews of oxen or horses , and moulding them with their hands /z/ as they dry , -=  --  of course a most tedious and laborious process . Sometimes they are stuffed out with sand , that they may dry into a large hollow shape ; and , when necessary , metal tubes are inserted , to make spouts for tea-pots , or necks of bottles . Leathern vessels are often made so large as to require the whole skin of an ox or horse . The manufacture of felt , for the coverings pf tent and floors , of hair lines , and of all kinds of clothing , the preparation of food , and the care of children , leaves , we may suppose , very little idle time to the women ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them than the North American Indians , do assist them in packing the goods for a journey , putting up the tents , and making hair lines , as well as in attending to the cattle , and slaughtering the animals required for food . As a wife is so useful an assistant , a young man is naturally desirous to obtain one as soon as he can possibly afford it . The price of a young lady , belonging to what may be called the middling classes , is usually about fifteen cows , fifteen horses , three camels , and twenty sheep ; but the father is expected to allow her a marriage portion of about equal value in clothing , made and unmade , and household utensils . The price of the bride is paid on betrothment , which may take place after she has completed her fourteenth year , but not sooner ; and if the bridegroom does not fetch her away before she is twenty , complaint is made to the /z/ chief , or prince , whose business it is to find her another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forfeits whatever he has paid as a deposit . Over every forty famihes is a kind of superintendent , who has to see that at least four marriages take place every year ; and if the funds of the bridegrooms are found to be insufficient , they are made up by contributions from the rich . The first point to be ascertained when a wedding is about to take place , is , under what signl the bride and bridegroom were born ; for if it should happen that the lady 's star commands the gentleman 's , she will certainly , it is supposed , exercise an undue authority over her husband . The Mongols reckon twelve signs , corresponding with our months ; they are the mouse , the ox , the tiger , the hare , the dragon , the serpent , the horse , the ram , the ape , the hen , the dog , the swine . Marriages between persons bom respectively under the ox and the tiger , the hen and the horse , the swme and the ape , are prohibited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been satisfactorily settled , the person appointed to act for the bridegroom , his solicitor , we may call him , settles with the fiiends of the bride how many sheep and oxen , and what quantity of goods and chattels , of various kinds , are to be given on either side . The bridegroom then musters all his relations and friends , sometimes to the number of a hundred or ' more , and taking with him vast quantities of boiled /z/ meat , and , what is quite indispensable , a leg of mutton for the young lady in particular , repairs to the tent of the papa , and there , after adorning the idols , and prostrating himself before them , indulges in a grand carouse . In the meantime the new tent , bestowed by the parents of the bride , as part of the marriage portion , is set up , and the lama is called in to fumigate it , and perform in it the due amount of professional exercises . A fire is then kindled before the door of the tent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a piece of felt being laid before it on the ground , the young couple are required to kneel down upon it . The lama then inquires if they enter the married state voluntarily and without any constraint , exhorts the bride to obedience and the bridegroom to forbearance , and calls for a boiled shoulder of mutton , which he places before them , requiring them both to lay hold of the bone . This is the moment for the young lady to manifest a becoming degree of reluctance ; but if her modest hesitation lasts too long , it is usual for some one to come behind her , and force her hand down upon the bone . The lama then repeats several blessings , and afterwards calls out two of the young men present , who bend down the heads of the newly married pair three times to the ground , commanding them to honor the sun , the fire , and the earth . Some travellers give a different account of the words spoken on /z/ these occasions , and translate them , ** Honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutton ; " but it may be that the words are not always the same . The friends of both parties , standing in readiness behind them , then suddenly snatch their caps off their heads and throw them into the hut to a lama standing ready to receive them , and as especial good luck is betokened for the party whose cap goes in first , it is a great point of friendship to be as quick as possible . The bridal pair is then led into the tent , where they receive another blessing , have their caps placed on their heads again , and are seated side by side on the ground , and ordered to eat out of the same dish , as a symbol of the future community of goods between them ; and the guests also now come in and begin to eat again . The ceremony is then concluded by the younger among the matrons of the party making a sudden attack on the bride , and tearing her away not very gently from the midst of her virgin companions , who , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , so that something like a general battle ensues among the ladies of the party . Since we do not find , however , that the young damsels are ever successful in retaining their companion , we may conclude that , as in stage combats , which party is to be victorious has been previously settled by amicable arrangement . The married ladies now invest their new associate with a robe of a peculiar form , worn only by /z/ wives , plait her hair afresh , after a new fashion , and she may then be considered as installed in the honors and immunities of a Mongol matron , and much in the same position as a young lady among us , who has just returned from her wedding tour . The religion of Buddhism , professed by all the pure Mongol tribes , is superior to any that would have been likely to arise amongst themselves ) having been communicated to them from a people in a much higher state of civilisation . It is of great antiquity , having been founded in India about a thousand years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mythology , it teaches sublime doctrines and pure precepts of morality : it recognizes the existence of one great Supreme Being , and the immortality of the soul . Its adherents believe , that by virtuous actions eternal happiness may be gained , and that vice will be punished , but not eternally . It expressly condemns not only murder , robbery , and all kinds of licentiousness , but threatening , calumny , and " idle discourse , nay , even such sins as the heart only is conscious of ,  --  envy , hatred , and evil thoughts . It enjoins its professors to save any one 's life , to be charitable , to observe cleanliness , to speak the truth , " to speak politely y to preach and preserve peace , to be contented with their station . The manner of life of its distinguished professors has frequently been exactly that of the early saints of the Roman Catholic Church ; they have de- /z/ voted themselves to religious exercises , to severe abstinence and constant contemplation , and have lived apart from the vrorld . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddhists , that in Lassa , the capital of Thibet , vrhere the Dalai Lama , the present head of the religion , resides , there are , it is said , no less than three thousand convents . Magnificent external monuments of this religion are still visible in India and the island of Java , *  --  such as the ruins of a gigantic temple , and five large subterranean halls , exhibiting skill in architecture and sculpture , far surpassing that of the modem inhabitants of these countries . It has spread over the greater part of Asia , and has undoubtedly exercised great influence in softening the character of the once fierce and wild tribes of Mongolia and Tartary . Even what we must consider one of its errors , the doctrine of the transmigration of human souls into the bodies of the lower animals , has introduced a spirit of humanity towards them , very striking in a people who , from the necessity of their position , are compelled to slaughter them for food . The reverence paid to their lamas , or priests , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior to that paid sometimes to the Roman Catholic clergy in the middle ages of European history " You will attain , " says a Mongol viting , " eternal felicity , if you /z/ honor the Lamas ; the sun itself , which dispels impenetrable mists , rises only that honor may be rendered to the lamas ; the most enormous sins obtain pardon by showing respect to the learned lamas . The blessing of the Grand Lama gives bodily strength , communicates great advantages to youth , and confers glory . If you sincerely implore , during a whole day , the benediction of a lama , all the sins committed during innumerable generations may be effaced ; and , on the other hand , any offence to a lama annihilates the merit acquired by a thousand generations . " Every father of a family considers it his duty to bring up one of his sons to the priesthood , so that the lamas are very numerous ; but they are by no means idle members of society . They are exempt , indeed from military service , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend to the cattle . They are the only physicians , and the only persons who give instruction in reading and writing , which the Mongols learn for the sake of reading their books of prayer ,  --  almost the only books , indeed , which they possess . The lamas are also at liberty to buy and sell , and attend to domestic affairs , although they must remain unmarried , and observe many of the rules of a strict monastic life . As disciples of Buddha the Mongols of course acknowledge the Dalai Lama , as their great high priest , or supreme pontiff ; but they have also a pontiff of their own , whom they believe to be a peculiar object of af- /z/ fection to the Supreme Being , and to receive whose benediction they will undertake long and fatiguing journeys . This is the Koukoukton of Ourga . There are ten grand priests , or koukouktons , who hold the first rank after the Dalai Lama , and are supposed to be acquainted with all events , past , present , and future ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the privilege of having their souls at death pass into other human bodies . The Dalai Lama , as the head of the Church , points out the children into whom the souls of the former koukouktons have passed or are about to pass ; and these children are generally of distinguished families , and are educated in a manner suitable to their future dignity . As soon as a child has been recognized as a koukoukton , a grand procession is made to meet him , with the most lively demonstrations of joy ; and he is conducted , in great pomp , to the residence of his predecessor , where he is confided to the care of the lamas , who henceforward permit very few persons to see him . Those who enjoy this favor he receives sitting cross-legged upon a splendid altar , never saluting even princes who come from distant regions to pay their homage , but at the utmost laying his hand on the head of the worshipper , in token of the pardon he grants to their sins . In the country of the Kalkas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequented by the Mongol tribes It is built on the side of a mountain , and is about fif- /z/ teen Hundred feet in circumference , and surrounded by a wall , which , as well as the building itself , is of bricks , painted red . At the main entrance are planted two beams as high as masts , and behind the wall , on one side , stand seven tents , where the lamas live , who - serve the temple ; and on the other is a wooden building , where they dine , and hold their assemblies . In the vestibule of the temple are four gigantic wooden figures , representing warriors in full armor . The first has a red face , and holds in his hands a serpent ; the second has a white face , and he holds a parasol in his right hand , and in his left a mouse ; the third has a blue face , and a sword ; and the fourth , a yellow face , and a lute . These statues represent beings superior to men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to live two thousand five hundred years , in different regions of Mount Soumer , the centre of the universe , which extends fifty thousand miles towards each of the four quarters of the world , and has seven gilded summits . The interior walls of the temple are hung with silk , adorned with representations of the most revered saints ; and round the wooden pillars are hung drums , standards , and kadasks , or sacred ribbons . Opposite to the entrance is a large copper idol , and near it seats for the elder lamas , with cushions covered with yellow satin . On the floor are spread carpets of felt for the inferior priests . Behind the temple , against the north wall , /z/ Stands a gilt image of Buddha , with a table before it , on which are placed dishes of butter and milk , and copper gilt cups of iced water and tea ; more innocent offerings than the blood-stained sacrifices of so many heathen altars . It is not , however , only in temples made with hands that the supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to reside . They regard him as diffused throughout all nature , but especially present in objects of vast size , lofty rocks and mountains , broad rivers , and mighty trees . These accordingly become objects of devotion ; and near them the Mongol raises , with solemn ceremonies , under the direction of his lamas , hillocks , or ohos , as they are called , of stone , sand , earth , or wood ; and here he prostrates himself to implore the cure of diseases afflicting his family or cattle , victory over his enemies , and , in all cases , the mercy of the Great Spirit of the Mountains and Valleys . There are also , in some places , soubourgans or chapels , of stone or wood , of a pyramidal form , which are built by rich people for the expiation of their sins , or in the hope of future reward . On the consecration of these soubourgans , hundreds of little cones of clay , called Tsatsa , are thrown into them , as symbolic images of deified persons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable materials ,  --  gold , silver , jewels , &c.; ; but as few are able to afford a sufficient /z/ quantity of these , they mostly content themselves with mingling a small portion of these precious articles with clay . The number of these gifts must not be less than a hundred , but the more the better ; and every Mongol who passes a soubourgan must stop , make three prostrations , go three times round it , and throw in something as an offering ,  --  were it only a lock of hair , or a chip of wood . One of the most curious articles found in the temples of Buddha is a machine intended to serve the purposes of a prayer-book for those who can not read . It is a chest with many angles , turning on an axis , and covered with prayers in the Mongol and Tabetan languages , in gold letters . Into the chest are also put prayers in both languages ; and worshippers coming to the temple kneel before it , and , repeating a few holy words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompts them ; these turnings of the chest being considered as efficacious as recited prayers . Some pious persons will whirl away at a great rate and for a long time , and seem to care very little about interruptions , provided they are not absolutely laughed at . In general , clamorous prayers , loud music , pilgrimages , and splendid processions , form an important part of the Laraaic religion ; but besides these , which may be considered its legitimate observances , a great deal of secret conjuration is practised , which is not approved*by the regular priests . This need not surprise /z/ US , if we consider for how many hundred years the existence of witches and wizards was an article of universal beUef among the Christian nations of Europe ,  --  if , indeed , it may be considered as entirely abandoned ; and that recourse was frequently had to their assistance , even by those who abhorred them . A great number of conjurors , of both sexes , are found in Mongolia , as well as among the ruder Nomadic tribes of Siberia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community , and are applied to by those who can not afford to pay for the prayers and ceremonies of the more regular practitioners , the priests of Buddha . These schamans bless cattle , distribute charms against their various diseases and little images of household gods , rag dolls , considered to be good for pains in the stomach , and , in general , serviceable in the promotion of domestic happiness . Similar idols , intended as tutelary deities of sheep and cattle , are occasionally made even by the lamas themselves ,  --  anxious , we may suppose , to take the business out of the hands of ignorant and unorthodox pretenders . The Russian traveller , Pallas , witnessed an incantation , performed by a sorceress in a Mongol tent , for the benefit of a man whose wife was sick , and who had himself fallen into necessitous circumstances . A day having arrived which was declared propitious , a sheep intended to be sacrificed was brought into the tent , and slaughtered there by the officiating witch . /z/ The heart , breast bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the rest cut up and placed in a cauldron , and left to boil until the day began to decline . The kettle was then taken from the fire , an image of Buddha set up opposite the door of the tent , and a lamp kindled beneath it ; the boiled mutton was now poured into a trough , and brought by two assisitants to the sorceress and the master of the tent , who had seated themselves outside , and a certain number of pieces were selected , tied up in a sack , and placed near the witch , while one of the bones was suspended by a red silk string over the fire . After various antics , the company fell on the remainder of the mutton and ate it up . After this they set to work again , going through a great number of intricate mancEUvres , not worth detailing , and making sacrifices of fat , milk , sugar , and raisins , to sundry spirits . In conclusion , the sorceress took a bell in her left hand , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her right , and began tossing herself about with wild gestures , and uttering loud and apparently frantic invocations to spirits of the air and all whom the matter concerned ; working hard in this way for a full hour till she was in the most violent perspiration , and in a proper mood for prophecy , being occasinoally held during the performance by her two assistants , who appeared very much inclined to laugh at the whole proceeding . She then announced to the master of the tent a great deal /z/ of good fortune that awaited him ; and other Mongols who were present , put various questions to her concerning their future destiny ,  --  all of which she answered in loud tone , between a song and a scream . Then there was another feast of boiled mutton , and towards midnight the party separated ,  --  the wise woman receiving two white handkerchiefs , in each of which a new piece of money was tied up , as a fee for her services . The bones of the animal sacrificed must be left lying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shoulder is carefully laid aside , as most valuable for prophetic purposes . Most of these magic ceremonies , and especially the mingling of things considered sacred with others which are forbidden , strikingly resemble former practices of European witches , as detailed in their trials and confessions ,  --  the image of Buddha holding among the Mongols the place of the Bible among the witches of Europe . The sacred books of the Mongols , which are very numerous , are written on long thin slips of paper , in lines going perpendicularly from the top to the bottom of the page , and then wrapped up in handkerchiefs , and pressed between two thin boards . Those written in the Tibetan language hold the highest rank , as they contain only prayers , and are called , therefore , books of salvation . They are treated with so much reverence , that it is said neither priest nor layman ever /z/ takes one in his hand without a solemn expression in his face ; and it is to symboUze this reverence that the lamas , before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of their prayers they do not , however , pretend to understand the meaning of , saying it is not necessary that they should . The one most frequently used ,  --  the one that every pious follower of Buddha repeats , if possible , a thousand times a day , is , " Our man i padma houm ; " words for which our best Oriental scholars can offer no other explanation than " Oh , precious lotus ! "  --  but if a Mongol is asked their signification , he answers , that volumes must be written to express their meaning . These words are written on the banners , and on everything pertaining to the service of the temple ; and to every one of them a miraculous power of averting all sorts of dangers is ascribed . On account of their numerous flocks and herds , the Mongol migrations are very frequent ,  --  in many cases every third or fourth day . The great chiefs , however , do not change their abode so often ; and in winter sometimes remain as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spare the trouble of frequent movings , only as many cattle near them as are necessary for subsistence , and for carrying baggage . His highness does not , indeed , hesitate to make free with a horse , a cow , or a sheep , belonging to a subject , should /z/ he stand in need of it ; although it must not be forgotten , that these are usually counted and paid for at the end of the year . The spots chosen for winter encampments are , if possible , such as will supply wood and reeds for fuel ; but as these are often only barely sufficient for cooking purposes , the lower classes suffer much from cold . In the spring , the driest tracts are selected , as the water remaining from the melted snow makes them more habitable at that season than any other . Summer and autumn bring these wanderers into the best watered districts they can find . A migration is generally begun at break of day , and preparation made for it the evening before , by bringing the beasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as morning dawns , the men go out to catch the horses and camels , some of which are cunning enough to guess what is intended , and so start off at the most distant glimpse of the instrument used for the purpose ,  --  a long flexible pole , with a noose at the end to throw over the animal 's head . It is sometimes as much as an hour 's work , and could hardly be done at all but for the exertions of the trained horse which the Mongol rides , and which appears to take great delight in catching the fugitive . Whilst some are thus engaged , others are occupied in unfastening the hair lines and cords of the tents , pulling up the poles , and tying them together , rolling up the coverings , and packing the whole , ready to be laid on the backs of /z/ the camels . Three are generally sufficient to cany the whole property of a moderately opulent Mongcd , though the chattels of a prince require seven or eight . Before the march begins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like to begin a journey fasting ; and the few who are so poor as not to have any tea , content themselves with a bowl of sour milk . The chief sets off first , as he has to choose the spot for the next encampment ; and this is often the same that his tribe has occupied the year before , where it has not been burnt or eaten bare by other hordes . Should this prove to be the case , he goes on further . When he arrives at a place which he thinks suitable , he plants his standard ; and after riding about the ground , to examine the pasture , orders a carpet to be spread out , on which he lies down till the camels come up and his tent can be pitched . As long as the march lasts , there may be seen , covering its whole line , the camels in larger or smaller groups , each with a single leader ; between them troops of mares , cows , and sheep . Sometimes comes a crowd of priests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in confidential discourse ; and on either flank are seen flying parties of sportsmen as light cavalry , pursuing wolves , foxes , or wild goats . The camels belonging to the chief are usually deco* rated with colored woollen bridles , or with blue and red trstppings , with a handsome tassel hanging down /z/ over the tail . As each division of the horde arrives at the halting-place , it begins to pitch the tents ; neighbors find themselves again near each other , and in a few hours , what had been an unpeopled wilderness , is alive with the hum of active life , covered with hundreds of movable habitations , and with the almost countless flocks and herds that accompany them ,  --  to be restored , however , again , in a few days , to the silence and solitude of inanimate nature . The Mongol tents are always pitched at a considerable distance from each other , in order to leave room for the flocks and herds to feed among them ; and the town , or camp , is divided into several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tents of the lamas are pitched , so as to form an oval , with the large prayer tent , or temple , in the midst ; the Vice-Khan 's , or Prince 's quarter ; and the market quarter , or bazaar : around these are clustered the habitations of the lower classes , which are not only much smaller , but mostly ragged and dirty . The tent covered with felt , which serves as the palace of the wandering sovereign , is distinguished by a wide space left round it , and a double line of spears leaning against horizontal poles . In the inside , the Prince may mostly be seen engaged in the exercise of his judicial functions , while seated cross-legged on a pile of carpets , and often getting on with devotional business at the same time , by repeating prayers , and slipping along very diligently the /z/ beads of his rosary . Around the tent are ranged a number of chests , containing his movable property , and frequently seated upon them the younger male branches of the royal family , discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly similar to those which Attila and his family are said always to have made use of , notwithstanding the quantities of gold and silver plate , which he had collected in his very profitable travels through the provinces of the Roman empire . Costly articles of this description are even now by no means uncommon in the tents of the Mongols , and they are often intermingled with large pieces of beef , or horse-flesh , hung up to dry , as if a silversmith 's and butcher 's shop had joined in partnership . The food of these nations , apart from the uncleanly manner of its preparation , is not of an unpleasant kind . Horseflesh , it is true , is not an article we should very willingly admit into our " cuisine ; " but setting aside the influence of custom , there is certainly nothing more disgusting in it than in most other kinds of animal food . The races who occupy the country generally known as Independent Tartary , use a great deal of wheat and flour , which they procure from the agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancient Greeks , in sacks made of skins . The Tartars also get from the Russians melons and various kinds of vegetables , and use many kinds of /z/ edible plants and roots which are found in the countries they traverse ; but the Eastern Mongols profess the greatest distaste for any kind of vegetable food , saying , " Herbs were made for beasts , and the beasts of the field for man . " Most of the Nomadic people of Asia make great use of an article called " brick tea , " which serves both for drink and food . It is brought from the tea manufac-* tories of China , where the dry , dirty , and damaged leaves and stalks of the tea are thrown aside , and afterwards mixed with a glutinous substance , pressed into moulds , and dried in ovens , in blocks of the size and shape of bricks , whence the name has been given . The usual mode of using it is to pound a piece of it in a mortar , throw the powder into an iron kettle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time upon the fire . A little salt nd milk is then added , and sometimes flour fried in oil . Water is seldom drunk till it has been boiled ; and even milk is not drunk fresh , but made into a kind of whey , by boiling it with rennet . The curd is then used for cheese . The butter appears to be less like what we call bv that name than what is called " clouted cream " in some parts of England . Immediately after milking , the milk is generally poured into a large trough , which is one of the most necessary articles of housekeeping , and never wanting in any tent . This vessel is never cleaned , and has usually a sour re- /z/ mainder from the former store , besides a crust of stale curd all round it , giving it anything but an agreeable smell . " In every tent there is generally a kettle on the fire , full of tea , mixed with milk , butter , and salt ; and the weary traveller may at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick tea , but he must have his own wooden cup , which a Mongol always carries about with him as an article indispensably necessary . " However little we may find to object to in the mate*-rials of food employed by these races , it must nevertheless be confessed that there is much in the style of the cookery to cause a shudder in the most enthusiastic traveller . It is considered a sin to wash out any vessel , not only on account of the frequent scarcity of water , but because the remains of food left sticking about it would then be wasted . The favorite method of cleansing it is by sweeping the fingers round , and sometimes by licking it out ; and the flavor of yesterday 's horseflesh is usually strongly perceptible on the tea , while the bowl of milk is seasoned by bits of garlic , which have served as the condiment of the preceding evening 's meal . Pieces of meat are flung into the kettle to boil , without any one objecting to the bits of grass , clay , hairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sticking upon them . The water in the tea-kettle is usually full of ashes and dirt ; and , in short , nowhere could we find a more perfect illus- /z/ tration of the proverb , which tells us that " Meat is sent from Heaven , but cooks  --  from the opposite direction . " The principal meals are taken in the morning and evening , and always commenced by setting apart a certain portion as a sacrifice to the gods . This is done in a very reverential manner with uncovered head , and in sacred vessels , never used for any other purpose ; but among the poorest classes , who do not always possess such vessels , the custom is less rigidly observed . Neither tablecloths nor napkins , knives nor forks , are of course to be met with ; and , considering the general habits of these people , it seems rather surprising that they commonly wash , or at least pour water over their hands , before eating . After a meal , the fingers are either licked or wiped upon the boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the grassy floor of the tent . /z/ However tedious may be the monotony of the measureless sea of grass , which constitutes the landscape beyond the South-Eastem limits of the Russian territory , the agricultural settlers who have established themselves there , are not pleased to see it enlivened by the appearance of a picturesque troop of wild horsemen scouring over the plain , for the sight is generally followed by the loss of their cattle and sheep . The existence of these wandering tribes is usually first made known to a traveller who crosses the frontier , by the complaints which he hears of their depredations ; but if he proceeds further into their country , he forms a better opinion of them , as he finds them living for the most part peaceably enough on the produce of their flocks and herds . It is not very easy to settle the exact locality of /z/ races in perpetual movement ; but the two great branches of the Mongolian family , called Calmucks and Kirghis , are found mostly in the vast plains of Independent Tartary . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watered and fertile countries of the South , has adopted the Mahommedan religion , and become , in a great measure , settled . Of the Calmucks , many thousand families or ' ' kettles* ' have been induced to acknowledge the authority of the Russian Government , and to confine their rambles to the plains of the Wolga ; but the ' greater number still remain faithful to the religion and the mode of life followed by their forefathers for hundreds of years . They may be regarded as entirely independent ; for though the Russian empire has a voice in the appointment of their princes , it not only exacts no tribute from them , but pays them a pension , on consideration of their refraining from their predatory expeditions . Their constant migrations , however , which take place mostly every four or five days , the care of their numerous flocks and herds ( of which a single rich man will sometimes own as many as twenty thousand sheep , besides hundreds of camels and horses ) , to say nothing of the time taken up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them probably but little leisure for less honest pursuits . The great charm of the contemplation of the life of these Nomadic races is , that it transports the imagina- /z/ tion back to those early patriarchal times , when a few wandering tribes , perhaps , constituted nearly the whole human race ; when " the world 's grey fathers " went forth in search of fresh fields and pastures new ; and Abraham , ' rich in cattle , and silver and gold , went on his journeys from the south to the place where his tent had been at the beginning , and Lot also went with him , and had flocks , and herds and tents . " The migration of those far off ages must have presented , as nearly as posble , the same picture that may be seen at the present day on the Steppes of Tartary . The collecting the cattle , the stir and movement throughout the camp , the taking down the tents , and packing them and the household utensils on the backs of camels  --  all the arrangements must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people was probably little different . A man of ordinary rank among the Tartars ,  --  one of the " black people , " as the lower classes are called ,  - -  hastens with break of day to the pastures where his cattle are feeding , to lead them , often a considerable distance , to the watering-place , his wife having , if possible , got there before him , to dip for a pail or two before the beasts have troubled the water , which is always bad enough at best . The children now get up , and wrapping themselves up in their little ragged sheepskins , go out on the Steppe to collect fuel ,  - -  grass , reeds , or dung . When the parents return , fire /z/ h made , and the frugal meal prepared ; and sometimes when the father has been out in the night watching the cattle , he indulges in a little brandy . After breakfast , the little boys tumble about naked on the grass ; the girls assist their mother in sewing or preparing skins , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work to make wooden spoons or troughs , or to mend his saddle . In the warmest part of the afternoon , the family generally lie down to sleep ; and in the evening again the cattle must be taken to drink ; and when the rays of the setting sun are falhng across the wide grassy slopes , the groups of Tartars , with their cows , sheep , and horses , are all in motion again to seek the water . A Calmuck of the higher classes , or a Prince , as soon as he has smoked his morning pipe and drunk his tea , leaves his tent for another , which is set apart for business . Here he is occupied the greater part of the day in settling disputes and arranging various affairs , and ih going through his devotional exercises with the rosary , which is used by all the Mongol tribes , and is sometimes made of amber and other costly materials . Now and then he takes a few turns with the praying wheel before described . The ladies , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what constitutes the chief employment of women of rank in many countries ,  --  paying visits , which being burdened with an infinite number of smaU ceremonies , kill as 6 &; CALHirCKS AND KIRGHI8 , OB much time , and appear just as tiresome and to strangers , as an English party probably would to a Calmuck . The summer evenings are mostly spent by all classes in the open air , and nowhere is a summer evening productive of more exquisite enjoyment . The air is often deliciously cool and pure after the hottest day ; and people of all ranks come forth from their tents to enjoy it , either lying on carpets of felt spread before them , or strolling about among the flocks . Various games and diversions are going on among different classes of people , and the whole scene is one of pleasure and animation . A lovely idea may be formed of some features of Tartar life from the letters of a traveller , * who spent some time on the Steppes of Asia , and who seems to have been so fascinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mind to take up his abode with these roving nations . He set out for the Steppes from the Russian town of Sarepta , near the mouth of the Wolga ; and after passing some ravines filled with oak , wild apple , and other trees , entered on the immeasurable sea of grass , joined company with some Calmuck Tartars , and set off in search of a party of their countrymen . " We flew swiftly along on our excellent horses /z/ and soon reached the spot where we expected to find the party ; but not a trace of them was to be seen . A few miles further , however , brought us up with them , and we found ourselves hospitably received . A tent was pitched for us on the fresh grass , a sheep killed , and some felt carpets spread out for our night 's repose . On the following morning , when we took leave of our host , he appeared as well pleased with his guests , as if our visit had been a source of profit , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sheep . The morning was cool and pleasant , but no object met our eyes that we had not seen the day before ; the grass was still green and high , but the butterflies that had been at first numerous and beautiful , grew continually scarcer . " Towards noon we halted ; the Calmucks dug a hole in the ground , made a fire in it with some dry dung which they collected , and put on our kettle ; but the rain-water , which they fetched from a pond or tank , was of a black yellow color , and full of insects . The only answer which my grumblings on the subject received , however , was an assurance that I might think myself lucky if I got water even as good as this in future . We had lain down for half an hour with our saddle-bags under our heads , but the heat of the sun was so insupportable , that we felt more weary after this rest than after our six hours ' ride . We set off again , therefore , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five and twenty miles , the two foremost of our party were out of sight , and I had some difficulty in coming up with the two others , who had placed themselves both on one horse , in order to reUeve the one that appeared most exhausted . They exhorted . me to make haste , unless I had a mind to pass the night on the open steppe without food or shelter ; and as this was no very pleasant prospect , I urged on my poor weary steed , and soon left behind me the one that carried double . The Calmucks bawled after me that I should not be able to overtake the foremost , and that I should lose myself . I was obstinate enough , however , to pay no attention to their advice , but continued my course in the direction which I thought the right one , being guided only by the sun . But my eyes were too little accustomed to estimate distances in these measureless steppes , and I had soon not the slightest idea in what direction I was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower and lower in the heavens , but I was in no mood to enjoy the magnificent spectacle of his setting , which at another time would have filled me withrapture . Anumber of stories crowded into my mind , of unfortunate persons who had lost their way , and perished in this pathless wilderness ; and I was tormented by intolerable thirst , so that my tongue seemed to cling to the roof of my mouth . By the time the sun had fairly set , as I found myself near a ravine , I resolved to make the best of it , and pass the night there . I dismounted , /z/ therefore , and having tethered my horse , climbed up the opposite side to look about me . After lingering there about an hour , I saw , with inexpressible joy , something moving a long way off ; and this something proved , indeed , to be my two Calmucks , who had distinguished me at an almost incredible distance , and had come out of their way to seek me . Soon also , dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a distance of several miles , the laden camels which served to guide us to the tents . " I was kindly entertained by a Calmuck priest ,  - -  the bowl of mare 's milk handed round , and the kettle put on for tea . My host was one of a class of priests much despised , on account of their being married ; and as he was poor , his family was crowded together in a small tent , which , it must be confessed , was so exceedingly filthy that the fear of vermin induced me to prefer sleeping outside on the grass , with my saddle for a pillow , and no other covering than a felt cloak . The nights here are excessively cold ; and this time there was a disagreeable fog , which did not , indeed , disturb my rest , but made my hair and my clothes wet through . I awoke early , and wishing for some refreshment , was told I could have either milk or cream . I chose the latter ; whereupon my hostess , seizing a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and then filled it with her hand , licking off it at the same time what appeared superfluous . /z/ ' * The horde of Tartars amongst which I found myself is one of the principal ; not so much on account of its numbers , as because the chief priest of all the Calmuck disciples of the Dalai Lama had taken up his abode among them . The Vice-Khan , or Prince , was a fine-looking man , about forty years of age , dressed , when we were introduced to him , in a Uue silk robe , and holding in his hand a rosary , such as are used by all the followers of Buddha . I was presented to him as a stranger , who wished to make himself acquainted with the Calmuck tongue ; for which intention I was of course honored with his Highness 's approbation , and his advice not to fail , in that case , to eat plenty of the Calmuck food ; as it is a common notion among them that the acquirement of their language is much facilitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calmuck tea , and , on my answering in the aflSurmative , it was brought in a large wooden vessel with brass hoops , and poured out into wooden bowls . " We found that the tent we had entered was only used as a Judgment Hall , and we were soon invited to enter a more spacious one , which was the residence of the Vice-Khan . On the left of the entrance stood an altar table , on which were placed many sacrificial vessels , and by the side of it hung several images of gods . Here we found the Princess , seated on a pile /z/ of cushions , and playing with her children , of whom she had many , though she still looked fresh and well . " After the heat of the day was over , the evening was spent in witnessing the performances of some Calmuck wrestlers , before the tents of the young princes , who , though they appeared busy all the while with their prayers and their rosaries , did not fail to mark every movement of the players , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evenings are only pleasantly cool , but after midnight a degree of cold comes on that makes furs at all seasons desirable . The stillness of the night was sadly invaded by the crash and clang of the various musical instruments from the tents of the lamas , as well as by the cries of the camels , the neighing of horses , the lowing of cattle , and the loud croaking of frogs in a neighboring pond ; so that I could not sleep till the mid hour of the night had passed . " I was awakened by the daylight piercing through the numerous holes in the covering of my tent ; and towards nine o'clock I went to the tent of the Tartar Prince , whom I found engaged with his family in prayer . The prayer seemed to consist of invocations of the gods ,  --  mostly of the infernal ones ; for it is a characteristic of polytheism , that it brings with it more fear of the evil than love of the good deities , who are supposed to be far less active in kindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers we were entertained with tea , and then the Vice-Khan rose to go to his judgment tent , whither we followed him . He is assisted in his judicial duties by a sort of council of eight members , who , however , merely give him the benefit of their opinion , and put no sort of restraint upon his will . " At the time of my arrival , it happened to be the period of a Buddhist festival of fifteen days ,  --  the latter days of April and the first of May ; and the sound of loud instrumental music was heard continually from the tents of the lamas , accompanied occasionally by a vocal performance , and by the very frequent ring of a bell . Of the instruments , there were some resembling drums , others trumpets , and others cymbals ; and during this festival time , they were going the whole day , from morning till night , till I was fairly deafened ; and however tolerant I might feel towards their religion , I could not resist the conviction , that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interval of the service , sour milk - was handed round ; and during one of these I obtained leave to enter and examine the interior of the tent , at the door of which only I had hitherto stood . Opposite to the entrance was a lofty altar ,  --  a wooden scaffolding , hung with colored silk , and above it a canopy , on which was represented a figure of the heavenlydragon who produces thunder and lightning . Upon the altar stood several bronze figures in silken robes ; /z/ and on a projection beneath , dishes filled with corn , beans , rice , and other thhigs , likewise oflfered as sacrifice by the Indian Brahmins . Near them stood a vessel of holy water , out of which rose several peacock 's feathers , and beneath it a looking-glass , though for what purpose I could not discover . " Suddenly , when I had nearly finished my examination , the blast of a cow 's horn without gave a signal for the renewal of prayers and the recommencement of the service . The priests came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exit . Outside I found several of the higher order standing , wrapped in red mantles , with something like helmets on their heads , from which a large bunch of yellow wool hung down the back . Some of the inferior dignity were engaged in exercising their lungs through horns , and making the noise which we had heard . At some distance an immense kettle was suspended over a fire , maintained by a mountain of dung , and whole sheep and even cows were boiling , in preparation for the banquet . Near the fixe stood a cook , black as Erebus , and naked to the waist , with a huge ladle in his hand , with which he was stirring up the contents of the cauldron . Not far off , I observed in an open tent a crowd of boys , who assist the priests in the religious service ; some were eating , with no deficiency of appetite , large lumps of boiled meat given to them , and others appeared to await with eagerness their turn to share in the enter- /z/ tainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was compelled to retire again , lest in the hurry of those who were running about with the dishes , I should receive a shower-bath of scalding hot soup . Two ceremonies were to take place to-day ,  --  the appointment of fifteen new priests , and the reception of the patriarchy Great Lama , of the horde . Of the new candidates for the priestly office , I had the night before observed eight walking , as it is their business to do , round and round the ecclesiastical quarter , barefoot ' and silent , with an earnest and solemn expression of face . Their heads were shaven , and they wore , over the usual red frock , a robe of yellow silk , which descended from the neck to the ankle , concealing the left arm , while the right was occupied in moving rapidly along the beads of a rosary . These rosaries are in use among all the Mongolian nations , and consist of a hundred and eight beads , made of plum-stones , and to these , at certain distances , other smaller ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are used for arithmetical as well as for religious purposes . " The tent intended for the Chief Lama had been pitched at some distance oflf , at the other side of a small river , across which his holiness had to be carried . He also wore a yellow silk dress ,  --  as yellow is a very favorite color among the Mongols ; and his cap , instead of the customary fox skin , was trimmed with rich sable . He was mounted on a horse , which one /z/ of the ordinary lamas led by the bridle ; whilst another carried before him a staff of ebony . He stopped at a hut , before the entrance of which two flags were planted , and entering through a smaller open tent , which formed a kind of antechamber to it , prostrated himself three times before the altar within , but came back in a few minutes , and seated himself on a pile of cushions placed for him in the outer tent . He then put off his red boots and his upper robe , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The common people , also , pressed as near as they could , but were preyented from approaching too closely by the vigorous use of the sticks of the ecclesiastics . After some time had elapsed , the Vice-Khan made his appearance in a blue silk dress , glittering all over with gold and silver , and after him his sons , the Princess , and her daughters ; they all threw themselves /z/ on the ground before the Chief Lama , who merely returned their salutation by waving his hand . After this levie there was a solemn prayer ; in the midst of which dishes of milk , tea , and boiled meat , were handed round ,  --  the common people all the while prostrating themselves , with their foreheads touching the earth , or at least their caps , which they seemed to throw down before them on purpose . " The conclusion of the ceremony was announced by the images being taken from the altars , the hangings rolled up , and the priests pouring holy water over /z/ the hands of the worshippers , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and washed their faces with the rest . The water is mixed with saffron and sugar , and every Calmuck who receives it , pays in return the value of a small copper coin . Towards evening I visited the market , whither the festival had attracted a number of Russian and Armenian traders . There were about fifty open tents or booths ; the wares were spread on the ground , and all around were Calmuck purchasers , kneeling down and closely examining their quality . I inquired of the merchants whether they were often robbed , and I was told in reply , that they did not recollect that a theft had happened for years past , although only a single watchman is left at night to guard all the tents , and , of course , nothing can be easier than to obtain an entrance into them . ' * On his second visit to the Tartars , Mr. Bergmann had an opportunity of becoming acquainted with one of the less agreeable circumstances of Nomadic life ,  --  a march in wet weather . He had returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracted to return to the Steppes :  --  " In Sarepta I could neither eat nor sleep ; but I no sooner foimd myself once more upon my couch of felt than all was well again ; and I rejoiced when , with the dawnmg light , the great kettle was put on for a Calmuck tea . I know not whether it is the purity of the /z/ air , or something in this Nomadic sort of life , that agrees so well with me . " I found the horde just on the point of breaking up their encampment to seek fresh pastures ; and since my arrival had been unexpected , a camel and a horse had to be got ready for me . Troops of horses , cattle , and camels , were in motion from every quarter ; the tent of the Prince was being taken to pieces , and he was seated with his wife before the skeleton of his palace , when I approached and made my proper Calmuck salutations , and presented to the Princess a small barrel of grapes . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in about seven hours ,  --  a slowness of progress which must be attributed to the pace of the loaded camels . It is of no use to attempt to ride before them , since one would have , after all , to wait till they came up , and might run the risk of losing them . As soon as we arrived at our new resting place , our tent was pitched , the kettle put on , and in half an hour the meal was ready . I then went to the Charuk , or prayer tent , to seek out some of my old acquaintance , and on my way I was struck by the sight of a Burchan , just set up . Three poles , tied together at the top , and spread out widely at the bottom , with a piece of felt thrown over them , formed a kind of small tent , in the entrance of which was placed the idol . I had often noticed those burchans before , and knew /z/ that they were set up for the ceremonial of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved to do so this time ; and after I had been riding slowly up and down for an hour , a crowd of priests approached , and seated themselves in two rows , extending from the entrance of the tent , having first kindled a fire at a little distance . Accuser and accused then advanced , followed by a considerable number of their respective friends , and disputing all the way along , and even for some time after they had reached the sacred spot . " At length one of the parties , with a very voluble speech , of which I understood little , prostrated himself three times on the earth , and then advancing , touched the image with his forehead . This was all ; the idol was now taken away , and the assembly dispersed . I was told the quarrel had been merely about a few rubles . " The following morning it was intended we should continue our wanderings , but the rain poured in such torrents , that it seemed unadvisable to keep to this plan . A weather prophet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would clear up ; and it was resolved , in consequence , that we should proceed . Horses and cattle were put in motion , and we set off , but made very little progress indeed ; and as the rain continued unceasingly the whole day , I could not help in my heart many times cursing the prophet . The poor little children were , however , the most to be /z/ pitied ; for they were packed in the customary man ner , in boxes , placed upon the backs of the camels , and so tightly wedged in , that they could hardly move hand or foot . Many had forced out their heads from beneath their felt coverings , and were often all bleeding , from the friction of the wood-works and cords that confined them . " It is not , however , the rainy weather only that is productive of annoyance to this migratory people . The summer is often a season of much more severe suffering . Although the dews are heavy , the almost total absence of shade leaves the country exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , which rises and sets like a great globe of fire . In the hot season , the surface of the ground becomes browner and browner , till it is sometimes at last perfectly black . Men and cattle assume a lean and haggard look ; their tanned skin hangs in wrinkled folds ; the ponds and many of the wells dry up ; the lakes become mere sandy hollows ; and guards have to be set over such springs as remain , lest they should be drunk up ; not a breath of air is stirring ; and the least movement , even of a bird , raises a choking cloud of black dust . At this season , a horde is seldom able to proceed as much as ten miles in a day ; and in winter their march is often obstructed by heavy falls of snow , so that their longest journeys are often made in spring and autumn , the seasons when rain is most frequent . /z/ When the weather is quite fine , the migration has the appearance of a festival ; the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxen , and the animating cries of their leaders . The people also put on their best clothes ; but when there is fear of rain , it is not uncommon to see them riding half naked ; as a Tartar , who can not afford many changes of clothing , would always rather ride bareheaded , or thrust his naked feet into the stirrups , than run any risk of spoiling his cap or his boots , which , on such occasions , he covers up carefully under his felt cloak . Young children are , as we have seen , usually packed into baskets , and dangled over the backs of a camel , but the sucking infants are carried before their mothers on horseback ; boys of six or seven years , and old women of eighty , are often able to ride their fifteen miles without stopping . The favorite diversion of these wandering Tartar tribes is precisely that of many of our highest aristocracy , and their imitators in various classes , namely , horse-racing ; with the difference only , that the Tartar pursues it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sake of the amusement and the honor only , whilst the English nobleman who ' * goes on the turf , " does so often enough with a view to pecuniary profit ; thus turning it into a trade , and not always a very honest one . Among the Tartars , the winning horse belongs by " right divine " to the Prince , and the /z/ owner receives only a robe of honor , for the value of the horse and the victory together . The run is generally as much as fifteen or twenty miles ; and with the first glimmer of morning light , the Prince and the other spectators take their places near the appointed goal ,  --  two or three tents being pitched , if possible , on an eminence commanding a view over a considerable extent of country . The approach of the horses can be perceived from a great distance , by the clouds of dust and the clamor and confused cries of the men , and the crowd surrounding them . As many as five hundred horses are sometimes entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in sight , the spectators gallop oflf to join them , and accompany them in grand triumph to the goal . The victory is afterwards celebrated by a banquet , and the wooden bowls passed freely round in honor of their exploits ; for which honor , as in other cases , it sometimes happens the victors pay the forfeit of their lives . The Tartars have also other social diversions ,  - -  dancing , games of various kinds , and grand drinking bouts ; at which , however , it does not appear that any disorder takes place , though immense numbers of people are assembled . Each brings with him his contribution of brandy and kumys , and the meeting is held under the open sky ; the girls sing songs , and , at a given signal , every one must drain his bowl . /z/ In the long winter evenings , also , the interior of a Cahnuck tent is often enlivened , especially among the rich , by the performance of singers , dancers , and the tellers of stories ; and the young girls amuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies of rank , with a favorite game , which consists principally in pitching little balls of bread into the mouths of their servants , who stand holding them wide open on purpose , and are very skilful at catching what is thrown . The winter evenings are also often chosen by the young men for hunting parties , to pursue the boar and other wild animals of the Steppe . The Buddhist religion has introduced among the Mongol races more of what may be called literary culture , than might have been expected in their stage of civilisation . The knowledge of the arts of reading and writing is very generally diflfused among them , as the lamas are very diligent in giving instruction ; they have two kinds of writing , one used only for the sacred books , and another in which their more limited stock of profane literature , the traditions of heroes and great leaders of their race , are preserved . They have also poems of a pathetic character : such as , the lamentation of a young wife for the absence of her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or of a girl mourning for the loss of her lover ; as well as others of a more animated and inspiring strain . Of these , some of the most celebrated are the songs of /z/ Jangar , and his twelve heroes , a number that may remind the reader of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table . The poet who composed these songs Was at all events a very wonderful personage ; for it is a notorious fact , or at least every Calmuck knows , that after lying three days and three nights buried on the Steppe , and when the dogs had begun to gnaw his bones , he got up again , and returned to his tent , where he began to sing at such a rate as no poet before or since ever did , for three days and three nights , without stopping , and got through three hundred and sixty songs  --  somewhat too much , perhaps , of a good thing . /z/ Amono inhabitants of the same or similar countries , the Ufe of the settled cultivator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that of the Nomadic herdsman ; as on Caesar 's first visit to Britain he found the inhabitants of the southern parts of the island , who possessed corn-fields , in a much more advanced state than those of the middle and northern districts , who still lived on the milk and flesh of their flocks and herds . But in tropical countries , where the quickness and luxuriance of vegetation is so great , that plants may almost be seen to grow , so little skill or industry is requisite to enable man to live by the cultivation of the soil , that it forms the easiest transition from the life of the mere hunter or fruit eater , which was everywhere the first state . The agricultural nations of Western Africa and Nigritia are by no means in a higher state of civilisation than the pastoral races who roam over the great table land of Central /z/ Asia , or than the wandering Tuaricks and Tibboos of the great African Desert . The term savage , which we use to express the earliest condition of the human race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sense in which the same word is used , it always seems to imply some fierceness of character , and not merely a state of simplicity and ignorance ; so that it sounds like a contradiction to say , that a mild and inoffensive race , such , for instance , as many who inhabit islands on the Pacific , is a race of savages , and that a fierce and cruel people , like the Ashantees , is not so ; yet this is unavoidable , for we use the term not to describe the moral character of a people , but their want of culture . The old-fashioned phrase of " wild man " would be , perhaps , preferable . As a general rule , however , an improved character does accompany an increase of knowledge ; and where this is not the case , we shall always find that some adverse circumstance has interfered with the natural progress of improvement . The ferocity and general degradation of character among the natives of the maritime countries of Western Africa , would be extremely perplexing , were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slave trade , and of all the vice , misery , and degradation , which it brings with it . " Throughout Negroland , ** says Dr. Prichard , in his valuable work on the " Natural History of Man , " " and /z/ especially in this part of it , the inhabitants of one district , the dwellers on one mountain , are ever on the watch to seize the wives and children of neighboring clans , and sell them to strangers ; many sell their own . ' Every recess , and almost every retired comer of the land , has been the scene of this hateful traffic and of slaughter , not to be excused or palliated by the spirit of warfare , but perpetrated in cold blood , and for the love of gain/* Southern Africa , at the time of its discovery by Europeans , was occupied by a people in exactly the same condition as the Mongol races of Central Asia . They were divided into many tribes , under the patriarchal government of chiefs or elders ; they wandered about with numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , constructed of poles , or boughs , covered with rush mats , which could be taken down and carried by pack oxen . The Bushmen , the descendants of these people , in consequence of the wars with Europeans , and the cruel treatment they have experienced from the past colonists , have fallen from the pastoral state back to that of hunters , and , indeed , of robbers , for a part of their subsistence is derived from plunder . From peaceful shepherds and herdsmen they have become predatory savages ; and that their present miserable and degraded condition is the consequence of these unfortunate circumstances , and not of any natural deficiency , js evident , since /z/ those who have been converted to Christianity , and made the objects of benevolent care , have exhibited as much , or perhaps more than any other people , its happy influence both in their moral character , and in the increased prosperity of their outward condition . The Gallas are a wild race of wandering herdsmen , inhabiting vast plains south of Abyssinia , spreading to a considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers have of late increased so much , that they axe regarded as very formidable to Abyssinia , which they seem likely to overrun . They are divided , as pece in this stage usually are , into tribes , independent of each other , and , in some particulars , resemble the Caffres , another half Nomadic and warlike race , inhabiting South-Eastem Africa ; a people in many respects far above , the merely savage state . Besides their flocks and herds , they have a knowledge of the rudiments of many arts , practise agriculture know the use of iron and copper , and manufacture from these metals many articles of use and ornament . They also make articles of earthenware from sand and clay , and , in their fields and gardens , grow maize , millet , beans , and water-melons . They are among the handsomest nations of this continent , being tall , strongly made , finely proportioned , and with the high forehead and prominent nose of the Europeans . The Bechuanas are of the same family as the Caf &es,; and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country of one tribe the missionary Mr. Campbell , who penetrated farther into the country in this direction than any other traveller , saw fields of corn several hundred acres in extent , and a town of several thousand inhabitants . A hundred and sixty miles north-east of these , he found a still larger city of a people called the Murutsi , who build their houses with masonry , and ornament them with pillars and mouldings , and manufacture knives and razors of a kind of steel . Beyond these , again , in the same direction , he heard of a people of whom it was said that " they wear clothes , ride on elephants , climb into their houses , and are gods ,  --  an expression denoting at least the speaker 's notion of their superiority to the natives with whom he was acquainted . At the time when the Portuguese first settled in Africa , much was said of fierce Nomadic races , called Jagas , who inhabited the high plains eastward of Loanga and Congo ; but little is known of these people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Atlantic Ocean to the confines of Egypt , is inhabited by many wandering tribes , some of foreign descent , others of ancient African race , subsisting partly on the produce of their sheep , goats , and camels , but more by plunder and by the sale of slaves , whom they seize and carry oflf from the natives of the interior . Of these tribes , one of the most remarkable is that of the Tuaricks , a very handsome qwq /z/ race , with an air of lofty independence , in their manners , and a dashing military bearing that is very imposing . They are said to belong to the great original Lybian family , of which the warlike Kabyls of the Atlas mountains are also a branch . They have no resemblance to the negro , not even the black skin ; for though their complexions are embrowned by the burning sun , the parts of their skin which are constantly covered , are as white as those of most Europeans ; and their appearance is extremely striking and picturesque , as they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall camels , called Maherries , which they manage with great dexterity , firing while mounted , and hitting their mark whilst going at full speed . They wear a loose shirt or frock of blue , or blue and white cotton , or sometimes of bright scarlet or striped silk , confined by a broad belt , full striped cotton trowsers , turbans of various gaudy colors , and sandals of black leather with scarlet thongs , elegandy embroidered ; but the most peculiar feature of their costume is a blue or white cloth , passed over the face , and covering it closely up as high as the eyes . Their original inducement to this singular custom they appear to have forgotten , but say it must be right , as it was the fashion of their forefathers . They are fully armed ,  --  rhaving straight , long swords , daggers suspended to their wrists , light spears , about six feet long , made sometimes of iron , inlaid with brass , and some- /z/ tunes of wood , but always highly ornamented . Be* - ides these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddles , and usually a long gun . Which is very effective in their hands . Round their necks , arms , and legs , across the breast , in fact , wherever they can find room for them , the Tuaricks wear an almost countless number of charms ; their and guns even have their share , and in the very folds of their turbans scraps of holy writings are concecded . They speak the Berber ,  --  a very ancient African language  --  and are conscious and proud of its antiquity , declaring that Noah spoke it in preference to any other . Although very bold and warlike , it does not appear that they are unnecessarily cruel , and they never show to any one anything like servility . They will not kiss the hand of a superior , but merely advance and shake it , and then retire a few steps , looking faim full in the face . . Of what might be called their domestic habits little or nothing is known , as they are only met with occasionally in crossing the Great Desert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bomou and ezzan ; but from their general intelligence and their aptitude for trade , and freedom from any degrading vice , it is probable , that should any European nation ever open an extensive intercourse with the interior of Africa , they might become highly civilized . Another wandering race , which divides with that of ttFE IN AFRICA . 66 the Tuaricks the empire of the vast desert , and like them levies contributions on passing caravans , is that of the Tibboo , also a handsome people , and totally unlike the negro , in all but the color of the skin . The women are often quite beautiful , unless we should think their bright black complexions deprived them of any claim to the epithet . They are mostly prettily attired in colored shawls , arranged with taste and some regard to decorum , yet showing to advantage their exquisitely moulded figures . Their long , black , plaited tresses , and jetty skins , are adorned with red coral , their delicate waists and ankles glitter with silver ornaments , and they have generally an appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition . They subsist partly on the produce of their flocks , as well as on dates and a little com , but make no scruple to plunder whenever they can find an opportunity , and , like all the nations of Northern Africa , trafiic with slaves . We need no other explanation of the general barbarism of this country than the prevalence of this practice . Nomadic tribes of Arabs are also found in the northem parts of the Desert , whose manner of life is that of all people similarly circumstanced . They retnove their tents wherever pasturage , or any other inducement , may offer itself . Their camels are laden with the tents , cooking utensils , and women and children : and the men . walk before , driving the flocks , or // sometimes rid on horseback , without bridle or saddle . At night the flocks are guarded by fierce dogs , almost like wolves , though of a whitish color , who howl rather than bark whenever a stranger approaches . Whenever it is possible , the tents are pitched in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and far between in the Sahara , that a week often elapses withput the sheep being allowed to drink . When they find a spot of ground capable of cultivation , the Arabs sow on it a scanty stock of corn , after turning up the ground with a hoe , and these spots are usually respected , it is said , by other wanderers ; but should the Arabs happen to be at war with the Bashaw of Tripoli , he is sure to destroy their crops , and to avoid this , they often gather them in when the com is not nearly ripe , and conisequently will not serve for seed for the following year . When the date season " begins , they come and pitch their tents near Tripoli , where they can purchase this fruit , as it forms an important article of subsistence , and they also use the milk of the camels and sheep , and make butter and cheese much in the same manner as the Mongols . From the wool of their sheep the women manufacture ' strong shawl-like wrappers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the wodl and hair of their sheep and goats are also made into tents and sacks to carry their corn and merchandise . The looms of the Arab women stand on the ground , and /z/ they have no shuttles , but pass the thread through their fingers in a very laborious manner ; so that what with cooking and other employments , they have not much idle time on their hands ; but the men do scarcely any work inside the tent , and appear not always free from ennui ,  --  the torment generally of more civilized communities . Central Africa is traversed across its whole breadth by a chain of mountains , called , generally , the Mountains of the Moon , of which the western part , the chain of Kong , is rather a plateau , or high table land , than a chain of hills , presenting three lofty fronts towards the sea , and consisting of terraces or mountainous uplands . The country along the sea-coast is low and flat , so that for hundreds of leagues the tops of the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water ; but on advancing further up the rivers , its general appearance is uncommonly beautiful and attractive : it is covered with stately and umbrageous trees ; the rugged appearance of the mountains is softened by the lively verdure with which they are clothed , and their majestic irregular forms , and the huge masses of light and shade projected from their sides , give it a grand and picturesque aspect . The forests are dense and magnificent , and almost impenetrable from the exuberant growth of gigantic creepers , which chain tree to tree , and frequently ren- 8ft PASTORAL AND AGRICULTURAL der it necessary to cut a passage througb ihem with a batchet . The matted mass of foliage in many parts permits no ray of sunshine to pierce the awful gloom , which the imagination of the negroes peoples with evil spirits ; and a deathlike stillness reigns , broken cmly from time to time by a sudden- flight of parrots or other gregarious birds . Sometimes a partial opening will admit a sudden blaze light frcon.the vertical sun , and dazzle the eye with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honor of the dark and pathless woods , as the taraveller plunges into their recesses . The paths through these forests to the native settlements are purposely made as intricate as possible , and they are often flooded by water that has accumulated in the hollows and slopes , or crossed by monstrous larees which have fallen to the earth in a state ot decay , exhibiting every ste of decomposition . Sometimes the feet sink deep in masses of rotten wood dust , and often they are pierced with sharp pointed thorns of a fearful growth . Howlings and fetid effluvia give frequent indications of the presence of wild beasts , even when they are not seen ; and the exhalations from the swamps are of the most noxious and even fatal character . Yet even here , in the inmost recesses of these woods , the natives often choose to establish their abode ,  - -  preferring the danger of wild beasts or poisonous miasma to the neighborhood of their fellow men . /z/ On account of the prevalence of the terrible slavetrade , security is generally the first point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village . The bank of some small river or creek , lined with thick mangroves , and therefore difficult of access , is frequently selected ; but where this can not be found , a small piece of ground is cleared in the depths of an almost impenetrable wood ; and the only approach made to it is one narrow footpath , often carried in a winding direction round the place ; so that a traveller passing through these vast forests might suppose himself far from any human habitation , when he was really within a few yards of a town . Such a situation is , of course , terribly unhealthy to Europeans , as the breeze which comes through the woods in the morning and evening , laden with moisture , renders them often extremely chilly , but dies away in the middle of the day , leaving them intolerably close . When any great epidemic sickness occurs among the natives , from this cause or the vicinity of swamps , they immediately attribute it to witchcraft , and , if possible , abandon their town . Often in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come upon the ruins of an African village , which has been either forsaken from this cause , or the inhabitants killed or carried off as slaves . " Our route , " says a visitor to the Ashantee country , * Dupuis*0 Journal of a Residence in Ashantee. /z/ " still lay through the forest , amidst pillars of wood of mighty dimensions , cemented together into a rich entangled web , impervious to a single ray of the noonday sun . This grand awning was inwreathed in folds by various plants of a migratory kind , and particularly by that sort of fibrous stem which resembles cable ropes . A morass intersected the path , in which mud predominated more than water ; and beyond this , about an hour 's march , we crossed a little stream and entered Yankomady . All that now remains of this village is a few bamboo huts ; some palm and plantain trees , choked up with the rank growth of cane and jungle , were the only relics left of its plantations ; or rather , in spite of the exterminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the surface of utter devastation . Some spots appeared in the neighborhood , where clusters of the largest trees had been overthrown by the violence of tempests , thereby dragging in their descent a whole army of surrounding objects , or crushing into splinters those limbs that were incapable of sustaining the accumulated pressure , until a sufficient bearing was gained on the barren wrecks of many trunks . Not unfrequenlly these threatening avalanches were suspended in various angular positions , supported only by numerous bands and links of forest cordage , entwined in friendly embraces among the trunks . " Now and then the scenery of the forest is enlivened r /z/ by a clear sparkling stream , over-arched by lofty trees , through whose intertwining branches the beams of the noon-day sun here and there find an entrance , and glitter with a golden effulgence on ** brilliant little rocks , and shelving slabs of granite , iron stone , and mica , and mixed with pure white sand ; while parties of women and girls skip about among the rocks , and laving their limbs in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a group of Naiads . " The Ashantee country , from the latitude of about seven degrees north , has been described as one vast rampart of vegetation , down to the water 's edge  --  extending east and west from Aguassim to Ahanta , in the form of one compact forest , intersected by the most capricious and serpentine paths . The villages mostly consist of about forty or fifty huts , built in a circle , with a space in the middle for the pulaver house or town hall . They are placed so close to each other that if one happens to catch fire the whole town can hardly escape being burnt ; arid considering their materials , such an accident can not be , one would suppose , very rare . The huts are built either circular or square , and no one but the king is allowed to have more than one story . Four strong posts are sunk about a foot and a half into the ground , with smaller ones between at the distance of about two feet ; and the spaces filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six feet /z/ high , and plastered inside and out with clay , and frequently moistened to prevent their drying too quickly before the roof is put on . The roof is made of a conical form , with the branches of a species of bamboo , thatched with long grass , and , projecting a few feet beyond the wall , forms a kind of piazza which affords a shelter from the rain , as well as a pleasant lounging place for dry weather , and where the natives spend much of their time , swinging in hammocks , or reclining on mats on a bank of earth raised about a foot and a half high , and running all round the house except at the entrance . These houses have mostly two openings opposite to each other , to afford a current of air , as well as to admit light ; and there is seldom any other place of exit for the smoke of the fire . A mat let down before the opening constitutes the door , and the mansion contains little more furniture than a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , an iron pot , a kettle for water , and a few baskets and calibashes . The larger towns form on.e avenue or street , with narrow diverging paths , and very extensive plantations round them ; and beyond lies the thicket , peopled with lions , panthers , hyenas , and other formidable beasts of prey . Clearing the ground for the reception of grain is , where vegetation is so rapid and exuberant , of course the chief difficulty of the cultivator . When a suitable /z/ spot has been selected , the natives go into the forest , just before the rainy season , and cut down the trees , the smaller to the roots , the larger some feet above the ground . They then collect the loppings into heaps , and set fire to them , vrhen the greater part , including the stumps , are mostly consumed . The flames , indeed , spread with a rapidity that is often exceedingly dangerous to the surrounding country , and at any other season might be fatal . The torrents of rain that fall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when the earth has been thoroughly soaked and manured by the scattered ashes , the people throw in their rice or other grain , but they never turn over the ground , or even give themselves the trouble to grub up the roots , or the tendrils branching from them , but scratch over a little soil , and leave the grain to its fate . The harvest is reaped four months after seed time ; but long before this , numbers of old people and children are sent into the fields to drive away the ricebirds which make their appearance in swarms , as soon as the rice is in ear . The rice is cut with a common knife , and then tied into bundles and hung on the stumps of trees left standing ; these bundles are afterwards laid on the ground and beaten gently with small sticks , whilst a number of men stand round and keep up a draught of air , by swinging mats backwards and forwards , to blow away the chafi* . The com is always kept whole , and pounded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily occupations of the women , who generally use for the purpose a wooden mortar and stakes four or five feet long . The grain is sown on fresh ground every year for four or five years , after which the first is used again ; and the plantation is cultivated by all the inhabitants of a village in common , and the produce divided according to the numbers of each family . Besides this common land , however , individuals are at liberty to cultivate land for their own exclusive use , as they frequently do . The headman , or chief of each village , claims a tribute of as much rice as will reach up to his mouth when he is standing upright ; but as he is expected to entertain all strangers who may come as friends to the village , the tribute scarcely equals the expenses of his hospitality . The European method of dividing the year into four seasons is not applicable to this part of Africa , which has but two , the rainy and the dry . The time of day is marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denote the time from sunset to midnight , the people say , " He is gone into the water ; " meaning , of course , the waves of the Atlantic : and from midnight to morning , " He lives in the bush . " The ages of children are reckoned by rice harvests . In the wet season the rain sometimes continues for thirty hours without any intermission ; but at others , for not more than twelve , being followed by an interval of clear , cool , and delightful weather . This season is usually /z/ ushered in by tremendous tempests , called tornadoes  - -  violent gusts of wind , attended by thunder and lightning , as well as torrents of rain . A- small dark cloud is first seen on the verge of the eastern horizon , and several faint flashes of lightning in quick succession , with distant mutterings of thunder . The clouds now become more dense , appearing piled in huge masses upon each other , increasing gradually in blackness , till the whole heaven appears wrapped in the pitchy darkness of the deepest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the west . Man and beast fly to the nearest shelter , and presently the thundering storm bursts with a tremendous uproar that can not be described . Immediately after a tornado the atmosphere is often so clear that remote objects appear as if brought within half their usual distance :  --  " The groves , the mountain tops , the headland heights . Stand all apparent ,  --  not a vapor streaks The boundless blue . " Sometimes a dry parching wind prevails , which renders the weather insufierably hot , and the atmosphere so thick and hazy , that the stars , usually so brilliant , can scarcely be seen , and the sun appears only for a few hours about noon . Vegetables of every kind sufier terribly from this hot wind , tender plants are killed by it , and even the most hardy feel its baleful influence . The lemon , orange , and lime trees droop , their leaves /z/ wither ; the grass dries up like hay ; even the sides and decks of ships on the coast open and become leaky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parts of the country which are free from wood , grass growing to the height of six or eight feet frequently takes fire , and the only chance which a traveller has in these cases to escape destruction is by striking a light and kindling another fire , so that by the time the flames of the first reach him , there may be a spot burnt clear , in which he may find a refuge . It was probably under this aspect that the Carthaginian traveller , Hanno , first saw this country , when he described it as " burning with fires and perfumes , the streams of fire falling into the sea . The country was impassable , " he adds , " on account of its great heat , and we sailed quickly thence , being much terrified . Passing on for four or five days we discovered a country full of fire ; in the middle was a lofty fire , larger than the rest , which seemed to touch the stars . " * Ashantee has now been for more than a hundred years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sway all lesser chiefs have been subjected . The monarch is of course despotic , although a sort of aristocracy exists , or did exist a few years ago , which exercised some control over his royal will , at all events , in questions of war . The nobles are exempt from - Falconer 's Voyage of Hanno. r /z/ capital punishment , but liable to be deprived of their property at the pleasure of the sovereign , who is , of course , by no means inclined to forget this part of his prerogative , so that the aristocracy is becoming daily more select , for few people have much ambition to enter its ranks . Beneath these there is no other distinction but that of slave and free man ; unless we reckon as a separate class the caboceers or captains , who , besides commanding his forces in war , have the honor to execute his majesty 's commands in disposing of the heads of his subject . The rich wear a rather costly dress , or drapery of striped silk , made exactly like the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a piece of cotton cloth round their loins . The war dress of the captains is very showy , with gold ornaments , a gold breastplate a cap with gold ram 's horns , and an enormous plume of eagle 's feathers . Sometimes a lump of rock gold is worn suspended to the wrist ; for in no other country in the world  --  not even in South America  --  is gold so plentiful as in Ashantee . It is procured partly by washing the sands in the beds of the rivers and torrents , partly from mines and pits in the mountains ; and lumps of clay or rock , containing a pound or a pound and a half of the pure metal , are often brought to market . The washings of the market-place belong - to the king , as well as in some districts the exclusive right to the washings of the sands and the produce of some of the /z/ mines . His revenue is also increased by a tax on all the slaves bought to be sent to the coast , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his subjects , and , lastly , by his being the heir to all the gold belonging to deceased persons . Some of the richest of the gold mines have , it is said , never been worked , as they are considered sacred to the gods . The natives of Ashantee have made greater progress in arts and manufactures than might have been expected of a people whose manners are still so rude and ferocious . Nearly all the weapons and ornaments they use are manufactured by native smiths and goldsmiths ; and their weavers and dyers , it is said , produce cloths of such fineness , variety , and brilliancy , that they would do no discredit to an English loom . Others exhibit their dexterity in a less creditable manner , by adulterating the gold of their country in a manner that could hardly be excelled by a first-rate chemist , and by practising similar frauds . The Ashantees also carry on a rather extensive trade with the countries of the interior , as well as contrive to elude the watchfulness of the British ships cruising off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countrymen as slaves . It would be a task too painful and disgusting , to enter into a detail of the brutal excesses and terrible cruelties common among the Ashantees , and which we can not but think would never have arisen among any /z/ people who had always been in peaceable occupation of their country ; but are to be regarded as the terrible result of the long ages of war , violence , and slavery , from which they as well as other African races have suffered . They appear to have been originally driven from some country further north , by the swords of the foreign nations who poured into it about the time of the great Mahommedan conquests , and to have been thus early initiated into cruelty and bloodshed by a people in a higher state of advancement than themselves . Nothing can well exceed their ferocious disregard of human life . Every festival is celebrated by the slaughter of hundreds of human victims . One person at least must be murdered at the funeral of every free man , to " wet the grave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chief his attendants , to the number of some hundreds , male and female , are massacred . On all grand occasions , the golden ornaments and showy silken robes of the king and his chiefs are stained and smeared with human blood recently shed . " The city , " says Mr. Dupuis , who was sent on an embassy to the barbarian monarch from the British Government , " exhibited at the lime of a religious festival , the most deplorable solitude ; and the few human beings who were courageous enough to show themselves in the streets , fled at the approach of one of the king 's officers , and barricaded the doors of their huts , to /z/ escape the danger of being shot or sacrificed . The doleful cries of the women vibrated from several quarters of the city , and the death horns and drums within the palace seemed to stupify the obnoxious prisoners and foreign slaves with horror , as they contemplated the risk they were exposed to . I wandered about during this awful day , until fatigue and disgust led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not venture to stir abroad , and my Moslem acquaintance kept within the house to avoid the sight of the butcheries . Oppressed with bodily and mental fatigue , I mounted my horse and rode into the forest ; *but the business of the day was not over when I returned . In the palace only , besides those who were sacrificed in private houses and in the forest , seventy persons were put to death , and the following day a similar train of horrors succeeded . " It is scarcely necessary to add , that what we must call the religion of the Ashantees , is a very low and gross kind of idolatry ; yet , what is somewhat singular , they have the firmest belief in a future state of existence , which affords the only palliation that can be oflfered for the disgusting enormities just described . 3oth the murderers and their victims have , it is said , a perfect confidence that the persons sacrificed proceed immediately to a happier state of being . This notion may tend to lessen , in some degree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not but /z/ have a most injurious effect on the morals of the people in all respects ; and if we may trust the accounts of travellers , it is very difficult to make out what are the redeeming points in the character of the Ashantees . We can not believe , however , that any race of men is naturally inclined to the practice of atrocious wickedness ; and as the character of the Mahommedan Ashantees is strikingly superior to that of their Pagan countrymen , there is reason to think that extreme ignorance and superstition , rather than a tigerlike delight in blood , may give rise to their manifold cruelties . It is also well worthy of remark , that the people of this and the neighboring countries are in a measure cut off from much of the mental communication with each other , in which all sympathy and kindness originates , by the almost incredible number of dialects that prevail among them . Within sixty miles of the Gold Coast , no fewer than seven or eight languages are spoken by various tribes , each unintelligible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there is no mutual understanding , there can scarcely be a feeling of common humanity . Perhaps if we could trace to its source all the hatre  --  and bad feeling existing in the world , either among individuals or nations , we might find that it arose mostly from mutual ignorance and misunderstanding . /z/ On the northern shores of the Sea of Asoph we find , in the recently settled tribes of Nogay Tartars , a branch of the great Mongolian family , a very interesting example of a people who have lately abandoned the nomadic life for that of the settled tiller of the ground . The change has been made in circumstances not entirely favorable ; for they are , of course , subject to the control of the worst and most barbarous of European governments , and the chmate exposes them to extreme vicissitudes of heat and cold . Though lying in about the same latitude as the south of France , the cold of the winter is greater than we ever experience in England , and the heat of the summer almost equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sun are poured down with unmitigated fierceness . /z/ on these treeless plains ; and as neither mountains nor forests intervene to protect the country from the piercing winds that in winter blow from the Frozen Ocean and Siberia , they rage here with tremendous violence . Rain falls but very seldom , so that the country frequently suffers from drought ; but the rain , when it does come , brings forth a rapid and abundant vegetation . A great part of the territory of the Nogays consists of a fine ricli soil , sometimes as much as five or six feet deep , yielding an abundant harvest of every grain committed to it , and producing spontaneously luxuriant grass , aromatic herbs , and splendid flowers , especially tulips of every gorgeous dye , and yellow and violet-colored lilies . The word Nogay is said to signify in the Tartar language , unsettled , fugitive ; but the appellation is probably derived from that bestowed on the celebrated warrior Nogaya , who , in the year 1261 , separated himself from the great Golden Horde , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea . The tribe has since been estimated at as many as five hundred thousand kettles , or families , of whom many still lead the nomadic life about the plains of Astrachan , and among the mountains of the Caucasus ; and it is only since the year 1808 , that about sixty thousand of them have been induced to build houses , and confine themselves to one spot , i measure , however , more of necessity than of choice ; for they have the same /z/ ayersion to fixed habitations as their ancestors the Scythians and Huns of old . For many years they continued to look back with longing to their former wandering mode of life , and even made two or three attempts to resume it . On one occasion their intention had proceeded so far , that many had sold all they possessed , and bought themselyes tents , pack oxen , and wagons , such as their people had formerly used for their migrations , and had arranged a plan for rising en masse , and moving off again to the Steppes of Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they next petitioned for leave to return to their nomadic habits ; this was refused , and as they have become gradually surrounded by Russian and German husbandmen , they have been compelled to reconcile themselves to a settled life . When a Nogay Tartar is about to build himself a house , the first thing he has to do is to make the bricks ; aud for this purpose he digs out the earth to a depth of about three feet , in a space of from twelve to fifteen feet diameter ; then he brings water and short hay and straw to the place , and by making several horses gallop round and round on it many times , kneads it to a proper consistency . He then presses the clay into a wooden mould , and dries his bricks in the sun . Within the space which he has cleared , he then builds up a wall to the height of about six feet  --  VBLIC UBRARl /z/ qwq merely laying the bricks one upon another , without using any mortar , and leaving little spaces for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three or four divisions , and lays rafters across the top , over which the gable roof is made , first with beams and laths , over this with a covering of reeds and brushwood , which is then covered again with ashes to the thickness of about a foot or more , and the roof soon becomes overgrown with grass , and is impervious to rain . In the middle a hole is left for the smoke , and sometimes , though rarely , a kind of chimney built with bricks . The door has hinges and a bolt , and the windows are filled up with wooden trellis work , or in winter with a piece of thin skin , which , though allowing some Ught to pass through , is of course not transparent . In the best houses glass is sometimes used . The building is then plastered inside and outside with clay , and afterwards whitewashed . Stones are not used at all , and the wood is very scarce , and mostly bought of the Russian and German settlers , who bring it from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to confess that for the very cold whether these warm clay cottages are preferable to the old tents in which their fathers dwelt ; but in the summer they can never refrain from expressing their longing for the old movable habitation of poles and felt . They are beginning to perceive , however , that on the whole the /z/ fonner are preferable ; and every year , if not laigr , at all events better houses are built , for which more wood and iron are employed ; but two great evils remain ,  --  the quantity of smoke , which fills them so that in certain winds one can hardly breathe without lying down upon the floor , and the numbers of earth fleas by which they are infested . The interior of these cottages is divided into a fore house or kitchen , a sleeping apartment and an inner room , which , among those who have adopted the Mahommedan religion , is called the harem . The furniture and utensils are of course few and simple . In the kitchen we find , first the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then a great leathern vessel , made often of the whole skin of a young ox or calf , exactly such as are used in the Mongol tents ; then a trough used for a variety of purposes ; a bucket fastened to a rope or long pole , for drawing water ; and an article which we must call a table , though it is only about five or six inches above the floor ; this is used both in preparing food , and as a tray to serve it upon . The commoner kinds of tools  --  such as spades , shovels , saws , and gimlets  --  are also usually found in the kitchen ; and amongst the richer Nogays a few more sieves , bowls , and dishes than are possessed by the poor . There are , however , but few distinctions of this kind amaag the Nogays ; the rich man enjoys little more of convenience and luxury than his poorer neighbor ; some- /z/ times eren he endeavors to conceal his riches , and he always places his principal pride in the increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style of living . The inner apartments are furnished with woollen carpets and mats of straw or reeds , a chest for keeping money and ornaments or other valuables , mattresses , cushions , and coverlets , which are kept rolled up during the day ; and among the wealthy , towels , bedsteads , and curtains , to protect them from the gnats . The villages of these Tartars are mostly situated in the hollows , not deep enough to be called valleys , often found on the Steppes , and described as having the appearance of a pressure produced by a gigantic hand having been laid on the surface of the plain ; they are probably caused by the sinking of the lower strata , and they have the advantage of retaining the moisture long after the rest of the country has been parched up by the heat of the summer . The existence of a large pond or brook is always an inducement to build a village near it ; and sometimes an advantageous situation is found in the deep clefts or ravines which intersect the high terrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rivers that have now changed their course . The low houses covered with grass , and surrounded by haystacks and dunghills , can , notwithstanding their whitewash , often scarcely be distinguished till the traveller is in the midst of them . Each viUage has usually a Mosque , or even sometizoes /z/ two or three , but without towers or minarets , and looking little better than sheds . There are also magazines for com to which every Tartar family has to furnish a certain contribution , and a clay hut , half underground , which serves for a school-house , pria cipally for the boys intended to be brought up as priests . In form and feature the Nogay Tartar still bears traces of his Mongol origin , though mingled with others characteristic of various nations with whom his race has been associated since they left their original seat , especially with the handsome people of the Caucasus . They are mostly of middle stature and athletic figure , and their deportment is upright and even stately . The brownish yellow complexion , which in the nomadic races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great measure dependent on the degree of exposure to weather ; and the Nogay still retains the fine , regular , resplendently white teeth , which are the only beauty of the Mongol face . The women often have the delicate figure , fine eyes , and small hands and feet which distinguish the women of Circassia . Living in as simple a manner , and inhabiting a similar country , they retain the extraordinary sharpness of sight and hearing of their nomadic ancestry ; but the senses of taste , smell , and touch , appear to be very dull , a circumstance sufficiently accounted for by the smoke and the compound of smells observable in their /z/ habitations , the hardening of their skins by the sun and cold winds , ami the variety of substances , including clay , with which the children are accustomed to cover themselves . A very important part of the ordinary dress of the Nogay is furnished by the skins of his lambs and sheep , tanned , and made up by the women ; he has also a linen garment or shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rich wear pelisses of colored cotton , blue nankeen , or even silk , bound with a sash passing several times round the body , and over this in cold weather a coat or mantle of fur . A cap of blue cloth , much decorated , is worn by the higher classes , and in the summer full trowsers of white linen . In general , the fulness of their garments is neither so inconveniently abundant as that of the Turks , nor so close and scanty as that of the nations who have been said- to ** Live , with all their lordly speeches , The slayes of buttons and tight breeches. ' * The Nogays have also mantles and trowsers of scarlet cloth , which are worn on grand occasions ; and young men , who have a leaning to dandyism , sport rings of silver or brass , enriched with precious stones or cut-glass . The chief stock of finery belonging to a Tartar fa  --  /z/ mily is , however , exhibited on the persons of the young girls , who are often quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear for full dress a cap of red cloth , as high and large as a pail , hung all round with silver coins , mostly Turkish . Over the forehead hangs down a row of pieces of red coral , and at the back are introduced shells and many other ornaments . Their long black hair is plaited , and hangs down behind , finished off with two pieces of white linen twisted into a rope , and reaching to the ankle . At festivals and ' ' high solemnities " girls wear silk caftans , of blue , red , white , and all colors but black , one above another , and fastened by a broad girdle and massive silver clasps . Through the right nostril they pass a wire ring , on which small pearls are threaded , and their ear rings , of uncommon size and weight , are often connected together by a chain that hangs over the breast , and the whole costume is enriched with beads , buckles , and little dangling rolls of metal . Considering the great proportion which the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Tartar family , it is fortunate that among these people fashion has almost lost her character of fickleness , and that a Nogay belle is quite satisfied with the finery of her great-great-grandmother . The ornamental part of the young ladies ' wardrobe is also sometimes regarded as a sort of /z/ THE SEA OF ASOPH . Ill savings ' bank , to which recourse may be had by the parents in times of need . Poor girls are , of course , not embellished in quite the splendid style we have been describing ; but it is usually a principle with a Nogay father to dress his daughters as well as he can , as it enhances the price he may expect for them from the bridegroom . The market price of young ladies is calculated at so many cows . Among many other Turkish customs adopted by these people , is the general use of the veil , which to a married woman at least is considered indispensable : for the rich it is made of light thin stuff , and decorated at the ends with colored fringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Nogay also , like the Turkish women , wear wide trowsers and yellow boots , which are kept from the dirt when they go out , by stilts or wooden pattens , about three inches high , and which are also worn by the men for a similar purpose . On the whole , the Nogay s must certainly be considered as a well-dressed people ; and the poorest are scarcely worse clad than many in a similar situation unfortunately are among ourselves . In endeavoring to understand the condition of any people , the two most important points to be ascertained are , perhaps , the character of their religion , and the nature of their ordinary occupations ; as the one will generally give us an insight into their mental state , and /z/ the other enable us to fonn a correct picture of their daily life . The subject of the religion of a people beyond the merely savage state is , however , too grave and high a one to be entered upon in a little work of this nature ; and we must therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features and outward customs of that of the Nogays . The notions of mere savages on this subject are so few and rude , that their religion may almost be considered as that of children . The Nogay Tartars had adopted the Mohammedan religion long before they had abandoned their nomadic and predatory habits ; but it does not appear that it is likely to lead them to a higher or purer state of morals than that of Buddha , still professed by their Mongol brethren , might do . Of both it may be said , that they contain far more good precepts than their followers usually practise , though it may be doubted whether they generally fall as far short of their standard of right and wrong as we Cliristians do of ours . The great principle of the Mahommedan faith is resignation to the will of God ; and justice , benevolence , and self-denial , are positively enjoined by it : to submit patiently to suffering and misfortune , to be faithful to agreements , to give to those who have need , to our relations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wandering pilgrim or beggar , to ransom slaves , to be punctual in the performance of religious duties . /z/ to worship God only , and to believe that he is all-wise , all-knowing , all-sustaining , and all-merciful ; that not the smallest insect crawls on the ground without his knowledge and care  --  all this is the duty of the good Mussulman ; and one who should truly and faithfully perform it , would have a right to be considered in any country as a good and pious man . What distinguishes the Mussulman from all Pagans , as well as from large classes of Christians , is his aversion to the use of any image or picture in his religious services . The Koran forbids the representation of any living creature , and nothing of the kind is therefore ever found either in their mosques or houses . Drawings even of inanimate objects often seem to render pious Nogays uneasy ; and since they have never seen any pictures but those in the Armenian and Greek churches , they have an idea that no picture is ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every devout Nogay Mussulman is bound to pray at least five times in the twenty-four hours : the first prayer should be repeated before sunrise , and be accompanied by four prostrations to the earth ; the second , the great prayer at noon , by ten ; the third in the - afternoon , by eight ; the evening prayer at sunset , by five : and let the appointed time find him at home or at the mosque , in the street or the market-place , he instantly breaks oflF whatever business he is engaged in , and goes through the prescribed ceremonies with /z/ an appearance of profound abstraction from all worldly affairs . No noise , no spectacle can induce him to turn , his attention from his devotional duty ; to understand the prayer he utters he does not consider as essential ; he says it is sufficient if God understands . Like the Buddhist , he makes great use of the rosary , and before commencing his prayer puts off his shoes as Moses and Joshua did when they entered on holy ground ; he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mecca . The Tartars offer frequent sacrifices : on occasion of the birth of a child , at a wedding , before a journey , after a happy return , in consequence of a vow , in memory of deceased persons , &c.; ; and they make sacrifices for sin , as well as of gratitude . On these occasions the family is all assembled before the house , surrounded by neighbors and invited guests , but especially by the poor . A MoUah or priest is present , and begins the ceremony by a silent prayer . The head of the animal  --  usually a cow or a sheep  --  is then turned towards Mecca , and it is slaughtered amidst loud invo cations of the Holiest Name . The meat is then boiled , and during the time of its preparation other prayers are uttered , and many ablutions performed . The meat is distributed and consumed in the open air ; and the more persons are present to partake of the meal , the greater will be the blessing that will follow it , and the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is /z/ customary , therefore , when a sacrificial banquet is to be held , to send round a crier to announce the fact , and invite young and old , rich poor , to partake of it , . while to the sick and infirm portions are sent home . The custom of olBfering sacrifices is not originally a Mahommedan one , and is not prescribed in the Koran , but it appears to have existed from the very earliest times among all Oriental nations ; it is indeed one of the first manifestations of the feeling of religion amongst races even in the rudest  --  condition , and we may observe traces of it amongst children when they ofier to their parents a portion of the very gifts they have themselves bestowed . This may be called a sacrifice of gratitude ; the sacrifice for sin is altogether of a different nature . The Ramadhan , or great fast of the Mahommedsui year , lasts for thirty days ; and when it occurs in the summer , often involves considerable privation ; as from the time when it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing must be eaten or drunk ; and the work in the fields has consequently to be performed during the heat of the day without any refreshment . At other times the fast is comparatively easy ; and as it is allowable to eat after sunset , many of the Mussulmans make themselves amends for fasting all day by eating all night . Among the Nogays the wife begins her cooking operations often as early as at noon , /z/ and after her husband has eaten as much as he can possibly cram at one meal , wakes him up in the middle of the night to eat sftother . During the whole time of the fast no work is done that can be avoided , and every one sleeps as much as he can , so that the institution certainly does not answer its intended purpose of mortifying the flesh . The feasts , however , are more conscientiously observed . The great festival of the Bairam commences with the very smallest streak that can be seen of the first new moon after the fast of the Ramadhan . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the succeeding ones almost wholly to pleasure , although alms are all the time freely distributed to the necessitous . The art of cookery , as it exists among the Nogay Tartars , on this day puts forth all its strength , and every person that enters the house must be entertained with presents of meat , cakes , &c.; Every one puts on his best clothes ; the boys and young men mount their favorite steeds , and go galloping about exhibiting feats of horsemanship . Great processions of visitors of more mature age go from one village to another , the men on horseback , the women in wagons drawn by oxen , of course glittering in all the finery they can muster ; the little girls rejoice in swings put up for the occasion ; innumerable kisses are given and received ; through all the days no work is done but what is necessary for the care of the cattle ; and on /z/ one day the cows are left unmilked , that the calves ftiay suck their fill , and so have their share in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants of a village go out upon the open Steppe and sacrifice a sheep or a cow upon one of the grave hillocks of the ancient Mongol race , which are found in considerable numbers in many parts of them . In every Nogay village reside several moUahs of various ranks , of whom the chief is called the Mufti . It is their duty to proclaim the hour of prayer from the mosque , to lead the devotional exercises , to give explanations of the Koran , and sometimes short addresses to the people to animate them to the performance of religious duties ; to ofiiciate at weddings , at sacrifices by the sick and dying ; to keep school ; to illuminate the mosque , and to prepare amulets or charms to preserve men and cattle from harm ; for all which services they receive payment in corn , cattle , tallow , and skins , and occasionally in money . The priests are married , if they please , to more wives than one ; and they are allowed to possess and cultivate land , and take part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long white linen cloth , which they wear wound round their caps in the fonn of a turban , and on festal occasions by a robe of fine white woollen stuff , confined by a girdle , in which is stuck /z/ the metal inkstand and reed pen , which indicates their possession of the accomplishment of writing . These MoUahs stand by no means so high in the estimation of the people as the Lamas of the Mongols ; and " their reputation for sanctity is rivalled or surpassed by that of the Hadjis , who have performed the difficult and meritorious act of a pilgrimage to Mecca , which very few of the Nogay Tartars are able to- The journey seldom takes , it is said , less than a year , or costs less than two hundred ducats ,  --  a considerable sum for so poor a people ; and many therefore conapound for the omission of the duty , by contributing to the expenses of those who are willing to undertake it . One route is by one of the seaports of the Crimea to Odessa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the Red Sea to Medina and Mecca , in company with the great Egyptian caravan ; but the more usual course is through Syria and the Arabian Desert . The poor pilgrims are exposed on the journey to manifold dangers and privations ; to hunger and thirst , heat and cold and fatigue , as well as to the infectious diseases and to the extortions of the Turkish Pashas in every province they pass through , and the exactions of the Arab military escort , which , whether they wish it or not , they are compelled to take and pay for ; and it is no very uncommon occurrence for them to be robbed , and even murdered , before they reach the holy city ,  --  the goal of their wishes , and the /z/ reward of all their sufferings . Many never return ; but those who do , value themselves not a little for the remainder of their days on the feat they have performed , regarding themselves , and being regarded by others , as finished saints . The Hadji , it is said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the observance of the outward and ceremonial parts of his religion , and the most neglectful of its higher spiritual duties . The Nogay settlers still retain enough of their old habits to prefer greatly the employments that fall to them as herdsmen to all farming operations . The care of the cattle on the Steppes , the trade carried on with them at the fairs in the neighborhood , and the breaking in and training the wild horses and oxen for the work required of them , are , and will probably continue for some time to be , their favorite occupations . The numbers of their herds are usually greater than they ought to be in proportion to their land , as the price of them is excessively low , and they have no market for their milk and butter ; the latter , indeed , is seldom good enough to be worth buying . Cheese they only make for their own use ; and the running about over the wide Steppe to search for cattle that have strayed , and the driving them about to distant markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The latter business , however , is a labor of love to the Nogay , as it gives him again a taste of the rambling life to which he looks back so fondly , and he often goes /z/ dragging his cattle about from one market to another rather with a view to pleasure than to business . What his pleasure can be it is often dif &cult; to make out , for he is exposed to many sUghts and annoyances in his dealings with the Russians and Germans ; he takes no part in their dancing and drinking ; contents himself with the dry , roasted com that he has brought with him from home ; prepares his frugal meal , and sleeps ; , wrapped in his sheepskins , on the bare earth under the open sky , and exposes himself to cold and wet and various hardships , for the mere enjoyment of going to the fair . If he can make such a barter with his cattle that he shall not be a positive loser , he is quite satisfied with this employment of his time ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on at the making of bargains in which he has no concern . It is even by no means unusual for these Tartars to arrive . at the place where a fair is to be held , eight days before the time ; and many of them pass the greater part of the year in going from one to another . The cattle belonging to every village is generally divided into two or three herds , and driven out on the Steppe by the several owners in turn , always on horseback , for in this country horses are so cheap , that even beggars are often seen riding about , and very well mounted . The herdsman usually leaves his horse and the cattle together , and returns to the village , coming back in the evening to look after and THE SEA OF A80PH . ISl collect them  --  no easy task ; for as there are no enclosures on the almost boundless Steppe , but , at most , divisions are only marked with a ploughshare , the cattle stray in all directions , besides often doing much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Tartars breed sheep , horses , and camels , as well as homed cattle ; but the camels are by no means so serviceable to them in their present condition as when wemdering over the stony terrace lands of Asia ; and they do not appear to thrive so well on the rich pasturage of these plains as on the coarse scanty grass of Tartary and Mongolia . Most of them have a ring through the nose , through which a cord is passed , which serves to guide them ; they are harnessed in pairs , and draw immense loads of com , and other produce of the country , to the markets of Southern Russia . The Tartar women also make from their hair a very close , thick stuff , which resists all rain , and is worn by the men over their other clothing . The use of these animals is , however , much declining , as they are scarcely worth keeping , especially since they are mostly vicious and troublesome . Breeding and dealing in horses is an occupation for which the Nogay Tartar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it involves a great deal of moving about , and enables him to lead a wild , roving kind of life When out on the Steppe with /z/ his herd , he eats , drinks , and almost sleeps on horeeback . The yast herds of horses seen on the Steppe , though they all have owners , exhibit in the wild freedom and grace of their movements a proud unconsciousness of their dependent state . It is , indeed , not uncommon to hear them called wild horses ; but , correctly speaking , wild horses are not met with nearer than on the plains by the sea of Aral . In appearance and habits , however , there is no discoverable difference between them . The Nogay horses range over a wide extent of country , and subsist on a poorer kind , of pasturage than would be necessary for horned cattle . From Easter to October they remain grazing day and night on the Steppe ; but during the winter months they are usually taken into a sort of shelter for the night , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the snow with their feet to get at the scanty grass beneath . The shelter is nothing hke a stable , but merely an enclosed space , with an earthen mound , and a sort of roof towards the north , to keep off the most piercing wind . In the spring , these horses have terrible battles to jsustain , sometimes with the wolves , and sometimes with the horses of other herds . They rush at each other with tails and manes erect , like angry lions , screaming and howling , too , like wild beasts , and tearing each other with their teeth . Upon the wolves /z/ they often charge in a solid phalanx ,  --  and trample them under their feet . But should their first attack fail , the poor horses have a bad chance , for the wolves , at this season half famished , fly at their throats in packs often or twelve at a time , and never leave them till they have dragged them to the ground . On the whole , the sheep is , as in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers ; and they accordingly rear immense flocks of what is called the fat-tailed kind ; but even these must be diminished as the land comes to be employed moVe and more for the purposes of agriculture . The Nogays have a proverb that says , ** God gave the Russians a plough , but the Tartars a wheel ; " by which they mean to express their contempt for the agricultural life , which binds man to a certain spot , instead of allowing him to foam over many lands ; and requires also more labor than that of the shepherd or herdsman . Little as this life is agreeable to their taste , however , they are beginning to perceive that , even in the Steppes , it is more advantageous . The . Nogay may have as much land as he chooses to cultivate ; and , if he pleases , a certain quantity of com for seed from the Russian government , which is very desirous of turning these vast plains to greater profit by encouraging settlers upon them . Should he stand in need of farming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain them from a richer neighbor , in exchange for a certain amount of service . The lands tilled by the people of one viUage lie close together , but frequently so far from the village itself , that at seed and harvest time the laborers have to bivouac on the open field , as they can not go and return on the same day . They usually pitch tents , where they carry on their cooking operations , and are supplied from time to time from the village with com , meat , buttermilk , water , and whatever else they require . The ploughing time is generally the month of March , with which the Nogay year commences , but the first operation of Tartar husbandry is often to burn away the weeds that in some places shoot up to such a height as to hide a man on horseback . These burnings are very advantageous , as they not only rid the soil of its encumbrances , but manure it for a new crop ; but they must be managed very cautiously , as when a fire is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say where it will slop . In some cases , it has been known to sweep along for hundreds of miles , - destroying cattle and corn-fields and even whole villages , in its course ; but this has been in summer , when the grass was excessively dry . The only safe plan is to dig a deep , wide trench , round the space intended to be burnt ; but even this will be sometimes /z/ insufficient to arrest the progress of the flames , as the wind will carry the burning particles over it The ploughs used by the Nogays are excessively clumsy , and require ten or twelve oxen to draw them . The sower usually walks first , and scatters the seed ; the plough follows , and the harrow , consisting of a log of wood , is dragged after the plough , to crush the large lumps of earth . Ploughshares , sickles , and scythes , and all iron implements , are bought by the Tartars from the Russians ; but whatever is made of wood is of home manufacture , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . In reaping , the Nogays follow one of many customs which they appear to have derived from the ancient Israelites : " And when ye reap the field , ye shall not reap wholly the comers of your field , neither shall ye gather the gleanings of your harvests , and neither shall ye glean your vineyard , nor gather every grape of the vineyard ; ye shall leave them for the poor and the stsanger. ' * ( Levit. xix . ; Exod. x . ) They leave a portion of com standing at one end of the field . In threshing , also , we recognize the mode alluded to by the prophet Isaiah , as practised by the Hebrews . A circular space before the house is cleared of grass and dust , sprinkled with water , and a stake driven into the middle of it . The sheaves of com are then spread round it , and several horses attached to a string , one end of which is made fast to the stake . They are then driven round and /z/ lound , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at last up to the centre of the circle . They are then turned in a contrary direction , and driven round again , so as to unwind it . The corn is preserved in round pits , dug near the house , of about four feet in diameter at the bottom , but at the top only wide enough to allow a man to pass through . Into these pits the com is poured , and they are then covered with hay and boards , and over these again with earth , and the grass soon grows over the top , so as to render the spot unrecognizable to a stranger , who may go driving or galloping over the magazine , without ever suspecting its presence . A Nogay family that owns a house , and has sheep and com in abundance , oxen for the labors of the field , and milch cows , can not be considered as poor , for all their real wants are supplied , and they have no idea of the many superfluities beyond their reach . There are few , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their immediate consumption , as much com and cattle to carry to market as will purchase them in exchange fruit and tea ( usually the brick tea used by the Mongol races , but for which the Nogays have to pay a much higher price ) , as well as farming implements and other tools . Some few of these people possess property to the amount of seven or eight hundred pounds ; but these are very few , and , in general , a * moderate competence " signifies , in the esti- /z/ mation of a Nogay Tartar , enough to buy a wifcj an iron kettle , a few head of cattle. , some mattresses , wooden dishes , and spoons . Has he this much , he builds himself a house , and becomes ' a respectable man . " Should his capital not be equal to such an expenditure , it is usual for him to go to service for a certain number of years , until he has earned the price of the maiden  --  we can not say whom he is wooing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is desirous of purchasing . It is not allowed that he shall serve in her family , as Jacob did for Rachel , lest the young couple have an opportunity of becoming acquainted with and attached to each other . This would be contrary to Nogay etiquette . He must remain as much as possible a stranger to her . The circumstance that , perhaps , more than any other , tends to retard the progress of the Nogays towards a true , civilisation is the position of the women , which is attributable mainly to the influence  --  in this respect , certainly injurious  --  of the Mahommedan religion . They are considered to belong wholly as property to the other sex , and to have no other duty or object in life but to serve them . The father sells his daughter , the brother the sister ; and in the division of an inheritance the females are regarded precisely in the same light as the domestic animals . Whoever obtains them in his share receives so many cattle the less , and is /z/ equally at liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a widow goes with her children to the next male heir , who may either sell her or keep her , as he thinks proper . It need not , " therefore , surprise us , that the women seldom appear to have much sense of duty towards their husbands or children , especially as a Nogay , who can afford it , thinks himself at perfect liberty to take ' three or four wives if he pleases , being allowed to do so by the precepts of the Koran . The whip is often enough resorted to , to maintain order in a family so constituted ; and the women are so accustomed to think this treatment quite in the natural order of things , that they receive rather with astonishment than gratitude any interference of a stranger in their behalf . A German traveller , who spent some years among the Nogays , mentions having once come between his host and a wife , whom he was beating till the blood came , and being asked by the lady what business it was of his ? The husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only way to manage Nogay women . " They do not and can not love us , " he added , " when we buy them , and so we must make them fear us . " This same Ali once requested his German friend to go and buy another ynfe for him , which it is not the etiquette for a man to do for himself . Two young ladies , just arrived from the Crimea , were understood to be on sale , and not being of genuine Tartar blood , were to /z/ be had cheap . The deputy wooer accordingly went to the house of the parents , and on presenting them with a piece of money , was shown into the inner apartment , where the damsels were seated , stijBf and silent , and , of course , in full dress to be viewed . The only points on which Ali required information , were , whether they were fat , and had black hair ; and as both these questions could be satisfactorily answered , he wished to close the bargain . It happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his was not the highest offer , he was unsuccessful . Ali afterwards , in a fit of pique , bought himself a very aged widow , whom he obtained as a very great bargain , but the poor old lady was so unmercifully plagued by the first younger wife , that she took the only means allowed her of obtaining her liberty ,  --  she robbed her husband ; that is , in order to induce him to drive her out of the house . Had she merely run away , no one could have taken her in . When such are the relations between a man and his wife , it is not surprising that the state of moral feeling among these oppressed women is bad enough . They seldom scruple to help themselves out of any difficulty by as many falsehoods as they find necessary , and would probably get into more mischief were they not kept so fully and constantly employed . They have , indeed , more to do than it is possible they should do properly ,  --  to spin , and make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to prepare skins , to make soap , to fetch water , to grind com , to cook , sometimes many times in a day , for guests as well as for their husbands , besides nursing the young children , and performing other indispensable duties . They are also naturally enough , considering their total want of education , and the immoderate demands made upon them , very disorderly in their habits , and often increase their labors by their total want of arrangement . It is not uncommon , for instance , when they have washed their clothes tolerably clean , for them to spread them out upon a dunghill to dry ; and when making their bread with excellent flour , to give the children bits of the dough to play with , and after these delicate morsels have been rolled about on the dirty clay floor of the hut , they are collected and kneaded up into the batch . The style of cookery in a Nogay minage is , indeed , it must be confessed , such as it is not desirable to inquire too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consequently wasteful ; but there is seldom any appearance of want . There are a few who may be regarded as paupers , and subsist almost wholly by begging , or taking advantage of the hospitality of many of their countrymen , being constant visitors at weddings , public enters tainments , and sacrifices , or wherever , from whatever cause , there appears an unusual plenty of meat . They often go from house to house with a bs , into r THE SEA OF ASOPfi. tBl which every one puts a handful of com , and sometimes they carry also an earthen pot to receive con* tributions of butter and fat . As has been mentioned , they frequently ride about on horseback , and do not even give themselves the trouble to alight at the several houses at which they call , but announce their presence by a loud doleful cry ; and as the giving of alms is a duty expressly enjoined by the Koran on all the followers of Islam , they seldom depart empty handed . Hospitality towards strangers in general has , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . change in their mode of life ; but this is not surprising , when we consider the character of almost all the travellers who find their way to this remote spot ,  - -  wandering American traders , petty Russian ofiicials , and such as are very likely to abuse the hospitality offered to them . It often happens , too , that there are but one or two houses in a village to which any one would choose to go , and these therefore have often more guests than they desire ; and though they could not be induced to name a price for their entertainment , certainly expect it to be acknowledged by a present . There are , however , others who esteem it an honor to receive a stranger , and , like Abraham and Lot , entreat him to enter their dwelling . Whoever does so , may place himself and his goods with the most perfect confidence in the hands of his host . No member of the /z/ household will ever do anything to wrong him , and should it be necessary , will even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house is giren up to the stranger , and the wife and children have to sleep in the kitchen . Warm water for washing is brought to him , and often a sheep slaughtered , that he may not have to take merely what has been left . The guest takes possession without ceremony of the best place , and when the meal is served , invites the master of the house and the family to partake with him . It happens sometimes , indeed , that a traveller who is at all fastidious on the point of cleanUness , prefers sleeping in his travelling conveyance before the door , or upon the open Steppe ; but should any lady or gentleman feel inclined to place themselves as boarders in the family of a Nogay Tartar , they may do so for the not quite exorbitant sum of about sixpence a week , and feel sure of being neither robbed nor starved . /z/ Across the isthmus that separates the Black from the Caspian Sea , rises like a dark mighty wall , one of the oldest ranges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a height far exceeding that of the loftiest Alpine peaks of Switzerland . The highest regions present scenes of the wildest and most picturesque grandeur ,  --  huge jagged rocks , with their summits clothed in perpetual snow , or rearing their vast masses , black and frowning , to the sky  --  precipices of many thousand feet in depth  --  avalanches and roaring torrents . The most frequented pass even  --  a ravine called the Caucasian Gates  --  is a fearful defile , shut in by precipitous walls of porphyry and schist , with awful abysses opening beneath , through which a raging flood has forced its way . A wonderful con- /z/ trast , however , to the sublime desolation of these regions is found as we descend but a little way the sides of the mountains . In amount and variety of vegetation , the lower districts of the Caucasus are almost unrivalled . In many places blooming plants mingle even with the snow of centuries , and every tree , shrub , fruit , or grain found from the warmest parts of the Temperate Zone to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these mountains . From every part of them countless streams rush down towards one or the other sea , and as we descend they become more and more fertile , till we find a country abounding in forests and fountains , orchards , vineyards , cornfields , and pastures mingling in rich and picturesque variety . One region , from the exquisite beauty of the flowers it produces , has been called the " Paradise of Roses ; " and on the swampy shores of the Black and Caspian Seas , the vegetation is sa exuberant as to convert it into an almost impenetrable jungle . In many places the forests of oak , cedar , cypress , beech , hazel , fir , pine , and hosts of other trees , are so thick , that a passage through them has to be cut with the hatchet . In the cultivated spots , plenteous harvests of wheat , barley , rye , oats , and millet , are produced with scarcely any labor ; in the warmer plains and valleys grow cotton , flax , hemp , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untilled , brings forth flowers of every scent and dye , as well as grapes . MOVNTAINESaS OF THE CAUCASUS . 135 pomegranates , figs , apricots , mulberries , and many , other fruits . The whole range of the Caucasus extends about seven hundred miles from east to west , and is from two to three hundred miles broad ; but within this space are collected a greater number of different nations and languages than are found in any Country in the world , except in the part of Africa before mentioned . This difference has produced its usual effect of giving rise to a great deal of hostile feeling among tribes , who , if they understood each other better , would probably have been better friends ; but of late years the attacks of their formidable enemies , the Russians , have awakened a more brotherly feeling among them , and induced them to forget many of their petty feuds , and make common cause for the defence of their country . The largest and most important country of the Caucasus is Circassia , * occupying its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is inhabited by one of the noblest and handsomest races in existence ; speaking of whom , an Arabia geographer of the twelfth century says , ' Praised be Allah , for having created mortals so infinitely beautiful and perfect : " and who excite the greater interest at present , /z/ from the dangerous , if not desperate struggle in which they have long been engaged with an enemy so immensely superior to them in strength , as the Russians . The Circassians are divided into various tribes or clans , comprising rulers and elders , or what we may call princes and nobles , freemen and slaves ; but the latter are mostly prisoners of war , and very kindly treated ; and in the general assemblies of the people , at which all affairs of importance are discussed and decided , the freemen or common people have the same influence as the princes and nobles . In domestic life the head of the family rules over his kindred or clan with the complete authority of the patriarchal ages ; but the union of several families constitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wisdom . The Brotherhoods consist mostly of about twenty families , and are called sometimes by the name of the most numerous family , but more frequently by that of the river or valley where they dwell ; they are united by the closest ties . If a member is killed in war , the brethren maintain his wife and children ; if any one conunits an offence the whole society pays the flne ; but on a frequent repetition of it , the Brotherhood takes on itself the office of punishment . Should any member fall into poverty and distress , the brothers maintain him ; and , in all cases , perform towards each other the duties of the nearest kindred  --  ' * one is for all , and all for one ; " even slaves are ad- m MOUNTAINEERS OF THE CAUCAStTS. 137 mitted to join them , being regarded as membors of the families they serve . The general assemblies of the people exercise authority over the various Brotherhoods , as the Brotherhood does over single families . These assemblies strikingly resemble those which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history among all the - Germanic nations , and present a most picturesque scene . They are held in the open air , in some spot which is regarded as sacred ; mostly by an ancient tree , and towards evening ; and the debates are usually prolonged by moonlight to a late hour . The members form a great circle , with a space left free in the midst , round which sit the elders or nobles f . next comes the dense throng of freemen of mature age ; the outer circle is formed by the young men on horseback ; and , generally , crowds of boys are perched as spectors in the trees around the sylvan parliament . Very severe punishments are affixed to the offence of interrupting the proceedings , or offering any insult to one of ils members ; and the first act of the assembly is to choose three persons to preside over it . The different ranks vote according to ages , the majority of voices of the whole assembly decide all questions , and there is no appeal from it . ' Crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this people , but thefts of small amount ,  --  such as of a horse or a cow , were formerly common enough , but until lately not punished at all , being regarded /z/ rather in the light of a game of skill among the young men of different fraternities ; the booty , if once carried to a place of safety , was not demanded back again but considered as a lost stake , though the keeper of the herd , who had been careless enough to lose it , had to pay the value . In cases of theft among members of the same Brotherhood , - the culprit had to pay nine times the value of the article stolen ; as it was rightly judged such an offence tended to disturb the peace of the society : and for the same reason , since the war with the Russians , thefts are punished , wherever they occur , lest they should give rise to feuds among different tribes . The terrible custom of retaliation for murder , exist ing amongst almost all uncivilized nations , prevails still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with blood ; the kindred of the person slain seek out and put to death the murderer ; and his relations again take a similar vengeance . Murder follows murder , till one of the families is , perhaps , driven from the country , and even then is not always secure , for , as it is a point of honor , the Circassians will sometimes undertake long journeys in pursuit of one whom they have devoted to death . Revenge is regarded as a sacred duty . The free Circassian is much inclined to consider war and the chase of bears , wolves , gigantic wild boars , and other dangerous creatures , inhabiting the r /z/ mountain , as his only proper occupation ; and to leave the care of the cattle and agriculture , as well as domestic duties , to the women and slaves . The great abundance of animal life prolonged in these countries the period , in which hunting formed the chief source of subsistence , much later than usual ; and even now , deer , hares , pheasants , and many other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the people possess numerous flocks of sheep and goats , as well as milch cows , buffaloes , oxen , and horses . Land is held in a remarkably primitive manner . Every ' family takes as much as it finds convenient to cultivate , and no one seems to wish to call a greater extent his own than what he can usefully occupy , so that there is still enough for all . Any one finding ground unoccupied , may take possession , and settle upon it forthwith . A few years ago , when the Russians seized on one of the most fertile districts , on the coast of the Black Sea , and drove the inhabitants further up into the mountains , some disputes about land arose in the district to which they fled , but they were settled in the general assemblies of the people . Sometimes a rich man will assist a poorer neighbor to cultivate a piece of ground , and then the produce is divided between them ; but no other payment than this is ever made for land . The cultivation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very rough and simple style . The land is set // fire to in the spring , and the field ploughed once slightly over , to plough in the ashes for manure . The seed is then put in , and the ground harrowed with boughs of trees . When the land immediately round a village has been used several times , the inhabitants take possession of a tract further off ; ancl when the distance has become inconvenient , they generally move off with all their chattels , and build another hamlet : ploughing , sowing , mowing grass , and reaping are all carried on in common by the inhabitants of a village , and the fields , where great troops of people are busied in these cheerful labors , have quite the appearance of a merrymaking . Passing travellers are sometimes hailed and called on to lend a hand , and usually received with a shout of welcome that rings in wild echoes among the mountains . For the Lesgians , a people who inhabit the highest mountain ridges that can be cultivated , agriculture is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial terraces , by building up a wall perpendicularly before the face of the rock , filling the intermediate space with stones and earth , and laying upon the top a vegetable soil . The formation and maintenance of these terraces is , of course , a troublesome business , but it is abundantly repaid by their rich produce . Along the edges , trees are usually planted to shade the com , and , when necessary , rivulets conducted into them . MOUNTAINEERS OF THE CAVCASITS. l4l Few families own more cattle or raise more com than is necessary for their own consumption , but near almost every dwelling is a garden where many kinds of fruit and vegetables are grown ; and there is always a row of bee-hives , for honey is an article in great use , as the Circassians have , it is said , a sort of passion for rearing bees , and regard the insect with a superstitious veneration , their increase being considered as a sure harbinger of good fortune . Mead and metheglin are much liked , and honey and milk are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , indeed , principally for the sake of milk and for draught oxen that cattle are kept by the Circassians , as they seldom eat beef . They are , in general , very temperate in their diet , but when a guest makes his appearance , Circassian cookery puts forth all its strength to do him honor . The sons go out and slaughter a sheep or a goat , the best joints of which are soon seen roasting on the spit and boiling in a great kettle , while the housewife and her daughters are busied in baking fresh bread in the ashes , or preparing the favorite pillau  --  the same dish of rice and mutton which is eaten all over the East . Numbers of savoury herbs and roots are boiled with the meat , and the bread is made into flat cakes of about an inch and a half thick and a foot in diameter . Milk and water are the usual drinks , but a pleasant fermented liquor is made with /z/ honey and grape juice , as well as a thick beer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie mostly in clusters in the wooded dells , often shaded by the rich draperies of the wild vines , that are festooned from tree to tree . In some of the highest districts , indeed , dwellings tolerably spacious are cut out of the solid rock , and reached by terraces and bridges of wood or stone ; but over the greatest part of the country they are constructed with the trunks of trees , stuffed in the interstices with straw or grass , and plastered with clay . The roof , which is flat , and made by boards laid across the top , serves , in the spring and autumn , as a place of recreation for the family . The door and a chimney are mostly the only openings of these huts , for very few have yet attained to the distinction of a window ; the floor is as nature made it , and in wet weather the rain often finds an easy entrance through the roof . Opposite to the door is a semicircular space for a fire-hearth , and to the right of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which serves as a bed for the master , as well as for a sofa or divan for him and his guests . On the left of the door are the sleeping places for people of a lower class , and for the slaves . In the sheltered valleys , the habitations are often merely made of plaited osier twigs , plastered with white or green clay , and covered with a straw thatch . /z/ The poor share the shelter with the cattle , but the rich have sheds apart for them , and where the family is large , also separate huts for the women and for the slaves . A recent traveller* gives a description of the interior of a house of the better class :  --  " My room is about twelve feet long , by eight broad  --  and is better furnished than that at Subith . It has a small unglassed window that can be closed with a shutter  --  the walls are hung with beautifully wrought mats ; the divan is covered with one of the choicest , and the bed last night laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soft mattress bordered with velvet , velvet pillows , a quilted silk coverlet , and , better than all , clean white sheets . The only other furniture in my room is a bench placed across the lower end for young men , and persons of inferior rank ; but mats and cushions are ranged on the side opposite to that of the fireplace and window , for the seniors and * persons of quality . ' " The same writer gives a description of a pretty out-of-door scene in a Circassian village :  --  ' * This hamlet is charmingly seated on a wooded knoll with others iflanking it , and overlooking rich meadows intersected by the stream that gives its name to the district . High oak-clad hills close it in to the south . . . The /z/ * guest house ' stands in a large green about which several noble oaks are scattered ; in the centre is a small fieldpiece ( the pride of our host 's heart , mounted on an unwieldy carriage fit for a gun six times its calibre ) ; divers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in anxious , sometimes fierce debate  --  groups of cows and buffaloes are feeding from circular panniers fixed in the ground  - -  horses saddled or unsaddled are tied to all the trees  - -  turkeys and other poultry roam scaredly about their invaded domain  --  watch-dogs stalk sulkily around  - -  while between the family houses that skirt the enclosure , females with their floating white veils glide gracefully on their household errands , and present a strong contrast to the Russian slaves lazily hewing wood and bearing water . A huge fence of split trees forms the enclosure , which is embosomed in woods , and through them appear the blue tops of the mountains to the south . " The Circassian women  --  although the influence of Tslamism has been of course unfavorable to them  --  are nevertheless greatly superior in character and position to those of any people of whom we have hitherto spoken . They are , indeed , what we must call bought and sold , but seldom  --  perhaps never without their own consent ; and if they are regarded as the property of their husbands and fathers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of being con- /z/ demned , like most women of the East , to the dreary frivolity of the harem . As among civilized nations , their choice is considered as a very desirable if not necessary condition to marriage . Among tribes even who profess the Mahommedan religion the girls in Circassia are often sent to school to the Mollah , and taught to write and read Turkish religious books as well as the boys , and they share equally in many corporeal exercises . It is perhaps not quite fortunate for them that they are renowned for their beauty , and much in fashion in Constantinople ; and they and their friends are therefore often tempted to speculate on a grand alliance with a rich Turk in preference to remaining to lead a life of greater purity and simplicity at home . Perhaps instances may , however , not be very uncommon even in civilized countries of young ladies and their parents being influenced by similar motives , and with less excuse . In the choice of a wife beauty is far from being in Circassia the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are equally regarded ; and an instance is mentioned by Mr. Bell , of a young woman having a very high and widely extended reputation , who was even strikingly deficient in the beauty so generally characteristic of her race . She was renowned not only for her skill in embroidery , by which she maintained her family , but for her general talents , and her amiable , dignified deportment . She lived in the unrestrained /z/ freedom of perfect innocence with the young men of the Brotherhood to which she belonged  --  yet he thought himself happy who could boast even of the smallest mark of her friendship ; and though she had many offers of marriage she declined them all . She is described as " a maiden of the stuntiest of figures , tawniest of complexions , and plainest  --  if not ugliest  --  features , " yet whose " unembarrassed and cheerful demeanor , and ready flowing conversation , " soon caused these disadvantages to be forgotten . In the dress of the Circassian women we find none of the hideous and tasteless kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They wear flowing robes of silk , cotton or cloth , with full trowsers and caftans , or pelisses confined by a girdle with a silver clasp , and the bodice ornamented with silver lace  --  and frequently a small cap , to the front of which a diadem is affixed , and a long embroidered muslin veil flows down behind . The men wear cloth of dark rich colors , also ornamented with silver lace  --  but their weapons of attack and defence are their favorite decorations . The lower order wear a tunic and black mantle made of goat 's hair and sheep 's wool plaited together ; but every man is well armed with a poniard and hatchet in his belt , a light gun slung across his shoulders , and often a club large and heavy enough to fell an ox . Some tribes make much use of the bow and arrow , and carry shields of wood covered with buffalo 's hide , /z/ and strengthened by bands of ironT When at home the Circassian hangs his glittering arms round the walls of his dwelling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being completely armed . Visits of ceremony are usually made in a coat of mail , and helmets , cuirasses , and thigh pieces made of plates of steel laid over each other , and lined with woollen stuff . Chain armor of steel , or even silver rings , and enriched with gold ornaments , is worn by chieftains . It is made into a sort of shirt reaching from the neck to the knee , and has short sleeves for the defence of the upper part of the arm . The helmets are made so as to protect the neck and fasten under the chin . The horse of the Circassian is chosen not for beauty , but for fleetness and durability , and trained to endure hunger and fatigue , to swim , and practise all other accomplishments requisite for the companion of a guerilla warrior . The military chieftains are elected to their office ; and it is therefore their interest to gain the affection of the men under their command , and excite their admiration by acts of generosity and daring valor . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteenth century , " is a great admirer of generosity , and cheerfully gives away everything he possesses , except his horse and his arms . In respect to his apparel , he is not only liberal but profuse ; hence he often cuts a worse figure than his own vassals . Whenever he puts /z/ on new clothes or a shirt of crimson silk , a vassal frequently begs them from him as a present ; and it would be the greatest disgrace if he denied or seemed unwilling to comply with the request . If therefore any one solicits the gift of the clothes upon his back , he immediately pulls them off ; and changes them for those of the meanest applicant , be he ever so squalid . Thus the nobles and knights are frequently worse equipped than the common people , except in regard to boots , arms , and horses , which they never part with , and in which their chief pride consists . " Whether this account be literally true or not it serves to express the speaker 's opinion of the chivalrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that time many settlements X ) n the Eastern shores of the Black Sea , it is probable that he had opportunities enough of becoming acquainted with it . No Circassian receives pay for military service  --  it being considered disgraceful for a man to be paid for serving his country ; and every soldier provides himself on leaving home with bags of barley meal , millet or Indian corn , rice , sour milk , and mead . These he suspends round his saddle when on a march , together with game and such provisions as he picks up on his route , and which often have a very odd aspect when contrasted with his jewelled weapons and glittering armor . Wood to make fire is to be found everywhere  --  and in most places hares , deer , wild boars , as well as turkeys /z/ and pheasants , are frequenily met with . If possible the warrior also carries a ball of felt and mats , with which and a few branches of trees , he can construct in a few minutes a tent that will afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence of which his adversary the Russian soldier is often exposed , with no better protection than a flimsy jacket , linen trowsers , and a thread-bare coat . The religion of ttie Circassians appears to be a singular mixture of Mahommedanism , and a slight in* fusion of ideas connected with Christianity , with the Pagan rites of their forefathers , and with notions and practices derived from the most ancient Israelites . Among many tribes the priestly office is performed by the patriarch of the family ; it is he who kindles the torch , and offers sacrifices at an altar erected in the open air in the shade of an ancient hallowed grove , to the gods of thunder , of fire , of water , and of wind , whom he worships ; but he believes at the same time in the superintending providence of one Supreme God , whom men may hope to please by the fulfilment of their duty , by exercising hospitality and beneficence , by paying reverence to old age , by fidelity and valor in the cause of their country . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they show reverence to the images preserved in the ancient Christian churches which still exist in some districts , as well as to the antique crosses to be seen in many parts of the 15 ( y MOUNTAINEERS OF THE CAUCAStJS. country , and which the Mahommedans have vainly endeavored to bring into disrepute . What is the signification of the cross  --  of what it is the symbol , they do not seem to have any notion ; but they honor it because their forefathers have done so . On one occasion , during Mr. Bell 's stay in the country , even a Mussulman interfered to prevent the removal , which he regarded as desecration , of these ancient memorials . Many of the people wished to have them removed , but equally jfrom a reverential motive , as they feared their being taken by the Russians . One of these crosses was on the summit of a hill , near some tombs  --  another was suspended by an iron chain to the branches of an ancient oak . Some of them are of stone , some of iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groves and crosses , there are also holy mountains in Circassia , which Heathen , Christian , or Mahommedan , regards with equal reverence , and never passes without bowing down and making the sign of the cross ; and there are caves in the rocks reverenced as having been in former days the abodes of holy hermits . From the Mussulmans the Circassians have adopted an especial veneration for the moon , which in its crescent form gives the symbol of the faith of Islam , and they are , as has been observed , fond of holding their public meetings by moonlight . One of the practices which the Circassians appear /z/ to have derived from the ancient Hebrews , is that bearing the name of the " Feast of the Presentation , " which appears like a commemoration of the sacrifice offered by Abraham . Every young lad , when he attains a certain age , is solemnly " presented to God , " as it is called . An altar is prepared in a holy spot  - -  usually on the greensward before one of the ancient crosses : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bread , and messes of a sort of paste , of honey , flour , and water , contributed by the country people , and , in the back ground , are blazing fires over which are suspended kettles for boiling the meat . For every boy to be presented , one animal  --  a sheep , or a goat , or a calf  --  must be sacrificed ; and the ceremony begins with prayer to the highest God , after which the elder , ofiSciating as priest , taking in one hand a bowl of mead , and in the other a cake of unleavened bread , turns towards the cross , and having implored a blessing on the food , gives it to his assistants , who give him more , which is to be blessed in a similar manner , and this is repeated several times  --  the assembly kneeling round the while with uncovered heads . The victims for sacrifice are then brought forward , a vessel of the consecrated liquor poured over the head of each , a little of the hair singed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signal for the assembly to break up ; and while the meat is being dressed , a variety of sports and athletic exercises , such as racing , leaping . /z/ and shooting at a mark , are carried on , and , in conclusion , flowing bowls of mead pass round as in the banquets of the ancient Scandinavians . From Christians the Circassians have borrowed a veneration for the Virgin Mary , and the practice of keeping holy the first day of the week ; and six times in the year , on the first Sundays of February , April , June , August , October , and December , public sacrifices take place in the sacred groves . The religion of the heathen Circassians is freer from gloomy or degrading superstition than that of any other pagan people , and places more reliance on the religion of the heart and the fulfilment of duty . The Mahommedans among them show less of the foolish prejudice against unbelievers , and a less timid anxiety about trifling external ceremonies , than others of their faith . Mr. Bell found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business of the patriotic war , wearing a coat of mail , and exhorting his countrymen before all things to peace and union among themselves , and to forgetfulness of all causes of internal dissension . Among the many evils brought upon Circassia by the war with the Russians , there has been one great good ,  --  that it has produced more internal peace and national union . The warUke spirit of the people , which before kept them at constant hostility with each other , has been turned in a better direction ,  --  that of resist- /z/ ing a very cruel and unjustifiable attempt to seize on their country , and subject them to the same miserable and soul-killing despotism as the rest of the vast territories of the Emperor of Russia . It is not that the mere loss of what is called national independence is always a great evil . In the case of a people who are not in a sufficiently advanced state to govern themselves well , the being subjected to the rule of a wiser nation , who might introduce just laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when we see a government like that of Russia , urged by no motive but ambition and greediness , sending out vast armies of its serfs to overwhelm a comparatively free and happy country , to which it has no more claim than any rich man has to the cottage of a poor neighbor , we can not but feel deeply interested in the contest , and fervently wish success to the heroic resistance of these brave mountaineers . Hitherto , considering the immense superiority of numbers , the Russians have made little way , but sad indeed has been the change in many districts where they have been victorious . Among a thousand instances we may mention one ,  --  that of an aged patriarch , who , before the attack of the Russians , dwelt with his descendants in a beautiful and quiet homestead , in the Western Caucasus , but whose home was laid in ashes , and he and his family driven out to perish or subsist , as wan- /z/ derers , on the charity of their countrymen , too many of whom had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says an Englishman , * who had partaken of his hospitality , " how much I admired thy peaceful retreat  --  the beautiful rivulet that bubbled past the door  --  the majestic linden planted with thy own hands  --  the sunny slopes of the majestic hills covered with flocks and herds  --  the manly youths and lovely daughters of thy house  --  the little rosy cherubs that called thee great-grandfather ; but thy powerful neighbor came down like a ravenous wolf , and in one short winter thou wast left without a home , a refugee and a wanderer , amid the fastnesses of thy native hills . No longer will thy humble cot be open for the reception of the weary traveller  --  no longer will thy osier palace echo to the song of revelry , the shout of triumph ; the knout and the lash will succeed thy patriarchal reproof , and , in a little time , thy noble tribe , now become the slaves of a despot , will degenerate from the bravest of the brave to the veriest cowards , * the heWers of wood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven forbid that such should be the fate of the whole of this fine race  --  for assuredly if there is or can be such a thing as a just and necessary war , the heroic struggle in which the Circassians are now , and t /z/ have for many j ' ears been engaged , may be truly so regarded . Gladly would we put faith in the assurance of the poet , that * Freedom 's battle once begun . Bequeathed from bleeding sire to son , Though bafled oft , is ever won . ' Should this be  --  should the Circassians succeed in making good their cause , and history affords us more than one illustrious example of success against equally fearful odds , good may arise out of evil , and the storm , which looked so threatening , prove to be the harbinger for them of a new and brighter era of a truer civilisation and happiness , than in their former rude and divided state they could have ever known .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
