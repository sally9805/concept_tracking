txt PERHAPS there has never been a time since our ancestors came to this country , when a sound national prosperity , and a healthful national character , were in so fair a way of progress , as during the few years immediately after the present century had left its teens . At that period , it seemed to be a pretty general opinion that respectability depended in some small degree upon personal qualities . Talents , information , moral uprightness , and freedom from awkwardness and affectation , were qualifications for good society , indeed , the best society . Wealth had influence , birth had influence , but not more than it was natural and right they should have . Fortunes were gradually accumulated , and education had time to keep pace with the increase of luxury ; so that wealth , and cultivation , and refinement , were generally found associated ; and the latter were considered not only as indispensable to the former , but as raising their possessors to an equality , even to a superiority , when they were found disconnected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , proved , in its results , highly unfavorable to this mode of estimating the merits // of individuals . On this flood , multitudes who had no claim to the abovementioned qualifications found themselves lifted from their original obscurity , and carried upward and onward , until , to their surprise and delight , they were wafted to the very doors of sumptuous dwellings , on which they found their own names inscribed , and which they were exhorted to enter and enjoy . They did so , and for a while the gratification of the senses in their new situation , was sufficient for their happiness . The imperial carpets were soft to the tread ; the damask sofas yielded delightfully to the pressure of the form ; the rich and gorgeous hues of silk and velvet furniture were marvelously pleasant to the eye . It was pleasant , too , to fare sumptuously every day , and to ride in gilded carriages , drawn by sleek and well-fed horses . It was pleasant to dress in the richest products of the East ; and for less than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gems and pearls upon the toilet . This was all very natural ; and it was natural that a feeling of pride , and complacency , and self-importance , should grow out of the possession of these things . Had the rise been more gradual , or , instead of being extended to whole classes , had it been confined to here and there an individual , the general face of society would have remained unchanged . The " new " people , finding that a certain degree of cultivation and refinement was necessary to their being well received in society , and to their feeling as comfortable abroad as they did at home , would have hastened to acquire it , and things would have held their natural , relative position . But it was irksome to learn by slow degrees , and painful to submit to a feeling of inferiority . They had obtained that which all respected and wished for ; why not dispense with other things , and make this the only test of superiority ? Numbers found themselves in the same predicament ; they had pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other in countenance , and they carried the day . A philosophy literally and strictly material came to pervade society . Things were turned topsy-turvy . The five senses enjoyed a distinction which it was never intended they should have ; and the head and the heart , that which was merely mentally and morally good and beautiful , were degraded from their proper place in general estimation , and cast quite into the shade . Wealth and its appliances came to he considered the only rational pursuit , the only means of happiness , and indeed , the only proper test of worth and importance . Society flourished ; all was apparently good humor and complacency . The leaders of ton never doubted that what they did was and must be right . Had they not seen how things were done in Birmingham and Manchester ? And supposing they varied a little from these standards , were they not rich , and had they not a right to do so ? Thus the gales of prosperity continued to blow , as did the strong east winds , and the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the ships that bore the element* , the very foundations of their happiness and importance . But , alas ! who can tell what a ship may bring ? Among cases of Italian silks , and boxes of French laces , and hampers of Spanish wines , and droves of English traders , all of which were gladly welcomed to our shores , came an article of quite another description , an English traveler ; and he was most gladly welcomed of all ; for would he not see the glory and the splendor which reigned among us ? And would he not publish it in a book , and would not distant nations read , and wonder , and admire ? And should we not become a patttern // for them , the very mirror in which they should all dress themselves ? The bookmaker 's speculation proved fortunate , and he was succeeded by others ; and woman , gentle woman , followed in the train , and opened wide her eyes and ears , and plied her pen , and the press groaned with the products of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectations of their feasters and entertainers , who looked for the dulcet notes of praise , the fragrant incense of adulation . Instead of these , came strains of most discordant music . Captain Hall thundered and growled in deep and monotonous tones of grave disapprobation . Major Hamilton struck in with a tenor in the same key , but with different time and expression ; now gay and frolicksome , now satirical and jeering , and , anon , blustering in a tornado of wrath and indignation . Higher , louder , shriller , and in a different key , followed Miss Martineau , in a resolute and overpowering alto . But harsher , more discordant than all the rest , and sounding like the mirth of midnight witches in their horrid glee , came the loud , fearless laugh of Mrs. Trollope , causing strange misgivings in many a hitherto complacent and self-satisfied breast , and making some such accompaniment to the trio , as would a Chinese gong to a trombone , a Kent bugle and a flagelet . This concert was thought rare music by . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried it on con amore . Not so the Americans , who , instead of the diamonds , and pearls , and roses , which they had looked for , when these travelers should open their mouths to speak or to sing , saw a strange and disgusting compound of tobacco-spittle , muddled eggs , steel forks , military titles , political quacks , di'unken ladies , forward girls , and premature old women ; awkwardness , ignorance , and prejudice , with not a single grace or courtesy of life in the shape of a finger-glass or a clean napkin , to cover and relieve the nauseous and incongruous mixture . Then men began to look strangely in each other 's faces , and women 's hearts failed them for fear . They gazed around them with bewildered and distrustful eyes . Of what avail were all the glittering and gorgeous things by which they were surrounded , when instead of one Mordeeai they beheld half a dozen ? A loud and simultaneous cry of anger , and denial , and defiance , burst forth , but it was affectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have shouted so - loud . And when the shouting was over , and men were red in the face and hoarse in the throat , what did they do ? Did they go quietly on in their old way ; or did they look about them to see if haply there might not be some among themselves who had been overlooked , but who yet were worthy of imitation in the science of manners ? Did they ever think of recurring to first principles , and adapting them to their own condition , strive to improve their manners by the assiduous cultivation and improvement of their minds ? No ; this would not do . They had been horrified at the idea of eating their soup and drinking their wine in a different manner from the fashionables in - Square . The ghosts of egg-shells , whose contents had been scooped into a glass or cup , appeared in long array before their eyes , and spoiled their breakfasts ; and who could tell if at every meal they did not sin against some rule of polished society , equally important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly from the shell ? So , many packed their trunks and set off bag and baggage for England or France , to learn exactly how things were managed there . Foreign waiters were at a premium , and became the instructors of fainilies. // Foreigners were anxiously observed and imitated , and books of etiquette began to be written and studied . In the course of four years no less than eleven grave , didactic works , were issued from the American press , the sole object of which works was to give rules for behavior in society . Several of these books went rapidly through many editions . In consequence of all this , a new principle was gradually introduced . Matter lost something of its importance ; mode became also a touchstone of gentility . Wealth alone no longer gave the very highest claim to distinction ; it was a knowledge of conventional usages-not such usages as might have grown out of the habits of a refined and intellectual class among ourselves , but such as belonged to the fashionists abroad . But the passion for wealth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mechanic , those whose occupations might have led them to an undue value of the objects of their traffick or their toil ; the physician , the lawyer , the judge , the author , the divine , were found willing to sacrifice the superiority which has generally been conceded to them as the consequence of their more intellectual pursuits , to abdicate their high position , and to place themselves in the ranks of those who were running the race of mainmon . The idea of good came to be generally limited to the external advantages of life ; to the possession of fine furniture , houses and carriages , to the name of fashion , and the reputation of a miscalled superior breeding . The poetry of life was almost lost . " The still , sad music of ' humanity , " was drowned in the din and bustle of sensual pursuits ; and those who would have withdrawn at times from the ignoble strife and turmoil , were generally doomed to find themselves alone , without the sympathy which cheers , and soothes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purest minds ; till , at length , they be*came disgusted with society , or , yielding by degrees to the current that swept around them , their high aspirations were lost , and they followed , albeit with many regrets and self-uphraidings , the common and universal impulse . As wealth continued to flow in , the general mind seemed more and more to turn itself outwards , and to live in externals ; and as people became familiarized to the idea of splendor , the mania of fashion seemed also to increase . But there were other causes beside the facility with which fortunes were acquired , and the sneers and jeers of English travelers , which tended to throw the general mind off its balance , and to lead to an undue estimate of wealth , to an extre me anxiety concerning manners , and to erroneous principles in their cultivation . Literature , especially light literature , though its character may generally receive a bias from the spirit of the age , reacts with tenfold force upon it , strengthening particular tendencies , and directing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never was this fact more apparent , than at the period of which we speak . The moralists seemed all at once turned into political economists . The class of minds that were formerly devoted to the culture of our spiritual and intellectual nature , were now teaching us how to make the greatest show upon the smallest means . Instead of inciting us to burnish our minds till they were bright as the gold of Ophir , they were now instructing us how to polish our mahogany tables and Egyptian marble slabs , in such manner as to produce the most brilliant effect . Instead of being stimulated to preserve purity and transparency of character , we had receil ) ts for clarifying jellies and ta // king stains from silks . We were flooded with essays upon housekeeping , domestic economy , agriculture , horticulture , floriculture , the grape , the mulberry , the silkworm . Almost every authoress in our land , as soon as she had acquired a little reputation by her tales of fashionable life , appeared , first , with a treatise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in reality confined almost exclusively to maxims and directions for behavior in society ; and , after that , with a work on cookery . Books of etiquette for men , women , and children , appeared simultaneously in all our large cities . It is true that numbers of standard works continued to be published and republished in this country ; but , alas ! they were seldom made the sweet , domestic friends , a constant intercourse with whom , would have improved our tastes and dignified our leisure ; whose deep and earnest , yet gentle and unobtrusive teachings could not have failed to lift the mind at times above the mere objects of sense , and to open a world where the higher parts of our nature might expand and grow . In seven instances out of ten , they were purchased and placed in bookcases , beautiful mahogany or rosewood book-cases , and there they remained , as bright and glittering as when brought from the bindery . They looked well in a room ; they were useful as furniture . But the eager , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulated by the excitement of rapid changes and new situations , was more than ever averse from quiet , persevering study . Novelty must be had , and time must not he wasted on that which could be of no directly practical use . The last new work was sure to be the topic of conversation for a few days , and the ignorant could judge and speak of its merits as decidedly as the well-informed ; there Vol . I. 47 fore the last new work must be read . To minds unaccustomed to the splendor and gayety of fashionable life , pictures of foreign society had a fascination not to be withstood . The newly rich lady , buried in her velvet fauteuil , loved to lose herself in the contemplation of those scenes of splendor and elegance , the enjoyment of which she longed to realize , and for acting a part in which she prepared herself by the study of these precious productions . Lords and ladies flitted before her enraptured fancy , with their loves , their hates , their emulations ; and when she arose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the society of her peers , no wonder that she strove to imitate the models which had been so vividly pictured upon her imagination . Her furniture , her dress , her very language seemed vulgar , if not in known accordance with this foreign standard . hence , Hannah More , and Miss Edgeworth , and Miss Hamilton , were thrown into the background by Lady Blessington , and Mrs. Gore , and the Honorable Mrs. Norton . Sir Walter Scott was displaced by Sir Edward Lytton Bulwer , and the younger D'lsraeli . It is by no means our intention to discuss the various merits of these authors . We shall simply allude to their influence on prevailing modes of thinking , and their consequent effect upon manners . They all dwell mainly upon outward and artificial life . They may collectively be called the school of fashion , passion , and expediency . A certain kind of worldly wisdom may be found in them-wisdom useful to him who wishes to thoroughly understand his own inferior nature , and to learn the secret springs by which the minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would know the power and extent of the passions , and the influence they may be made to exert in forwarding the 18431 369 // designs of aspiring and ambitious men . But let one analyze and define the idea of good , as it is represented in these works , and he will uniformly find that it consists in the gratification of the passions , success in life , pleasure , wealth , and worldly honors ; above all , in belonging to a certain exclusive set in society , and being in the height of the fashion . Of that higher wisdom , that holier light , that purer principle , which is at work among the affairs and in the souls of men ; the beauty , the dignity , the independence , the peace-giving power of true virtue ; that which makes its possessor superior to circumstances , and though neglected and solitary , not melancholy and dejected , we obtain but a faint idea . The great character is he who understands all the conventionalisms of polished life , and who has trained himself to repress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these works rises from their perusal with the belief , not only that wealth and pleasure are absolutely necessary to happiness , but that man 's highest dignity and felicity consist in adopting the fashions , and practicing the manners and habits there described . Concerning Mr. Dickens , people have gone almost mad . Lie is certainly a man of genius , and if , as some say , laughter is good for indigestion , the whole tribe of dyspeptics should unite in raising a statue to his honor . Yet his school , which may be called the school of fun , is also a school of horror , and , we feel constrained to say it , of vulgarity . If he has improved the Yorkshire academies and the English parish poor-houses , which is said to have been in some degree the case , let us give him honor due . Let us honor him , too , for having , in two or three touching pictures , however unnatural , created a sympathy for the poor and unfortunate of our xace . He deserves great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is and it ever has been our opinion , that their general effect is unfavorable to manners , and to the development of true principles concerning them . We love the spirit of gayety and mirth . rhe benevolence of nature has furnished much food for this spirit , in our domestic and social condition . It springs spontaneously in the hearts of the young and the happy , and the brow of age is softened by its genial influence . An active and playful imagination finds food for it , in the every-day occurrences of life , as well as in rare and uncommon incidents . The kind of mirth we mean , is perfectly consistent with refinement of manners , and delicacy of sentiment . But the coarse caricatures of low life , the ludicrous and improbable adventures , the vulgar and ungrammatical talk with which these books abound , have no tendency " to mend the manners , or refine the heart . " On the contrary , it is evident that such an incessant " dancing Jim Crow ; " such a constant exhibition of the excessively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and misfortune , and glaring forth under every aspect of life , particularly of common and low life , has the effect of hardening the heart , and preventing the spontaneous flow of generous , natural feeling . The spirit of ridicule , than which none is more averse to true politeness , though it is ever the handmaid of fashion , is fostered and grows apace . We learn to look at the things around us , not with a kindly benevolence , a sympathy in our common nature , nor yet with an ever ready smile for the gleams of genuine humor and originality ; we are not content to smile , we must laugh ; and no accident , or distortion , or caricature , is too gross for an occasion . It is a great convenience , no doubt , to a certain class of readers , those who live upon borrowed wit , the lovers of cant phra* // ses , to have a broad and perennial supply of pithy and humorous sayings to quote from . To this class , Sam . Weller must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark , that the oftener repeated , the more witty both the sayings and the repeaters of them seem to grow , until they become quite overpowering , to one who is content with that kind of wit which darts its rays into the mind , and startles it with a delightful consciousness of a bright , original idea ; but which often produces little more external effect than an intelligent , beaming smile , that eager lighting up of the features , which generally attends a sudden and pleasurable excitement of the imagination . To Mr. Dickens ' imitators , the great class who write droll stories for the periodicals , the above remarks xviii apply still more strongly . It must be observed that in these productions , even where satire is evidently the object , it is seldom the faults or follies of the world that are aimed at . Their remarks are confined to manners and external observances , and their object seems to be to flatter the higher and more exclusive classes , by placing every thing beneath or apart from them , in a ludicrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by maki*ig fun of them . Does a tradesman or mechanic invite his friends to dinner , and are they joyous and happy in their honest and homely pleasures , they become , forsooth , a most delightful subject for quizzing , to the highly polished and refined circle in the next square . The picture is taken in excessive caricature , and presented . And what are the objects of ridicule ? The lady who was obliged to leave her parlor , that dinner might be properly arranged ; the accident that spoiled the soup ; the scantiness or redundance of some particular dish ; the mistakes of a raw footboy , or a new servantgirl from the country ; every thing is food for merriment . The sincerity , the hospitality , the heartiness and cheerfulness of their enjoyments , go for nothing ; they are not in high style ; they do not understand hon-ton , and , therefore , are they to be derided , and either to renounce their social enjoyments , from fear of offending against some law of etiquette in their entertainments ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the exclusive classes , which , if succeeded in , would rather loxver , than exalt them in the scale of moral and rational beings . Who does not perceive that the disproportionate importance attached , in these works , to mere externals ; the ridicule thrown upon every thing that differs from the arbitrary rules of a par* ticular class , must have the effect not only of destroying all originality and variety of character , but of lowering the scale of intelligence , of morals , and particularly of manners , since a fearless and independent originality is far less vulgar than a timid and servile imitation . It is said that improvements have been made in English poor-houses , since the appearance of Oliver Twist . It is also said that certain comfortable , and formerly respectable streets and squares in London , have been almost depopulated , in consequence of the ridicule attached to them , by being made the supposed residences of some of these unfortunate people , so distressingly ignorant of the conventionalisms of high life . Such was the character and tendency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us at the period of which we speak . We have alluded to our own cookery books , our etiquette books , &amp;c . But among the most remarkable phenomena of the time , was the change which came over two of the most popular and influential of our authors , Mr. N. P. Willis , and Mr. J. Fenimore Cooper . The former of these had acquired fame // as a poet . Perhaps there is nothing in the compass of American literature , which shows genius of a higher order , than the early poems , the scripture pieces of N. P. Willis . There is an elevation of thought , a chastened brilliancy of imagination , a depth of feeling , a beauty of expression , which mark the true poet , and indicate clearly enough what his vocation ought to have been . Had he persevered in his poetical career , he must have taken a high stand , perhaps the highest among the authors of his country ; and he might have done much to preserve and foster in the general mind , the pure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheds around it . But he lowered himself to the yoke of popular opinion . The mere externals , the trivialities , the barren practicalities of life , took possession of his fine mind , his noble fancy , and fashion and high life became the objects of his ambition , and the themes of his pen . He went to Europe . But the thousand associations with the venerable past , the mighty dead , the fame , the glory , the poetic beauty and grandeur which fill the very atmosphere in which he moved , had now no power to stir his imagination . Inklings of Adventure , Letters from under a Bridge , descriptions of breakfasts , dinners , suppers , furniture , dress , and , above all , fashions , modes and customs ; these were the subjects which filled his soul , and which , he rightly judged , would prove more acceptable to his countrymen and countrywomen , than mere abstract idealisms , romantic nonsense , as it was the fashion to call every thing which had not an immediate practical bearing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that Willis could not have lived on poetry . He could not have lived as he wished to live , as all wished to live , in splendor , in luxury , in the odor and sanctity of exclusive fashion . He followed the general current ; and it shows how strong that current must have been , when such minds as his , were not only drawn into it , but led to bend the whole strength of their genius and their talents , to foster and encourage the trivial , sensuous , material taste and spirit of the time . Halleck , before this , had ceased to write , and had taken to the counting house . What might not the author of Fanny and of Marco Bozzaris , have done to check the mere pride of wealth , and encourage the pride of noble feeling . Percival , too , shrank more and more from a society which grew more and more uncongenial to his taste . He could not write that which would not be read and approved ; so he , for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rocks and lonely fields ; and in studying their secrets , and collecting their treasures , in communing with wild and solitary nature , found a solace which he sought in vain from the sympathy and appreciation of his fellow men . Mr. Cooper , the author of high and spirit-stirring tales of the forest and of the deep , works eminently calculated to cultivate the taste and imagination , and to enrich the literature of our country ; he , too , forsook his high vocation , and on returning from his residence abroad , where he had assiduously striven to obtain the honors and distinctions of ton , produced his famous Home as Found , a book remarkable for many things , but for none so much as for showing how the naturally fine mind of the author had become enthralled to the prevailing low , contracted , mechanical spirit , as evinced in his strictures on society and manners . Mr. Cooper had it in his power , at this time , to do much to elevate the standard of manners , for all eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and done by those who had been abroad . Had // he written a book inculcating sell ' . respect and independence of thought and action ; had he shown how our new and peculiar position enabled us to throw off the burden which time , and prejudice , and opinion , had thrown around an old and artificial society , and instead of imposing fashion and prescription as a guide , had directed us to the principles of fitness , of convenience , of true politeness , of genuine taste , he might , by his influence , have increased our true respectability , both at home and abroad . But instead of this , much as he complained of provincialism , and want of independence , he certainly did his best to frighten the Americans ( already , as we have seen , timid and anxious to a ridiculous degree , ) into a belief that all manners were shocking , and vulgar , and unbearable , unless they were formed upon one particular model , and that model , not founded as it should be , upon benevolence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrary rules and customs of a cold-hearted and artificial foreign society . Miss Effiagham is an impersonation of etiquette , and so is the elegant Mr. Effingham , her father . The French governess , who seems to have been introduced to utter oracles on fashionable usage , rings changes through the whole book , on retinue , good tone , and savoir vivre . The faults of our society , the manifold deficiencies in manners , are represented as springing from want of a capital , containing a circle whose customs shall be a law unto all the rest . Nothing is left to good sense ; nothing to peculiar circumstances , institutions , and habits of life . Wine must be drunk , eggs must be opened , puddings must be helped , rooms must be entered in a particular way , the way that Mr. Cooper had been accustomed to see in Square , or at the Hotel de - , or the unhappy wights were branded as naive , provincial , unfinished-terms , in Mr. Cooper 's vocabulary , the most humiliating and degrading . Thus every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise the value of wealth , and the importance of mere externals , and to make manners an object of universal study and anxiety . Many circumstances were favorable to their cultivation , particularly the leisure , and the means of increascd social intercourse , which were the concomitants of sudden and general wealth . How then did it happen that the springs of society did not work more easily ? That there was not more of grace and elegance , of enjoyment , of ease and freedom , of gentle courtesy , of self and mutual respect among men and women ? In detailing the prevailing , influences of the time , this question has been already almost answered . The influx of wealth had raised multitudes to situations , for which they were not by previous education and habits prepared . Where wealth and accidental circumstances were the only or principal objects of respect , society could not be otherwise than vulgar . Not having the resisting and self-directing power , which a cultivated judgment and taste would have bestowed , the severe strictures of foreigners caused an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of imitation , than which a power more destructive of dignity , of ease , of gr ace , of variety , of elevation of any kind , does not exist . Add to this the effect of a whole literature of direct or indirect ridicule . The larger cities became afraid they should not resemble , in every particular , the state of things in London and Paris . The smaller cities and larger villages were in a panic , lest they should be supposed to differ in any of their modes and customs , from New York , or Boston , or Philadelphia . The old families of the country were frightened and disgusted at the encroachments of the new people , and retired with // as much haste as their dignified habits would permit , from an arena that was desecrated by the presence of mushroom gentility ; while these last , uncertain of their position , and each anxious and determined to be greater than the other , sought to increase their consequence , by all sorts of airs and pretension . Ambition became the ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsuspiciousness of that interesting period was , under maternal tuition , tinged with the spirit of sordid calculation ; and the little things in pantalettes , instead of yielding to the joyous and trusting confidence and love , natural to their age , might be seen and heard eagerly discussing and settling , often laughably enough , the exact grade of gentility of some little playmate , and the precise degree of attention and respect which she was entitled to receive , in virtue of her mother 's fashion , or her father 's wealth or office . Jealousy , distrust , and fear , took the place of honest confidence , and generous friendship . There seemed to be no settled principles of action , except a general determination in each one to be first . People were much in society , but the communion of mind with mind and heart with heart , was deadened and interrupted by some ambitious desire , or some latent fear , connected with the wealth or the standing of those by whom they were surrounded . Instead of the genuine demonstration of respectful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor is paid to character , there was the variable and fitful expression , either of strong regard , or of entire neglect , as expediency , or a desire for popularity , or some other temporary motive , swayed the ambitious mind , and led it for the moment , to wish to ingratiate itself with individuals or with classes . Tender , delicate , sincere natures , were of course unsatisfied with this selfish and variable regard ; and what wonder if such , unwilling to enter upon the strife of competition , and incapable of perpetual simulation , shrank away from this heartless intercourse , and came , very unjustly , to be considered as cold and unsocial . In the work of Mr. Cooper to which we have alluded , he repeatedly makes the remark , that while the manners of the inhabitants of our larger cities , were inferior to the same class abroad , those of our villages and retired country places , were vastly superior . This was probably true ; and where shall we find the solution ? Was it not that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial modes and foreign opinions , and having , as they all had , leisure , literature , and the means of general cultivation , ( and be it remarked , that the literature of refinement and taste was not so soon displaced by the literature of ridicule and fashion , in the country as in the city , ) exhibited the natural result of such a state of things , in increased refinement and self and mutual respect ? They were not tormented with the fear of being in bad taste , or out of the fashion . Somehow or other , they had acquired the idea that they had a right to judge of these things for themselves ; and the consequence was , an easy dignity and self-possession , a mental sprightliness and independence , which the anxious and trembling imitator of fashion would have given the world to possess , but which she could neverattain . It was not necessary for these persons to send to a foreign land , to learn how to arrange their furniture , and in what part of a room they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refinement of mind , and an opportunity to mingle freely with equals , there will naturally be found  |p0-liteness  and good breeding . When there is no strong counteracting tendency , // the principles of a just taste are developed simultaneously with the intellect and the imagination ; for they depend upon a good judgment , and a delicate perception of the beautiful ; a union which it should ever be a main point in education to form . After Mr. Cooper wrote , things in the country were not improved . The spirit emanating from the metropolis , extended its influence , in some measure , into remote places . It is true that the material comforts and elegances of life were increased . But the eagerness to acquire these envied distinctions , wrought a change unfavorable to real elevation , purity , and benevolence of character . There became less of elegant , literary leisure ; of refined , social intercourse ; of kind and liberal reciprocation of neighborly offices ; less of quiet , modest independence of thought and feeling . The objects of life were show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appliances of luxury increased , life itself became coarser and more practical . The cultivated and reflecting mind lost some measure of its influence , and the characters which came to be held up for imitation in the domestic circle , were those who were most assiduous and skillful in all the little arts of gradually elevating their social position . It will be observed that we have all along been speaking of what has been , of xvhat was at a certain peri od . We have described a state of things which was general , but , happily , not universal . Good judgment , good taste , independence , and a just appreciation of the objects of life , and what constitutes the charm of society , were by no means wanting in individuals or in families , among the newly rich as well as others ; but they were not sufficiently numerous , to feel the comfort of extended congeniality and sympa thy , or the power and influence of combined force . Here and there was one of sufficient strength to give the tone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more daring minds generally usurped the prominent places in society , and in the jumble of life , and struggle for precedence , the finer particles were shaken out of sight . Mr. Cooper says that with us , two years constitutes antiquity ; and if , as has been observed , time is long , in proportion to the important events and changes taking place in it , then may the last five or six years be called indeed an age , for manifold have been its revolutions . We need not describe the great commercial calamity , which took place at about the commencement of this period , when thousands who had rested upon their wealth as upon a sure foundation for themselves and for their children , found it suddenly crumbling to dust beneath them ; but we may examine its bearings upon the subject we are considering ; we may try if we can not discern a jewel in the head of this ugly monster . And we rejoice to say that the germs of a truer and better philosophy of life and manners may be perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not developed into visible and tangible form and proportion . Experience , the great teacher , though her lessons have been rudely given , and quite in the reputed style of a stepmother , has taught some deep and important truths , and none more forcibly than the importance and necessity of self-dependence ; the virtue and comfort that is to be found in activity ; and the dignity and happiness which may be thrown over the domestic or social circle , without the aid of extreme wealth , or high fashion . Those who have retained their wealth , have been startled by the shock which has vibrated every where around them ; // and many of those who have lost it , have been surprised to find how much of that which gives contentment to the mind , and beauty and grace to life , still remains to them . An old , imported prejudice , that it was in some measure disgraceful for a lady to exert her talents for her own support , that idleness was necessary to gentility , has been in a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpless unhappiness , how much cramping of noble powers . Work , activity of all kinds , is coming into repute . Misfortune has brought individuals more into contact with the better parts of each other 's nature . People are discovering that the blessing and charm of social intercourse , is not all in splendor and show ; and they are beginning to have the courage to entertain their friends with greater simplicity ; to depend more on the mind for enjoyment , and less on the lights , and the music , and the supper . C'est le premier pas qui coute . If we can think for ourselves on one subject , we shall soon do so on many subjects . Symp. torns of independence of thought in modes and customs , are here and there discernible ; and we are sometimes referred to what is beautiful , and becoming , and proper , rather than to what is fashionable . These improvements may be referred to experience and reflection ; but a new feature in our literature is decidedly showing itself , and a new taste and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel , the burlesque caricature , and the tissue of ludicrous adventure , no longer constitute the sole reading of any class . Old English literature and history , have been gradually coming into vogue . The finest minds of our age have been devoted to the production of essays , biographical , critical , moral , and philosophical . These essays , written with wonderful force of thought , and marvelous power of expression , are made by their subjects and their style , of deep and universal interest ; while their shortness and condensation , invite to general perusal . Many of them , appearing first in reviews , have been lately published in collective volumes , forming a precious little library of wisdom . They were not intended to make profound scholars or deep philosophers , but it may be reasonably asserted that they have done more , and will do more , to form the general mind to correct habits of thought , upon character , life , and society , than all the other literature of the last fifteen years combined . New and better views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misfortune , which has overtaken thousands of families , and driven others by necessity or fear into habits of economy . There has been less extravagance of expenditure , less frivolity , less show , and less love of show . Serious thoughts of a future world , and of the high ends of existence , have gained admission to minds that were before wholly engrossed either in schemes of ambition or in a round of heartless pleasures . But what has this new philosophy to do with manners ? How are manners to be improved by new modes of thinking ? Manners more than any thing . Whatever tends to render the perceptions clear and acute , to lead the mind to think and judge for itself , to refine the imagination , to inspire a love of beauty , and order , and fitness , to give just ideas of what we owe to others , and what to ourselves , to impart to the taste an accurate powerofdiscrimination , must of course have a favorable effect upon our modes of communication with those around us . And let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courtesies , and amenities , and graces of societyon whatever tends to render intercourse with our equals easy and // agreeable  --  or even on ceremonious modes and forms when such are necessary . The communion of mind with mind is a precious privilege , on which many of our virtues and much of our highest happiness depends ; and whatever is connected with it deserves careful study and attention . All we have contended , or would contend for , is the right to free ourselves from the thraldom of exclusive fashion , the pitiful spirit of servile imitation , particularly of every foreign custom , whether adapted to our condition or not . We would be glad to see more ease , more polish , more refinement , more variety , more freedom , but we are convinced that in order to attain them we must have more self-reliance and independence ; that we must permit ourselves to think and act without constant and timid subservience to an arbitrary standard ; that we must refer to first principles , to taste , and not alone to fashionable prescription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in all instances rejecting foreign customs . So far from it , we felt truly obliged to the writers and travelers mentioned above , whether friendly or unfriend ly . They undoubtedly did much good in pointing out and lashing what few among ourselves would have had courage to attack ; and if the habits of filthy spitting , of rapid eating , and of foolishly betitling every male biped in our land , could be done away by any number of Mrs. Trollopes , we would gladly welcome one every month . But we think there was no necessity for being so much frightened at criticism ; of giving up our claim to the right and power of self-guidance and selfimprovement , particularly when the principles of society and of taste lie as open to us as to them . It was originally our intention to enter into a discussion of these principIes , and to prove that taste is a thing separate from and independ ent of fashionable usage , but the subject has been so well treated in an essay recently published in this magazine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of explanation ; and we have , therefore , used the terms in their distinct and recognized meaning . We would not discourage those who have it in their power to visit foreign countries . The delight and improvement of traveling abroad , if undertaken with proper objects , must be great indeed . Our heart leaps within us at the very thought of standing on the soil of England , of gazing on the " lilied fields of France , " of sailing up the " storied Rhine ; " of beholding the glorious works of nature and of art , concerning which we have heard so much . But the same heavens are over us here as there ; we have the same literature upon our tables , we are from infancy familiar with the same ideas . Here as there we are surrounded by human beings who need our love , our pity , and to whom it is our duty to make ourselves useful and agreeable . And here as there , and perhaps more easily here than there , we can drop and discard whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was intended by heaven to be , a solace and a blessing ; a help to morality and religion ; an improver of whatever is good and beautiful in our nature and condition ; a perennial fount of enjoyment in the pathway of life . We had intended to take a more particular notice of some of the books of etiquette , and essays on manners , to which we alluded on a former page , but our limits will not permit . There is one branch of our subject , however , which , from the importance attached to it , and the efforts made to improve in it , with not always a very favorable result , demands a more particular exemplification . We mean manner , individual carriage or bearing , and // particularly as applied to females . No one can think this subject unimportant who knows , as we do , that it is considered the very first point in female education , taking precedence even of a knowledge of etiquette ; that those schools are most popular where most attention is paid directly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often repeated in the girlish ear , as " be lady-like in your manner ; " and that there is more care and effort expended upon this one point , than upon all others put together . All acknowledge the influence of a pleasing manner ; it is important that it should receive attention and culture . But we are , probably , singular in our opinion , that indirect teaching by example , by general cultivation of the powers of taste and observation , by instilling an early knowledge of the fundamental principles of grace , would have more influence in forming a pleasing manner , than the teasing , didactic rules and lessons so incessantly insisted on , and in general with so little effect . We would not paint the petals of a tulip to increase its beauty ; we would enrich the soil in which it grows , we would expose it to the smile of heaven , and all genial influences ; we would guard it from insects , and clear it from noxious weeds ; and we would let nature do the rest , confidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and richness of coloring . But our greatest point of difference lies not so much in the mode of culture as in the thing itself . What we have seen admired as the perfection of manner , struck us as something very different , and we have sometimes thought that we were farther from the summit of cultivation and refinement in this respect , than is altogether agreeable to our self-love to admit . The styles of manner most admired and imitated , have appeared as something too distinct from the character and the person , too much a thing put on for show , as must ever be the case where manner is trained to a particular standard , without any reference to peculiar disposition . The perfection of manner consists in its being an easy and natural expression of the feelings and the character , divested from awkwardness by careful training , and kept free from art and affectation . XVhen this is done , if the material is naturally of any degree of fineness , the result will be a beautiful simplicity , which is the very highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so , even where cultivation has reached its extremest point of perfection . The progress of taste in regard to manner , may not unaptly be compared to that of the fine arts ; and to prove and illustrate our position , that the highest culture leads us back to nature and simplicity , let us glance at one or two of these . The first step in civilization is a departure from nature ; the last is a return to it . The rough farmer of the west , the pioneer of the wilderness , despises the wealth of foliage and of shade , with which nature has embowered the soil , and not till he has cleared the spot where his cottage stands from every tree and shrub , does he think it wears an air of comfort and civilization . When all is bare , and the forest has receded to a respectable distance , then , and not till then , does he congratulate himself upon having made an improvement . He is satisfied with this , not for the mere purposes of cultivation ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he thinks , superior to the primeval wilderness from which he has redeemed it . Look at him , and at the English nobleman who has brought into requisition the finest talents of his country , and expended thousands in the effort to surround his habitation with what shall appear like a simple , natural landscape , // and you have the two extremes of taste and cultivation . Between these two are many gradations . Ornament is early sought , but it is all of an artificial kind . The Lombardy poplar , with its stiff , straight stem , planted in rows , the circular pond , the oval grass-plat , the long rectangular beds of flowers , have their day and are admired . But improvement rests not , and increasing taste is shown by a still farther departure from nature . Flower beds must be made in all sorts of scientific and fanciful shapes ; trees must be cut into regular form , or dwarfed to diminutive size ; figures which have not their likeness in heaven or on earth , are arranged as ornaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and terraced gardens , are in their turn esteemed the perfection of beauty . It is not until some fine , original , independent mind , with an eye to perceive the vast superiority of a brook tumbling wildly over its bed of rocks , to the straight , insipid canal ; of undulating glades , embowered in the thick foliage of spreading maples , to clumps of straight and nicely triin med trees ; of flowers scattered through an irregular border , and lifting up their sweet faces unexpectedly and by stealth , to circles , and rhomboids , and trapeziums fitting into each other like a joining map ; of an arbor of young trees interlaced with vines , to the eight-sided board temple , placed on the spot most exposed to wind and rain , and crowned with its pert , little weathercock , that the genuine principles of taste in the laying out and ornamenting of grounds , begin to be perceived . From this moment , however , improvement is rapid . Art assumes her proper place as the handmaid of nature . She removes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping the various features which nature has impressed upon the scene , but she attempts not to counteract or remodel them . Vistas are opened to furnish views of a distant mountain ; groves are thickened to hide an unsightly or incongruous object ; and thus an effect is obtained , natural , or like the most beautiful nature . In this , as in manner , the finer the taste , the more correct the eye , and the sounder the judgment which directs the necessary improve meats , the more beautiful and perfect will be the result . Let us turn to another of the arts , namely , architecture . The first rude dwellings of man are constructed on the most simple plan . Trunks of trees cleared of their branches , and overlaid with rough beams , are made to support a roof , which sheds the rain , and affords shelter to the family within . The most beautiful temples of Greece are built upon the same plan , and with very nearly the same proportions . The trunks of trees are represented by tall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rude , square stone , brought by the herdsman from the mountain , to give stability to his habitation . The beams , with their projecting ends , though made smooth and regular , are seen in the Doric and Ionic orders ; and even th' very channels worn by the rain , are preserved in the triglyphs of the Doric , where , with their depending drops just ready to fall , they form the principal ornament . In the majestic order called the Ionic , what do we see for its crowning ornament , but the common twisted horn ? And in the Corinthian , where the elements of beauty and grace are all combined , we behold in the most conspicuous place , the simple wicker basket with its covering of board , in the midst of the flowing acanthus leaves . All succeeding ages have attempted improvements , artd have striven , by splendor of coloring , or by profusion of ornament , to produce something that should be more admirable ; but the highly refined // taste turns from them all to the models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finds in their beautiful simplicity , their symmetry , their fitness and adaptation , the perfect beau ideal of its finest conceptions . The manner of persons engrossed in the necessary business of life , is generally plain , direct and simple ; and we venture to assert , that when we arrive at the perfection of breeding and refinement , the same epithets will apply-improved , of course , by a generally cultivated taste , by tact and judgment , and by that easy dignity which a consciousness of cultivation gives ; in short , with some such difference as there is between the taper trunk of the hickory tree , and the finely carved column , which is considered the more perfect , the more nearly it resembles it in form and proportion . But before this natural and beautiful result is gained , there are many trials and many mistakes . With wealth and leisure , comes the desire of shining in society ; of appearing something different from and superior to , the common mass . This leads us away from nature , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , the thicker and more abundant do all sorts of airs and affectations grow . It might be supposed that manners would be as various as the shades of individual character , and to . a certain extent this must be the case ; but not even in dress , is the power of fashion and imitation more apparent than in this . Some admired model , some intimation of a fashionable custom abroad , some innovation of a dashing belle at home , has power to sway the more ambitious part of the female community , like a gale of wind sweeping over the tall grass of the meadow . Take , for instance , the mode of walking . A few years ago , a fashionable aspirant might be known by her peculiar gait . The short , quick , fiat , plumping step ; the shoulders and bust thrown forward , and the lower part of the body ostentatiously protruded and carried from side to side with every movement ; the elbows thrown out and forward , and the hands meeting in front . But some keen-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , not real elegance . It was discovered to be the exact mode of walking of the Paris soubrettes , and was abandoned . The manner which succeeded , was entirely different . The person was carried as upright as possible ; the hands , especially if a muff was used , being placed as low as the arms would permit ; while the knees seemed to take the lead , the feet languidly following . This style has also disappeared , and the firm , decided , old English , marching step , with head erect and folded arms , is coming into vogue . So also in entering a room . At one time , it must be done with a quick , running step , and a manner all eagerness and empressment . At another , the mien must be cold and stately , and every movement measured and methodical . It has been observed by scientific men , that owing to the peculiarities of our climate , the newness of our country , or some other reason , the sanguine temperament , that which gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This , with its rounded form , its brilliant complexion , and its mellow hair , is decidedly the temperament of beauty , and under proper culture it would be that of grace also . But we have heard that the prominent characteristic of the highest class of English society is a cold , apathetic indifference of manner ; one which , wrapped in the comtemplation of its own perfections , is quite above and beyond the sphere of common feeling and sentiment ; and into this manner our misses and school-girls are carefully trained . // It is painful as well as ludicrous , to enter a room of young ladies , whose rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes indicate the vivacity of their dispositions , and to see them sitting in starched , and affected , and unchanging attitudes , striving to look languid , and indifferent , and ladylike ; to see them practicing the stately , supercilious courtesy , or extending the two permitted fingers in the most exact of curves . Think not , fond mother , or teacher , that any degree of practice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitual . Nature repays herself for the violence done her , by going to the other extreme when the pressure is taken off . These incipient fine ladies , when escaped from your surveillance , are the veriest hoidens on the face of the earth . Would it not be better to allow a natural expression of feeling and action in consonance with the age and character ; restraining rudenesses , and correcting awkwardnesses , hut giving scope for the thousand nameless graces which would play around the youthful form in unconscious ease , if art and fashion should yield part of their power to nature and taste ? In the formation of manner , reference should be had to the physical as well as to the mental character . The movements of large bodies in order to be graceful , must be slow ; smaller bodies can and should move quicker . In contradiction of this rule , how frequently do we see small people despising their peculiar advantages , and endeavoring to give themselves importance and dignity by a heavy , measured tread , and a stiff , erect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought heavy and clumsy , throws aside the dignity which would sit so gracefully upon her , and which nature would be sure to teach her , and skips and dances about like a frolicksome kitten , to show that she is not at all encumbered by her superior weight . Where nature has given a joyous expression of countenance , the sunny hair , the rosy cheek , the light-hearted laugh is beautiful , is graceful ; but with the pale intellectual brow , the dark , thoughtful eye , the features of classical repose , a hearty laugh seems incongruous ; it is against nature , it is distortion , and instead of joining in it with earnest sympathy , we feel uneasy until the mocking disturbance has passed away , and the features have settled into their expressive stillness , or into the mindillumined smile playing gently over them , like southern moonlight on a group of sculptured marbles . Yet we have seen , with a Hebe face and figure , a gravity and demureness that mocked all efforts to awaken the springs of gayety which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and while so occupied , have been paralyzed by a hearty laugh from a neighboring statue of Minerva , or what had , until that moment , appeared like one . Dr. Johnson observed , that a woman was well dressed when , after seeing her , one could not remember what she had on . A similar remark will apply to manner . Is a lady 's dress wanting in neatness , is it ill-fitting , or tawdry , or too highly ornamented for the place and occasion , it strikes us at once , and we are sure to observe and remember it . So in manner , it is awkwardness , it is affectation , * it is incongruity , which forces itself upon our observation . Where there is propriety , and adaptation , and ease , we are conscious of a feeling of high gratification and pleasure ; we are charmed , scarcely knowing why . It is like harmony in music , or a happy union of colors in painting . It is true , there are those who like a tawdry and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // admire manners evidently artificial and overwrought ; but they are not to be found among the most highly refined and cultivated . They are generally those who have begun to study the graces when their education has been nearly or quite completed ; who have been smitten with a desire for superior elegance , and have supposed that the more widely they departed from nature , the more evident it would be that they had made it a peculiar study . They have not studied wisely ; that is , they have not gone far enough to perceive that the principles of true taste would lead them far beyond this limbo of cold , fantastic , unreal shows , which they have entered from fear of being confounded with the vulgar , into a genial and kindly region , where they are permitted , nay , required , to unite the beauty of truth with the charm of grace . There are many among us in this state of half progress ; and they are generally most prominent where the fashionabies or would-befashionables most do congregate . Satisfied with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite unconscious that some whom they see around them with quiet , simple , unobtrusive manners , which they would stigmatize as no manners at all , and yet whose influence they can not but feel , and are provoked with themselves for feeling , are in reality practicing that which would be instantly recognized as good breeding by the most refined class of any cultivated nation . It will be perceived that in this slight essay , we have used the term , society , in a very limited sense . That we have merely glanced at its surface , and at some of the lighterand more obvious influences , which have been , and which are affecting it . In our present state , when there seems to be a breathing time from overexertion and excitement , a time for reflection , for new prepara tion for the future ; it were well if some one fitted for the task , should probe to its very depths ; should show the tendency for good or for evil , in many of our incipient habits and modes of thinking ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest improvements . A few years ago , it would almost have appeared that it were better to bring up our daughters in ignorance , than to endeavor to expand their minds , to give them superior accomplishments , and open to them an elevated rnnge of thought. - Amongaco mmunity where the general mind was bent upon dress , and eating , and furniture , and carriages , a rational course seemed likely to place them without the pale of that sympathy and congeniality , which every human heart requires . But the changes in society are working a corresponding change in opinion . Many who , a short time since , were nodding their plumes to each other , from splendid chariots , may now be seen some feet lower upon the trottoirs . Many who had set up as leaders of ton , on the strength of an elegant house and fine furniture , are now to be found dusting their own chairs , and washing their own tea-cups , in the unaristocratic " two story . " The circumstances which gave them their consequence , in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that wealth which does not depend upon banks and subtreasuries , is again rising into some esteem . The class is daily becoming larger , who think that a cultivated taste , and a well-stored intellect , are advantages worth possessing ; for they see that those who are thus prepared , generally meet and sustain a change of fortune , with far more , cheerfulness and equanimity , than the empty and the vain . And well they may ; for the reverses which take all from the mere worldlings , leave the others rich in resources for making themselves and // their friends happy . In such circumstances , they have the advantage greatly on their side , even supposing that both had cultivated the social and domestic affections with the same fervor , which , however , can not - be the case . The passion for mere wealth and show , is a disorganizing and disuniting principle in its very essence ; and to suppose that the kindly and humane affections as readily unite themselves with its selfish nature , as with those of a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the placid brow and the gentle smile , laying aside the tinsel trappings with which affection may have decked her in the hour of prosperity , and betaking herself to the humble employments which a change of circumstances requires ; but her who , by force of a judicious education , or by natural strength and enlargement of mind , has been led to perceive and appreciate the true relations of things ; that there is a higher and a better good , than any the externals of life can furnish ; that mind is superior to matter , and of the same value , wherever placed ; and that sympathy and affection are the very jewels of life , the pure and inborn gems that give light even in darkness ? Let not then the timid and wavering mother be misled by a too shortsighted view of things , into a belief that she consults the best welfare of her daughters , by restricting their education to a low standard . We trust the time is coming , is come , when those who act from no higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivating all the highest powers of the mind , and warmest affections of the heart . They will see that the commercial revolutions to which our country is subject , will from time to time , come to lay waste the fair fields of prosperity , and that then , she who has been best prepared by education , will be most likely to preserve her own respectability , and the happiness of those around her . And it is to be hoped that the sad experience of the past , will open so many eyes to the value of this better wealth , that in the golden days of prosperity , superior qualities shall retain the ascendency and the estimation they deserve ; that airs shall not again take precedence of graces , flippancy of wit , rudeness of refinement , inanity of intelligence , nor apathy and indifference of warm and generous feelings . We even venture to hope that improvement may be carried to such an extent , that the pleasure and benefit to be derived from the exercise of elegant accomplishments and useftil employments , shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from gossiping , scandal , and worsted work . Then will manners become what they should ever be , the beautiful index and exposition of character , and will flow from it so naturally , and with so little study , that we may confidently expect our stores of waste paper to be very considerably increased by superfluous pages , here and there , from even our best digested systems of etiquette.
