txt IT is well that these two publications appear nearly at the same time . The father and the son were closely united dur // ing their lives , not only by the natural ties of mutual dependence and affection , hut by the great similarity of their characters , opinions , and pursuits ; and in their deaths they were not long divided . Educated alike almost from the cradle for the same profession , working at their appointed tasks with equal constancy and devotedness , enjoying the same love , confidence , and respect , not only of the religious denomination to which they both belonged , but of the whole community who were witnesses of their gentle and unassuming virtues and remarkable abilities , and laboring side by side during the whole later portions of their lives as professors in the same institution , it seemed not unmeet that the two should he called away in quick succession from their earthly toils . Yet if we regard age only , the divine summons caine prematurely to the one , while it found the other in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he had hardly reached the age which is usually marked by the most vigorous expansion of the mental powers , and is with most persons no more than the middle period of their useftilness . His death , therefore , seemed a heavier privation to the multitudes who had profited by his counsels and example ; hut the feeling of privation was mercifully made lighter for his aged father , who had already passed the term of life assigned by the Psalmist , and whose mind was now partially obscured hy the shadows of approaching dissolution . He lingered less than two years more , and then rejoined his eldest son . Dr. Palfrey , for many years the colleague of the two in the management and instruction of the Divinity School in Harvard University , has paid a just and appropriate tribute to the character and services of the elder Df . Ware . The story of his life , a life not of many incidents or vicissitudes , but of unremitting study and patient devotion to onerous and important duties , is very plainly and briefly told , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great simplicity and fidelity . The portrait is a pleasing one and a striking likeness , not overcharged with eulogy , nor burdened with minute details or any excessive display of analytical skill . Those who were well acquainted with the subject of the discourse will he grateful to the writer for the increased distir*ctness which he has given to their recollections of him , and for the graceful and feeling language in which he has embodied their sentiments of respect and affection for his memory . // We have room here only for a meagre outline of the facts and reflections contained in the discourse . Henry Ware was born in Sherburne , in this State , on the 1st of April , 1764 . His father was a farmer , whose moderate means did not enable him to do much for the education of a large family ; and the boys could only attend a common school for a few weeks during the winter , while they were engaged for the rest of the year at work upon the farm . The gentle and rather timid manner of Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of books , made him a favorite with his teachers ; and his elder brothers , " with a generosity so nobly common , then and now , in our New England farm-houses , " resolved to unite their efforts to obtain for him a liberal education . The minister of the parish assisted him in his preparatory studies , and he was admitted to the Freshman class at Cambridge , in 1781 . Faithful in the performance of all his duties , and invariably correct in his deportment , he became distinguished as a scholar , and graduated with the highest honors of his class . But with the humility which was a striking trait in his character , he avowed that he had little pleasure in the retrospect of his undergraduate course , as he thought he had made but imperfect use even of the small advantages which the College , in those troubled days , was able to afford . Few will think , however , that much of his time was misemployed during those years in which he held the first rank among his classmates , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success in after life . Dr. Ware was always equal to his work ; he had no strong passions to contend with , nor any fruits of early carelessness or indolence to eradicate . On leaving college , he took charge of the town school in Cambridge , in order to support . himself while he was pursuing his studies for the Christian ministry under the direction of one of the clergymen of the place : His time of preparation was short , amounting only to a year and a half ; during which period , moreover , seven hours a day were occupied in his school . But the native vigor of his mind , his strict application and orderly habits , even with such imperfect opportunities of regular culture , were enough to insure success in his profession , and his preaching from the first proved highly acceptable to his audiences . Dr. Palfrey sums up very briefly , but with nice discrimination , the qualities on which his popularity as a preacher depended . // " lie had the great Christian preparation for his studies , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his will , he shall know of the doctrine . ' The clearness , Scriptural simplicity , and practical character of his expositions of truth ; the rich personal experience disclosed in his discourses ; their modest , and at the same time winning and fervent , tone ; the gentle and sincere solemnity , which impressed and subdued all the more for assuming nothing , and inspired confidence in the same degree as it tacitly disclaimed authority ; the native and cultivated refinement of mind , which not only made any offence against good taste , any coarseness of address , impossible , hut which knew how to find for gospel truth the kindest access to the waiting spirit ; the ruling good sense , which conceived no extravagances ; the contemplative and tender feeling , which had fathomed the depths of every remonstrance and rehuke that was uttered ; these qualities in the young preacher , set off with the advantages of an engaging presence , a musical voice , and a natural action , fixed attention and won golden opinions in the congregations to which he ministered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his years of riper service . " - pp. 12 , 13 . He soon received an invitation to take charge of the First Church in Hingham , and was ordained there on the 24th of October , 1787 . Two years afterwards , he married Mary , daughter of the Rev. Jonas Clarke , of Lexington . Ten chiidren were horn of this marriage , of whom four died in infancy , and three sons and three daughters arrived at years of maturity . Mr. Ware continued to be the minister of Hingham for eighteen years , his labors being cheered by the respect and confidence of a numerous and intelligent congregation , and darkened only by the anxieties which arise from a narrow income and a large family . He was settled upon a salary of four hundred and fifLy dollars a year , which was afterwards increased to seven hundred . This sum being quite insufficient for the wants of his , household , he was obliged to eke out its deficiencies by keeping boarders , and taking boys under his charge to fit for college . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they interfered seriously with the progress of his studies and the growth of his professional reputation . But in these respects , most other clergymen had to contend with difficulties equally great , and his relative standing therefore was high in proportion to his fine abilities , the extent of his attainments , and the strength of his character . // Accordingly , in 1805 , the decease of Dr. Tappan having created a vacancy , Dr. Ware was appointed to the Hollis Professorship of Divinity in Harvard College . This appointment proved the signal for an open rupture between the two parties into which the Congregational Church in New England had long been divided , though circumstances had hitherto prevented any outward manifestation of the schism . In the theological warfare which ensued Dr. Ware took little or no part ; he had but little personal concern in the matter , as his appointment was contested on doctrinal grounds , and not from any alleged disqualifications in point of character or ability . The action of the Corporation in his case was confirmed by a considerable majority in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he quietly occupied himself with the duties of his office within the College , leaving it for others to ride the storm of religious controversy that was raging without . Averse to angry discussion both by temperament and principle , the gentle and diffident cast of his mind and his industrious habits inclined him to keep within the still air of delightful studies , and the cares of his office and his family offered scope enough for his ambition and his efforts . Not till fifteen years after his appointment did he take any part in the religious controversies of the day ; and the discussion in which he then engaged with the Rev. Dr. Woods , of Andover , protracted for ahout two years , was at once his first and last appearance as a polemic . The Letters and Replies issued on this occasion , together with two small volumes , which appeared at a much later period , on the Foundation , Evidences , and Truths of Religion , and some occasional sermons , were his only publications . We can not dwell here upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an officer in the academical and theological departments of the University . " His official connection with the College , " says Dr. Palfrey , " has covered the whole of three presidencies , embracing far the most prosperous period the institution has ever known . " About two-fifths of the whole number of graduates at Harvard , and nearly all the Unitarian clergymen in the country , have been his pupils . He instructed the undergraduates by lectures and sermons from the pulpit , by recitations on the evidences of natural and revealed religion , and by a course of academical lectures on the history and criticism of the // books of the New Testament . For several years he had the exclusive direction of the studies of the candidates for the ministry , and after the Divinity School was established , in 1815 , he shared with others its instruction and management . His theological teachings were strongly marked with the candor and fairness of his disposition , the clear and logical arrangement of his ideas , and by his deeply seated religious belief and devotional spirit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart and the intellect to attend an exercise by Dr. Ware . His character and deportment never failed to command the respect and affection of the whole body of the students ; and when , on two occasions , he was charged temporarily with the duties of president of the College , the institution flourished under his management . We quote a portion of Dr. Palfrey 's remarkably just and happy delineation of his character . " I never heard of his having an enemy , and he had cordial friends and well-wishers without number . I never heard of any body 's being injured by his unkind word or deed . A meek and gentle charity was the spirit of his life . Mild and encouraging in his intercourse with intimates and strangers , tolerant in his judgments , reasonable in his expectations , easy to be pleased , patient to wait God 's time for his successes , grateful for what was given , content to forego what was denied , a rare serenity of mind endowed him richly with that truest independence that can belong to man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to cherish the tumults of a selfishly ambitious or a dissatisfied temper . Occupying a conspicuous and responsible station , in which an agitator would have found abundance of temptation and scope for turbulent activity , and which unavoidably , from the circum. stances of the times , invited some ungentle assault , he knew how to be inflexibly true to its obligations , without ever a departure from the meekness of wisdom . The candor of his mind was remarkable . He trusted truth enough to give error every fair chance . Who ever knew him unjust to an adverse statement , or heard him sharpen an argument with a taunt ? " The scrupulous , rather the essential and spontaneous , fair . ness and uprightness of his understanding was an eminent qualification for a liberal discipline of youth . Its influence gently laid their minds open to a willing and reverential reception of all truth , and by a sort of insensible but irresistible contagion inspired them with the love of it , and of the goodness with which it is congenial . A great firmness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a truer man , to stand courageously by what // his cautious judgment had once approved as fit and right , does not live . A hopeful perseverance belonged to it no less . His official success was not without its interruptions . At one time , twenty-five years ago , some of the most eminent of his pupils adopted a theory of Christianity the most adverse to his views of a sober interpretation of the Scriptures . At a more recent period , the School was partially infected by what he and his colleagues regarded as a sad tendency to no religion . But he had lived long enough to see many unexpected occurrences , and therefore to see some others without surprise ; and observation and experience , as well as meditation , had given him a reliance on the power of truth , and of the well directed labors of its friends , which forbade a moment 's discouragement or distrust , even though some floating vapor should , within the little range of its transient shadow , obscure that ever-burning sun . And always , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope . " - pp. 31-33 . The character of the father , with the slight modifications incident to some original difference of temperament , was happily reflected in that of his eldest son . The history of the childhood of Henry Ware , jr. , says his brother , " constitutes , perhaps , the most important part of his biography . Then impressions were made , a tendency was given , and habits of thought , feeling , study , and action were formed , which appear to have decided his whole future course . " The influences of his early home were of priceless value to him , and left but little in his character to be corrected by the harsher lessons of personal experience in maturer years . He lost his mother , indeed , while he was yet a boy ; but not till he had largely profited by the peculiar tenderness and watchfulness of a mother 's love , so that he could be trusted for the future with more safety to the firmer hand and more uniformly judicious , but less incessant , guardianship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the father and the son gave to their intercourse , so far as one can judge from the letters published in this volume , more the appearance of two friends consulting with each other on important topics , with equal liberty of judgment , than of paternal authority and filial submission- So much care was taken with early habits and first impressions , that little or nothing remained to he corrected by subsequent teachings , and there was no room for reproof . The lessons related to progress and higher attainments , and not to the correction of mistakes already cornmitted , or the repression of impulses once indulged . // For the further illustration of this point , we quote the following beautiful account of the early religious education of Mr. Ware . " It is impossible to designate the period at which religious impressions were first made upon his mind . It would be difficult , indeed , to look back upon any moment at which he was destitute of them . He had the happiness to be brought up under the guidance of parents , with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons , as it was an element of their daily life and conversation . It was , therefore , presented to his mind in its most attractive form , constantly kept in view , held up as the most important concern in life , but divested of that air of formality and sadness , which so often makes it repulsive to children . Instruction on this topic was constant , but not burdensome . Family worship and the reading of the Scriptures were made an indispensable part of the duty of the day , but not protracted so as to be tedious to the young ; whilst private devotion was so inculcated , as to make its omission felt as an act of ingratitude to the Creator . Every occasion of trial , sickness , or death afforded an opportunity for gentle , but distinct admonitions , intended to impress on the young mind the uncertainty and dangers of life , the certainty of death , and the reality of eternity and judgment . The Sabbath was to be regarded as holy time , a day by itself , essen* tially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object and employments ; not as a day on which man was to be more religious than on other days , but on which religion was to become more peculiarly the subject of meditation and study . Still it was not made gloomy by tasks or restraints so severe , as to associate it with the idea of privation and austerity . It was suffered to be a day of cheerfulness , but yet of moderate restraint upon the buoyancy and playfulness of childhood . " - Life , p 8 . This passage explains the whole secret of Mr. Ware 's peculiar religious character . His faith was an inflexible and ever-working principle , constantly applied to all the concerns of life , yet never thrust obtrusively forward , nor paraded when out of season . It was eminently a practical and personal thing , which formed an atmosphere , as it were , that colored all his motives and conduct . It had all the warmth , but none of the blindness , of enthusiasm ; it was founded on strong convictions and deep feeling , but guided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as great a degree as any individual whom we have ever known the qualities of a cool head and a warm heart . His religious // belief had grown up with him as a part of himself ; and he held it , therefore , easily and gracefully , as something taken in the natural way , and not as a quality superinduced upon old habits by inoculation or some great revolution in the inner man . He troubled himself but little with dogmas , and was very unwilling to enter upon any polemical discussions , while he delighted to talk and write upon religious subjects . In the light of an earnest and deeply seated faith , working from the heart outwards , he held that most theological doubts and difficulties were sure to be dispelled . He was dedicated to the ministry almost from the cradle , both by his own predilections and the wishes of his friends , and his earlier and later culture was all directed with a view to this end . " I doubt , indeed , " says his brother , " whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any length of time , from the days when he preached a juvenile sermon of his own composition from a cradle turned on end as a pulpit , to that in which he actually assumed the office of a minister of the gospel , and made his appearance in the sacred desk . " The plan thus early conceived was followed out with remarkable unity of purpose and a resolute will , through his whole career . The great business of his life was to be a religious teacher , and it seemed never to enter into his head that he could have any other . Various purposes and engagements , seemingly di .. vergent from this object , were still in his view brought to bear upon it , and made subservient to its accomplishment . As an author , either in prose or poetry , as a teacher in the University , when the failure of his health made him an invalid or a traveller , his chief care , and in fact his only one , was the care of souls . The pulpit was his home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole measure of his time and his ambition . Literary fame or reputation as a preacher he never coveted , and no one was so much astonished as himself when they came unsought . The success of his sermons or his publications was never gauged in his mind by any other standard than that of their direct , practical effect on the conduct and consciences of men . His literary and social talents , his oratorical powers , his ability to interest , move , or convince the minds of others , were prized by him not for their own sake , or for the place which they acquired for him in the public estimation , but as means for 17* // the furtherance of this one purpose . They did not increase , they rather diminished , his self-satisfaction , because they enlarged his responsibility . The traits of character which enabled him to accomplish so much in the world were his extreme conscientiousness and his strength of will . His life was not a long one , and it was broken by frequent and long-continued illness . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of bodily inactivity and indolence of disposition . He speaks with great feeling of his sufferings on the former account , and in the same sentence he shows by what means he was able to overcome the difficulty . " All my power of doing any thing , which has led to the reputation I have got , ( God knows how little I deserve it , and there are moments when I think of it with unspeakable wonder and shame , for I can not take to myself any credit , ) has been owing to a stern resolution and vow to throw off my diffidence , and substitute for it a certain nonchalance and affected indifference . This was hard to do , and I suffered enough ; but gradually I did it , and now , after ten years ' practice , I am pretty bold . I had my fears , my mortifications , my horrors of all kinds ; but I determined to overcome them , or they would have overcome me. ' * - L*fe , p. 191 . This explains a peculiarity in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which often surprised those who were well acquainted with his real amenity of disposition . This roughness of address was only a rigid mask resolutely put on to hide and correct the nervous and shrinking spirit that was torturing him within . In another place , speaking of this sensitiveness and of his constitutional indolence , he says : - " Tongue can not tell what I suffered . I shrank from duties important and not really difficult , in the same state of mind in which Cowper shrunk from his post in parliament . But this only made the matter worse ; it increased my sensitiveness , and added to it the pangs of a guilty conscience . ' * The advice which he gave on this occasion , for he was writing to one who had complained to him of similar difficulties , is so good , and throws so much light on his character , that we extract it entire . " 1 . Resolve resolutely that nothing whatever , either in your feelings or circumstances , shall deter you from doing what you think you ought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can tell you . Never stand and think about it , and dread it , but go at once and do it , and have it over . You remember the coward dies a thousand deaths in fearing one . I have died ten thousand in the agony of these fears ; - but there was no need of it " 2 . Persuade yourself that you are somebody , at least in the eyes of other people , and have a right , from your education and situation , to assume something ; - which will be readily allowed you , if you do not act the upstart tyrant . 0 , how long it was before I found this out ; or could believe that others looked on me as any thing more than little Henry Ware , or were ready to receive kindly and with deference whatever I should say I " - lb. , pp. 247-248 . How many suffer from these causes , and how few have the strength of purpose necessary to trample them under foot , as did Mr. Ware ! The pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so acute as to be almost morbid , and which never failed to be awakened when these feelings had led him to shrink from the fulfilment of any duty , however slight . Having profited so much in his own case from cultivating a determined will , he was fond of inculcating this duty upon others , and was never more eloquent than in describing the marvels which it might accomplish . It never did more for mortal man than for himself . In that short life , through all the obstacles and hindrances which we have enumerated , what an amount of labor of the highest and most difficult character did he perform , and how wide and lasting was the impression he left on the minds and hearts of all who came within the sphere of his writings or his voice I The purity of his motives gave him strength ; the simplicity of his manner added to its force ; the singleness of purpose with which he labored always made his work effectual . If he had written or preached from ambitious or personal motives , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extend his influence among them , his words would have fallen comparatively lifeless . But they were winged with his earnestness of spirit , and with what was not so much selfdevotion as entire forgetfulness of self . No wonder , then , that they reached their mark , and left indelible traces where they fell . His manner as a preacher was very characteristic , and showed in some measure the secret of his power . The pecu* liarity of his physical temperament already alluded to affected // his delivery , and a degree of sluggishness and monotony of manner at first impeded the effect of his sermons . This outer crust kept the intensity of his feelings imprisoned within for a while , but only made the contrast more startling , when the pent up spirit at length broke forth , like the lightning from a cloud . We never heard any thing in the way of eloquence which surpassed the electric and thrilling effect of two or three sentences from Mr. Ware . Then , indeed , the cloud would settle down again over his utterance , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been suspended for a moment , and the attention of his hearers would be recalled to his firm and logical evolution of the subject of discourse . The effect of his sermons was aided also by the hearer 's vivid perception of his sincerity , and by the spirit of reverence and deep devotion with which he engaged in his work . In his manner , no less than in what he uttered , he seemed to say , " I have a message from God unto you " ; and his earnestness and solemnity were such as befitted the awful mission . The attractiveness of the name and character of Mr. Ware has betrayed us into this imperfect and rambling sketch of his moral qualities , while the very minute and interesting biography of him by his brother , Dr. John Ware , lies before us as yet unnoticed . Some idea of his intellectual endowments , and of the extent and value of the works which he has left behind him , may he gleaned from a brief review of the incidents of his life . This volume , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and correspondence , contains all the materials requisite for a complete delineation of the man . The extracts , which are selected with good taste and judgment , give the history of Mr. Ware 's mind and the nature of his opinions in his own words , and the impression which they leave coincides perfectly with the idea formed of his character by those who were intimate with him during his life . They show the warmth of his affections , his conscientiousness , and his devotion to truth and to the highest interests of mankind . Those which relate to his residence in Europe are very lively and entertaining , evincing excellent powers of observation , a highly cultivated taste , and correct judgment of men and things . The writer of the memoir has executed his task with discretion and marked ability , and though his pen was evi // dently guided by strong affection for his deceased brother , he shows no tendency to exalt his merits in an undue degree , or to claim for him a higher place ihan will readily be conceded in the judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succinct , and faithful biography , excellently well written , and full of interest and instruction for all classes of readers . Henry Ware , jr. , the fifth child and eldest son of Dr. Ware , was born at Hingham , on the 21st of April , 1794 . As a child , he appeared docile , thoughtful , and studious , but exhibited no precocity of talent . He was fond of writing , and by his early and frequent attempts at composition , both in prose and verse , he acquired that facility in the expression of his ideas for which he was always remarkable . Dr. Allyn of Duxhury , a classmate and friend of his father , was his teacher for a year or two , and after the removal of the family to Cambridge his studies were pursued under the direction of a recent graduate of the College . One year , also , he spent at Phillips Academy , in Andover , and having completed his preparation there , he was admitted to the Freshman class in Harvard College at the commencement in 1808 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house , and did not form many intimacies within the college walls . He was faithful to his studies , but did not take a distinguished stand as a scholar , and seemed in no wise ambitious of excelling his classmates . Indeed , a lack of ambition was characteristic of him through life ; the desire of reputation among men seemed never to be among his motives of action . He graduated in 1812 , and delivered a poem at the commencement , on the Pursuit of Fame , which was favorably received . The two years after leaving college were spent at Exeter , New Hampshire , as assistant instructer in the Academy there , under the charge of Dr. Benjamin Abbot . He was young for such a post , having but just passed his eighteenth year ; and the trial was a more serious one for him on account of his extreme diffidence and shyness . But by great efforts he so far conquered these difficulties , that strict attention to his duties and his good attainments soon made him acceptable as a teacher , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all who knew him . On these two years he always looked back with as much pleasure as on any period of his life ; his work in the Academy was not irksome // or arduous , he was in the midst of agreeable society , his mind became fixed as to the choice of a profession , and the hours not occupied in instructing others were pleasantly and profitably devoted to his preparatory studies for the ministry . Twenty-five years afterwards , on occasion of the Abbot Festival , when so many of the old friends and pupils of the aged principal gathered around him to congratulate him on the completion of the half-century of his services as the head of the Academy , Mr. Ware revisited Exeter , and showed by the almost boyish exhilaration of his spirits how pleasant were the recollections of his former residence in the place . He wrote a song which was sung at the public dinner then given , and which was received with great delight from its mixture of quiet humor and deep feeling . In August , 1814 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year longer under the direction of his father . The University did not then provide any stated means of instruction for candidates for the ministry , and it is probable , therefore , that his reading was somewhat desultory ; but his zeal and conscientiousness made up for the lack of regular training , and he afterwards appeared well informed on the subjects of his profession , though not a distinguished theological scholar . During this year he delivered two poems in public , one of which , on the conclusion of the Treaty of Peace with Great Britain , was afterwards printed the other was the annual poem before the Phi Beta Kappa Society . Mr. Ware wrote verses with astonishing facility , and frequently cultivated this talent for his own amusement , but very seldom published what he wrote . Among those which he printed , the lines to the Ursa Major , and those entitled the Hour of Prayer , are very striking and beautiful poems , showing an extraordinary command of imagery and versification . Mr. Ware began to preach ' in the autumn of 1815 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he marked , " To be opened and read for improvement , once a month , " though It was probably seen by no one during his lifetime , shows with what humility and devout earnestness he entered on the solemn duties of his calling . There was nothing brilliant in his first appearance as a preacher , and neither he nor his friends were disappointed when it was found that his ser*-nons attracted no particular notice . He was only surprised // when he attained popularity and eminence some years afterwards . A few discerning persons , however , were favorably impressed by the spirit and unction with which , as a beginner , he conducted the services ; and as he acquired confidence and steadily improved in manner , he made a stronger impression , so that , about a year after he began to preach , he received an invitation to settle over the Second Church in Boston . He accepted the call , and was ordained on the 1st of January , 1817 . It was more as a pastor than a preacher that Mr. Ware first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his charge . Struggling with timidity and self-distrust , he went about among the members of his parish , who belonged chiefly to the middle classes of society , and , by the affectionate earnestness and truly Christian spirit of his ministrations , soon won their confidence , and at last their cordial esteem and love . He was indefatigable in his labors , and , indeed , by multiplying the duties connected with his office , and engaging in them with a generous but indiscreet ardor and perseverance , he exhausted the powers of a constitution naturally slender , and laid the foundation of the serious complaints with which he had to contend for the last fifteen years of his life . His hopes were answered in the magnitude of the effect he was permitted to produce on the hearts and consciences of those to whom he ministered , but success was purchased by the prostration of his bodily powers and a premature death . He instituted informal meetings of young persons for religious improvement , first at his own house , and afterwards at the church . Conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course he took far the largest share in it , and soon , in fact , occupied nearly the whole evening with the communication of his own ideas . These private exercises were a source of greater enjoyment to him than the more stated meetings , and probably he was not aware how serious a draft they made upon his capacity for labor . He wrote largely also for religious periodicals , and gave much time and eflbrt to the prosecution of occasional schemes of philanthropy and the inculcation of Christian sentiments among all classes of people . Unfortunately , also , his indolent temperament made him irregular in the disposition of his time , and for the neglect of some assigned duty at the proper period his conscience compelled him to // make atonement by performing it at unseasonable hours , and thereby omitting intended bodily exercise or repose . He labored , moreover , in the establishment of extraordinary religious meetings for the poor , who had no fixed places of worship , and had the happiness a few years afterwards of seeing the excellent institution called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meantime , his reputation as a preacher had much increased , and he had found by his own experience - if his humility had permitted such a reflection - the truth of the maxim which he was wont afterwards to impress upon his pupils , that " the great requisite " for excellence in this department " is a devoted heart . " Acting on such a generous mind as his , the discovery that his sermons were more eagerly listened to only made him bestow more effort on the preparation of them , because preaching was now a more efficient means of usefulness . In 1824 , he published his Hints on Extemporaneous Preaching , a subject on which his own facility of speech , acquired by earnest and untiring effort , empowered him to be a teacher . It is an excellent essay , written in very simple and chaste language , and abounding in sensible and practical suggestions . About this time , also , his Recollections of Jotham Anderson , first published piecemeal in a religious periodical , were collected and printed in a separate volume . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality a work on practical piety , in which is embodied much of his own spiritual experience , and some personal recollections which his modesty led him to ascribe to an imaginary personage . Artless , persuasive , and pious* in tone , this little book affords a charming portrait of Mr. Ware 's own mind , and its popularity and usefulness have been very great . Shortly afterwards , he published a small volume of sermons on the Offices and Character of Jesus Christ , and began the preparation of a Commentary and F*tmily Bible ; this task , however , he never completed . In August , 1824 , General Lafayette being present at the annual celebration of the Phi Beta Kappa Society at Cambridge , Mr. Everett appeared as the orator on the occasion , and Mr. Ware was the poet . The person first assigned for this latter office bad failed to appear , and Mr. Ware consented to supply his place at three days ' notice . Two remarkable dreams had been told to him on the preceding // Sunday evening , and " under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he versified them ; and this impromptu poem , a bold and beautiful lyric , called the Vision of Liberty , was afterwards published . It is one of the most remarkable specimens of rapid poetical composition to be found in print . We have given but an imperfect sketch of Mr. Ware 's multifarious labors at this period ; but enough has been shown to make it a matter of no surprise , that his health broke down entirely under his incessant toil and mental excitement , and after one or two journeys in this country , which produced but partial benefit , he was obliged , in 1829 , to give up his active duties for a while , and go to Europe with his wife , in the hope of repairing a shattered constitution by a change of scene and climate . He remained abroad nearly a year and a half , profiting but very little in point of health , but gaining the acquaintance and friendship of many distinguished and estimable persons , and laying up a store of pleasant memories from the many remarkable scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume relating to his foreign tour is so rich and entertaining , that we are tempted to extract largely from it ; but the want of space will permit us to give our readers only a taste of its quality . The following is from a letter describing a visit to Miss Edgeworth . " I think you will be pleased to hear from me , that your kind letter to Miss Edgeworth has procured for us a ready welcome and a delightful visit . We inclosed it to her , and sent it from Belfast , with a request to be informed whether she would be at home ; as we thought it not worth while to drive sixty miles into the heart of Ireland with the risk of finding her absent , ' - an old College bull , which very properly presents itself at this moment . Her reply was a very gracious one , and we passed nearly two days at Edgeworthstown this week , she seeming pleased with the attention , but the other members of the family still more so , as they seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and we were exceedingly gratified by every thing we saw and heard . " Her manners are easy and animated , without being striking ; her conversation very lively and rich , with a great variety of fine sentiments carelessly thrown out , and perpetual illustrations and images , sometimes highly poetical , sometimes humorous , sometimes , perhaps , a little far-fetched , but always apparently accidental , and always rendering her talk delightful . She is too // rapid and earnest to talk in set phrases , or to have any affectation ; and , as to a masculine way , which some have ascribed to her , it seems to me there is nothing anti-feminine about her , unless it be to talk a great deal , and occasionally to laugh heartily . But she does not talk loud and boisterously ; and her laugh so rings from the soul , ' that even I , who laugh seldom , and am apt to be put out of countenance by a violent ebullition of that human peculiarity in others , could yet entirely sympathize with Miss Edgeworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discretion withal never to laugh long , ( a discretion , by the way , to be recommended to all who would make their mirth acceptable , ) and does not laugh from habit , but only when rightfully excited by sufficient cause . And I am sure it would be hard to find fault with her for laughing , who has occasioned so much exercise of that sort to others . " I was pleased to notice perpetual proofs of great strength of feeling , and that of the most amiable kind . She drew us to her by this trait , and fairly compelled our love . It was not irifrequently , that we observed her eyes fill at the expression of a generous sentiment , or the relation of a touching anecdote . When I told her , that , on my saying at my father 's that I intended to see her , little Charlotte immediately clapped her hands and said , 0 , give my love to her ! ' the water came to her eyes at once ; - and it is plain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and solicitude for their good , which are expressed in her works . She evinced it constantly in her treatment of her younger brother . Then we were very much struck and pleased with the manner in which she spoke of other authors , - so kindly and generously , so free from all petty feelings of jealousy , or whatever other evil emotion there may be ; saying only what was kind , and taking pains to tell Lady Morgan 's story in such a way as to apologize for her affectations , and give us a better opinion of her character . Of Scott she had much to say , and read to us several of his very interesting letters . On the whole , not to prolong , we were highly gratified and satisfied , and not the less so , because we found we were the first Americans , if we rightly understood her , who had paid her a visit at her own house . - L*fr , pp. 277-279 . We find accounts of visits made by Mr. Ware to several other eminent persons in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following , relating to Mr. Southey . " Southey is fifty-five years old ( he showed me a portrait of himself taken at two years of age , - fifty-three years ago , - a round-faced , bright-eyed child , with a tremendous bush of hair , - // he seems to have been always an Absalom in this respect ) ; he looks ten years younger ; was dressed in white pantaloons ; has a most aquiline nose , bright eyes , thick , bushy hair ; is of middling size , blushes easily , and has a very sensitive face ; his eyes filled with tears several times during our conversation . He does not dissertale , nor at all attempt to show off , but talks on easily and naturally , in an affable and gentlemanlike way . " He did not , any more than Wordsworth , disguise his partialities in politics or religion , and , as regards the Catholic question , declared that he would sooner have laid his head on the block , than have voted for the late measures of government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discontents of Ireland did not originate in the religious disabilities , and therefore could not be removed by removing them . From Ireland he ( Southey ) came to America . He spoke *n terms of friendly interest ; rejoiced that the more frequent intercourse was removing ill-will and jealousies ; and said that he had more friends in Boston , than in any city of the world , excepting London , and that , if he were a younger man , he should visit America , and see for himself the condition and prospects of society . " In speaking of his situation , I remarked that he seemed to be both in retirement and in the midst of the world . To which he replied , that , for the three summer months , he was full of company and saw all his friends , and for the other nine was wholly secluded ; and that he could not desire a happier arrangement ; that the summer days were too long for study ; he could work only by candle-light , and if he could have three hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not care what became of the rest of the day . Something led him to speak of writing by dictation , and he said he never had done it , neither was ever able to employ another person in any way about his works , except some trifling copying . 1 asked if he was in the habit of copying for the press , or if he sent his first draught . He said he generally copied , always what was important , and that it was only in making the copy that he paid the slightest regard to style . He thea showed me his History of Brazil , ' in the progress of its manufacture ; bound up in six manuscript volumes , containing , first , the notes and materials put down while reading for the preparation , and , secondly , the history as first written . The copy which the printer used was destroyed . Then he showed me Thalaba , ' the second draught ; the first was written on scraps ; these were copied into a book , on every other page , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sent to the printer , and destroyed . Madoc ' and The Curse of Kehama ' are in the same state ; the latter has three different beginnings in three different sorts of verse . // " Then he showed me his unfinished American poem , called Oliver Newman , ' which is promised to Mr. Ticknor ; and he bade me report progress to him . He read me a passage , which I liked much , but we were interrupted in the midst . He reads with a very peculiar intonation , which is , however , favorable to the metre , and not a bad specimen of poetical recitative ; and occasionally he gesticulates with his arm . I afterwards read the opening canto , and thought it very beautiful , - as beautiful as the first in Thalaba . ' I asked him by what process he built his stories ; whether he laid out the whole plan first , or invented as he went on . He said , that he made the story complete at first , and altered as he went on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 274 . The letters from Rome , where our invalid spent the winter , and from other parts of Italy , are very interesting , as our readers may judge from the following admirable account of some of Thorwaldsen 's works . " Canova was exquisite in a certain line of beauty , but he could not go out of it ; he had no variety , he repeated himself for ever , and has done nothing more than make a great family of brothers and sisters , with a striking family likeness , who had all been brought up by dancing.masters and posture-masters , and could not sit , stand , or look , except by rule . In one word , he was artificial . Thorwaldsen is natural . He copies , not from certain conventional rules of beauty and taste , which he has ir&amp; his mind , but from the various models of nature . Consequently he does not repeat himself , and presents a variety of forms , and expressions , and attitudes , that astonish you almost as much as those of Raffaelle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , without constraint or artifice . It is one of Raffaelle 's distinctions , that you never see any thing like stage effect ; no attitudinizing , no strutting , no showing off of hands and limbs . A stranger may go into his Chambers and decide at once which of them he did not draw , by this criticism ; the other pictures are not representations of the real persons and scene , but of the persons and scene as represented on the stage , - not Constantine , &amp;c. , but certain pompous actors playing the part of Constantine . Now Thorwaldsen has fully this eminent excellence of Raffaelle ; and it is one no small proof of his greatness . " To illustrate all this , and more , I ought to be able to describe to you his two great groups , but I can not do it . Both were done for a church in Copenhagen , by order of the king of Denmark ; the one in marble , colossal statues of Christ and the Apostles ; the other in bronze , John the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure of our Saviour is one of the very few attempts to represent that holy person at which you can look with pleasure . It is noble and sublime , sweet , simple , sad , in attitude and look . The Apostles are a glorious company of venerable men , so variously arranged , in attitude and drapery , that you detect no similarity , and yet with a severity of simplicity that can not be surpassed . I think that out of all the Apostles , of all the masters of painting which I have seen , it would not be easy to select twelve which should be altogether superior . " But the other group is my favorite ; indeed , that I have spoken of is not a group , as each figure is to stand in a separate niche . John the Baptist is truly a group , to be placed in the pediment of the church . The only thing in antiquity to be compared to it is the celebrated and admired group of Niobe and her children . Now I do not admire that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplicity and nature . It is not a copy from nature , but from the stage , - a group of ballet-dancers ; Niobe herself is careful to hold her garment gracefully in all her woe , and the children are thinking of displaying their postures , and holding up the folds of their drapery tastefully , instead of being absorbed by the terrors of the moment . Nothing like this in the group of John ; all is easy , unembarrassed , unaffected , unconscious nature . The Baptist is a thin , haggard man , filled with his subject , and uttering himself vehemently ; his hand raised powerfully , not gracefully , and his eye fixed , as if his mind was working with all its might . The people around him are just those whom you might suppose to be present at his preaching . They describe various classes and ages of hearers , and each may be said to be a model of its class . I can not remember the order of the whole , but it was something like this : On his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his dog at his side , which takes up the attention of two little boys just behind him , one of whom is pointing to him , and the other , a little older , seems divided in attention between the dog and the preacher . Then stands a fine , noble soldier in his armor ; then a figure whose description I forget ; it was standing apart in another room , and I never saw it but once ; then a mother sitting with eye intent on the speaker , with her arm embracing a little child , who is leaning his head sweetly on her lap ; then a young man , reclining at his length , and looking over his shoulder at the preacher . On his right hand you see , first , a young man with his arms folded ; then an elderly man with a young man behind , leaning on his shoulder ; then a mother , kneeling , and a child , of eight or ten , looking over her shoulder ; then an aged man , sitting , his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cane , and his 18 * // head on his hands . Here , you see , is almost every age , each in its characteristic attitude , and each with its peculiar expression of attention . Perhaps the finest things are , the old man , on one side , and the mother , with the child 's head in her lap , on the other , though one hardly ventures to say . I am sorry that I did not study it with a view to describe it to you , as I could then have been particular . I was sorry to find that it is impossible to procure casts of it , or of any of its figures . It was only the day before leaving Rome that I discovered it had been engraved , and I made two vain attempts to procure it . I hope still to procure the engraving . If I had not said so much , I could tell you of some of his single figures , but enough for the present . " - pp. 303 - 305 . Mr. Ware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little better than when he left it , and naturally depressed in spirits at the prospect of continuing to be an invalid , and , what he dreaded more , a useless man . Immediately on his arrival , however , a favorable turn took place in his health , and he recovered so far as to assume the duties of his new station in the University . He had been chosen Professor of Pulpit Eloquence and the Pastoral Care at Cambridge , - in fact , this professorship was founded for him , - and the members of his old parish , who had continued to hope almost against hope that he might again appear in their pulpit , reluctantly consented to his final separation from them . Except in the grief of this parting , his new situation accorded entirely with his wishes ; he was now to instruct others in those duties which for fifteen years he had so admirably performed himself . Soon after his establishment at Cambridge , he published what proved to be the most popular and useful of all his *vorks , his little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those who are seeking a Religious Life . Through that severe illness and weary convalescence , during his long journeys and protracted residence abroad , he had not forgotten the grand object of his life , the fulfilment of his duties as a Christian teacher among men . " The book was written at distant and uncertain intervals , upon journeys and in public houses " ; it was begun at an inn in Princeton , Massachusetts , a little was composed at Florence , at Rome , at Naples , and the conclusion was added at Cambridge . Chaste and unassuming in style , avoiding all declamation or flights of eloquence , yet showing that pecu // liar earnestness of feeling and purpose which was so characteristic of the man , manifesting alike the most practical good sense and the most heartfelt piety , steering clear of all controverted topics , giving that advice only which was applicable to all Christians , and meeting wants which long and close observation had shown to be common to all , it was not surprising that the book rose at once into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprinted and circulated extensively in Great Britain , and at least fifteen thousand copies of it have been sold in this country . The writer entreats that it may he read , as it was written , " not for entertainment , but for moral edification ; his object was " to aid in the formation of Christian character , and about every other result he was indifferent . " He was rewarded for his effort in the manner most accordant with his hopes , by being permitted to witness the good effected by its publication . During the twelve years of his residence at Cambridge , Mr. Ware 's occasional publications , consisting of reviews , memoirs , sermons , and works for which he performed the duty only of an editor , were quite numerous , but we can not stop to enumenite them . The most considerable work that we have not yet noticed was a Life of the Saviour , a small volume of two or three hundred pages , published as the first of a series which was called The Sunday Library . It has all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much favor , and has passed through several editions both in England and this country . The series to which it belonged was continued for three numbers more , and then stopped , not from the want of patronage on the part of the public , but from the difficulty of finding contributors . He edited also another series of works , more popular in their character , entitled Scenes and Characters illustrating Christian Truth , which was continued with good success for six numbers , and then stopped from the same cause . Our limits will not permit us to dwell on the history of this latter portion of Mr. Ware 's life , which was richly productive of good not only to the institution with which he was connected , and to the religious denomination to which he belonged , but to the community at large , among whom the purity and excellence of his character , and the practical wisdom of his philanthropic efforts , were now generally recognized . Few persons have enjoyed so wide an influence , and // 212 Jan. none have directed their powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health was interrupted by several attacks of severe illness , and at one time by a serious affection of the eyes ; but for some long intervals it was quite good , - much better , in fact , than could have been anticipated after the apparently entire prostration of his physical powers at the period when he quitted the work of the ministry in Boston . On the members of the Divinity School and on the undergraduates in the College , in whose instruction for several years he took an active part , the effect of his teachings and his example was eminently happy ; and the memory of the intercourse they then had with him will long survive among their most precious recollections . The nature of his literary efforts is so well illustrated by an anecdote told in this volume , that we can not forbear repeating it . His wife once said to him , when he had been giving a good deal of time to the revision of sermons , and articles for periodicals , newspapers , &amp;c. , that she wished , " instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon ephemeral productions , lie would concentrate the same amount upon some single work , which would be of sub*tantial value . " He looked up with a smile and replied , " Now that is your ambition for me ; for my part , I am glad to do the little good I can in any way that presents itself ; no matter if all is forgotten to-morrow , provided a seed is sown to-day ; it will germinate some time or other . " Mr. Ware 's pulmonary complaints had entirely disappeared ; but in 1842 , a new disease , which ultimately proved fatal , first manifested itself , and he was compelled to resign his professorship , and retire into the country . The kindness of his friends made this transition easy for him , and it was hoped , that , after a year of retirement and the entire cessation of labor and anxiety , his health might be so far reestablished as to enable him either to take charge of a small country parish , or to edit a religious periodical . Amid the fluctuations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , this hope was still cherished ; but in the spring of the following year , another and more serious attack apprized him and his friends that the end was at hand . With perfect resignation and composure he prepared himself for the great change which his religious convictions and the fluctuating state of his health had kept near in view for a large portion // 213 Ware 's Life of Henry Ware , Jr . of his life . For a time , the strings of his fine intellect were jarred , and gave forth only confused and uncertain sounds . But it could hardly be said that his mind wandered ; for when his thoughts were hut little under his own control , invincible habit still turned them to the great purpose around which they had long been centred . " On one occasion , he seemed to fancy himself to be about to administer the communion . He called all his family about him , and spoke to them in words like those with which he was accustomed to address his own flock on such an occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as collected , as devout , as when , in the days of health , he had actually stood at the altar of his church . Warm and elevated expressions of gratitude to the Saviour , intermingled with affectionate addresses and counsels to his family , fell from his lips . His thoughts turned to the closing hours and acts of the Master whom he loved ; and speaking of the design of Jesus in instituting the Last Supper , as if inspired by the very spirit of his own boundless benevolence , he stretched out his feeble arms , saying , He intended it for all ; he would gather all to his embrace . ' " - pp. 450 , 451 . Periods of imperfect consciousness alternated with those in which he took considerable notice of what was passing , and the cloud was mercifully kept from darkening entirely over his spirit . On the 21st of September , the last day of his life , he recognized the members of his family , and spoke kindly and rationally to them ; but towards nightfall a severe attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without convulsion or struggle , " he passed on . " " His remains were followed to Mount Auburn , and deposited in the sepulchre which had been presented to him by his friend Professor Farrar , of which he was the first tenant . Here , just at the edge of evening , in the midst of a gentle shower , whilst the falling of a few of the leaves of the early autumn were in solemn keeping with the melancholy ceremony , was left his weary and wasted form . He had grown old and died before his prime , worn down by those exertions , both of body and mind , which had been directed for thirty years to a single great object , - an object to which he had devoted his whole spirit with a constancy which knew no repose , till he was thus laid , like his Master , in this new tomb , where man was never laid before . But of the grief , the sense of loss , which must always attend such a separation , there could in no case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a pure , an // active , a useful , and a happy one . There was as little in it for his friends to look back upon with regret , as is compatible with the necessary imperfections of the human character and condition ; whilst there was much , very much , that could be contemplated only with , - we will not say pride , - but with a sentiment of a higher and nobler sort . All the success which he wished , or was capable of enjoying , he had attained . He had striven constantly , and not in vain , in the only paths in which he desired to walk . He had enjoyed and he had suffered much . He had received multiplied favors from his fellow-men and choicest blessings from Heaven . Gratitude to God and men was among the most cherished of his feelings . He had been tried by repeated afflictions , and by wasting , protracted , and painful disease . But he had submitted in patience , and without repining . They had not dimmed the brightness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith . He had always lived in the near expectation of death , and , when at last it came , he met it with unfaltering trust . "
