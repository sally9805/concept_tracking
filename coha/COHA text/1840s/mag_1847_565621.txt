txt IT is with some diffidence , that we venture to enter upon a theme so copious , and in some respects so difficult , as that which is announced in the heading of this article . And yet the intrinsic importance of this subject to every man 's highest welfare , together with the prevalence ( as is thought ) of some obscure or false views respecting it , in many minds , at the present day , seems to commend it as a proper subject for serious and careful examination . What we chiefly propose , in the following remarks , is to call attention to this deeply interesting theme , rather than to discuss it fully . Many schemes of proposed reform are afloat at the present day , founded as we think , on erroneous or very confused opinions in ethics and theology ; and from these schemes of reform , results are confidently anticipated , by their authors and propagators , in respect to which they will , by and by , find themselves sadly disappointed . And then , as in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceded them , there will come on a reaction of doubt and despondency in the minds of their authors , unfavorable to all attempts of every sort for bettering the condition of mankind , both the sound and the practicable , as well as the unsound and the Utopian . In respect to the particular subject of consideration now before us , namely , What is the true spirit of devotion , and how may it best be upheld and kept alive in the Christian 's mind-it seems to us , that in any thing like a full and clear analysis of the case in hand , the following things are of vital importance , or at least , are worthy of very serious reflection . MAINTAINED AND KEPT 1 . We must go back a little , and settle in our minds a correct theory of moral sentiments . There is much looseness and indeterminateness of thinking on this point . Many persons set out with false theories as to the very nature of moral excellence-what it is , and wherein it does truly consist . They begin wrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is perfectly obvious to any one who observes at all what is taking place around him , that there is a wide difference , and this difference we fear is growing wider and wider in the minds of many among us , as to what constitutes right , and what constitutes wrong , in moral action ; as to what is the true and proper standard on this subject , at which men should be directing their aims and efforts ; as to what ought to be the grand ultimate object of their aspirations , hopes and endeavors . Now if this be so , as we have here stated it to be , it is certainly a matter very much to be regretted , on account of its many unhappy influences upon the cause of true evangelical virtue and sound morals . Hence , as it seems to us , it is exceedingly important that we should endeavor to form , and to get firmly established in our minds , at the very outset , a clear and correct theory of moral sentiments-that is , that our minds should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what is vice ; what is moral rectitude and what is moral obliquity ; what is sin and what is holiness in heart and life . Until these first princi* ples are settled , and settled clearly and firmly , it seems to us that men will be liable to run into many mistakes , and much confusion , as to what is the true spirit of religious // devotion , and consequently , as to what are the best means of upholding and keeping alive that spirit in the minds of men . For , it will be seen at once , that the question , what is right and what is wrong , in moral action and moral character , is a question affecting deeply , and it may be affecting vitally , the great fundamental principle in theologyto wit-what is the true moral character of the Supreme Being himself ' , and why should men adore and love and serve him . It will not be denied by any one , that it is , primarily , the moral excellence of God , which constitutes , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved , and served , by mankind , just as he in fact claims to be . In other words , it is the fact that there exists in him a boundless moral rectitude , moral purity , moral grandeur and moral loveliness , or all in one word , moral excellence ,  --  it is this fact , which lays the very foundation of his claims upon us , and which constitutes , primarily , the basis of our obligations towards him . This all are ready to concede . Now suppose , that we are not all agreed as to what true moral excellence is . Suppose that the terms , infinite rectitude , infinite purity , infinite moral grandeur , and moral loveliness , and the like expressions , convey to men 's minds , not the same ideas , but widely different ideas . Suppose that moral excellence is , in the view of one man , a very different thing from what it is in the view of another man . In other words , suppose that men differ from one another in their abstract notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Will not this very thing affect their views of the Supreme Intelligence itself ? Will it not be so necessarily , and as a matter of course ? If we are not agreed as to the very nature of moral excellence in any being , how can we be supposed to be agreed as to what constitutes consummate moral excellence in God himself ? Here , we apprehend , lies the ground of that actual discrepancy among men , which exists in their views respecting the glorious author and moral governor of the universe . They set out with inaccurate or confused notions of what is true and consummate moral excellence in the abstract , and therefore of what is true and the highest moral excellence in any being actually existing , whether created or uncreated , whether in God or man . Here , as we think , all error , or nearly all error in theology begins . Owing to the influence of a depraved and wicked heart , men 's theories , their inward secret practical views , respecting the very nature of virtue and vice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are greatly defective , loose , obscure , and often positively wrong . They see not the true beauty of holiness . They understand not , fully and clearly at least , in what true holiness consists . Into their ideal of holiness they put many things which do not belong there ; or they take away things which ought to be there , and which are essential to a correct apprehension of this subject . Hence , when they come to think of God , and to transfer their miserable theories to his character and government , and to apply those theories to the great practical *urposes and duties of life , no wonder that we should often find them , as we do in fact find them , running into a careless atheistical recklessness of God and of his favor on the one hand , or into some wild impracticable scheme , utterly Utopian and hopeless , of doing good on earth and gaining heaven at last , on the other . The day in which we live is fruitful in such schemes . And the tendency of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this respect , unless there shall be a coming back to correct first principles , in relation to the character and gov // eminent of God , and to what constitutes the nature of a true , lofty , consu inmate , moral excellence , in the abstract . To cultivate and keep alive , then , the true spirit of devotion , with all its conservative , healthful , happy influences around us and upon us , let us begin with clear and settled views of the nature of sin and of the nature of holiness , and of the wide and eternal separation between them . Let us establish , in our own minds , and get a clear and distinct view of what that lovely , beautiful , excellent thing , virtue , is on the one hand , and what that hateful , ugly , malignant thing , vice , is on the other . Let us be sure that we are right here . Let us be rooted and grounded in the truth on this point . And then , having settled our views in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these views to the character and government of God . Let us not shrink from applying them to the Supreme Being himself . 2 . This leads us to remark further , That clear , settled , scriptural views , respecting the moral character of God , are vitally important in aiding us to exercise and keep alive the true spirit of Devotion . The spirit of devotion in mankind ; the fear , the reverence , the awe , the hope , the confidence , the love , which they entertain towards their Maker , will depend , very much , on the conceptions which they form and cherish , respecting His moral perfection . If their conceptions concerning what constitutes the true moral excellence of God are wrong , or are very obscure and feeble , or are vague and indefinite , or are unsettled and fluctuating , now one thing and now another , such wrong conceptions respecting God , when entertained even by the Christian himself , will affect unhappily his piety . They will taint his devotional exercises . They will enter with him into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle gathered with him around the family altar , into all the secret exercises of his inmost heart and soul , and they will be to him like an evil genius there , hindering , deadening , perhaps for the time being wholly precluding , his spiritual and pleasant intercourse with leaven . There are conceptions of God which are destructive of true piety . Views may be taken of the moral character of the Most 1-ugh , which are deadly to the true spirit of prayer before him , and which can not be cherished without bringing the blight of spiritual death upon the soul* Nor is the danger small , that men will form erroneous conceptions of God . They are perpetually tempted to do this . Multitudes are in fact doing this . They are entertaining radically wrong views* of their Maker . They are ascribing to him a character which does not belong to him , and which he disowns . Especially is this true , as we think , at the present day . It may be said to be one feature in the general aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , in one way or another , all around us . It is seen in attempts to set forth , before the public mind , the goodness and mercy of God , at the expense of his justice and holiness . It is seen in the repugnance which many feel , to the idea of God 's exercising a discriminating moral government over his creatures . It is seen in the false sentiments which are coming into vogue , respecting all government , all authority , all effectual coercion and restraint upon men 's evil inclinations . It is seen in crude and false notions respecting the origin of law and government , and respecting the right and equity of punishments . It is seen in the weak visionary schemes and doctrines of a psuedo-philanthropy , which in various forms are now being put forth upon the world , as never before . It is seen in the wavering of the minds of many in regard to truths and principles , which were once deemed both unquestionable in themselves // and fundamental to the order and well being of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempts now making to introduce upon our shores , the disorganizing , leveling doctrines of the Fourier school in France , and to propagate here on American soil , what we can not but regard as one of the most revolting and dreadful schemes of unbridled , lawless licentiousness , that has ever been devised by the heart of man . It is seen in the wavering , the silence , the advocacy of th' wrong side , of the-public secular press , in many instances and on some questions of vital interest to mankind . Other causes , doubtless , have their share of influence in producing these and other such like results . But one fruitful cause of these things is a lax and rotten theology . Mistaken , unworthy , weak views of the moral character of God , the Supreme Ruler over all , are doing no small part of the mischief . Who does not see that the Divine Being as he is set forth in the Bible , is not the being recognized and worshiped by many of the professed reformers of the day ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure , just and holy God , seems to have passed away and to have ceased to exist , in the minds and feelings of many among us ; and in its place , some lifeless wax-work creation of a soft and sickly sentimentalism has been introduced ; a God who hates not sin ; a God who loves not holiness ; a God stripped of authority , without a law , without a throne , and who is seeking , not so much to make men virtuous , humble , teachable , weaned from earth , submissive to his will , and contented with the lot assigned them , as first of all , and chief of all , and by the force of changes in their external circumstances too , to bring about their happiness . One half of these schemes of human happiness entirely overlook the fact of man 's natural inherent propensi ty to evil . They forget the fundamental difficulty , human depravity and human wicke , dness . They set out wrong and they end wrong , and one vital error in these schemes is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiness in them , whose approbation and favor men are to secure , and whose frown and wrath they are to deprecate and flee from , as the only possible road to true and ultimate happiness . Let us see to it , then , that our views of the character of God are right views ; that they are not visionary ; that they are not weak and sickly ; that they are not such as will be likely to desert us in the time of trial , but such as will stand by and support us , when we shall most need their help . Let us look upon the moral character of God , as the actual embodiment , the living reality and substance , of that ideal excellence and perfection , of which mention was made under our last head . Irrespective of our own interests , irrespective of our own wishes , irrespective of our own hopes and fears , let us think of our adorable Maker just as he is , an infinitely pure and holy being , perfectly able to discriminate , and actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and eternally and unalterably loving the right and hating the wrong . With such views of God , firmly fixed and deeply cherished within us , what reverence , what simplicity , what sofemnity , in manner and feeling , would mark our approaches to his throne of grace ? What a sense of need should we be likely to feel , when thus approaching into his awful presence ? With such views respecting Him , how far should we be from all unseemly lightness of mind , or presumptuousness of hope and expectation , before him ? And how , in such a case , could we , contentedly , neglect to worship him , to pray to him , to praise him ? Who-what man on earth-could cast off fear and restrain prayer , if he habitually // entertained , in his own mind , right , clear , vivid views of the true moral character of God ? But it may be asked , are men really liable , in this enlightened land , and at this enlightened period of the world , to run into any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject as that which relates to the moral character of God ? We reply , they are in danger , as we have already seen . But perhaps this part of the subject may require a little farther elucidation . There are , on this subject , as there are on most other subjects , two important extremes , both of which are to be avoided . Ph is such a thing as taking too gloomy and too discouraging views of the Supreme Being . This is one extreme . And although not so dangerous , perhaps , as the other , it is still dangerous , and still to be carefully avoided . We will point it out more fully . There is a view of Moral Excellence , and consequently of the moral character of the Supreme Being Himself , which is pretty much confined to simple justice , or rectitude , or holiness , and without taking in , very clearly , if at all , the distinct ideas of benevolence , compassion , mercy . It is such a view as might have been taken of Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin and its necessary sequence , misery , had never existed , or , if sin and misery had existed , but without an atonement , and without a system of redemption . Now there is , doubtless , much that is excellent and desirable in simple justice . This we are not about to call in question . The idea of perfect moral rectitude , however severely and rigidly stern that rectitude may be , and in whomsoever it is found , we are not going to say is an unlovely , undesirable thing . On the contrary , we think rather , it is a lovely , desirable thing . And that as such , it commends itself to every unsophisticated , impartial , rightthinking observer of it . So , when it is viewed as forming the character of a moral agent , and of a moral ruler , if you please , over other beings , it presents , as we think , a view of that agent or ruler , which is not an unpleasant , undesirable view of him , but the reverse . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless , love to think of him as possessing infinite purity , infinite rectitude , infinite justice , and would look upon him as an excellent and glorious being in this view . The Scriptures would lead t is so to regard him , even in this view of his character . The seraphim , in the vision of the prophet , are represented as paying to him their spontaneous and delighted adorations , saying , " Holy , holy , holy is the Lord of Hosts , the whole earth is full of his glory . " And a similar view of him is presented to us in the 19th chapter of the Apocalypse , where the heavenly hosts are represented as worshiping him in the most exalted and rapturous strains of adoration and praise , in view of the simple display of his justice in the condiga punishment of the wicked . There is , then , in the naked attribute of justice itself , irrespective of compassion and mercy , something which , in the view of perfectly holy beings , is matter of devout and joyful recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expression of their high satisfaction . Justice , therefore , punitive justice , the simple love of right and the simple hatred of wrong , in the Supreme Being , is a part , an essential part , of his moral perfection . And it is ever to be so regarded by us . For it is indispensable to a right view and appreciation of his character . We have dwelt thus long upon this particular point , in order to avoid any possible misapprehension of our meaning . But when we have said all this respecting simple rectitude , . justice , holiness , in the Divine Being , or in // any other being , we must go still farther and say , that this is but a part , though an essential part , of true and consummate moral excellence . It is well , so far as it goes ; but it leaves the character of him in whom it is found , unfinished , incomplete , not raised to the highest point of perfection . There needs to be , commingled with this love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth from the same pure and holy heart in which it d*vells , the spirit of kindness also , the exercise of compassion , the meek , gentle , and forgiving temper of mercy , whenever the circumstances arise which call for these feelings and prepare the way for their manifestation . Else , we do all feel , that the highest perfection of virtue and true moral excellence of character is wanting in that heart . Consummate beauty of moral character , we do all feel , is only found in that mind where justice and mercy meet together in the formation of one , combined , harmoneous , impressive exhibition , both of the severe and the gentle , the sublime and the beautiful , the awful and the tender and lovely , in moral feeling and moral action . This , we regard , as the true beauty , the real excellence , the consummate perfection and glory of the Infinite Sovereign of the universe . Just and holy He is , in the highest degree ; but this is not the whole of his august and adorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of what He is . If it did , if this were a complete view of His character , that glorious character would lack much of the true lustre and brightness which now belong to it . It would shine with a diminished radiance and attractiveness . Is it true , then , ( as those who run into one extreme would seem to imagine , ) that the eye of God from eternity rested only upon that exhibition of Himself afterwards to be made , in which His holiness and hatred of sin were to be brought out to view and made known to his creatures ? and is it true , that the Divine Being from eternity , was bent , only , upon pursuing the great ends of Right and Justice , in that universe which He was afterwards to create and fill with intelligent creatures ? This doubtless was a part of the object which infinite wisdom proposed to itself ; was it the whole ? were there no other , ulterior , perhaps higher , and more glorious objects , in contemplation ? was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be done ? this , indeed , was of itself , a transcendently important object to be secured . And who that loves righteousness himself and hates iniquity , does not rejoice in this exhibition of his Maker 's character ? But surely this was not all that was needed . The clemency and mercy of God were also to be brought out to view . And one ruling purpose in the Divine Mind , even then from eternity , was a purpose of mercy ; one object , even then , from eternity , was the display of that mercy . Yes , even then , the Most High had his eye upon man , the would-be apostate , as the vessel of that mercy ; upon sin , the would-be evil that should one day desolate even the pure and blissful bowers of Eden , as the occasion for the exercise of that mercy ; and upon the " decease " of the Redeemer which was afterwards to be " accomplished at Jerusalem , " as the method in which that mercy was to be so affectingly brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is , also , another and opposite extreme touching this subject . A widely different view of the Supreme Being is sometimes taken is very apt to be taken by minds of a certain class , and by large numbers among mankind . It is , in fact , the view of the Most High upon which vast multitudes among men , especially the unrefiecting , the // reckless , the profligate , seem chiefly delighted to dwell , whenever they think of this Glorious Being at all . We refer here to the attributes of benevolence , compassion , mercy , in Him . Here , as we think , mistakes , in their practical influence of the most frightful character , are committed . And it is next to impossible to rectify these mistakes and root them out of men 's minds , they are so soothing and congenial to the feelings of those who embrace them . To this point we call the reader 's particular attention . And that we may not be misunderstood we shall dwell upon it a little . The subject is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to render needless what we are about to say in relation to it . Clemency and mercy , -  --  to be exercised in appropriate circumstances , whenever such circumstances arise ( it will be conceded on all hands , )  - -  constitute a part of moral excellence . In man , in angel , in God himself , benevolence is a desirable , lovely , excellent thing . It is what all men love to see and love to think of ; it is essential to the highest form and degree of moral excellence . Especially is this true of benevolence in the form of mercy . Mercy , wisely exercised , is the ingredient of all others , in moral character , which imparts to that character its chief and highest lovelieness . We must , therefore , ascribe mercy to our Maker . And we all readily do this . A God without benevolence in the form of mercy , to be exercised in all the appropriate circumstances for exercising mercy , would be , not the God of the Bible , not the God of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a widely different being ; and mankind , as the conscious subjects of guilt , would find it difficult , if not impossible , to offer to such a being that affectionate worship and confidence and trust , which the true God requires of his creatures . Now as a God of benevolence and mercy , the Most High must desire , also , the happiness of mankind , and the happiness of his whole intelligent system , so far as this result can be wisely and properly brought about . And we deem it proper to say , that God created man to be happy , and that He created the system of which man is a part , for the sake of the general happiness which he intended to accomplish by it . True happiness , we think it proper to affirm , was one leading end , perhaps the chief end , for which the creation was made . But the inquiry naturally arises here , how was this end to be attained ? In relation to man , how was he to be happy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , happy ? Not , surely , at all events , and as a matter of course , irrespective of man 's own character and conduct . Not , surely , as a mere passive recipient of divine favors and blessings . Not , surely , in his sins , out of Christ , and aside from the plan of redemption in the gospel and from his own agency in the matter of accepting that plan , and thus availing himself of its proffered benefits . How , then , in what way , was man to be happy , even under the mercy of God and by the mercy of God ? This , is the point that needs to be looked at . And there is just reason to fear that men will go wrong here . The mercy of God ! the boundless mercy of God ! This is a pleasant idea , and as true as it is pleasant . It furnishes a real as well as welcome , delightful refuge and solace to the heart of the lost wanderer in sin and misery . But to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perversion of it ) an unsafe refuge , a fallacious ground of reliance . Such views of God 's mercy may be entertained , often are entertained , there is reason to fear , as are deadly to men 's souls . Are you looking simply and alone to the mercy of God to save you ? Beware , lest you misapprehend the true character of God , and , the true method of salvation . This is not a // vain warning , an idle , uncalled for caution . There are not a few men who appear never to think of God but as a being all mercy . In their view of his mercy they blend no other attributes . they conceive of him only as merciful , only as good , only as benevolent , ready at all times and under all circumstances to pardon and save the guilty . Let us now , for a moment , test the cor. rectness of this view of the Supreme Being , by applying it to any other being , or to our essential notions of virtue itself ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view for us to proceed upon in the momentous concerns of men 's souls . What would you think of a man , a mere man , who was such a pattern of easy good nature , so kind , so merciful , so full of pity and compassion towards the calls of suffering humanity around him , as to be quite regard . less of the claims ofjustice and equity in his dealings , quite insensible to the distinction between right and wrong in the nature of things as a distinction of any practical value , and quite indifU*rent as to the question , whether , in his attempts to relieve present suffering around him , he might not be ( in a wider view of things ) shielding vice and countenancing wrong , and thus opposing and thwarting the highest and most substantial interests of society . Nor let it be said that such a supposition ought not to be made ; that the thing supposed is impossible , or not likely to occur . Look around you . Do you not see such cases every day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are ( in their way ) liberal arid kind , at the expense of justice ? persons of a facile , easy temper , and of a loose , reckless generosity ? You may call them good and benevolent , if you will , but it is to the entire disparagement and neglect of those sterner virtues which are so essential to the solid well being of society . And is not this , indeed , one of the tendencies of the present age ? We think it is . We think that a weak , sickly , false philanthropy is , even now , and in many forms , coming into vogue , and that in some forms and some quarters it is gaining ground rapidly . Many persons , and of both sexes , are to be met with at the present day , who make a show at least , of battling right earnestly against the disorders and sufferings , which ( it is acknowledged ) are found amon.g men ; and which ( as these persons suppose ) have their origin in a faulty , vicious organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these self-same reformers , both male and female , are quite tolerant of men 's vices ; see little or no evil in sin as committed against God ; and are so very kind and merciful , that they are ready to faint at the thought of the spectacle formerly presented by the inside of a prison or a penitentiary , and are exceeding1 y horrified at the fact , that in this enlightened and humane nineteenth century , culprits of any class and for any offences , however atrocious , cold-blooded , and revolting , should be compelled to expiate their crimes under a gallows . We hear much of the " sacredness and inviolability of human life , " and how dreadful a thing it is that courts of justice should have power , by a solemn judicial sentence , and under the forms of law grown venerable with antiquity , to deprive even the very worst of human offenders of life , as an atonement for their guilt to an injured community ; when , at the same time , those who are so nervously sensitive on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence of law , and after a full and impartial trial of the offender has been had , and his guilt has been clearly established , feel no compunction or misgiving , at the wholesale destruction of human life which takes place on a field of battle , and as the result of inspiring men with the spirit of war . Now it certainly looks suspicious , that the // .49 very men wI ) o are such sticklers for the inviolability of human life in the one case , are so entirely indifferent and satisfied , and even self-cornpla. cent , in view of the immeasurably greater sacrifice of human life in the other , especially when they have had a hand in accomplishing that destruction themselves . The evil of which we have been speaking , lies deeper than many suppose-views are taken , principles are advocated , which go to the setting aside of all punishment . The world is to be reformed and made better by mere kindness and mercy . The old fashioned ideas of justice , arid right , and wrong , and law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submission , and punishment , and the like , are coming to be thought out of date and out of place , in these days , and an undue reliance is coming to be placed , for securing the good of mankind , upon views and theories of entirely another sort ; and , to our apprehension of the matter , a great deal of vapid sentimentalism and turgid nonsensical declamation are expended , over what is called the malorganization of human society , and over the calamities and sufferings of mankind , which are supposed to result from this single source , and over the brighter epoch that will dawn upon the world when this fountain of evil shall be dried up . Something called ( how intelligibly we do not say ) a " true social order , " is henceforth to be the hope of the world . Labor and toil are by their own " attractiveness , " to lead men to be industrious and happy . And as to the present arrangeme ntof mankind into families , by express divine appointment , the " decrees of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the place of all other legislation on the subject . In other words , men are to be emancipated from the restraints of law , all law human and divine . Inclination is to govern ; and then , all will be right , and as it should be ; and thus , a new golden age will come upon the world . What folly ! Alas for the world , if this is to be its last hope . Now , seriously , in all this , what right-minded man does not see , as plain as noonday , that the very root of the evils conplained of is untouched and overlooked ; that the philanthropy which is thus grandiloquently paraded before us , is entirely misdirected ; and that all the noise and the show of something new and more promising to the world , which these reformers are now making , will end in smoke ? Man , in his apostasy from God , it must never be forgotten , is some . thing more than merely unhappy ; something more than simply an object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yielding necessarily and against his will to the force of circumstances , the helpless victim of a delusion which he can not dispel from him . Man is a guilty being , propense to evil , and voluntarily yielding to that propensity . He wanders from God and from duty , and he loves thus to wander . Witli the Bible in his hands , he knows or ought to know , where the true path of happiness lies . In all his wanderings , therefore , from the path of duty , and thus from the path of peace and happiness , into the thorny ways of sin and sorrow , he is to be looked upon with some other feelings than those of simple commiseration . Vice is a hateful thing ; a justly punishable thing ; and pity and kindness are not the only sentiments that we should feel towards it . What parett could make himself respected by his children , or could respect himself even , who should be only and always indulgent and kind to them and never punished i/tern , no matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among men , could be justly entitled to a respectful deference from the community over whom he was appointed to hold the reins of government , if in his public official character , he should overlook // the claims of justice , and should give up the reins of government into the hands of mere goodness and mercy , and shodid thus make the simple promptings of a kind good nature within him the rule and guide of his administration ? Such a character in man we should all of us look upon as weak and childish , if not even contemptil ) le . How , then , can the self same character , in the Supreme Governor over all things , be regarded with veneration and reverence ? No . We do not hcsitate to declare it as our firm conviction , that a God all goodness and mercy , such as some persons would make the Most High to be , would be wholly unworthy of the high and awful supremacy over all things which the true and living God possesses . Such a Supreme Being would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before such a being the true spirit of devotion would be impossible . But there is still another view of the moral character of God . It is the evangelical Bible view . It combines and harmonizes both of the foregoing extremes . The attribute of justice and the attribute of mercy , it blends together , into one perfect , and divinely beautiful character . It sets the Most 1-ugh before us as just , and at the same time as the justifier of him that believes in Jesus , a just God and a Savior . The purest , loftiest justice , it reconciles with boundless clemency and grace . In this view of the Divine Being , He is no longer simply just , or simply merciful , no longer merely good and benevolent , or merely holy and righteous . He is both ; both equally ; both in the highest degree ; both unalterably and forever ; as such , we are to think of Him ; as such , we are to approach him with our petitions for his favor ; as such , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this view of his character , this view and no other , which makes the true spirit of devotion so reasonable and so excellent a thing . It is this view of God , which lays a foundation , a right unalterable foundation , for the exercise of rational exalted worship before him , and which binds this duty upon us . It is a truth which all must admit , that a being of such a character is a proper object of religious worship , and that the obligation to pay him such worship grows out of the fact that such is his character . Prayer , therefore , in a true view of the character of God , is a natural dictate of our minds . Such a being should be enthroned in our souls , and habitually acknowledged and sought unto in our prayers . And the best way of getting our minds impressed with this truth is , to accustom ourselves to take right views of Jehovah 's character , to think of him as he is both just and good , and to have the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable us to do this , we have his word and his works , placed under our eye , and reflecting his glory in cloudless beauty and splendor upon us . Such a view of God , habitually cherished , will dim the luster of worldly things and help us to resist the thousand seductive influences which surround us . Such a view of God will impart to the approaching solemnities and joys of a dying hour a new and deeper interest , and will invest the revealed doctrine of a future existence after death , with a greatly augmented power over us here . Nor is this all . Such a view of the glorious Creator 's moral character will spread over the face of nature around us a new unwonted charm , and give a new and higher zest to all the safe and innocent enjoyments of this present life . It does this because it tends to cherish and uphold , among men , the right and true spirit of devotion . 3 . As needful to the same end , we mention one thing more , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a fallen , sinful , ruined // being , needing a atonement for his sins , the renovating Spirit of God to recover him from his fallen state , and the mercy of God to forgive and save him . On these points the minds of many are covered with darkness , and endless misapprehensions are entertained . These misapprehensions are all , however , of one general kind , and may be summed up in one general description . They are founded in a denial of the true doctrine of human guilt and human depravity . They proceed from mistakes in regard to the nature , the demerit , the turpitude of sin , and the consequent ruin in which the sinner is involved by his sins . It is the fashion of the times , among large classes of men , to think lightly of sin ; to call it by gentle names ; to attach to it the idea of misfortune ; to look upon its acknowledged existence as a sort of hitality ; and to appeal , in its behalf , and with the view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity and compassion . As an illustration of our meaning , and the best that now occurs to us , there are exhibited , in the systems of prison discipline which are coming into use in this country , if we mistake not , sonfe indications of a false leaity towards crime and a false tenderness towards those guilty of crime . We see it , sometimes , in courts of justice ; we see it , sometimes , in the jury box ; we see it , sometimes , in the arguments of counsel for prisoners at the bar ; we see it , sometimes , in the internal arrangements of prisons themselves designed wholly or chiefly for the comfort and reformation of the prisoner , rather than for the specific ends of punishment and the prevention of crime hereafter ; we see it in a vitiated pul ) lic sentiment , respecting the real guilt and turpitude of crime itself , as an offence against Law and Right , against Authority and Government , against the Supreme Ruler and Lawgivcr . We see it in many other forms too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We see it in *certain religious creeds , and pulpits , and schools of theology It is the vital error of those who deny the divinity of Christ and the doctrine of the atonement by his sufferings and death . It has much to do with the Universalist 's denial of endless punishments to the wicked . Claiming to be wiser than Solomon , it has crept into our systemns of family discipline and family government , and is superseding by its proposed reforms the maxims which he taught . In all these modes we see one and the same spirit at work . One fundamental error pervades them all . They begin in slight views of the evil of sinning against God . They make disobedience to established laws and govei-nment a matter of less importance than it is . Criminality , and obnoxiousness to punishment on account of it , are things too much forgotten and lost sight of Hence it is , that repentance , a true sorrow for sin , involving on the part of the sinner , both a hatred and a renunciation of his evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , that men are so little anxious as to what is to become of them hereafter . Hence it is , that the forgiving mercy of God is so little sought in prayer . And hence it is , that the plan of redemption in the Gospel of Christ is so inadequately appreciated , and so generally and unthinkingly rejected , by the great body of mankind . Certain it is , that the true spirit of prayer must spring from a true sense of men 's wants . Certain it is , that the habitual and humble and earnest spirit of supplication before God can proceed , only from a true sense of men 's gi*ilt and lost condition . The spirit of devotion , which proceeds from any other source than this , is sickly and false , and it will not long be kept up in any mind . It lacks the essential requisite to its being effective and lasting in its controT // over mankind . The influence of the world will easily overcome it . The hour of temptation , in any form , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the case of him , who has drank deep into the great Scripture doctrines of man 's guilt , and depravity , and ruin by the fall . Not so with him , who feels that his forgiveness and salvation are depending on the free mercy of God , and that that mercy can be dispensed to him only on the ground of the atonement of Christ and as the consequence of his faith in him . How this truth humbles the pride of man 's heart , and lays him in the dust before God . And yet , at the same time , what light and comfort it pours into his soul , by leading him to look away from himself to the refuge appointed for him and to the hope set before him . He will pray , if any man will . In his heart the spirit of devotion will burn , and will burn steadily and strongly , if it will burn in any heart . And the whole life of such a man will be , virtually and in principle , one unceasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation : this will be his daily , habitual , loved employment . If the foregoing things are duly considered , the inquiry before us , it is thought , will be sufficiently answercd for the purpose which we had in view in suggesting it . But we have not gone into this inquiry as a merely intellectual exercise , or with a view to resolve speculative doubts and difficulties . Our object is a higher one : it is to aid the honest inquirer after truth on a great practical question ; it is to help the humble ; sincere disciple of Christ , who having engaged in the great Christian conflict , feels his own weakness , and desires to know how and whence he may get strength to go through the conflict , and attain at last the victory . If the eye of a single individual of this description shall fall upon these pages , let him re member it is for him that we write ; we have known something of his dimculties , and we think also , ( if we are not deceived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of them . The following suggestions , designed to give to the above remarks a more practical aim and application in relation to the great ends and objects of human life , may not improperly perhaps , be appended in the conclusion of our subject . 1 . There is much occasion for cultivating the spirit of devotion , and for leading a life of prayer . He must know but little of himself , and little of the world in which he dwells , and little of the futurity before him , who does not admit the justness of this remark . Every thing , almost , within and around us , invites us , yea urges us , to the exercise of prayer and to the maintaining of constant spiritual intercourse with our Maker . How unstiitable to forget Him , how ungrateful , how unreasonable . Even our physical wants , and the supplies for them which we unceasingly need , would be , of themselves , a sufficient reason why we should accustom ourselves to resort to the throne of grace and ask for the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days of his flesh , set us the example . He instructed us to offer the petition , " Give us day by day our daily bread . " It was to be a daily asking for daily supplies , even for our very " bread , " or the means of animal subsistence and comfort . But man doth not live by bread alone . Physical wants do not comprise all our wants . We have many other wants besides , all of which , with united importunity , urge us to present our requests before God in prayer . And why should we not do this ? What good reason exists for that coldness , that reluctance , that infrequency of communion with our Maker , in which we are so apt to indulge ourselves ? When , especially , we think of our higher wants , // *s intelligent accountable creatures , how can we reconcile it to our sense of duty or of safety , to forego , as many do , all communion with God , in prayer and praise , in adoration and thanksgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What folly ! what stupidity ! 2 . In those eases in which prayer is not wholly omitted , there is sometimes an improper presumptuousness and fearlessness in the performance of this duty . The moral character of God , it must not be forgotten , cdmbines in it , as we have already seen , unspotted holiness , infinite rectitude . His justice is as real and as great as his mercy . And then also his natural perf*ctions , infinite power , infinite knowledge , and so on ,  --  what a foundation do these lay , in connection with his purity and holiness , for his being approached with the deepest reverence and filial fear and trembling . How unsuitable is that presumptuous confidence , that fearless unconcern , that want of deep seriousness and solemnity , with which some persons appear to " rush into his presence . " Let us , then , ever remember , that into the true spirit of devotion there enters , as one of its essential elements , a deep and solemn awe ; a feeling as far removed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole spirit of true devotion , and in all its varied exercises , of adoration , supplication , praise and thanksgiving , involves in it the profoundest feelings of reverence and self-abasement , on the part of* a frail , dependent , fallen , sinful creature , ( such as man is , ) when attempting to hold communion with the great and adorable Creator . " Dust and ashes taking upon itself to speak unto God . " How just and right were the patriarch 's sentiments upon this subject . But we see another spirit now at work among men . Other and different sentiments from those of the " father of the faithful , " are coming to be cherished , by many in these days . We are afraid of such sentiments . We deprecate their results as inauspicious to the best interests of society even in the present world . 3 . The views which we have presented , in this article , tend also , on the other hand , to shut out feelings of improper discouragement and faintness of heart , in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hope and all our encouragement lie . In a true apprehension of our Maker 's character , we have seen benevolence and mercy combine with justice and holiness . And in a true apprehension of moral excellence itself , we have seen the same thing . Now this view of our Maker encourages our approaches to him in prayer , it shows us , not only that we may approach him , but that we may do it cheerfully , joyfully , with glad hearts , in the exercise of a humble , but animating , delightful confidence , that we are welcome to come to Him , with all our wants , and all our fears and sorrows . In and through Christ , we can see how the mercy of God , consistently with His justice , can be made to reach us , so as to meet our wants , dispel our fears , and heal our sorrows . There is a satisfaction , made to Divine Justice , for us . The sufferings and death of the Redeemer were a substitute forour punishment , sustaining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for our being pardoned and received anew into the favor of God . And , now , penitence and faith in Christ can save us . In other words , mercy , God 's everlasting mercy , in Christ , can reach us , and not a tittle of the honor of his law , or of the perfection of his justice and holiness , be surrendered . Nay , God can be made to appear , in all His attributes , in his whole moral excellence , more glorious than before . This is the beauty of the Gospel plan of Redemption . It , sets God before us in the true and real excel . 0 // lence of His character , by reconciling together , in the most perfect manner , the different claims of justice and of mercy . Now , therefore , while we fear , we may also hope ; while we adore and tremble , we may love and confide ; while we sink into the dust , we need not be discouraged , but may rather take encouragement , and look up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very spirit of devotion , under the light which Christianity throws upon the character of God , is ( in its true nature ) a sweet , confiding , joyful spirit ; it is such preeminently ; ever humble and self renouncing , but ever sustained , soothed and encournged by an adequate , all-sufficient ground of hope towards God it is , it must be , a cheerful spirit . It has nothing of the discouragement , and pain , and dread of superstition , in it . It is not the spirit of the slave ; it is rather the little child , in the true filial spirit , approaching the Great Father above ; trembling yet trusting ; fearing yet hoping ; sorry for its offenses , but knowing that they can be forgiven ; distrusting and discarding all righteousness of its own , but resting upon the merits and mediation of Christ , and thus being prepared to breathe forth its desires before God , in the true spirit of adoption , saying unto Him , " Abba , Father* " 3 . The true spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapted to promote happiness among men . The great end of all duty , we conceive , is happiness . this , at least , is one of its ends . To this it tends . This is its legitimate result . So in religion , a true knowledge of God , accompanied with the right and proper exercises of heart towards Him , contributes to human happiness . This , at least , is its tendency . There may be other causes in operation , impeding and obstructing the taking place of this result . But the tendency of true piety in the soul of man , is evermore , and in all its fruits and exercises , to peace and happiness . It is so in families , in neighborhoods , and in larger communities . The principle is the same everywhere , wherever it is f6und . A right recognition of God and of his claims is , indeed , the grand secret of true happiness . Man 's restless , roving , aching heart finds its true rest nowhere else , but in such a recognition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good of mankind , which keeps this great fact out of view , will be found delusive . The world will never be made essentially happier than it now is , without the Gospel , and without the religion of the Gospel . Other schemes have been tried , and other schemes will yet be tried . They will end , however , all of them alike , in disappointment , if their abettors have really any confidence in them themselves , as fitted to subserve the end for which they are professedly brought forward . Our own belief is , that those who bring them forward , have , for the most part , as little confidence in them , for the end here referred to , as we have ourselves . Their real motives , and their professions , in this matter , are often two very different things . There is a hollowness and insincerity in their plans , fitted and intended to dupe the unwary . Arid their own hearts tell them , in their honest hours , that they are in their schemes of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , and misleading and ensnaring the souls of men . The true felicity of men ( they must know ) consists in the love and practice of universal virtue ; and of this universal virtue , religion ( or the worship and service of God ) forms an essential part . Prayer , then , is vital , in the very nature of things , to man 's well being ; and he is an enemy to his fellow men , who for the sake of carrying any plan of his own , would lead them into error and delusion on // this momentous subject . We call upon the young especially , to mark such men and shun them . They mean no good to you ; or if they do , their schemes will never accomplish it . 4 . Rightly understood , what a high and blessed privilege is it to live in the exercise of a true devotional spirit before God . The thought is a trite one : the princi. pIe , here brought into view , will never lose its importance . We , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthrights and privileges . We set them ata high value . We make our boast of them . And they are great and were dearly purchased . Civil and religious freedom ; a government of law ; the rights of the family ; the right to acquire and hold property , not in common stock , not subject to a Lex Agraria ; not at the mercy of a mob ; the right to possess , read and interpret our Bi. bles ; in fine , all the rights and privileges of American citizenship . If the old Roman might pride himself on his birthrights and privileges , may not we much more ? And this we are sufficiently ready to do , perhaps . But what birthright or privi. lege will compare with that which ( through the grace of God ) the Christian possesses , in the liberty given him of repairing to the mercy seat of his Maker in prayer ? This too is a privilege free for all . The poorest and the most wretched an*ong men are welcome to it . And , as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is adapted to the circumstances and wants of all . It was meant for the good of all . Who would willingly forego it , and throw away its priceless blessings ? It is the highest privilege on earth . Its exercise conduces to peace and happiness here . The praying man , amidst the temptations of life , has a guarantee of safety which no other man has a right to apply to himself ; amidst the disquietudes of lire , he has a guarantee of peace and tranquillity of mind , which no other man possesses ; amidst the trials and sorrows of life , he has a promise of sul ) port and consolation , to which no other man can lay claim ; in sickness , in old age , in the hour of dissolution itself ; he has a refuge to flee to , which is all his own . And then , in looking forward to the future after death , the praying man has prospects before him , which might well reconcile him to some infelicities and trials by the way . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watchfully maintained and cherished here on earth , an earnest of the final inheritance in heaven , after which it here breathes its desires , and for which it is here the incipient preparation . It is the upward tendency , the pluming of its wings , its first young flights , towards the broad sunny heavens , where at length , it will expatiate at large , as in its own proper sphere , beyond the clouds and storms of life . Shall we not seek , then , * to cultivate more assiduously the true spirit of devotion , and endeavor to have it always active and alive within us ?
