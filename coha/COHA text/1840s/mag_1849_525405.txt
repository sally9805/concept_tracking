txt I REMEMflER Jane Austen , the novelist , a little child ; she was very intimate with Mrs. Lefroy , and much encouraged by her . Her mother was a Miss Leigh , whose paternal grandmother was a sister of the first Duke of Chandos . Mr. Austen was of a Kentish family , of which several families have been settled in the Weald , and some are still remaining there . When I knew Jane Austen I never suspected she was an authoress , but my eyes told me that she was fair and handsome , slight and elegant , but with cheeks a little too full . The last time I saw her was at Ramsgate , in 1803 : perhaps she was then about twenty-seven years old . Even then I did not know that she was addicted to literary composition. - SIR EGERTON BRYDGES . You mention Miss Austen ; her novels are more true to nature , and have ( for my sympathies ) passages of finer feeling than any other of this age . She was a person of whom I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I regret not having seen her , nor ever had an opportunity of testifying to her the respect which I feel for her. - SOUTHEY , ( in a letter to Sir E. Brydges . ) THE brightness and beauty of the morning have induced me to go down in the garden , and there read and write . The trees are now in blossom . The peach with its delicate blush color , beautiful bell-shape , the lips turning backward and exposing the entire beauty of the flower , is mingled with the white blossom of the plum , and that of the cherry twining its lovely flowers all around the long straight branches , from end to end , not a leaf to be seen except those that come as a green crowning ornament at the tip of each bough-and , sweetest of all , there are the apple blossoms , fresh , delicate and modest ,  --  a blending of the rose and the lily . Countless bees are diving down to the very heart of the flowers , and with a perpetual and drowsy hum make pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof are cooing and bowing amourously , and finely contrast with the blue back ground of the sky . The picturesque elm trees are leafing out in broad masses of a refreshing green . Ah , friends ! methinks it were a pleasant sphere , If , like the trees , we blossomed every year ; If locks grew thick again , and rosy dyes Return 'd in cheeks , and raciness in eyes And all around us , vital to the tips , The human orchard laughed with cherry lips . Jane Austen was born on the sixteenth day of December , 1775 , at Steventon , in Hampshire , in which parish her father was rector for upwards of forty years , remaining there till he had passed three score and ten , faithfully discharging the duties of his office . The love of Christ and his Apostles twelve He taught ; hut first , he followed it himselve . CHAUCER . He then retired to Bath with his wife , Jane , and her sister , where he died in about four years . He was a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his daughter 's talents . After his death , his wife and her two children retired to Southampton , and subsequently to the village of Chawton , in the same county , where Jane wrote her novels , four of which were published anonymously in her life time , namely : " Sense and Senibility , " " Pride and Prejudice , " " Mansfield Park , " and * A fair constitution , regulnr habits , calm and happy pursuits , seemed to promise her a long life , but in May , 1817 , her health rendered it necessary that she should remove to some place where constant medical aid could be obtained . She went to Winchester , and there expired on the 24th day of July in the same year , aged forty-two . For two months before her death she suffered great pain and wean 621 // ness , natural to drooping and fading life , with unflinching patience . Her memory , judgment , temper and warm affections , were unimpaired to the last . While she could write with a pen she did so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her last words , in reply to the questions of what could be done for her , were , " I want nothing but death . " She thanked her physician for his attention , and received the sacrament before she became exceedingly weak : she was buried in the Cathedral church of Winchester . It is said that of personal attractions she possessed a considerable share , her figure was fine , her deportment quiet and graceful , her countenance expressive of cheerfulness , sensibility and benevolence . Her complexion was superb ; the blood spoke in her modest cheek through " the pearly texture of her dainty skin . " Her voice was sweet , her language fluent and precise . She was formed to enjoy and adorn elegant society . She was a good musician , and fond of dancing in which she excelled , as she did also in drawing . She was considerate as regards the frailties and foibles of others , although fully alive to them , and never uttered either a hasty , a silly , or a severe expression . Her manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a strong desire to become better acquainted with her , and to gain her friendship . Her mein was tranquil and serene . She became an author entirely from taste and inclination , when neither the hope of fame or gain min*led with her motives . It was with great difficulty her friends could persuade her to publish her first work , and she thought its failure so certain , and that its sale would not repay her publisher , that she retained a part of her small income to meet the expected loss . How great was her surprise when " Sense and Sensibility " brought her a clear profit of ? 130 . With all her great talents she was unpretending , although gratified to hear the applause that from time to time reached her ears from those whose judgment she highly valued . She shrank from the idea of attaching her name to any of her productions , althouoh amid her own a family she talked of them freely and modestly , was glad of their praise , and submissive to their criticism . The poet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are writ in sunbeams , by Fame 's loving hand ; But none record the household virtues there . In company she turned away from any mention of herself as an author . She was a warm admirer of fine landscapes , both on canvass and in nature . Gilpin , on the picturesque , fascinated her at an early age , and she seldom changed her opinion either of books or men . Her memory was excellent , and her reading extensive . Johnson and Cowper were her favorite moral authors Her natural discrimination was gratified by Richardson 's power of creating , and preserving the consistency of his characters , as he has done in Sir Charles Grandison . Her power of inventing characters was intuitive , she studied from nature . But better than all these endearing qualities and talents , she was thoroughly devout , fearful of giving offence to God or to any of his creatures . In one of her letters in reply to a mock charge of purloining from the manuscripts of a young relation , she writes : " What should I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketches , so full of life and spirit ? How could I possibly join them on to a little bit of ivory , two inches wide , on which I work with a brush so fine as to produce little effect after much The following extract is from a letter written a few weeks before her death " My attendant is encouraging and talks of making me quite well . I live chiefly on the sofa , but am allowed to walk from one room to another . I have been out once in a sedan chair , and am to repeat it , and be promoted to a wheel chair as the weather serves . On this subject I will only say further , that my dearest sister , my tender , watchful , *jidefatigable nurse , has not been made ill by her exertions . As to what I owe to her , and to the anxious affection of all my beloved family on this occasion , I can only cry over it and pray God to bless them more and more . " She concludes in this vein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wellmeaning man , without much manner ; his wife and sister all good humor and obligingness , and I hope , ( since the fashion allows it , ) with rather longer petticoats than last year . " Ah , Jane , the last sentence savors // morality be judged by the length of petticoats and skirts , or by their shortness A Swiss peasant girl is as likely to be modest as a fine lady with a long trail to her dress . Miss Austen 's novels are entirely unexceptionable , naturally and ably written . Her characters you seem to have known all your life , to have been with them and listened to their conversation in the sitting room , or by the dining table , and to have walked with them in parks , fields , and by the road side . You see into their very hearts , become acquainted with their virtues , foibles and vices . For instance , let any one take up Pride and Prejudice ; they will never forget Mr. and Mrs. Bennet , or Elizabeth , Ann , or Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pompous and empty Sir William Lucas , the foolish Collins , tedious , and with a skull of solid proof , impenetrably dull ; the haughty , vain and silly Lady Catherine de Bourgh , the good hearted but wavering Bingley , and his sister , proud , scheming and heartless , or the sensible , well-bred Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner , the sleek villain Wickham , or the proud* generous Darcy , who is at last compelled to love and wed Ann Bennet in spite of the vulgarity and offensive manners of her mother . The story of this courtship is well told . Miss Austen possessed good sense and pure religious feeling , not ostentatiously put forth , but winding like a thread of gold through all her writings , beautifying and enriching her genius . No particular moral , no dogma is inculcated in her stories . They give a true picture of life , of men and women as they really are , not as the imagination often dresses them up , and we see characters such as she describes , daily . The drawing and coloring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it seems as if any one could write novels equally good . In this respect they are deceitful enough , reminding us of the inimitable grace and flowing ease , the felicitous endowments , and the copiousness of Goldsmith , apparently easily to be imitated , but their naturalness and style have hitherto been unapproached . Doctor Johnson 's style was happily copied by all , from lottery dealers to utterers of heavy sernions from well cushioned pulpits . To interesting narrative , Miss Austen adds sound principles , and inculcates unsophisticated manners , integrity and rectitude , over the more common and artificial pretensions of society . Her discrimination , quiet humor and delineation of charter have never been surpassed . A very intelligent writer speaks of novels in the following strain , and I heartily coneur with his views . " If all literary fletion could be withdrawn and forgotten , and its renovation prohibited , the greater part of us would be dolts , and what is worse , unfeeling , ungenerous , and under the debasing dominion of the selfishness of simple reason . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novels from young people mistake the nature of the mind , thinking it only intellect , and would cultivate the understanding alone . Imagination they look upon as an ignis fatnus to be extinguished if possible-an ignis fatuus arising out of a quagmire , and leading astray to one . There is nothing good comes from the intellect alone . The inventive faculty is compound , in which the imagination does the most work ; the intellectual portion selects and decides , but collects not the materials All true sentiment , all noble , all tender feeling , comes not of the understanding , but of that mind or heart , if we so please to call it-which imagination raises , educates and perfects . Even feelings are to be made-arc much the result of education . The wildest romances will in this respect teach nothing wrong . If they create a world somewhat unlike the daily visible , they create another which is a reality to the possessor , to the romantic , from which he can extract much that is practical , though it may seem not so ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortitude . It is not true that such reading enervates the mind . I firmly believe it strengthens ir in every respect , and fits it for every action , by unchaining it from a lower and cowardly caution . Who ever read a romance that inculcated listless , shapeless idlene*s . It encourages action and endurance . We have not high natures till we learn to suffer . I have noted much the different effect troubles have upon different persons , and have seen the unromantic drop like sheep under the rot of their calamities , while the romantic have been buoyant , and mastered them . They // not bowed down to one thought , nor limited to one feelincr ; in fact , they are higher beings . The caution professes mainly to protect women ; yet , among all the young women I have been acquainted with , I should say that the novel-readers are not only the best informed , but of the best nature , and some capable of setting examples of a sublime fortitude  --  the more sublime because shewn in a secret and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed-side of the sick day and night , suffer privation , poverty , even undeserved disgrace , and shrink not from the self-imposed duty , but those very young women in whom the understanding and imagination have been equally cultivated , so as to render the feelings acute and impulsive ? and these are novel readers . Love , it is said , is the only subject all novels are constructed upon , and such reading , encourages extravagant thoughts , and gives rise to dangerous feelings . And why dangerous ? And why should not such thoughts and feelings be encouraged ? Are they not such as are requisite for wife and mother to hold , and best for the destiny of woman - best in every view-best , if her lot be a happy one , and far best if her lot be an ill one ? For the great mark of such an education is endurance  --  a power to create a high duty , and energy and patience , where both are wanted . Women never sink under any calamity but blighted affection ; and we love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they do sink then , for their heroism is in the patience that brings and that awaits death . " Poor Mrs. Bennet with her mean understanding , little information , and variable temper ! when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous . The business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news . " You take delight ( she exclaims ) in vexing me . You have no compassion on my poor nerves . Do n't keep coughing so Kitty , for heavens sake ! have a little compassion on my nerves . You tear them to pieces . ' * Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , " said her father , " she times them ill . " " I do not cough for my own * replied Kitty fretfully . Mrs. B. , speaking of Bingley 's sisters , says " they are charming women . I never saw in my life any thing more elegant than their dresses ; I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurt 's gown " here she was interrupted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very artful people indeed , sister . They are all for what they can get . I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is . It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbors who think of themselves before any body else . However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts to me , and I am very glad to hear whht you tell us of long " It is amazing to me , " said Bingley , " how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are . " " All young ladies accomplished ! My dear Charles what do you mean ? " " Yes , all of them I think . They all paint tables , cover screens , and net purses . I scarcely know any one of them who can not do all this , and lam sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finely displays the discriminating taste and judgment of Miss Austen . In describing fools she is truly Shaksperian , and in this very production she has hit off the character of Rushworth inimitably well . There is likewise a capital portrait of a Mrs. Norris , who is always dictating liberality to others , but herself mean , plotting and disingenuous , one of those well meaning people who are always doing mistaken and very disagreeable things . The Miss Bertrams are fine , showy , fashionable girls , accomplished , in the worldly sense of the word , but vain , * cold , and unfeeling , their heads somewhat cultivated , but their hearts a rank wilderness , from whence spring no wholesome fruits or lovely flowers . Lady Bertram paid not the smallest attention to the education of her daughters . She had not time for such cares . She was a woman who spent her days in sitting nicely dressed on a sofa , doing some long piece of needle work , of little use , and no beauty , thinking more of her pug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it did not put herself to inconvenience , being one of those persons who think nothing can be dangerous or difficult , or fatiguing to any body but themselves . // Dear Fanny Price is the most interesting character in this novel , and we love her from the moment she appears at Mansfield Park , a little girl of ten years old , as unhappy as possible , afraid of every body , ashamed of herself , and longing for the home she had left ; she knew not how to look up , and could scarcely speak to be heard , or without crying . Mrs. Norris had been talking to her of her wonderful good fortune , and the gratitude and good behaviour it ought to produce , and her consciousness of misery was therefore increased by the idea of its being a wicked thing for her not to be happy . In vain did Lady Bertram smile , and make her sit on the sofa with herself and pug , and vain was even the s4 , ht of a gooseberry tart towards giving her comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was taken to finish her sorrows in bed . The growth of her love for her cousin Edmund Bertram , is exquisitely narrated . On what slender grounds she feeds her gentle passion , a few kind looks , some pleasant words ; a few grateful acts suffice her the description of her scarcely conscious jealousy of Miss Crawford are in the finest style of novel writing . Miss Austen could never have written this sweet story of love without having experienced it herself , with all its rapturous enjoyments and torturing fears . Irvliss Crawford , handsome and selfish , gifted with much tact , and with no principles to interfere with the gratification of her schemes of vanity and ambition , soon secures Edmund in her strong toil of grace . " Miss Crawford 's attractions did not lessen . The harp arrived , and rather added to her beauty , wit , and good humor , for she played with the greatest obliginguess , with an expression and taste which were peculiarly becoming , and there was something clever to be said at the close of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be indulged with his favorite instrument ; one morning secured an invitation for the next , for the lady could not be unwilling to have a listener , and every thing was soon in a fair train . A young woman , pretty , lively , with a harp as elegant as herself , and both placed near a window , cut down to the ground , and opening on a little lawn , surrounded by shrubs in the rich fdia0e of summer , was enough to catch any man's heart . The season , the scene ' the air , were all favorable to tenderness and sentiment . Mrs. Grant and her tambour frame were not without their use ; it was all in harmony ; and as every thing will turn to account when love is once set a going , even the sandwich tray , and Dr. Grant doing the honors of it , were worth looking at . Without studying the business , however , or knowing what he was about , Edmund was beginning , at the end of a week of such intercourse , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit of the lady it may be added , that without his being a man of the world or an elder brother , without any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small talk , he began to be agreeable to her . She felt it to be so , though she had not foreseen , and could hardly understand it ; for he was not pleasant by any common rule ; he talked no nonsense , he paid no compliments , his opinions were unbending , his attentions tranquil and simple . There was a charm perhaps in his sincerity , his steadiness , his integrity , which Miss Crawford might be equal to feel , though not equal to discuss with herself . She did not think very much about it , however ; he pleased her for the present ; she liked to have him near her ; it was enough. ** The plot of Mansfield Park is simple enough , but it gave ample opportunity for the display of Miss Austen 's genius and purity of heart . A sensible critic observes that our fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon no artfully involved plot , upon no scenes deeply pathetic or extravagantly humorous . She paints a society which , though virtuous , intelligent , and enviable above all others , presents the fewest salient points of interest and singularity to the novelist-we mean the society of English country gentlemen . Whoever desies to know the interior life of that vast and admirable body , the rural gentry of England  --  a body which absolutely exists in no other country on earth , and to which the nation owes many of its most valuable characteristicsmust read the novels of Miss Austen . In these works the reader will find very little variety , and no picturesqueness of persons , little to inspire strong emotion , nothing to excite wonder or laughter , but he will find admirable good sense , exquisite dis // crimination , and an unrivalled power of easy and natural dialogue . Sir Walter Scott , in his Diary , March 1826 , remarks as follows : " I have amused myself occasionally very pleasantly during the last few days , by reading over Lady Morgan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passages of situation and description , and in the comic part is very rich and entertaining . I do not remember being so much pleased with it at first . There is a want of story always fatal to a book the first reading-and it is well if it gets a chance of a second . Alas , poor novel ! Also read again , and for the third time at least Miss Austen 's very finely written novel of Pride and Prejudice . That young lady had a talent for describing the involvements and feelings and characters of ordinary life , which is to me the most wonderful I ever met with . The Big Bow-Wow strain I can do myself like any now going ; but the exquisite touch which renders ordinary common-place things and characters interesting from the truth of the description , and the sentiment , is denied me . What a pity such a gifted creature died so early ! " A pity indeed . Persuasion , is considered one of the very best of Miss Austen 's six novels . It is certainly a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its conclusion are alike perfect . The characters I have not a doubt were taken from life . They are instinct with vitality , and make a lasting impression on the reader 's mind . This novel opens spiritedly with a descrintion of a foolish baronet . " Sir Walter Elliot , of Killynch-hall , in Somersetshire , was a man who , for his own amusement , never took up any book but the Baronetage ; there he found oecupation for an idle hour , and consolation in a distressed one ; there his faculties were aroused into admiration and respect , by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents ; there any unweleome sensations arising from domestic affairs , changed naturally into pity and contempt . As he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century-and there , if every other leaf were powerless , he could read his own history with an interest which never failed-this was the page at which the favorite volume always opened . Elliot of Killvnch-Hall : Walter Elliot , born March 1 , 1760 , &amp;c . Ellza beth did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years had seen her mistress of Killynch-Hall , pre siding and directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was . For thirteen years she had been doing the honors , and laying down the domestic law at home , and leading the way to the chaise and four , and walking immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing rooms and dining rooms in the country . Thirteen winters ' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighborhood afforded ; and thirteen springs shown their blossoms , as she travelled up to London with her father , for a few weeks of annual enjoyment of the great world . She had the remembrance of all this , she had the consciousness of being nine and twenty , to give her some regrets and apprehensions . She was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever ; but she felt her approach to the years of danger , and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth , but now she liked it not . Always to be presented with the date of her own birth , and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister , made the book an evil , and more than once , when her father had left it open on the table near her , had she closed it , with averted eyes , and pushed it away . " Sir Walter becomes embarrassed ; he had given Elizabeth some hints of it the last spring in town ; he had gone so far even as to say , " can we retrench ? does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench ? - a.nd Elizabeth in the first ardor of female alarm , set seriously to think what could be done , and finally proposed these two branches of economy : to cut off some unnecessary charities , and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing room ; to which expedients she afterwards added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne , as had been the usual yearly custom . These petty suggestions of economy did not stay the torrent . Killynch-Hall is finally rented to a frank , good hearted Admiral , named Crofts , a most genial personage , with a considerable sprinkling of oddities . The *ec. // walking along the streets , meets the Admiral standing by himself at a print shop window , with his hands behind him , in earnest contemplation of some print , and she might not only have passed him unseen , but was obliged to touch , as well as address him , before she could catch his notice . When he did perceive and acknowledge her , however , it was done with all his usual frankness and good humor . " Ha ! is it you ? Thank you , thank you . This is treating me like a friend . Here I am , you see , staring at a picture . I can never get by this shop without stopping . But what a thing here is , by way of a boat . Do look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queer fellows your fine painters must be , to think that any body would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that . And yet , here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their case , and looking about them at the rocks and mountains , as if they were not to be upset the next moment , which they certainly must be . I wonder where that boat was built ! ( laughing heartily . ) I would not venture over a horsepond in it . Well , ( turning away , ) now , where are you bound ? Can I go any where for you , or with you ? Can I be of any use . " Anne Elliot 's love for Captain Wentworth , and its history , form the most interesting part of * She had loved him in girlhood , but prudential reasons , and the advice of relations prevented their union . She was young , and he was poor , though full of life and ardor , and confident of success in his profession . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance ; but not with a few months ended Anne 's share of suffering from it . Her attachment and regrets had for a long time clouded every enjoyment of youth ; and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect . All his sanguine expectations and confidence had been justified . Soon after their separation he had obtained employment , he had distinguished him self , and by successive captures had made a handsome fortune . " How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been ! how eloquent , at least , were her wishes on the side of early , warm attachment , and a cheerful confidence in fu turity , against that over-anxious caution which seems to insult exertion , and distrust Providence ! She had been forced into prudence in her youth , she learned romance as she grew older  --  the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning . " They meet after seven years absence  --  the course of true love , in their case , did not run smooth . I must make one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Captain Harville , ( to Captain Wentworth . ) " Not quite , a few lines more . I shall have done in five minutes . ' * " There is no hurry on my side .

No hurry for a signal at all Well , Miss Elliot , ( lowering his voice , ) as I was saying , we shall never agree I suppose upon this point . No man and woman would , probably . But let me observe that all histories are against you , all stories , prose and verse . If I had such a memory as Benwiek , I could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side of the argument , and I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman s inconstancy . Songs and proverbs , all talk of woman 's fickleness . But perhaps you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perhaps I shall . Yes , yes , if you please , no reference to examples in books . Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story . Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree ; the pen has been in their hands . I will not allow books to prove anything . " " But how shall we prove anything ? " " We never shall . We never can expect to prove anything upon such a point . It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof . We each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex , and upon that bias build every circumstance in favor of it ihich has occurred within our own circle ; many of which circumstances , ( perhaps those very cases which strike us the most , ) may be precisely such as can not be brought forward without betraying a confidence , or in some respects saying what should not be said . " " Ah ! " cried Captain Harville , in a tone of strong feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children , and watches the boat that he has // sent them off in , as long as it is in sight , and then turns away and says , God knows whether we ever meet again .

I believe you equal to every important exertion , and to every domestic forbearance so loncr a s-if I may be allowed the expression-so long as you have an object . I mean , while the woman you love lives , and lives for you .

" There is no quarrelling with you . And when I think of Benwick , my tongue is tied . " Their attention was called towards the others . Mrs. Croft was taking leave . " Here , Frederick , you and I part company , I believe , " said she . " I am going home , and you have an engagement with your friend . To-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again , at your party , " ( turning to Anne . ) " We had your sister 's card yesterday , and I understood Frederick had a card , too , though I did not see it ; and you are disengaged , Frederick , are you not , as well as ourselves ? " Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste , and either could not or would not answer fully . Yes , " said he , " very true ; here we separate , but Harville and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harville , if you are ready , I shall be in half a minute . I know you will not be sorry to be off . I shall be at your service in half a minute . Mrs. Croft left them , and Captain Wentworth having sealed his letter with great rapidity , was indeed ready , and had even a hurried , agitated air , which showed impatience to be gone . Anne knew not how to understand it . She had the kindest " good morning , God bless you , " from Captain Harville ; but from him not a word nor a look . He had passed out of the room without a look . She had only time , however , to move closer to the table where he had been writing , when footsteps were heard returning ; the door opened ; it was himself . He begged their pardon , but he had forgotten his gloves ; and instantly crossing the room to the writing table and standing with his back towards Mrs. Musgrove , lie drew out a letter from under the scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowing entreaty fixed on her for a moment , and hastily collecting his gloves , was again out of the room , almost before Mrs. Musgrove was aware of his being in it  --  the work of an instant ! The revolution which one instant had made in Anne , was almost beyond expression . The letter , with a direction hardly legible , to Miss A. E , was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily . While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick , he had been also addressing her ! On the cbntents of that letter depended all which this world could do for her ! Any thing was possible , anything might be defied rather than suspense . Mrs. Musgrove had little arrangements of her own , at her own table : to their protection she must trust , and sinking into the chair which he had occupied , succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written , her eyes devoured the following words : " I can listen no longer in silence ..

Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman ; that his love has an earlier death . I have loved none but you . Unjust I may have been , weak and resentful I have been , but never inconstant . You alone have brought me to Bath . For you alone I think and plan . Have you not seen this ? Can you fail to have understood my wishes ? I had not waited even these ten days could I have read your feelings , as I think you must have penetrated mine . I can hardly write . I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me . You sink your voice , but I can distinguish the tones of that voice , when they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature ! You do us justice , indeed . You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men . Believe it to be most fervent , most undeviating in F. W. " It is needless to say that the parties soon understood one another after this letter . Sense and Sensibility is full of interest , with a good plot , and great diversity of character . The contrast between Elinor and Marianne Dashwood is very effective . Elinor , with an excellent heart , an affectionate disposition , and strong feelings , knew how to govern them . Marianne , sensible , but eager in everything . There was no moderation in either her sorrows or her joys . She was amiable , interesting , everything but prudent . Sir John and Lady Middleton are an interesting couple . He hunted and shot , and Lady Middleton was a mother : these were their only amusements . Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round , while Sir John 's employments were in existence only half the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child , a boy of about six years old , by which means , as Miss Austen says , there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity , for they had to inquire his name and age , admire his beauty , and ask him questions , which his mother answered for him , while he hung about her , and held down his head . On every formal visit a child ought to be of the party , by way of provision for discourse . Lady Middleton 's children must have been like those of the family where Lamb was visiting , and who was excessively annoyed by them ,  --  at the dinner table he gave for a toast , " the memory of the good King Ilerod . " The maternal complacency of Lady M. is boundless . " John is in such spirits today , " said she on his taking Miss Steele 's pocket handkerchief , and throwing it out of the window . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the second boy 's violently pinching one of the same lady 's fingers , she fondly observed , " how playful William is ! And here is my sweet little Anna-maria , and she is always so gentle and quiet . Never was there such a quiet little thing . But unfortunately , in bestowing these embraces , a pin in her ladyship 's head dress slightly scratching the child 's neck , produced from this pattern of gentleness such violent screams as could hardly be outdone by any creature professedly noisy . The mother 's consternation was excessive ; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles ; and everything was done *by all three , in so critical an emergency , which affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer . She was seated in her mother 's lap , covered with kisses , her wound bathed with lavender water by one of the Miss Steeles , who was on her knees to attend her , and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other . With such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise to cease crying . She still screamed and sobbed lustily , kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her ; and all their united soothings were incffectiial , till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress last week , some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple , the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch , and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it , gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected . She was carried out of the room , therefore , in her mother 's arms , in quest of this medicine ; and as the two boys chose // to follow , though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind , the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours . " In drawing the characters of Mrs. Jennings , and Mr. and Mrs. Palmer , Willoughby , Colonel Brandon , Edward Ferrars , the two Miss Steeles , Miss Austen has shown a surprising knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal , under the date of December , 1831 , at Malta , says , in returning from Mr. Frere 's , Sir Walter Scott spoke with praise of Miss Ferrier as a novelist , and then with still higher praise of Miss Austen ; of the latter he said , " I find myself every now and then with one of her books in my hand . There 's a finishing off in some of her scenes that is really quite above every body else . " Emma , and N Abbey , of the writings of Miss Austen only remain , on which we shall say but a word or two . From Emma we should like to make one quotation , but we refrain from so doing ; we allude to the important talk on the comparative merits of Dr. Perry and Dr. Wingfield , and one of the strangely jumbled together conversations of Miss Bates , but not having the heart of Dogberry , who if he had possessed the tediousness of a king , was willing to inflict it on every one , we hasten on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to take his sister out riding because she had thick ankles , and who had a horse that could not go less than ten miles an hour ; even with his legs tied he would get on : and Catharine Morland , who , after reading Ann Hadcliff 's romances , and visiting Northanger Abbey , fancies every old chest and cabinet contains some interesting memorial of the past ; and the first night she passes in the abbey brings fear and trepidation with it . What a cheap and delig , htful pleasure reading is . These novels of Jane Austen I have read thrice , each time with renewed pleasure . They are always charming . I take them up in happy moments , and they cheer me in unhappy ones ,  --  for sorrow comes to all . Even in solitude they introduce you to the most agreeable company , for all Jane Austen 's characters are either old friends , or persons that you are confident are living somewhere on the earth ,  - -  you listen to their conversation-you know the tones of their voices . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much Miss Austen has added to our round of harmless amusements . How much instruction is stamped on her pages . How clearly are displayed the viciousness of ill temper , procrastination , coquetry , affection , jealousy , meanness , and the many minor faults that embitter life . Every good novel is full of instruction . No one ever employed their genius to a better purpose than our fair authoress . Thou thy worldly task has done , Home art gone , and ta'en thy wages . And as Waller writes , All that we know they do above Is , that they*sing , and that they love . And surely no one was better fitted for such a sphere than Jane Austen . I commenced the reading of these volumes last summer , when the trees were covered with blossoms , and the air was mild and balmy . During the last few days the rain has fallen incessantly , the winds are roaring and sobbing above the chimney , and rattling against the doors and windows . The walks are strewn with yellow leaves , torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also thick with them . Within , the fire-place has been bright with the flames of a crackling woodfire , aadtwohappyhearts , worthyto be happy , have filled the room with sunshine . I unconsciously nestle near the cheering flame-as the storm drives against the house in angry gusts . Such is the season in which to read an entertaining novel or romance . When heavy , dark , continued a ' day rains Wi ' deepening deluges o'erflow the plains . Bunus . The storm has passed over . The glittering sunshine almost turns the dead leaves into things of beauty . My favorite nasturtiums , beautiful and hardy , again twinkle forth joyously . I have ascended the neighboring hills  --  the view is lovely-the air clear , sparkling and bracing . Some cattle " with meek mouths ruminant , ** are quietly standing in the sunshine , others eagerly crop the short rich grass . In a neighboring field a boy is driving oxen before a plough-his voice , and the cawing // of some crows are the only sounds that now break the utter stillness . Hark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail road . The reverberations echo like the booming of heavy artillery . Sloops are passing up and down the Hudson , and distant objects in the transparent atmosphere seem close at hand . " The golden orb of the sun is sunk behind the hills , the colors fade away from the western sky , and the shades of evening fall fast around me . Deeper and deeper they stretch over the plain ; I look at the grass , it is no longer green ; the flowers are no more tinted with various hues ; the houses , the trees , the cattle , are all lost in the distance . The dark curtain of night is let down over the works of God ; they are blotted out from view , as if they were no lon , , er there . " After my return from my walk , in turning over the leaves of some favorite poets , I met with the following passages that exactly harmonize with the present tone of my feelings . Reader , I know you will enjoy their genial and philosophical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rob 'd , And liberal handed brings no gloom to us , But rich in its own self , gives us rich hope Of winter times ; and when the winter comes , We burn old wood , and read old books that wall Our biggest room , and take our heartiest walks On the good , hard , glad ground ; or when it rains And the rich dells are mire , make much and long Of a small bin we have of good old wine ; And talk of , perhaps entertain some friend . Let Winter come ! let polar spirits sweep The darkening world , and tempest-troubled deep ! Though boundless snows the wither 'd heath deform , And the dim sun scarce wanders through the storm , Yet shall the smile of social love repay With mental light , the melancholy day . And , when its short and sullen noon is o'er , The ice-chain 'd waters slumbering on the shore , How bright the faggots in his little hall Blaze on the hearth , and warm the pictur 'd wall .
