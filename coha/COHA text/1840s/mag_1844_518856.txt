txt Different classes of our readers will be displeased with different parts of it . We , who are not thinskinned , have been vexed deeply by some expressions , and the more from the general fairness of the writer . Yet we should be sorry to lose the opportunity of reading what is thought and said of us by any respectable part of society abroad . So much by way of apology to those who may be disposed to find fault with us for copying what may displease them . We must show to our readers the Living Age . The United States of America ; their History from the Earliest Period ; their Industry , Commerce , Banking Transactions , and National Works ; their Institutions and Character , Political , Social , and Literary ; with a Survey of the territory , and Remarks upon the Prospects and Plans of Emigrants .

The means of judging of a nation fully and fairly are not often possessed by foreigners . A feeling of rivalry and jealousy frequently exists between the inhabitants of different countries , which leads them to lean to the side of depreciating and disparaging their neighbors . Even differences in matters so insignificant , comparatively , as the manners and customs which regulate the daily intercourse of social and domestic life , are apt to excite prejudice , and to produce unfavorable impressions in regard to matters much more important , when a candid and impartial consideration of these differences might convince men that many of the habits and customs of other nations were neither les* rational in themselves , nor perhaps less fitted to promote general comfort and convenience , than their own , and were unpleasant and annoying to them , merely because different from those to which they had been accustomed . The United States of North America have perhaps shared more largely than any other country in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the opinions cherished and expressed with regard to them . The history and institutions of that country are in some respects of a kind fitted to excite not very unnatural prejudice among the nations of the old world , and especially in Great Britain ; and there are still many things in the condition and circumstances of the United States , though we are disposed to regard them chiefly as adventitious and temporary , which afford plausible grounds for an 3*7 unfavorable judgment to those who are predisposed to regard tfr'em with prejudice . We are not sure that either in Great Britain or in the United States have the feelings engendered by the war which terminated in A.merican independence , been altogether obliterated . There are even yet some men in Great Britain who are disposed to look upon the United States merely as revolted col6nies , which ought still to form a part of the British empire ; and the revival of the doctrines of passive obedience and non-resistance-of " the right divine of kings to govern wrong , " by the high churchmen of our day-men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the advantages which have resulted from it , and who openly condemn the Revolution of 1688 as a " national sin , " - is not likely to favor the eradication of this view , and of the feelings which it is fitted to produce . And many Americans , on the other hand , are still too much disposed to remember that Great Britain once oppressed them , and tyrannized over them , and to allow the recollection of former injuries to tinge the feelings with which they still regard her ; and this state of mind and feeling is fostered by the practice still kept up in the United States , of reading publicly , on the 4th of July , the Declaration of Independence , which contains a minute and detailed enumeration of all the hardships inflicted upon the colonies by the mother-country . This custom can now have no other effect than to keep alive uncharitable and angry feelings , and would surely be " more honored in the breach than the observance . " The rel ) ublican government of the United States has tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions of that country . If there exist in America a strong tendency to ascribe the ignorance and misery which are to be found in European countries , to hereditary monarchy and a hereditary legislature , there is at least an equally strong tendency in this country , to ascribe the ignorance and misery which exist in the United States , to their republican form of government , and to exaggerate the extent to which these evils prevail , in order to derive from the state of matters in that country , an argument against democracy . And there is one peculiar circumstance connected with this matter , which has tended greatly to strengthen the prejudice existing in this country against the United States-we mean the notion impressed upon the minds of many worthy persons by the history of the first French revolution , and not yet wholly obliterated , of there being sonic intrinsic connexion between democracy and infidelity . It was nut very unnatural that the features which the French revolution presented , should produce an impression of this sort ; but still every enlightened arid intelligent man must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no scriptural grounds on which it *n be established that monarchy is in itself more THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . // agreeable to the will of God than republicanism ; and it can not be shown that the views which usually lead men to approve of a republican form of government , have any natural tendency to make them infidels , or infidel views to make them republicans . The connexion between republicanism and infidelity , at the era of the French revolution , was the result of circumstances , and not of any natural and inherent tendency in the things themselves . Some of the most eminent English infidels have been the defenders of absolute monarchy ; not a few of those who have been most eminently honored in promoting the cause of religion , such as Calvin and others of the reformers , were decidedly opposed to monarchical principles ; and we have now , in the United States , a body of ministers , many of whom are possessed of superior talents and learning , as well as undoubted piety , and have been highly honored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly maintain , that , upon grounds at once of reason and Scripture , a republic is greatly preferable to a monarchy or an aristocracy . These facts afford no reason why we should change our views upon the subject of government ; but they are sorely sufficient to expose the folly of the prejudice which many British Christians entertain against the United States , as if their republican institutions either sprung from , or tended to , infidelity . The Declaration of Independence was , indeed , drawn up by Jefferson , who was an infidel , though he did not venture very openly to avow his infidelity during his lifetime ; but Dr. Witherspoon was its most able and zealous defender , on the memorable occasion when the Congress adopted it. * Some one or more of these various prejudices to which we have referred , have influenced most of the British travellers who have visited the United States.t A considerable number of those who have published an account of their travels in that country , have been mere passing visiters , who saw only the surface of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mistaken ; while not a few of them have been more anxious to make an amusing * There can be no doubt that French infidelity , i. e. , infidelity produced by the writers , and sanctioned by the conduct of France , did much mischief in the United States ; but there were always many eminent men in that country , who strenuously opposed French principles and French influence , and deprecated any close connexion with Revolutionary France , from its tendency to injure the interests of reli0ion . Among these , Dr. Dwight , who so long and so ably presided over Yale College , was conspicuous . He was accustomed , on ( lays of public fasting and thanksgiving-for these have always been , and still are , observed in the United States  --  to declaim against Revolutionary France , and all connexion with her . in a style which would have been perfectly satisfactory to the most zealous clerical worshippers of Pitt and Duisdas .

And , in this country , we are very apt , when we hear of anything ridictilous or offensive as existing or occurring in the United States , to put it down as applicable to , and characteristic of , the whole nation , when probably it may attach only to a few individuals , or to some limited district of that vast regions Many people in this country have heard of some of the follies and extravagances which have been propounded and practised in the United States , on the subject of temperance-of some men asserting the direct and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquor-of some congregations excluding from communion all who were concerned in the manufacture and sale of ardent spirits , and even all who used them , and of some even going so far as to abandon the use of wine , and to substitute something else , in the celebration of the Lord 's supper ; and , hearing of these things , and knowing little else about the state of matters , they have beets ready to regard them as attaching to the temperance movement in general , and to the great body of its supporters , whereas they attach only to a very few indivitluals , and are repudiated by the great body of the friends of the temperance reformation  --  a work , the success of which is an honor to the United States , as it has conferred incalculable benefits upon the community . The great body of the ministry in the United States have renounced the use of intoxicating liquors altogether , and are quite able to adduce proof that their temporal atid spiritual welfare , and their ministerial usefulness , have been greatly promoted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extravagances above referred to . About twelve or fourteen years ago , we heard a great deal of the abuses and extravagances connected with American revivals of religion , and many of us believed , that , what seemed to be just artificial contrivances for producing a present and temporary excitement , had the general sanction and countenance of the American churches ; whereas these abuses were but local and partial , and , under the name of new measures , by which they were usually designated , were condemned and exposed by the great body of the evangelical churches , and have now , in a great measure , disappeared . We have heard of late a great deal of repudiation , and many , no dotsbt , in this country , have been led to attach the discredit of this dishonesty to the inhabitants of the United States generally ; whereas only one of the States , Mississippi , has denied its obligation to pay its debts ; and the conduct of this State , as well as that of Pennsylvania , ( which , without denying its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make provision for the interest of its debt* , though it has done so now , ) met with the strongest disapprobation in the community at large . You meet with no person in respectable society . 388 // opinion in America , that is not cordial and decided in condemning repudiation. * There prevails commonly in this country much ignorance of the United States . The Americans are , in general , better acquainted with us , our institutions , literature , history , and geography , than we are with them . We sometimes do them injustice from our ignorance of the extent of their territory , the nature of their internal government , and the origin and circumstances of the population . When Mr. Webster , the celebrated American lawyer and statesman , was in this country in 1889 , he paid a visit to an Episcopal dignitary in the north of England . The bishop expressed his feelings with some warmth against the neglect of the American government in respect to preventing the outbreaks continually occurring on the frontiers , and said it was their imperious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch over them and restrain them . And how long does your lordship think this cordon must be , to cover the boundary line between the British colonies and the United States said Mr. Webster . The bishop said that he had not particularly examined that point , but that surely the distance could not be very great . I will tell you then , said Mr. Webster , the distance is as great as from this to Constantinople , and back again to Vienna . We do not usually take sufficiently into account the loading peculiarity of their government , viz. , the entire independence of each of the twenty-six States which form the Union , in all matters of internal regulation , and the want of any central power , like the British Parliament , which has absolute control over all ; and in this way we are apt to make the nation in general responsible for many things over which neither the general government nor the general congress have any control whatever , but with respect to which each state is sovereign and independent* The trial of M'Leod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the British government had formally assumed the responsibility of the act  --  a proceeding which had very nearly involved the two countries in a var-was carried through by the governor of New York under popular info- * A respectable newspaper in New York , published in July last gave some statistical tables , showing the great want of schools and the low state of education in the State of Mississippi . The general results were , that , of the whole population of the state above twenty years of age , amounting , exeludin , slaves , to 74,000 , there were above 8000 , or 1 in 9 , who could neither read nor write . and that , of the population under twenty , only about oneeighth part were attending schools . We subjoin the concluding reflections of the editor of the newspaper , as indicating the general sentinient of die great body of the people and the press of the United States , on the subject of repudiation : - " Will any one longer marvel that Mississi ppi is a repudiatin* state ? Can any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation , than this of keeping people in such wretched ignorance , when they may just as well he educated and intelligent ? Why , compareml with these repudiators , the Choctaws and Cherokees , whom we have learned to call savage , are enlightened nations . " 389 ence , and in the exercise of state rights , while the general goverumetit did all that was constitutionally competent to them to prevent it . This , however , was an anomaly too gross and too dangerous to be continued ; and , acco*lingly , the next Congress , notwithstanding the q.xtreme jealousy which prevails in America on the subject of state rights , wisely and honorably passed what is called the Remedial Justice Act , the object of which was to bring all such questions , involving international relations , under the federal jurisdiction , and into the cotirts of the United States , so that it should not be in the power of the authorities of any single state to involve the nation in war . Still there are many things for which only the particular state , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and any interference with which , either by the supreme executive , or by the national congress , would be a violation of the constitution , arid would lead to the dissolution of the Union ; and this consideration we are too apt to overlook or forget in the sweeping censures we sometimes pronounce on the great North American Republic . The United States have had very great disadvantages to contend with in regard to the character and circumstances of their population , and for these we are not always disposed to make sufficient allowance . They were sprung indeed from most noble stocks , the English Puritans , the Scotch and Irish Presbyterians , arid the French Huguenots . A nobler ancestry than this the world could not have furnished , and to their descent from these men , and to the principles derived from them , do the inhabitants of the United States owe almost everything that has hitherto contributed to their prosperity and their virtue , to their greatness and their happiness . But the character of a large portion of those who have emigrated to the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from that of the original settlers . Instead of being the elite , they have been commonly the refuse and offscourings of the nations of Europe . Instead of being men , who , like most of the original settlers , were animated by the fear of God , and were determined to enjoy the blessings of civil and religious liberty , which in Europe were denied to them , they have most commonly been needy adventurers , and men who fled from justice , without character , without resources , without any wholesome influence to restrain and regulate them . The character of these emigrants has exerted an injuriotis influence upon the population of the United States , and has tended materially to strengthen the power of evil , and to obstruct the influence of the exertions made to promote the cause of religion and moral . ity . In several parts of Scotland , the religious and moral character of the inhabitants has been grievously injured by the influx of Irish Roman Catholics , and the same cause has operated extensively in the United States . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70,000 persons emigrate every year from Europe to that country , and that about 50,000 of these are Roman Catholics , chiefly from Ireland and Germany ; and the influx of such a body tends greatly not merely to increase the relative strength of the Church of Rome , but to degrade the general morality of the community . The singularly rapid growth of the population of the United States , and its diffusion over such a vast extent of territory , tend also , in no inconsiderable measure , to increase the difficulty of providing an adequate supply of the means of education and religious instruction for the inhabitants , and to obstruct the efficiency and success of the efforts made for accomplishing these objects . The differences in the origin , habits , and circumstances of different portions of the inhabitants , scattered over a territory about half as large as Europe , much of it but recently settled , and having still many of the disadvantages and deficiencies of a new country , render it impracticable to give , with anything like precision and fairness , general descriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . There are about as great differences , in many important respects , between the inhabitants of different states of the Union , as between those of the different kingdoms of Europe . Their free political institutions , no doubt , exert a certain influence upon their character , habits , and condition , and of course tend to produce a certain degree of uniformity ; but political government is far from being the only element which contributes to the formation of national character ; and the influence of their political institutions , besides that it has not yet operated for more than two or three generations , has been counteracted in all its beneficial tendencies by the existence of slavery in some of the states , and in all of them has been much modified by the operation of other causes . It is , therefore , almost as absurd to talk of the American character , even when the word is limited in its application to the United States , as of the European character ; and yet we often do the Americans the injustice of ascribing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practices which are to be found only in particular districts , and originate in local and temporary causes , for which the Americans are not , in every instance , exclusively responsible . Indeed , there is probably no portion of the existing population of the United States who are more reckless and unprincipled , whose character and conduct are more fitted to bring discredit upon any community connected with them , than the thousands and tens of thousands of Irish Roman Catholics , whose character was formed while they were our fello*vsubjects , living under the British constitution . One specimen of the place which the Irish Roman Catholics hold in the United States , and of the way in which their influence operates , is to be found in the fact , that a few months ago it was ascertained , that out of one hundred and eighty prisoners confined in the jail at Boston , more than one half were natives of Ireland , while there was only one Scotchman among them . And the British traveller in the United States , will often meet with facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the British government has such a body of subjects as the Irish Roman Catholics commonly are , and make him less disposed to press upon the American government and the natio*r in general , the responsibility of all the im*nnrality and degradation that may be found in that country . Another consideration that ought to be kept in view in judg.ing of the United States , and the neglect of which leads us to treat them with some measure of injustice , is , that the evil which exists there comes out more palpably *mnd more offensively than with us , and the*efore appears to be greater in comparison than is really is . There is much more freedom of opinion and of action in the United States than in Great Britain . Men are there less influenced by mere routine , or a merely coaventional system of acting , by the habit of continuing to live just as they have been accustomed to do , and as those around them are doing . In this country , men are , to a large extent , ground down or raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances in which they are placed , and the influences which are in operation around them , irrespective of their own personal principles and tendencies , whereas , in the United States , the actual personal character and principles of the individual usually come out more plainly and more palpably , and are less modified and restrained by routine habits and collateral circumstances . The evil that is in the hearts of all unrenewed men , usually conies out more palpably in America than in this country , arid this produces more frequent and public exhibitions of what is offensive . An irreligious man-one who is destitute of personal religious principle-is practically arid at heart an infidel ; and if he is not openly professing infidelity , and living in the violation of some of the laws of morality , this is owing to the restraining influence of external circumstances . This indirect restraining influence is not , we think , so powerful in America as in Great Britain , and therefore a larger proportion , probably , of irreligious men make a profession of infidelity , and throw off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The general standard of outward morality among irreligious men is probably lower than with us , except perhaps among our highest and lowest classes ; and as in America , as well as in this country , truly religions men form but a small minority in the community , there thus meets the eye and the ear , in general society , more that is unpleasant and offensive . The greater separation , too , between the church and the world which obtains in America , although right in itself , fitted to promote the interests of religion , and thus ultimately and permanently to benefit society , has a certain tendency for the time to lower the general standard of outward conduct among the mass of men . The places of worship over a considerable portion of the United States , containing the great bulk of their population , are at least as numerous as in this country . It appears that , generally speaking , they are as large and as well filled as in Great Britain , and yet the proportion of corumunicants is considerably less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who occupy the New England States , that part of the country which has been . longest settled and is most fully filled up , have , by the latest returns , 1150 ministers and 160,000 communicants , giving an average of nearly 140 communicants to each minister . The two great Presbyterian bodies , old school and new school , who are dispersed over the whole country except the Ne*v England States , have between them 3036 ministers and 280,000 communicants , giving an average of about 92 to each . And the other evangelical churches exhibit a similar proportion ; the smaller bodies , who are not dispersed over the country at large , but confined in a great measure to some 390 // particular district in the more populous states , approximating commonly to the Congregational rather than the Presbyterian average . This comparatively small number of communicants is an indication of the greater separation between the world and the professing church than usually obtains in this country . It implies the existence of a higher standard of character on the part of communicants generally , *but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower standard on the part of those who are not members of the church ; and as these of course form a large majority of the community , and constitute the class with whom most travellers come chiefly into contact , an unfavorable impression is commonly received of the general standard of morality as compared with that which obtains among the middle classes in Great Britain . There are many things in the United States which , from the greater freedom of opinion and action , assume an aspect that is offensive to us , when , in point of fact , things the same in substance , though less fully and palpably developed , exist to as great , or perhaps a greatcr extent among ourselves . The Unitarianism that prevails in Boston and in the state of Massachusetts , of which Boston is the capital , has been often held up as a proof of the decay and corruption of religion in that country . But , independently of the facts that it is almost entirely confined to one state , and is very decidedly on the decrease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Massachusetts is neither more nor less in substance than just the religion which prevailed so extensively in the Continental Churches1 and in the Established Churches of England and Scotland during the latter half of last century . On the Continent it was called Rationalism , in the Church of England Orthodoxy , and in the Church of Scotland Moderatism ; but in all it was just substantially Pelagian Unitarianism , that is , the natural religion of irreligious men , who had no sound views and no deep and sincere impressions of the doctrines of the gospel , but who did not find it convenient to throw off altogether a profession of Christianity . The extent to which these different parties went in developing their views , and especially in formally denying the doctrines generally maintained by the churches of Christ , was regulated much more by their circumstances than by their convictions , and these circumstances favored a more open profession of error on the Continent and in the United States than in this country ; while , practically and substantially , the general preaching and conduct of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were as little influenced by scriptural views of divine truth , and did about as much injury to the cause of religion , as those of the Unitarians of Massachusetts ; and we are not by any means sure that greater injury would have accrued to the cause of religion , if , in our own country as well as in America , these men had been led to make an open profession of Socinianism . A confirmation of the idea , that the Unitarianism of Massachusetts was just the particular form which a certain state of mind and feeling happened from circumstances to assume , while the same state of mind and feeling , under a somewhat less offensive form , prevailed at least as extensively in the Established Churches of this country , is to be found in the fact , that in the neighboring State of Connecticut , the same state of religion , or rather of irreligion , which in Mas a91 sachusetts led to a pretty general profession of Unitarianisr* , was quite satisfied with the preaching and conduct of the Episcopalian ministers who were found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied with Scotch moderatism , and that in consequence profe*ed Unitamianism has never made any progress in*.Connecticut . Many other illustrations might be given to show , that things in America , which may seem offensive to us , and produce an unfavorable impression , exist to an equal if not great&amp;r degree among ourselves , though perhaps not so fully and palpably developed . But perhaps it may be said , that this greater disregard of routine habits , hereditary practices , and conventional arrangements , producing , along with other influences that have been referred to , a somewhat fuller development of evil , and a somewhat lower standard of conduct , among those who are not under the influence of personal principle , is both the cause and the effect of a lower state of religion and morality . Now we are certainly not disposed to undervalue the important advantages which in this country we possess in the extensive and salurary influence which , in the great body of the middle classes , established habits and public opinion exert upnn the ordinary conduet of very many who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly so called . But still , let this influence , wholesonie and useful as it is , be estimated at its proper value . Let it not be taken as a substitute for true moral and religious principle , or as a proof of its general prevalence . And , on the other hand , let not the comparative absence or weakness of it in the United States , and the effects which flow from this , be regarded as proofs of the want of moral and religious principle , which we believe to be about as strong and as general in that country as in this , although , from the causes to which we have referred , its indirect operation upon the conduct of the great mass who are not living under its direct and personal influence , is not so widely diffused as in the land where our lot has been cast . We have made these observations to confirm and illustrate the general position , that the notions prevalent in this country about many things connected with the character and condition of the inhabitants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to matters where an unfavorable impression may have some foundation to rest upon , we do not usually make a reasonable allowance for the peculiarities of their situation , and the disadvantageous circumstances in which in some respects they have been placed . We are persuaded that intelligent and impartial travellers in the United States , who have had adequate opportunities of judging , will concur in the general substance of these observations ; and we think them of some importance in guarding against the erroneous impressions which the statements of travellers of a different description are fitted to produce . In proceeding to make a few miscellaneous observations upon the state of matters in America , we do not mean to dwell upon the peculiar political institutions of that country , and the effects of these institutions upon the character and ci ) nditiom of its inhabitants , because a discussion of this subject would require a much more full and lengthened investigation of the existing condition of things , with its remote and proximate causes , than we have had an opportunity of making , and because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , has tended to confirm our faith in the general truth and soundness of the speculations of De Tocqueville , in his very able work upon Democracy in America , both with respect to the advantagas they have derived from their political institutions , and the dangers from that source against which they are called upon to guard . De Tocqueville is a man of much greater talent and fairness , and gave much more time and attention to the investigation of this subject , than any British writer who has yet appeared , and his views are therefore much more deserving of serious consideration by all who wish to understand the political institutions of the United States , and their bearing upon the character and condition of the people . It can scarcely be disputed that the United States derive some important advantages from their republican institutions , which are not usually realized under a monarchical government , though there is certainly good ground for believing that these are fully compensated by corresponding disadvantages . There are not a few persons in the United States who , republican as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country the democratic principle has been carried too far , and who would not regret to see either some limitation on the right of suffrage , or else some interposition of other stages and barriers than at present exist between the mere voice of the people and the ultimate determination of national laws and national measures . As the friends of a limited hereditary monarchy , we concur in this opinion , and think that there is not a little about the state of matters in America that sanctions it . Still , there is much also about that country which is fitted to lead us to entertain a higher opinion than is usually held by the subjects of monarchs , of the capacity of a people for governing themselves , and to confirm the doctrine , which forms the basis and the substance of all liberal views in political matters , viz. , that in order to secure the great ends of government , it is indispensable that the people , whose welfare it should be the chief object to promote , should have themselves a very decided and efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we consider the extent to which the republican principle is carried in the constitntioa of the United States , when we recollect that there almost every man has an equal vote in the regulation of national affairs , we are more disposed to wonder that the counti*y should be so well governed as it is , that the laws should be so good , and upon the whole so well executed , than that there should be some things which we disapprove of , and which a less copious infusion of the democratic element might have prevented . We think it highly creditable to the intelligence and character of the people of the United States , that upon the whole they should govern themselves so well and we do not believe that there is another country in the world that could stand universal suffrage , that is , that there is no country where the same amount of political power could be lodged in the mass of the people , without leading to much more injurious and disastrous results . Those who may desire some limitation of the suffrage , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are of course fully aware that any change of this sort is impracticable , and place their chief reliance for the prosperity of their institutions and the welfare of their country , upon the diffusion of education and the influence of religious principle . Notwithstanding the inlidelity and recklessness occasionally exhibited , a respect for religion exercises a very considerable influence over the American community , arising both from the religious prinq*ples professed and acted upon by their forefathejs , and from the extent to which true religion continues to prevail among them . And this respect for religion exerts a wholesome influence even over their political arrangements . A curious and interesting indication of the existence of this feeling was given at Baltimore in the month of May last , by the delegates of the two great political parties for nominating their respective candidates for the presidency and vice-presidency , at the approaching election in November . They were political conventions , for a merely political purpose , of delegates from all the states of the Union , and yet in both of them a clergyman was asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scriptures , a practice for which in similar circumstances nothing like a precedent could now be found in Great Britain . In April last , when the salaries of the naval arid military chaplains were voted in the house of representatives , a member opposed the grant in an infidel speeeh. , but three or four members not only expressed their abhorrence of the infidelity , but answered the infidel cavils in a very judicious and intelligent way . No member of the British house of commons would venture to make an openly infidel speech , though many speeches are made there which would probably do less harm to religion if their authors had the courage to avow the infidelity that is in their hearts ; but then , on the other hand , we doubt much whether , if an infidel speech were made in the house of commons , it would have been so boldly exposed and so intelligently answered on the spur of the moment , as the one in question was in the American house of representatives . The generality of the newspapers in this country would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " specimen of republican Amnerica , " and omit the answers to it . It is of course felt in the United States to be indispensable that the people should , as far as possible , have the means of fitting them in some measure for the important duties which devolve upon them in the election of their rulers and legislators ; in other words , that they should be able to read , arid have opportunities of reading fully , on all matters connected with the regulation of their national affairs . Very great and laudable efforts , accordingly , have been made for promoting the general education of the community . This is effected by a general assessment upon the inhabitants . In many of the states these assessments for educational purposes are large , and the provision is consequently ample . Indeed , education is almost the only object for which the people seem to be willing to tax themselves. * It is generally admitted there , that an obligation lies upon the community to make provision for affording to the young the means of education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We believe it is now established that , excluding those states * The annual assessment for the support of th&amp;public schools in the slate of Massachusetts , amounts to a doltar a head for every individual in the population , while at ) out half as much more is annually paid to academies and private schools . An assessment at the rate of a dollar a head for the whole population would produce , in Scotland , considerably more than ? 500000 , and in England above ? 3*eco,0O0 , annually . 392 // which are still subject to the withering hlight of slavery , a much larger proportion of the people are able to read , and are at present attending schools in the United States , than in any other country in the world . All due pains have been taken to make the general system of education vigorous and effective . Iitelligent and judicious men have been repeatedly sent to Europe to examine into the scholastic system of its different countries , who , on their return to America , have usually published reports of what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night derive some useful su*estions. * In the public schools of the United States , education is provided for the community gratuitously , the erection of the buildings , the salaries of the teachers , and the whole of the materials and apparatus necessary for conveying instruction , being provided fur out of the general assessment . We are inclined to think , that upon the whole , this is a wise and judicious principle . Although some advantages may result from charging a fee from the pupils , yet it is scarcely possible to carry out the system of exacting fees in any scheme that professes to provide for the community in general . There must be very many parents in every com * The principal works of this class which have been published in the United States , are the Report of Dr. * che , President of the Girard College , Philadelphia , on the charitable foundations for instruction in Europe ; the Report of Professor Stowe to the General Assembly of the state of Ohio , in t837 ; and the Report by Mr. Mann , Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving the results of an examination into the scholestic system of the principal couistries of Europe , made in the summer of 184:3 . Mr. Mann 's Report contains some strictures on the schools of scotland which are , wu think , especially in what concerns religious instruction , exaggerated and unfair ; hut it embodies much matter well deserving of serious consideration in this country , as well as in the United States . The following is his general summary of the state of education in the principal countries of Europe : - " Arrange the most highly civilized and conspicuous nations of Europe in their due order of precedence , as it regards the education of their people , and the kingdoms of Prussia and Saxony , together with several of the western and south-western states of the Germanic Confederation , would undoubtedly stand predminent , both in regard to the quantity and the quality of instruction . After these should come Holland and Scotland  --  the provision for education in the former being much the most extensive , while in the latter perhaps it is a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national system , which is rapidly extending , aisd has already accomplished a vast amount of good . The same may l* said ofFrance . Its system for national education has now been in operation for about ten years , it has done much , and promises much more . During the very last year , Belgium has established such a system ; and before the revolution of 1830 , while it was united with Holland , it enjoyed that of the latter country . England is the only one among the nations of Europe , conspicuous for its civilization and resources which has not , and never has had , any system for the education of its people . And it is the country where , incomparably beyond any other , the greatest and most appalliu* social contrasts exist ,  --  where , in comparison with the intelligence , wealth , and refinement of what are called the higher classes , there is the most ignorance , poverty , and crime among the lower . And yet an no couatr y in the world have there t ) een men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , and elevation , and blessedness that come in the traits of mental cultivation ; and its no country have there been bequests , donations , and funds ad numerous and munificent as in England . Still , owing to the inherent vice and selfishness of their system , or their no system , there is no country in which *o little is effected , 6omnpared with their expenditure of means ; and what is done , only teiids to separate the diderent classes of society more and more widely from each other-p. 84. 393 community , who , while they would like to see their children edt*cated , are neither very able nor very willing to pay for it , or at least to pay for as much of it as would be desirable , and in regard to whom the exaction of a fee would be an obstacle in the way of their receiving educa*on , and thus so far defeat the object for which the community provided the means of instruction . That some should pay a fee , and others at the same school receive inrratuitons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both classes , and thus injure the popularity and efficiency of the schools . The advantages which are Coticeived to result from the exaction of fees , in inducing parents to take more interest in the regular attendance and the proficiency of their children , may surely be secured to a large extent by other means and iiifluences , whereas the benefits of edneation to the whole children of a community can scarcely be secured except by gratuitous education ; while a liberal remuneration to the teachers , and an efficiecat system of inspection and superintendence by those who have the power of appointment and removal , will secure all that can be secured in point of qualification , diligence , and activity on the part of the instructors . The public schools in the United States are under the superintendence and management of school committees , chosen sometimes by the municipal authorities of the district , sometimes by the people , and sometimes partly by the one and partly by the other . So strong and so general is a sense of the benefits of education , that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are rather disposed to say , because , of its being gratuitous , a very large proportion of the youth of the community are attending the public schools . In the published Report of the controllers of three fifths of the whole population between the ages of five and fifteen , now frequent the public schools , and that large ntimbers of applicants are found seeking for admission , more rapidly than vacancies occur or new schools can be formed . " There is a principle commonly acted upon in regard to the schools of the larger towns , which is found to exert a very wholesome influence on the teachers , the parents , and the scholars ; it is that of having a gradation of schools , through which the children pass in succession , a fair amount of proficiency at the lower being necessary before they are admitted . into the higher ; and admission into the highest , where they receive a classical edtscation , being in all cases the result and the reward of superior proficiency in all their previous studies . Thus , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into which of course the children are admitted indiscriminately ; then a system of secondary schools , into which the childretm are not admitted until they have made a certain degree of proficiency in the primary ; then a system of grammar schools , composed of those children who are found to have made due proficiencv at the secondary ; and lastly , a high school , where the higher branches of education , including classics and mathematics , are taught , and into which those only are admitted who have distinguished themselves at the grammar schools . In this way , all children , whatever niay be the circumstances of their parents , who exhibit talent and aptitude for learning , have the benefits of a full and liberal education within their reach ; the whole scheme of education for the city is brought // qwq extent of which in this country we have scarcely any conception . Every little town has its newspaper , and there is no place of any importance where the great body of the people are not in the habit of reading a newspaper which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked upon not merely as an amusement , but as a part of every man 's business , to which a portion of each day is , as a matter of course , devoted . In every considerable town there are several dailies published , and there are two classes of them , the larger , and generally the more respectable , cost a penny , and the smaller , many of which are less reputable , cost only a half-penny . In this way a great deal of information upon all public questions is circulated through the whole community ; and we have no doubt that a vastly greater proportion of the inhabitants of the United States have opinions upon all public questions , and are able to state and defend them in an intelligent and sensible way , in short , can discuss politics respectably , than in this country . There is also acquired in this way , and generally diffused , a larger acquaintance with the political affairs of Europe , and particularly of Great Britain , than we commonly possess of those of America . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust to newspapers for in*orination about European literature and politics , but are much in the habit of reading our reviews and other periodicals of a higher class . Most of the leading British reviews are republished in America , and are sold much cheaper than in this country ; our half-crown magazines being generally sold for ninepence , and our six shilling quarterlies for two ; and we have reason to believe , that about as large a proportion of men connected with the learned professions are in the habit of reading four or five of our leading reviews as are to be found even amongst ourselves . A great deal is said in this country about the corrupt state of the newspaper press in the United States , and there can be no doubt that unrestrained liberty in this respect has to a considerable extent degenerated into licentiousness ; but we are persuaded that this too , like many of the other evils existing in America , has been exaggerated . There is a recklessness in the abuse of public men , and of candidates for office , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrages upon public decency , in the shape of advertisements of quack medicines , such as never have been attempted here , and would not be tolerated by public opinion ; but still the general state of the newspaper press , as indicated by the casual perusal of all such newspapers as happened to come in our way , was not so bad as we had been led to expect ; and we fear that even the worst of them might be matched in most respects by some of the widely-circulated Sunday Journals of London . And it should not be forgotten , that if the press in the United States is often employed for evil , it is also vigorously and energetically employed for good , and that by its instrumentality a great deal of matter fitted to promote sound moral and religious principles , is widely diffesed through the community . By the general diffusion of education , and the absence of all taxes upon knowledge , a large amount of intelligence and of information upon all topics of public interest is spread through the community , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the important political functions which they are called upon to execute , more fully than we in this country find it very easy to believe . The leading practical defects connected with the mnanagement.of public affairs in the United States are the occasional interferences of popular feeling , exhibited sometimes even in the verdicts of juries. with the ordinary execution and administration of the laws , and the occasionaloutbreaks of popular violence which the civil authorities have sometimes neither force enough nor courage enough to prevent or suppress . These are great defects ; and as they interfere with the security of life and property , which is one great end of government , it is an imperative duty which the people of the United States owe to themselves and to the world , to adopt , if possible , some efficient means of preventing or remedying these evils . Still , , even about the incidents of this sort that occur sometimes in the United States , offensive as they are to us , who are so familiar , both theoretically and practically , with the absolute supremacy of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often some palliating circumstances which should not be altogether overlooked in the estimate we form of them . In many cases of these popular interferences with law and order and the peace of society , there has been some sound notion , some wholesome feeling , in the mind of the people , the perversion or misapplication of which , led to the violence of which they were guilty . Interferences with the ordinary execution and administration of the laws , have usually originated in a popular impression , whether well or ill founded , that by some legal technicality an accused party was likely to have a punishment inflicted upon him either more or less severe than justice and equity , and the general moral feeling of the community seemed to warrant , and have thus been somewhat analogous in their character and complexion to the execution of Captain Porteous by the inhabitants of Edinburghan incident in the history of the city which , though undoubtedly a crime , we presume its present inhabitants do not look hack upon with any very deep sense of shame or degradation . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be put down ; but still they are not to be confounded , especially when viewed as mdications of national character , with mere reckless and unthinking love of violence , or the mere indulgence of brutal cruelty . They have never , in the United States , assumed that fearfully offensive form of positive sympathy with murder and murderers , which , in certain parts of Ireland , hm sometimes saved the most desperate criminals from the punishment they deserved , by rendering their apprehension or conviction impossible . The occasional outbreaks of popular violenca too , have usually had their origin in some right feeling perverted and misapplied , and have been exhibitions of a sort of wild justice . A few years ago a nun escaped from a convent near Boston , and detailed the bad usage she said she had received ; this stirred up the indignation of the people of Boston , who went out and set fire to the convent . The recent riots in Philadelphia originated in the attempts of the Irish Roman Catholics to get the Scriptures expelled from the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealousy which these attempts excited in Protestants , who had more zeal than knowledge , hut who were anxious to preserve to the community the blessing of an open Bible . the late rising of the populace at N auvoo , and the murder of that vile impostor , Joseph Smith , the Mormon prophet , which grew out of it , originated in the tyranny which he 395 // and his followers were exercising over the surrounding country , combined with the fact that he had become rather too powerful to be controlled and restrained by the ordinary executive . Something similar is to be found attaching to most of the eases of popular outbreak that have taken place in America . We are not aware that the history of the United States exhibits any outbreak of popular violence so thoroughly disgraceful as the riots which took place a few years ago in Bristol . These Bristol riots originated in sheer love of violence and rapine , and had nothing like the pretence of a good motive , or the appearance of a right object , to palliate or excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , just because that country does not contain in any one of its cities or districts so large an amount of concentrated and unmitigated blackguardism8uch a mass of men who have nothing to lose and who have all the recklessness of utter destitution , as may be found in some of the large cities of this country . But still , though it is fair to have regard to these considerations in judging of events that sometimes occur in the United States , it can not be reasonably denied that there is too little government to afford full security for life and property , ton little provision for the enforcement of law and the preservation of peace and good order , and too great a tendency on the part of the rulers to leave the exercise of their functions in abeyance . Some Americans are disposed to indulge in speculations about the general diffusion of knowledge and virtue coming at length to supersede the necessity of law and government altogether . Whatever plausibility there may be in such speculations , and whatever may be the state of matters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fact , the time has not yet arrived , even in the United States , when they can be safely or conveniently acted upon in practice ; and we rejoice to find that since the recent riots in Philadelphia , the civil authorities of that city have adopted decided measures for raising and maintaining a force that may be adequate to prevent the recurrence of such disturbances , or at least to bring them to a speedier termination . Something more than mere education , however , is necessary in order to make the United States , or any other nation prosperous and happy , viz. , the general diffusion throughout the community of religious and moral principle . It is upon this that national as well as individual happiness depends , and just in proportion to the extent of this influence does any nation possess the true elements of greatness and prosperity . There can be no reasonable doubt that it is to the influence of Christianity , direct and indirect , that the small , and once very insignificant island of Great Britain owes the commanding position which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and there can be just as little doubt that the United States are indebted to the same cause for the great influence and prosperity to which they have already attained . And we should never forget , when we think of America , and of the feelings with which we ought to contemplate her , that she is the only country in the world , except Great Britain , where the religion of Jesus Christ can be said to have at present any considerable influence , where there is any very considerable number of persons who can be fairly regarded as acting from a real conviction that they are under law to Christ . There is certainly no country in the world , except Great Britain , that can be compared with the United States , with respect to the pioportion of its inhabitants who may be fairly regarded as living under the influence of religious principle , and though , from causes to which we formerly adverted , the indirect influeuce of religion upon those who are not living under its personal sway , is less widely diffused over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt that the influence of religion , both direct and indirect , is immeasurably greater in the United States than in any country in the world , except our own . We have said that Great Britain and the United States are the only nations in the world that admit of being compared together with respect to the general diffusion of religious and moral principle ; and though we are fully aware that a fair comparison between them would need a much fuller , and more careful investigation into the interior state of both than any inhabitant of either is ever likely to have an opportunity of making , yet we must say that we think that Great Britain , notwithstanding her greatly superior advantages , could not establish any very palpable or decided superiority in the comparison . It appears from the latest returns , that in 1843 , there were above 17,000 ministers connected with evangelical churches , excluding , of course , Roman Catholics , Universalists , and Unitarians , laboring in the United States , among a population of nearly 19,000,000 , thus affording an evangelical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much larger proportion of ministers to the population than are to be found in Britain , as large a proportion as exists at present in Scotland , and a much larger proportion than were to be found even in Scotland before the recent disruption of the ecclesiastical ' establishment , or than , but for that event , would probably have existed there for many years . It is true that a considerable number of these nninistersq especially among the Methodists and Baptists , are men who have not received a liberal educat , ion , but we believe the great body of them are pious and devoted men , who are not unsuited in many respects to the situations they occupy , and who are honored by the Head of the Church as the instruments of spiritual good. * The evangelical churches of the United States certainly do not present to any considerable extent the fearful spectacle which the established churches of this country and the continent have too often exhibited . of ministers subscribing articles which they did not believe and teach , and palpably falsifying by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they made at their ordination , * It is proper to mention that the Methodists and Baptists are now making much greater exertions than they once did , to secure an educated niinistry . The Presbyterians , to their honor , have strenniously resisted atienipis which have been sometimes made in consequence of the exigencies of the country , to lower the standard in this respect , and hive always refused ordination to men who did not possess the knoivledge that is commonly understood to indicaica liberal education . They d* not indeed exact attendance upon a prescribed curricubum as indispensable in every case , but they insist upon the possession of the knowl*dge , in whatever way it may have been acquired . A few years ago , a Presbytery in the West ordained some men to the ministry who bad not received a liberal education . The General Assembly refused to sanction the ordination . This led to a separation . The seceders assumed the designation of Cumberland Presbyterians , from the name of the district where they were chiefly settled , and have now about 450 ministers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were " moved by the Holy Ghost , " or , " chiefly influenced by zeal for the honor of God , love to the Lord Jesus Christ , and a desire of saving souls , " to enter upon the office of the ministry . The Presbyterian and Congregational ministers in the United States , are in general as well educated , and as intelligent and accomplished , as those who hold the sacred office in this country . We are disposed to think that they commonly manifest a fully higher measure of mental activity , and this arises partly from the greater general stimulus to activity and exertion in every department , by which the whole community is there pervaded , and partly from the way in which their education is usually conducted . There is in the American colleges and theological seminaries less of that mere lecturing ex cathedra , which has usually been the great staple of academical labor in our Scottish universities , and which left a considerable portion of the students in a state of intellectual dormancy , and more of mental training , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by there being much more of discussion , upon all the topics that enter into the course , between the professors and the students . It is not uncommon to have something resembling the old disputationes , in which the students state their difficulties or propose objections , and the professors are expected to remove or solve them . This practice is of course somewhat trying to the professors , and unless managed with great ability and skill on their part , may be fitted to foster a habit of cavilling , and a love of mere disputation and display , on the part of the students , but it is manifestly useful as a mere intellectual exercise , and tends greatly to sharpen and stimulate the mental powers . Its effects , we think , have been good upon the whole , though not unmixed with evil , and it has certainly tended , among other causes , to produce a high general standard of mental activity , among those who have gone through an academical and theological curriculum . The number of ministers preaching Jesus Christ and him erucified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general fitness of these men for the office they fill , may usually be regarded as a pretty fair index of the state of religion , and when tried by this test , the United States need not shrink from a comparison with Great Britain , if , as is quite fair , Ireland be put in on the one hand , to counterbalance the slave states of the south , and the half-settled states of the west , on the other . The general observance of the Lord 's day , is another index of the state of religion , and though some allowance may need to be made here , for a consideration formerly adverted to , viz. , that the indirect influence of religion upon those who are not religious men , is less felt in the United States than in this country , and that there men are more in the habit of acting freely upon their own personal views and feelings , unrestrained by the opinions and conduct of others around them , still we do not believe that upon the whole the United States fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular . The state of Sabbath observance in the large towns of America , as it strikes a stranger in passing along the streets , is , we would say , intermediate between the state of matters in this respect in the large towns of England and of Scotland ; better , we think , upon the whole , than in the southern , though rather worse than is th' ao*1icrn *ivi* ion of oni ' jiand . Tm as , 397 , we believe , been not very uncommon in America , for the men employed in the formation of canals , railways , and other public works , to labor for seven daysin the week , an outrage upon religion and decency , with which this country has not yet been disgraced . But the 4resent tendency in America is towards a better observance of the Lord 's day , while in this country , the current , we fear , is running in an opposite direction . The following testimony upon this point is given in the Report of the American Sabbath Union , published in April of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . " The transportation of the mails on the Sabbath has , on numerous routes , been discontinued ; and stage-coaches , steam-boats , tail-cars , and canalboats , have , in many cases , ceased to run on that day . Stockholders , directors , distinguished merchants , and civilians , have expressed their convictions that , should this he the case universally , it would greatly promote the welfare of all . The number of those who go , or send to the post-office , who are disposed to labor , or engage in secular business , travelling , or amusement on the Sabbath , is diminishing , and the number is increasing of those who are disposed to attend the public *vorship of God . Sabbath-breaking is becoming more amid more disreputable , and is viewed , by increasing numbers , as evidence of a low , reckless , and vicious mind . The conviction is extending , that it is not only morally wrong , but is unprofitable and dangerous . And should all the facts with regard to this subject be knowmi , and duly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal . Laborers , in many cases , refuse to work on Sabbath . They view it , as it actually is , as a degradation to be thus singled out from the rest of time comnmunity , and obliged to labor when others are at rest . They find it to be hurtful to themselves and their families . It injures their health , corrupts their morals , and increases the danger of their being abandoned to imifamy and ruin . Some who , imi consequence of refusing to labor on the Sabbath , had been dismissed from their employments , have afterwards been sought for , and employed again , and warmly commended for their attachment to principle , and for their fidelity and success in the discharge of their duties . " The last sentence in this extract suggests to us the observation that the facilities for promoting the better observance of the Lord 's day in the United States , are greatly increased by the facts , that the body of the people are much more independent , not only in their feelings but in their circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly so dependent upon the wealthier classes , and that , what is in many respects an unspeakable blessing , men who are able and willimig to work , have a far greater certainty of being able to procure a decent livelihood for themselves and their families . The working-classes , though certain , when not under the influence of religious principle , to misspend the Sabbath , and to fail in applying it to its proper purpose , are not likely to spend it in ordinary labor , except when this is required of them by those on whom they are dependent for subsistence . In other matters , too , than Sabbath observance . the influence of religion generally seems to ho upon the increase . The great revivals of religion which took place in the early part of this century , and x* i*C*i were followed in the main by tie most // salutary results , led also , in some parts of the country , to considerable excesses of extravagance and fanaticism . These again produced a certain degree of reaction in favor of coldness and rationality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure passed away , and the churches , we think , are now profiting by a judicious improvement of the history of religion for the last generation , avoiding excesses and extremes , and laboring with zeal , and yet with prudence , in the great work of their calling . The progress which the Church of Rome is makin g in some parts of the country , especially in the West , is exciting considerable alarm , and thus contributing to unite the evangelical churches together , *y a sense of common danger arid common duty , and concentrating their attention upon those important topics which are involved in the controversy between the apostate Church of Rome and the true Church of Christ . This result is also promoted by the wide diffusion of Puseyism and ultra high-churchism , in its most offensive form , among the Episcopalians of America . The antievangelical and Romanizing tendencies of highchurchism are more fully developed in the Episcopal Church of America , than even in the Church of England ; and the evangelical party as a body , though there are some noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about as deficient in courage and energy , decision and public spirit , as they are in our own land . The extent to which the Puscyites there have carried out their principles , has not only united the churches more closely together , but has made the controversies which they have been obliged to carry on against their high-church assailants , and which have been conducted with much ability and intelligence , turn not merely upon questions of church government and order , but on matters intimately connected with the true ground of a sinner 's hope , and the real nature of genuine religion . It may be fairly regarded as an indication of the growing influence of religion and religious men , that the whig party have selected , as their candidate for the vice-presidency at the approaching election in November , Mr. Freylingbuysen , who has long been known as a decidedly and consistently religious man , an elder and a Sabbath-school teacher in the Presbyterian church , and a zealous supporter of all schemes directed to the promotion of true religion . The election of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the latter as vice-president , will be supported by the great body of the religious men in the community , and by the great majority of those who are anxious for a steady and efficient government , conducted upon rational and well-defined principles , as opposed to merely temporary popular feeling and present apparent expediency . The election of these men would be highly honorable to the people of the United States , and would go far to refute the charge that has often been adduced against them , of giving their votes only to men who have secured their favor by mean subserviency and flattering their prejudices , and would augur well for the prosperity of the nation , and the stability of the government . As our leading object in this article is to convince our readers that some of the notions commonly entertained in this country regarding the United States , require to be modified , and that a more favorable estimate than usually obtains among us would also be a fairer one , we would now make a few o*s:rvations upon some of the particular defects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarly characteristic of our American brethren , omitting any further reference to their political institutions , as we have already said all that we think necessary or expedient upon that point . It is commonly understo.id in Great Britain that the Americans are distinguished for their selfcomplacency and self-conceit , and their disposition to boast about their country . That they love their country , think very highly of its institutions and capacities , indulge in very sanguine anticipations of its future greatness and prosperity , and express freely , and sometimes , as might be expected , foolishly enough , their views , feelings , and expectations on this subject , is true ; but , after all , we are not sure that they are much more unreasonable and ridiculous in this respect than some other nations that might be mentioned . There is a great deal in the hist.ory , condition , and prospects of the United States , which is fitted not unreasonably to call forth complacency in regard to the past , and bright anticipations in regard to the future . One of their authors has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American wilderness with the finest of the wheat ; " and there can be no doubt that their ancestors were to a large extent the best men whom the three kingdoms at the time ct ) ntained . Almost everything connected with the origin , management , and results of the war of Independence , was as honorable to America as it was discreditable to Great Britain . Since that time the increase of the population , and the growing development of the resources and capacities of the country , the diffusion of intelligence , activity , and enterprise through the community , have greatly surpassed anything of the kind which the history of the world had previously exhibited . The resources of the country are immense and incalculable , and there is a spirit of activity and enterprise in operation , which may not tinreasonably be expected to develop them to a wonderful extent . In these circtimstances , it is not surprising , that along with the buoyancy and vigor , there should be also some of the boastful presumption and self-confidence , of youth . There seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them exhibit something , more or less , of self-conceit , presumption , or puppyism , viz. , when they are conscious of the growth and development of new powers arid capacities , but not quite sure that others are yet prepared to admit their claims and pretensions to the possession of them . Something similar occurs in the history of nations . The Americans have been fully conscious of the growing strength , influence , and prosperity of their country , but they have been annoyed by the suspicion that their just claims are not yet frilly admitted and appreciated by the nations of the Old World . This has operated in the same way as a similar feeling often does among young men at a certain stage of their history , in producing something of an exorbitant disposition to urge their own clainis , and a somewhat morbid sensitiveness , as to the way in which their pretensions may be received . To whatever extent this feeling may have operated in time past , the Americans are now fully warranted in laying it aside . They are fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have attained a very high place among the nations of the world-that they need not now be very greatly concerned about the opinions which ether : ; atioas x*rv c*t*rtain of them-398 // that they may condescend to learn some things from other countries without any fear of being looked down upon by those whom in some points they may imitate  --  and that they should just quietly and steadily go on extending the blessings of religion , education , and good government , in the confident expectation that , through the Divine blessing , their country will yet become much greater and more prosperous than it now is , and will yet confer important blessings upon the world . XVe are in the habit of talking much of the vanity and the boasting of the French and the Americans , but it is well to remember that both French and Americans are in the habit of adducing a similar charge against ourselves , and alleging that Britons , and especially Englishmen , are pre*ininently proud , self-conceited , and boastful ; and it would probably be an advantage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of " seeing themselves as others see them . " Our own experience does not bear out the accounts we have sometimes read of the tendency of the Americans to extravagant boasting about their country . We do not remember to have heard , in the course of a visit of some months to the United States , any very unreasonable or offensive boasting or seWlaudation . We heard no more of this sort of folly than an American traveller in this country would probably , in siniilar circumstances , heam from us in praise of ourselves : and on this ground we are inclined to believe that the ridiculous boasting about themselves and their country attributed to the Americans in the gross , is to be found only among a class , who are represented abundantly among ourselves by those who continue to assert and to maintain the old position , that one Englishman can beat three Frenchmen at any time , and other extravagances of a similar description . Another notion pretty generally prevalent among us is , that the Americans are decidedly inferior to the inhabitants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard violations of these virtues as venial when they are managed with skill and dexterity . We have already admitted that the general standard of morality among irreligious men , and to them only , of course , does the allegation apply , is decidedly lower than that which obtains in similar circumstances among the middle classes of our own country , and offered some explanations upon the point . It is this , more perhaps than anything else , which keeps up in this country a strong prejudice against the United States . The complete cure of the evil is to be expected only from the more general prevalence and the more extensive influence of true religion ; but still it is worthy of the consideration of religious and upright men , whether more might not be done in directing general disapprobation and the censure of public opinion , against every violation of integrity , or of anything like it , though not coming under the cognizance of the judicial tribunals . We have no doubt that Dickens ' description of the way in which violations of integrity are palliated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetrator being a " smart man , " is , like many of his other descriptions , greatly exaggerated , and does not , by any means , apply so generally , even to irrehgmous men , as his statements would lead us to suppose . We are also fully aware , that on this and on some other topics usually discussed by Dickens and other travellers of a similar character , it is easy enough for Americans to retaliate upon this country , and to pic ! : up a good deal of change for American Notes . Still , we fear , it n*ust be admitted , that there is truth in the general position , that violations of integrity arid proceedings of a very equivocal kind on the score of honesty , do not quite so seriously injure a man 's character , in gene*al society , and call down such tokens of disappr*bation as they would in this country ; and that therefore there is much need of aiming , as a distinct and definite object , at raising the moral tone of the community , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the proper standard of integrity and honor . Somewhat akin to this accusation , though of a less serious character , is the notion very commonly entertained among us , that the Americans are most eagerly and unceasingly engaged in the pursuit of wealth ; and that this , even when kept within the restraints of honesty , has produced a cold , unamiable , sordid character . There is some truth in this notion , though , like most of our popular impressions in regard to the Americans , it is exaggerated , and in so far as it is true , the result is very much owing to the circumstances in which they have been placed . From the free access which all men have to every department of business , and to every avenue to wealth and influence , and from the exclusive dependence which every man must place upon himself and upon his own capacities and resources , for success and advancement , there has been called forth , through the community in general , a very large amount of intelligence , activity , and enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition in every department of trade and business , so that , in general , and in all ordinary circumstances , it requires unwearied activity and constant attention , something very like entire engrossment with business , to enable men to keep up and to advance , or , to use a common phrase of their own , " to get along . " This , combined with the almost entire want of idle men and their hangers-on , and the fact that almost every man is laboring , and is obliged to labor , in some way or other , for maintaining his family , or kee*ng up the station he has already reached , almosf inevitably produces a universality of engrossment with business , and a measure of attention to pecuniary affairs , which the very different state of matters in this country does not so extensively require . But though , from these causes , an entire engrossment with business , and . a thorough devotion of time and attention to the making of money , is more general than in this country , and therefore comes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though this , to some extent , exerts an injurious influence upon the general tone of character and sentiment , we do not think that there is more of hoarding of money , as if it were valuable for its own sake , and independently of the comforts and advantages it might procure . It is at least as common there as it is here for men to spend and enjoy the money they make ; and there arc probably fewer instances proportionally of men denying themselves comforts which their money might have been reasonably spent in procuring , and hoarding it up either for the mere pleasure of accumulation , or in order to enrich their children , The general state of society , requiring and prompting to great engrossment with business , of course exerts a certain influence even upon religious men , as the withdrawal or relaxation of their attention would be likely to result , not mer2ly in 399 // their gains being pro tanto diminished , but in their being driven altogether off the field . Still , with all the love of money-making usually ascribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their situation that tend to the formation of this habit , we are persuaded that the duty of giving for religious and charitable objects is usually discharged by religious people in that country upon a scale at least equal in proportion to their means to that which has been commonly exhibited by religious people in our own land . Circumstances of a peculiar and extraordinary kind have recently occurred in Scotland , to call forth a greater measure of liberality and a higher standard of giving for religious objects than had been perhaps ever previously exhibited amongst us , and this would probably give us at present an advantage in any comparison which might be instituted now with the American churches . But if we take the whole of Britain into view , extend the inquiry over the last few years , and omit what has sprung from recent and extraordinary circumstances , the contributions to religious and charitable objects in the United States , viewed of course in connexion with the number and the means of the contributors , would not suffer by the comparison . There is undoubtedly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , to the maintenance of churches and religious ordinances , and the diffusion of divine truth joth at home and abroad . There are not wanting , on the part of laymen , instances of extraordinary Christian philanthropy , the devotion of much time and money to schemes directed to the promotion of the spiritual welfare of the community . Indeed , we are inclined to think that extraordinary instances of Christian liberality are more common in America than in this country , and we ascribe this to the greater tendency which men there manifest to follow out their own personal convictions and feelings , in place of merely following the multitude in good as well as in evil . It is not uncommon in America for men to give large sums of money during their lives to religious and charitable objects , while here , if they gave at all , they would bequeath it in their wills to be appropriated after their death . It is no very uncommon thing , especially in New England , at least it is not so uncommon as in this country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laying up money for their children or relatives , but devoting their whole gains each year to objects of Christian benevolence . They can , to be sure , count with much greater certainty than we can upon their children being able to secure a respectable livelihood for themselves , but still the practice indicates a deep sense of the Christian obligation of giving as God has prospered them . Before concluding , we must say something about slavery in the United States . It is a painful subject , and one which no real friend of America can contemplate x4ithout feelings of the deepest sorrow and regret . It is the topic on which , of all others , our American brethren are the most sensitive , probably from a lurking consciousness that it is the deepest and darkest stain attaching to their country , and that all they can adduce in explanation or palliation of the system , affords no adequate defence of it . It is certainly disgraceful to men , calling themselves Christians and freemen , to keep multitudes of their fellow-men in bondage , deprived wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and religious improvement , and of the secure enjoyment of the blessings of domestic life ; and this guilt , until a few years ago , attached to tbe British nation , and still attaches to one third of the free citixens of America , the white inhabitants of the slave states . The inhabitants of the free states contain two thirds of the population of the whole Union . They had abolished slavery throughout their b*5ders before it was abolished in the British colonies , and are not now directly responsible for its existence in the other states , since , by the constitution of the nation , they are precluded from exercising any control over them in this matter . On the white inhabitants of the slave states , amounting to about one third of the whole white population of the Union , lies the proper and direct responsibility for the continuance of slavery , and it is certainly no light one . Those who have assumed to themselves , in the United States , the name of Abolitionists  --  and who , while they have done much good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we fear , done much harm to a good cause by their injudicious and extravagant views and measures-have succeeded to a large extent in propagating in this country the impression , that in America all men are either abolitionists in their sense , adopting their views and concurring in their measures , or else approvers and defenders of slavery . This representation is unfair and injurious . There are in America four pretty distinctly marked grades of opinion and sentiment upon this subject . 1st . The Abolitionists , technically so called , lay it down as their fundamental principle , that slaveholding is directly and in itself a sin , in the same sense in which murder is a sin ; and that every man holding slaves , no matter though they may have come into his possession without any act of his own , and no matter though the civil law of the land may interpose the most serious obstacles in the way of his manumitting them , is ipso facto , a thief and a robber , and ought to be regarded and treated as such . 2d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle , reckon themselves antislavery men , because they maintain , that the system of slavery is inconsistent with the natural rights of men , opposed to the moral bearing and general spirit of the Word of God , and injurious to the interests of religion , and on these grounds are anxious to see the system abolished ; though they hold themselves precluded by the statements and conduct of the apostles from regarding mere slaveholding as in every instance , and independently of circumstances , essentially sinful , and on the same grounds , believe that the church of Christ . is not called upon to apply the exercise of ecclesiastical discipline to mere slave-holding , or to sacrifice opportunities of preaching the Gospel and promoting the interests of religion , to agitating the general or abstract question of slavery . This view is entertained by a very numerous and influential body , comprehending , we believe , the great mass of the clergy in the free states . We confess that we do not see how , consistently with a due regard to scriptural authority and apostolic example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slavery ; and while we are half tempted to regret that it affords room for some considerations of expediency as to the time and way and manner of setting about the abolition of slavery , which cowardly and selfish men may misapply and pervert , that is no reason why we should go beyond the line of truth and evidence , and run into the 400 // ultra-abolition prini*iple , merely because it is more decided and unequivocal . 3d . There are many , who , without holding any very definite principles on the general subject of slavery as a topic of abstract speculation ) are desirous to see it abolished , on the ground of the great practical evils which are connected with it , and which seem inseparable from the system This class usually concur with that last described , in condemning the laws by which slaves are prohibited being taught to read , the separation of members of the same family is sanctioned , and mann mission is rendered almost impracticable . 4th . There are the approvers and defenders of slavery , the enactors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no wish to defend these men from the denunciations of the abolitionists , though we think , that the recollection of the fact , that by the constitution of the United States slavery can not be abolished without their consent or l ) erniission , might have suggested the expediency of dealing with them in a somewhat more conciliatory way . Had the abolition of slavery in our colonies depended upon the consent of the vVest Indian interest , it would certainly have continued to exist at this day , and the AntiSlavery Society would probably have seen it to be their duty to adopt a mode of procedure different in some respects from that which , being admirably adapted to our circumstances , was crowned with such triumphant success . But while we think that the abolitionists , who have had very much the ear of the public in this country , have done injustice to the second and third classes , by concealing their existence , or doubting their sincerity , we must say also , that these classes have done great injustice to themselves , by not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making suitable exertion* for diffusing them , amid attempting to get them carried into effect . The calumnies of the abolitionists in denying their sincerity-for we have no doubt they are calumnieshave derived much plausibility from their own apathy , their want of union and energy . They can not indeed join with the abolitionists , because they do not agree with their fundamental primiciple , and strongly disapprove of some of their violent and offensive proceedings . But this is no reason why they should do nothing , and leave the subject entirely in the hands of abolitionists . All except pro-slavery men condemn the prohibition to teach slaves to read , the separation ( if families , and the serious and almost insuperable difficulties interposed in the way of manumission . And yet scarcely any effort is made , except by abolitionists , to expose or remove these great evils . All who are in army sense , or upon any grounds , opposed to slavery , and desirous to see the system brought at any time to an end , should be doing something directed towards the attainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the slaves deliverance from the worst evils of their condition  --  to secure for them opportunities of utstruction , the blessings of domestic life , and manu* mission when their masters are willing to grant it . Although a great proportion of the intelligence and the worth of America rank in point of piofession in the second and third classes , yet practinally the first and fourth classes alone are doing much to attract public notice , and to influence the community , or are engaged in active and energetic efforts i*pon the subject of slavery . They allege , indeed , that the violence of the abolitionists , and the vio XXXt . LTVING AGE . y0Z* . Itt , * 26 401 lence thereby engendered in the southern states , rendered it . impracticable for a time to do any good , and inexpedient to attempt it . This may have been to some extent true , though we fear that too much was made of it . But this can not excuse continued inaction ; and the*time surely has now come , when the abolition o* the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolitiofl of slavery , should be taken up and promoted by wiser and more judicious men than rhe present abolitionists . We know there are great difficulties in the way of effecting this object-difliculties which , in this country , we do not fbily appreciate and sympathize with ; but if we , from ignorance of the circumstances , and want of due sympathy , underrate the difficulties of ameliorating the condition of the slaves , and effectimig the ultimate abolition of slavery , is there not reason to fear , that our brethren in America overrate them that they are too much disposed to say , There is a lion in the way  --  to fold their hands , and do nothing l The combined efforts of those in the free states , who , though not abolitionists in the technical sense , are opposed to the existimig slave laws , and desirous to see slavery ultimately abolished , might surely bring some moral influence to bear uimon the south , which would not only exonerate themselves from the suspiciumi of being the approvers and defenders of slavery , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are aware , that the general character of those who govern the southern states  --  the worst features of which are plaimily traceable to the fact that they are slave*holders-renders the result of any intesference on the part of the north , even in the usc of legitimate moral means  --  a somewhat doubtful experiment . But we can not help thinking , that the failure of the abolition movement was owing , not merely to the extrenme views put forth , and the violent measures adopted , but also to the fact , that it was not backed by the worth and intelligence of the north ; and that notwithstanding the senseless pride and the foolish insolence of the mass of southern planters , the friends of the slave in time north might adopt some judicious measures , that could scarcely fail to induce the slave-holders , at least to put an end to those features of the system , which , independently of all , abstract principles about slavery , always call forth the deepest indignation , such as the formabprohibition of teaching , the virtual prohibiti9.n of manumission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans , and even those , in the south , who may see nothing wrong . me. slavery , do no.t allow themselves to reflect up** , the manifest impossibility of perpetuating it and do not , under this eonviction , set themselves . in right earnest , and with vigor and decision , * to bring to.a safe and speedy terminatie*zr , . a ays*em which is fraught with so much mischief ? to all who are in anyway connected with it , and which tends so much to tarnish th' fair fame of their country . It is true , , that thee are somemem in Great Britain who speak mu Ii against Amencan slavery , while yet they opp. *ed the eataneipa-. tion of the slaves in oui own colonies-Men who. are still opposed to all liberal principles andiustitutions , and whose p*eended interest iii slavery is nothing more than an expression of theb.t dislike to . America . But it is also true , that all tAme friends .. of civil and religious libesty in this country , coniprehending , of e*urse* all who entertain time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see them *r*sperou* and , happy , are // deeply grieved with the existence of American slavery , and are much annoyed , that the enemies of liberal institutions should have so serious an accusation to bring against them , while so little comparatively can be said in defence or in palliation of th6ir* conduct . The Americans owe it to themselves , and to the principles and the advocates of civil and religious liberty , to do more than they have been doing of late years , to wipe away this reproach . The political principles embodied in their constitution , and of which they love to regard themselves as the representatives and the champions , are not likely to command the assent , or even the respect of the civilized world , so long as the enemies of freedom can point to American slavery . But while we think it right that our American brethren should be plainly and affectionately told , that their best and warmest friends in this country are decidedly of opinion , that they are not doing all that they can and should do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their ultimate emancipation , there are some general considerations suggested by this subject , which should not be overlooked , and which are fitted to moderate the self-complacency with which , ever since 1834 , we have been accustomed to contemplate this subject , and to lead us to form a somewhat fairer estimate than we commonly do of the state of matters in America . 1st . There is reason to believe , that the physical condition and the general treatment of the slaves in the United States are better than they were in our West Indian colonies previous to their emancipation . The proof of this is , that their slave population is increasing in number , in : * ratio little less than the free population of the same territories , whereas in the West Indies , as Lord Brougham repeatedly proved in the House of Cor*mons , the number of slaves regularly decreased ; and the cause of this is , that in the United States , the proprietors and their families are bred up with the slaves , and live amongst them , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notwithstanding the corrupting influence of slavery upon the character of the masters as well as of the slaves , do tend greatly to diminish the general amount of cruelty and oppression ; whereas , in our West Indies , there were very few cases in which the proprietors and their families were resident , and the slaves were generally under the control of hired overseers , who usually cared for nothing but gratifying their own passions , and mere sing their masters ' gains . 2d . The abolition of slavery in America , would be a far more honorable thing to the southern states , and to the country generally , than the emancipation of the slaves in our colonies was to Great Britain . The abolition of slavery did not run counter to the ordinary feelings and habits , prejudiecs and prepossessions of the inhabitants *f Great Britain in general . It exposed them to no danger , and did not in the least interfere with the ordinary framework and habits of their society . it cost them just a sum of money , and that sum though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources of Great Britrain , as requiring any great sacrifice , or imposing any great hardship . The case is very different in the slave states of Am3rica . There slavery is interwoven with the whole framework and habits of society , with all the arrangements of social and domestic life , and with all the feelings and associations which these things tend tQ. produce . On these grounds , combined with the very inadequate means they possess of guarding against commotions and disturbances , we have no hesitation in saying that the abolition of slavery in America , would be a far greater triumph of principle , humanity , and courage , than was the emancipation of the slaves in the British colonies , and that , of course , the achievement of it would entitle them to far higher praise , than we can claim to ourselves ; while the fact , that it has not yet been effected , considering the great diversity of the circumstances , and the far greater difficulties that stand in the way , should not subject them to the same amount of obloquy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored population of our colonies had been still the property of their former owners . The relation of the inhabitants of the southern states to slavery is much more close and intimate than even that of the West Indian proprietors in this country was to the slavery of our colonies , and its abolition there would he much more honorable to them than it would have been to our West Indian proprietors to have emancipated their slaves without compulsion . Yet we all know that it would have been hopeless to have expected this ; and we are very doubtful whether , if slavery had stood in the same relation to us as it does to the inhabitants of the southern states of America , there be even now enough of principle , humanity , and courage , in the community of Great Britain to have effected its abolition . 3d . There is fair ground to question whether , notwithstanding the existence of slavery , with all its attendant evils , there be a larger proportional amount of ignorance , crime , and misery , in the United States of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain and Ireland . We have certainly no desire to palliate the evils of slavery , or to encourage the Americans in apathy and indifference to this great sin and mischief , but we think these considerations deserving of attention-fitted to moderate our self-complacency with respect to our own social state , and to lead us to think somewhat less severely of our American brethren , even in regard to that subject which is undoubtedly the darkest feature in their condition , and the most certain to interfere with their growing prosperity and their increasing influence in the world . It is surely right in itself , and of great importance to the best interests of mankind , that friendly feelings should be cultivated and friendly relations maintained between Great Britain and the United States . Their common origin , language , literature , and religion , form bonds of connexion that do not subsist between any other nations , and which ought to be cordially recognized and acted upon . Our countrymen in general have treated the Americans unkindly and unfairly-have been too much disposed to exaggerate their faults , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of having been the mother-country of *uch a nation  --  a nation which , amid some considerable disadvantages , has made astonishing progress , and has reached a very high place , in all the leading elements of national prosperity , and which is most likely to continue to exert a growing beneficial influence upon the state of the world at large . Duty and right feeling should combine in disposing us to be To their faults a little blind , And to their virtues very kind.
