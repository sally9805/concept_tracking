txt THE American Revolution , like all important events , formed or developed extraordinary characters . The country has not yet compared and rightly estimated all these characters . It has not done this , because the country has not yet fully understood the Revolution itself . Even at this period it is too much surrounded by the smoke and din of the contest . Our attention is too exclusively directed to the results of the Revolution , to admit a just understanding of the relative importance of particular events , or the moral involved in them . The period is approaching , when its history will be written , and when the country will understand all the principles involved in the Revolutionestimate at its true value every important event , and assign to each prominent actor in those events , his appropriate distinction . When this is done , it will appear that the true glory of the Revolution does not rest upon the successful issue of the contest with the mother country . We find the seeds of the Revolution in the circumstances and character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , during the whole of that forming period , were singularly prophetic of all that was to come . After the colonies became united in resistance , the conflict could hardly have terminated otherwise than with success . England was too much divided and distracted at home , was too far from the theatre of the war , and withal too much in the wrong , to conquer a sparsely settled , but united country , defended with the enthusiasm which &amp;aracterised that protracted struggle . The contest ended in triumph . A victorious and unpaid soldiery , were disbanded to seek their homes of poverty . The " Rebellion* ' had given birth to a nation without a national government . A people exhilarated by the successful resistance of authority and law , were called upon to be a law unto themselves , while both the glory and poverty incident to war conspired to distract them . Then it was that there was danger such as had depended upon no battle of the Revolution . When the war and its excitement had passed , leaving no perceptible fruits but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt which it had cost ; when , with the country convulsed by the jealousies of great men , and discontent scattered broadcast among the people , an attempt was made to form a national goverment , a crisis impended more fearful than that involved in the declaration of Independence . And the events which followed-no one can read them , without trembling , though knowing how they terminated . When a people whose only bond of union was sympathy , flowing from common suffering and common resistance of authority , voluntarily adopted a form of government which made them one nation , and combined libertywith security-when the discontented avoided anarchy , and the ambitious yielded up their schemes of individual power , seeking and finding a remedy in a peaceable submission to authority , the crowning glory of the Revolution was Consummated . As " he who ruleth his own spirit is greater than he who taketh a city , " so was the adoption of the Federal Constitution a greater event than the renowned declaration of rights , or the great victory which terminated the contest . The country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw from it those sober and practical views of duty which it is suited to inculcate . It will then learn that there is much to imitate , as well as to praise . It will learn to venerate those extraordinary men who gave a right direction to public opinion ; who subdued local and individual jealousies ; and from the chaos of jarring elements , formed and established a government suited to their country . When great men are estimated by what they do ior others , rather than what they accomplish for themselves , the country will then have advanced to his standard , and will appreciate the character and actions , of John Jay . When the country learns to consider , as it ought  --  and as it will-its duties as well as its rights , and discovers , as it will , that its internal passions need more guards than its external enemies-when it learns to bear , and rightly to improve the trials of prosperity , Mr. Jay will enjoy a popularity , not bois-. // terous and assuming , but quiet like the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided it . When the world shall have sickened , and it is beginning to do so , of those great men who have sported with the passions , hopes and wants of humanity , and analyzes before it commends-when it seeks a model to live by , rather than a hero to worship , and brazen-faced intellectual selfishness shall have given place to public spirit , and statesman and christian shall have become synonymous terms , then will the country be grateful for the example , as well as the services , of John Jay . It does not lie within the range of our plan to consider the political opinions , but simply to narrate some of the incidents in the life , and to sketch some of the traits in the character of this eminent man . John Jay was born in the City of New York , on the 12th of December , 1745 . Mr. Jay 's aacestors were Protestants , and prominent enough to attract the persecuting spirit of Popery , and firm enough in their principles to abandon their country , rather than their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France , and came to this country in the latter part of the 17th century . Just before he emigrated , he had made a voyage to Africa . During his absence , his father had been compelled , on account of religions persecutions , to abandon his property in France , and seek shelter in England . Augustus Jay , when he reached France , and learned the fate of his father , had the good fortune to find a ship bound to Charleston , S. C. On reaching this country , he settled at New York , where he married in 1697 , Miss Bayard , one of whose ancestors had been a Protestant professor of theology , in Paris , in the reign of Louis XIII. , and who was driven from France by the Jesuit persecutions . Peter Jay , the son of Augustus , and the father of John , married in 1728 , Miss Van Cortland , whose ancestors had been driven by the same persecutions , from Bohemia . The infatuation of those times , forced to this country many good men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom the new world so much needed . These men brought with them their principles , dearer for the sufferings which they occasioned ; and from them sprung the Institutions of this country . Such were the high-principled ancestors of John Jay , and this short sketch of them , furnishes the key to his own character-well grounded principles stronger than power , stronger than temptation . Mr. Jay graduated at Columbia College , in 1764 , and immediately entered upon the study of the Law in the City of ew York . He was admitted to the Bar in 1768 , and almost immediately acquired an extensive and lucrative practice . He soon formed a partnership with Robert R. Livingston , afterwards Chancellor of the State . This connection continued but for a short time . in 1774 , he married the daughter of William Livingston , Governor of New Jersey . In May of the same year , upon the receipt of the news of the passage of the Boston Port Bill , the citizens of New York held a meeting , and chose Mr. Jay and others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that subject . This committee was the first organized body in New York Colony , chosen in opposition to those measures which resulted in the Revolution . in July following Mr. Jay was elected a member of the Continental Congress , and was the writer of the address from that Congress to the people of Great Britain . From this time to 1778 he was constantly either a member of the Continental Congress , or in some prominent station in his native state , exchanging the one for the other , as the exigencies seemed to require . In 1778 he was a member of the New York Convention to form a State Constitution , and made the draught which was adopted . He was immediately appointed Chief Justice , and his former partner , Livingston , Chancellor . Mr. Jay was at the same time a prominent member of the Committee of Safety , a Committee which exercised nearly uncontrolled and undefined executive functions . The latter part of this year he was elected to Congress , resigned his office of Chief Justice of New York , the Governor attempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was soon after elected President of Congress . When the Governor of New York wrote to Jay requesting him to recall his resignation of the office of Chief Justice , he replied , adhering to the resolution which he had taken , and added " the legislature may perhaps in consequence of this step be induced to keep me in Congress . On this head I must inform you that the situation of my father*s family is such that I can not reconcile it to my ideas of filial duty to be absent from them , unless my brother should be so circumstanced as to pay them the necessary attention . " At the same time he wrote to his brother as follows : " I am now to inform you that I have // resigned the office of Chief Justice , and if the state should incline to keep me here , I shall consent to stay , provided either you or James will undertake to attend constantly to our good old father and his unfortunate family ; otherwise t shall , at all events , return for that purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can not pay the necessary attention , prevent my election , and let me know your intention by the first opportunity . " Arrangements were made to render the step which he had determined to take unnecessary and he remained President of Congress . This determination more unequivocably attests the true greatness of the man , than his appointment to all the important offices he ever filled . Aspiring politicians , under such circumstances , would have regarded infirm and unfortunate parents as clogs on their hasty feet , and looked on their homes as the last theatre for the exhibition of a lofty character . It is time we had learned to think and to feel that it is what we are , and not u*here we are , that elevates or degrades us . No man ever filled so high and varied trusts , or passed through exciting and trying scenes , more entirely anchored upon his own principles than John Jay . Always acting from well considered and firmly fixed opinions , his life exhibits no inconsistencies . The zealous performance of one duty was never allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most constant friends of the Revolution , he exerted himself to moderate the resentment of the people against those who took up arms against the colonies , and to meliorate the condition of such of them as were suffering imprisonment . One instance of this kind is so characteristic of the man , and in such contrast with the times , that it may be well to mention it . A gentleman of New York having accepted a royal commission was , afterwards , by the casualties of war , made a prisoner and confined in the jail of Hartford . During his imprisonment Mr. Jay wrote him as follows : " How far your situation may be comfortable and easy I know not . It is my wish and shall be my endeavor that it be as much so as may be consistent with the interest of that great cause to which 1 have devoted everything I hold dear in this world . I have taken the liberty of requestlng Mr. Samuel Broome immediately to advance you $1 00 on my account . " No man more distinctly admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully met them . But he recognized no duties in patriotism inconsistent with the demands of christainity . In September , 1779 , Mr. Jay was appointed minister plenipotentiary to Spain . During his residence in Spain he was appointed one of the Commissioners to negotiate peace with Great Britain . This last appointment caused him to remove to Paris . He remained in Paris five years , and until 1784 , bore an important part in negotiating , and ultimately signed the definative treaty of peace with England . When he reached Paris he found only one of the Commissioners , Dr. Franklin , on the ground . As soon as the negotiation opened , Jay discovered that his duty to his country would require him to disobey the instructions of Congress , and to resist the intrigues of the French Court : that the American Commissioners , if they would preserve the real independence and dignity*of their country , would be obliged to meet England not only without the aid but in opposition to the influence of France . All this he did without the aid and in opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived , and concurred in the course which Jay had adopted ; and Dr. Franklin ultimately came into the same view . This was a trying emergency . Jay alone was to give a direction to the negotiation which was of the first importance to his country , then struggling for independence . He had the instructions of his country , and these he was obliged to disobey . He had but one associate , and his opinionand that a weighty one-he was obliged to disregard . In this crisis , suited to raise a great man , and crush a feeble one , Jay stood unmoved . In resisting the intrigues of France , in piloting his country through the dangers which surrounded it , in snatching it from the attitude of being the foot-ball of European belligerents , in preserving the independence of his nation from the intrigues of diplomacy more dangerous to it than the arms of England : in securing the blessings of peace without planting the seeds of future irritation and wars-his directness and honesty were more than a match for the artful diplomacy by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Spain , simply because he did not use their instruments . Theywere prepared to meet and vanquish an intriguing negotiator . But they were unprepared to resist a frank one , who avowed his object , and set to work to reach it by direct means . None but a pure man could , or would have taken the bold step which Jay adopted . The mere // politician would have faltered and left his country to be the plaything of Europe . But the exigency was suited to such a character as Jay 's . He saw the line of duty which the good , in opposition to the instructions , of his country required him to pursue ; and he adopted it as calmly as he gave an order to relieve a royalist in jail . Having accomplished the objects of his appointment abroad , he returned from Europe in 1784 , and upon his return he found that Congress , the body whose instructions he had disobeyed , had appointed him Secretary of Foreign Affairs-an office corresponding to the present Department of State . This appointment indicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jay 's conduct abroad ; that if they could have foreseen the exigency , there would have been no conflict between their instructions and his proceedings . Jay was at the same time solicited to be Governor of New York . This he declined , and accepted the first named appointment . Jn this situation he soon felt and saw the inefficiency of the old confederation , and he soon after opened a correspondence with Washington and other leading men of the country upon the subject of forming a national government . The Convention soon followed , and a Constitution was proposed . Mr. Jay 's attendance upon Congress as Secretary of Foreign Affairs , prevented his being a delegate to the Convention which formed the Constitution . As soon as the Constiution was formed and proposed to the people , a contest commenced more important , as we have said , than the war of the Revolution , and upon the issue of which more doubt was suspended . Mr. Jay 's efforts to procure the adoption of the Constitution were uninterrupted and efficient , and felt in every State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federalist , and the influence of those Essays , are well known . But in addition to his general efforts for the . benefit of the whole country , which was then vibrating upon the question of adopting the proposed Constitution , Mr. Jay and a few others were relied upon to bring the important State of New York to adopt it . The exertions necessary to this result may be inferred from the fact that when the New York delegates to decide upon the Constitution were elected , eleven were in favor of adopting it , forty-six against it . Hamilton and Jay were among the former , and in the end New York adopted the Constitution by a majority of three . Encountering the prejudices of those who feared that the Constitution confided too much in the people , and those who thought that too much discretion was given to the Government ; of those who deemed it more important that they should be great men , than that their country should be happy , and of those who thought freedom and security in some degree incompatible  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the important event in our history . Mr. Jay 's agency in producing this result alone would be sufficient to establish his claims to the affectionate respect and exalted estimation of his countrymen . Real greatness in a man lies largely in an understanding of truth and duty , and a rigid adherence to them . And the same traits of character which made Mr. Jay devoted to duty , gave him the confidence in man , by which he put trust in a federate republican government-not that confidence which would deify the passions of men , but which saw in man the image of the Diety in spite of them . Mr. Jay used to remark that if men would never forget that the world was under the guidance of a Providence which never erred , it would save much useless anxiety , and prevent a great many mistakes . This trust was the foundation of his faith and success . He never feared or doubted . During the revolution , his difficult negotiations for peace , the confficts upon the Constitution , and the controversy about his Treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result . All his letters , conversation and conduct , indicate a consciousness of having stood by the right , and a confidence that right would prevail . The Federal Constitution being adopted , and Washington elected President , he requested Jay to select the situation in the General Government which he might prefer . This offer could be given to no other man in the country , and it indicates the estimate which a keen discerner of character placed upon Jay . He selected the office of Chief Justice of the United States . He accepted this place rather as the post of duty , than honor . His charac ter was suited to this station . It accords with all our notions of fitness to see such a man in the highest seat of justice . We almost tremble for his purity in the conflict of parties and the intrigues of courts , until he teaches us how to feel and act in them . But we feel that all is safe when he is upon the bench . In this office he effected much in allaying opposition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new system of government . Upon the circuits he was everywhere received with demonstrations of respect and confidence . When he came to Portsmouth to hold his first Court , the citizens , to a large number , gave him a public entry into the town , and when he returned , accompanied him some distance on his way . Jay was now in the second office in grade and importance , the emoluments of which could not be diminished , and which he could hold for life . Yet when men in whom he bad confidence thought that the stability of the General Government required that the rising opposition to it in New York should be checked , and that this could be done by electing him Governor , he at once consented to be a candidate , and was elected by the people . But the office was withheld from him by the canvassers and Legislature . This produced an excitement which endaun ered the repose of the State . Jay interposed and told his supporters to yield to the constituted authorities of the State . He admonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support , by any irregular proceedings , and in asserting their rights to he no less distinguished by temper and moderation , than by constancy and zeal . This line of conduct , so natural in a good man , while it calmed the excitement , deepened the affection for him in the State . lie retained the office of Chief Justice . Though in moderate circumstances about 1792-3-4 he was at the expense of keeping at school six indigent boys of the town of Rye , where he himself had been brought up . This act of benevolence was unknown even to his family till after his death , and was revealed by letters found among his papers from a clergyman who acted as his almoner on that occasion . Another anecdote illustrates in him the vigilance of the magistrate and the kindness of the man . While he was Governor , a blacksmith in his neighborhood erected a house and shop upon the highway , in such a manner as to obstruct the public travel . Jay applied to him , saying , that his official duties would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass unnoticed , and requested the blacksmith to remove the incumbrance . He said he could not , for he had no land . Jay ofliered to give him an acre of land , or fifty dollars to buy land with . These offers failing , Jay wrote to the appropriate law officer to prosecute the black VOL. 11. - NO . VI . 5 smith , and repeated the same offer in favor of the delinquent . When the Court compelled him to move the incumbrance , Jay gave him the land to enable him to obey the order of Court . In 1794 , in consequence of the European wars and the depredations of England upon our commerce , all were expecting , and many desiring war between this country and Great Britain , and an alliance with Revolutionary France . In this , the most trying exigency of Washington 's administration , he determined , in opposition to the wishes of a large portion , if not a majority of the nation , to make one more effort to keep his country out of the strife which was convulsing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting of the Supreme Court of the United States called Chief Justice Jay to Philadelphia , then the seat of Government . He had from the early part of the Revolution been the conjidential adviser and friend of Washington , and the President now requested him to undertake a special mission to England . This was an unwelcome invitation to Jay , and one which he resisted until he saw that to decline it would be to disregard the demands of duty . Writing to Mrs. Jay at this time from Philadelphia , lie says , " There is here a serious determination to send me to England , if possible to avert a war . The object is so interesting to our country , and the combination of circumstances such that find myself in a dilemma , between personal considerations and public ones . " . Writing again to her after his nomination had been made , he says , " This appointment is not of my seeking : on the contrary , I regard it as a measure not to he desired , but to be submitted to . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuance of peace , and in preventing the efflision of blood , and other evils and miseries incident to war , we shall both have occasion to rejoice . Whatever may be the event , the endeavor will he virtuous , and consequently consolatory . Let us repose unlimited trust in our Maker . It-is our business to adore and to obey . " It were a sufficient eulogy of any man to say , that for such a mission , under such circumstances , he was nominated by Washington , opposed by Aaron Burr ; that he saved his country from the devastation of war , and secured her commercial prosperity . It will be recollected that he retained the office of Chief Jun // tice at this time . In consequence of this circumstance , he refused to receive any compansation as Minister to England . Jay never accepted an appointment so reluctantly . But no one but a pure man would have dared to accept such a mission , or could have awaited with his fixed confidence the result in this country . Persuaded that he had secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate judgment of the people , he entered upon the new trusts which awaited him on his return with no fears for the fate of his recent labors . The British Minister whom Mr. Jay met in the negotiation , Lord Grenville , conceived for him a high esteem , and the subsequent correspondence between them exhibits the gratification which they both derived from their joint agency in preserving to their countries the blessings of peace . Conscious that they had both served their respective countries , and the cause of humanity , they could well bear the censure which they did not deserve . With his country at peace , and in security , the clamorous imputations upon Jay , which reached him from every quarter of the country , calmed rather than disturbed him , because he knew them to be emanations from the passions which , under less fortunate circumstances , would have filled his country with the groans of the dying and bereaved , and prostrated its rising greatness . We trust that when ambitious , maddened and short-sighted demagogues shall a am seek , by ag*ravating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and profitless war , there will again be found wise and strong men , in our own and other countries , to avert so great an evil . Mr. Jay returned from Europe in 1795 . Five days before he reached this country he was declared elected Governor of New York . The people of New York , anxious to redress the outra* , e which had been inflicted upon the State by disregarding their clearly expressed voice in his favor on a former occasion , gave him a lar0e majority of their suifrages . His arrival in New York was welcomed by an immense concourse of people and the ringing of bells . He resigned the office of Chief Justice , and accepted that of Governor . He held the office of Governor six years , and although he succeeded a man of opposite politics , who had controlled the appointing power for many years ; and although party feelings ran higher at the beginning of his administration , than at any previous time in the history of the State , Governor Jay never removed an officer on account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office in the spirit of the Constitution , that no effective opposition could be made to him , and he enjoyed a liopular rather than a party support . The only act of his which seems to have excited much censure , was his proclamation recommending " to his fellow citizens throughout the State , to unite in public thanksgiving to that Being through whose Providence the ravages of the yellow fever had been stayed ! " It was upon his suggestion that the penal code of the State was softened , and that the system of employing / convicts in industrial pursuits was adopted . Jay had no fellowship with that expediency which allows a real wrong to avert a probable evil . His business and his aim was to do right . Adherence to principles is comparatively easy , when friends approve , and we see their obvidus connection with right iesults . But when friends falter and desert , when the prospect darkens and power invites to other courses , when there is nothing left but the motives which prompt and reward duty , then the true man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unshaken by the storm which obscured it . There are several incidents in the administration of Gov . Jay , that exhibit him in this lightonly one of which we have space to relate . The Presidential canvass was progressing in 1800 . Jay was known to be one of those who distrusted the party which was opposing the re-election of President Adams . The election had proceeded so far as to indicate the probability that the State of New York would hold the balance of power . The existing Legislature sympathised in opinion with Governor Jay . But it was regarded as quite uncertain if the next Legislature , upon which , in the ordinary mode of procedure , the choice 's of Electors of President would devolve , might not favor the opponent of Mr. Adams . In this state of things Gov . Jay was appealed to , by prominent men of his party , to convene the existing Legislature , for the purpose of securing the appointment of Electors , favorable to the re-election of Mr. Adams , as the only means , as they said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . A distinguished man wrote to him , referring to this request , and urging him to comply with it . After Jay 's death , this letter was found among his papers , with the following memorandum upon it , in his hand wri // ting : " Proposing a measure for party purposes , which 1 think it would not become me to adopt . " Jay through life , was the uncompromising opponent of Slavery . In early life , he was the President of a Manumission Society . For this reason , he was at first opposed for the office of Governor , Slavery at that time existing in New York . For several years , his annual messages urged its abolition . Under his influence , this measure was moved in successive Legislatures . At last , in 1799 , upoa the fourth attempt , the act for that purpose passed both branches of the Legislature by decisive majorities , and no measure of his administration had a more marked and favorable effect upon the morals , happiness , and prosperity of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the close of Gov . Jay 's administration , upon the resignation of Chief Justice Ellsworth , Mr. Jay was again appointed Chief Justice of the United States . President Adams , in a letter , urging him to accept this appointment , as the means of establishinga solid judiciary , remarked " that he had no permission from Mr. Jay to nominate him to this office , but that it appeared to Mr. Adams that Providence had thrown in his way an opportunity , not only of marking to the public the spot where , in his opinion , the greatest mass of worth remained collected in one individual , but of furnishing his country with the best security its inhabitants afforded against the increasing dissolution of morals . " Mr. Adams remarked , upon another occasion , that " he often said that when his confidence in Mr. Jay shall cease , he must give up the cause of confidence , and renounce it with all men . " Mr. Jay was 55 years of age . He had been 27 years with not a day 's interruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having sought one . He was solicited to be re-elected Governor of New York , and to be appointed to the second office in the nation . We find him hesitating , not as to which was the best office for him , but whether , consistently with the claims of the public , he could retire to private life . He examined this question as carefully as he would have examined a judicial question , and endeavored to do it as impartially . After mature deliberation , he decided that his duty did not require him to accept the office of Chief Justice , and it was afterwards , as is fell known , conferred on the late Judge Marshall , of Virginia . He also declined being re-elected Governor of New York , and in 1801 , retired to private life , carrying with Mr. Jay accepted public trusts , as a matter of duty , from the manner in which he filled them . it is equally evident , that he looked upon office in no other light than as the post of duty , from the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important and honorable trusts in the country were offered to him , he declined them . He relinquished public employment , after more than a quarter of a century spent in it , as pure as when he took it . His retirement was a matter of astonishment to those who did not understand the motives and principles which had always governed him . He went from the exciting scenes in which he had been a prominent , successful , and honored actor , to a country residence , at Bedford , about fifty miles from the City of New York , and three miles from the post road , upon which the mail then passed once a week . Upon one of his friends enquiring what he could do in such a place , he replied that he had a long and busy life to look back upon , and an eternity to look forward to . How different must have been the retirement which Jay sought , from that to which Bonaparte was forced soon after . He who in his youth resolutely determined that his " ideas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition , in the decline of life , found about him the same ideas of filial duty , re-produced and exemplified in his children . The ripened fruits of a well-spent life surrounded him . He had no unfinished plans of ambition to regret , no wreck of selfish purposes to mar his retrospect , no neglected duties , no abused powers , no betrayed confidence arose before him , to disturb his repose , and cloud his serene view of the future . Bonaparte , on the contrary , while he was the ruler of half of Europe , was as effectually exiled from those sympathies , affections , and duties which make up the deep course of life and constitute its happiness , as when he was confined on the most solitary rock in the ocean . The master of millions , he was a slave to his own will ; and this made him as much a terror and scourge to himself , as he was to the world . It was whet he was , and not St. Helena which made him an exile . The giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all his power , could no more have " ruled his own spirit , " than // Jay could have " taken a city . " His ambition was more than a match for his genius . His career and its catastrophe , exemplifies , on a splendid scale , the effects simply of selfishness . Jay 's exhibits the tendencies and results of a self-sacrificing spirit . Between such , the world , even , will yet be able to judge . Jay , in his retirement , divided his time between agricultural pursuits , his books , and his friends . Though retired from public life , he did not retire from usefulness . He was connected with several agricultural societies , and President of that in his county . He was zealous in spreading among the Ileople , the various improvements in farming . He also took great interest in the prosperity of the Episcopal Church . He was for many years the President of the American Bible Society , and kept up a correspondence with distinguished men of this country and Europe . All his letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit the power of truth , and the beauty of simplicity , with an unshaken faith in Christianity , and its power over menalways disdaining the selfish , and appealing to the lofty in human life . The attractive trait in Jay 's character , as we have intimated , is the constant ascendancy of duty over self-interest . He had an abiding faith that his responsibility ended with ascertaining and doing what was right , and that it did not end short of this . This shaped his whole life , public and private . His public acts retain the impress of this trait of his character . He christianized politics and diplomacy . He loved his country too well , and served her too truly , to seek to obtain anything for her by artifice . He wished to base her prosperity upon a foundation as pure and firm as that upon which his own fame rests . In public stations , the bearings which this or that line of policy might have upon his personal prospects , were never considered . As President of the Society to manumit slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the Bench , at the Foreign Court , and at his own fire-side , he was always the same man . There were in his nature none of the attractions or the foibles of brilliancy-nothing striking indeed , except its completeness and purity . He was free from the breaks and fragmentary aspects of what the world have agreed to call genius-free from the faults and contradictions of ambitious impulses-free even from the partisan zeal for his country , which would sustain her with equal efforts , whether " right " or " wrong . " Jay was wanting in several of those accessory aids , which have often facilitated the elevation of great men . He was never a " man of party . " In the common acceptation of the word , he had no ambition . Nor had he any enthusiasm . His power lay entirely in the soundness of his principles , and the equal tenor of his life . He trusted to the judgment of the people ; and he developed in the public mind the trait to which he appealed , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a plain manner . He was unaffectedly diffident . His opinions were maintained with a mildness and modesty , which gave a discerning opponent little hope of overcoming or altering them . He spent no money in ostentation , but gave much in charity . His habits and purposes of life were simple , and constantly tended to the same result . It was the simplicity of wisdom , and never exposed him to become the dupe of designing men . He placed little reliance in professors of patriotism , and used to remark , in justitication , that he himself had been reproached for lukewarmness in the cause of American Independence , by men , who in the hour of trial had deserted their country , and sought the protection of their enemies . Though naturally irritable , by careful training , he acquired a self control and equanimity , rarely equalled . He was distrustful of demagogues , and was accustomed to say , that from Absalom down , there had never been an honest one . He enjoyed the society of his children and guests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had borne in public affairs , he rarely spoke , and never in the company of strangers . Jay has frequently been associated and compared in the public mind with Ilamilton . This has happened , to some extent , because there was no one else with whom to compare Mr. Jay , except him who had no equal . There are in their characters points of contrast as well as resemblance . They were alike in their ardent love of country , and in the purity and success with which they served it . They were alike in the confidence which they enjoyed , and the detraction which they encountered . In their views of the Constitution , and in their efforts to secure its adoption ; in support of Washington , and iii the enjoyment of his confidence , they were alike , as they were also in their views of the structure of our Government // and its administrative policy . They were too much alike to be jealous of each other , or to be wanting a proper appreciation of , and respect for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most moral power . To be a statesman was the object of Hamilton 's life . It was an incident in the life of Jay , Hamilton could see at a glance how a nation could and ought to be governed . Jay could also show through a lifetime how a man ought to govern himself . Hamilton lost his life in an attempt to vindicate a fame , which he deemed necessary to his country . Jay would have distrusted the value of that influence which required , or would seek , such support . Hamilton saw and dreaded the dangers to which our Goverment would be exposed , from the passions of the people . Jay , trusting to the meliorating influences of Christianity , hoped when Hamilton feared . The Government , both in its structure and policy , retains the traces of Hamilton 's genius . Our Diplomacy and Judiciary retain the marks of the purity and power of Jay . There was much in the character of the times in which they lived , in the common objects which they sought , and the prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to associate these two great men together in the public mind . The association is fit , and will be lasting . But Jay resembled Washington more than he resembled Hamilton . Hamilton possessed in an eminent degree , those traits which we usually find in distinguished Generals and Statesmen . They were suited to develope and marshal the physical energies and resources of a nation . He , better than any of his contemporaries , could bring order out of confusion , and power out of weakness . How he would have succeeded at the head of the RevolutionaryArmy , when the object was to conquer more by endurance than by concentrated efforts , must be matter of doubt . Jay understood and appreciated the moral energies and capabilities of the people . He knew that a feeble individual , a feeble nation , and a feeble government even , were strong , if they were right . He knew to abuse power was to undermine it  --  to use it aright , was to strengthen it . He knew that the assembling men together into communities or nations did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws of their moral nature ; that a wrong committed in the name , and under the authority of millions , was , for that cause , no less a wrong ; and that as nations can have no hereafter , and thus no punishment in another world , retribution must surely follow their iniquities in this . He cared more , therefore , for the purity of the people , than for the power of the Government . This comparison and contrast is introduced , not for the purpose of depreciating the character of Hamilton , which isable to stand onitso*vn high pedestal , but to illustrate that of Jay . Washington and Jay alike understood , and attempted to give effect to the principle of the Revolution . They knew that this principle , if fully developed , would ultimately make power and right the same thing-that Government had no rights but in its duties , and power had no security , except in its rectitude . When the moral of the Revolution is worked out , and it is now making progress , in spite of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light reflected from it , will show the character of Hamilton , like a splendid fragment of some gigantic structure ; that of Jay as an edifice less imposing in its model , but more perfect in its proportions . The elevation of Jay to high stations , was but incidents in his life , and formed no part of his character . Had he lived in obscurity , he would have been as great a man . Few will reach the high stations which he filled , but all can imitate the single-hearted purity which adorned them . If we examine the frauds , the embezzlements , the trifling with trusts , the disregarding of others ' rights , and all the reckless proceedings which have so recently astounded and degraded the country , and trace this plentiful harvest of briars and thistles back to its seed , they will be found to have originated in an intense selfishness . When this principle grows short-sighted , trampling on the affections we owe to each other , and on the fealty we owe to our country , the most ruinous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great evil ; they are but the outward signs of an inward disease . As volcanic eruptions are the tokens of subterranean fires , these outbreaks and ravages of crime but indicate the intense working of a powerful and evil principle under the whole surface of society . When men lay aside all consideration of morals and religion , as unconnected with the pursuit and use of property , they are seeking and attempting to hold it , inviolation of one of the elements which constitute property . Morals and religion are as essential ele // July , ments of property , as the physical substances of which it consists . When it is so overvalued , that it cankers and corrupts these , its vital elements , it ceases to be property , because it ceases to be secure . It were as reasonable to expect health in a body without blood , as to expect that property can be held in security , when it ceases to be sought in moderation . Every unstrung energy of this great nation has but recently proclaimed this truth . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have buried them and their own integrity in a common ruin . Many of those who were not content with small gains and an easy competency , and the dispensation of its enjoyments and charities , and who sought that happiness in enlarged possessions , which can only be found in moderate desires and cheerful action , like the unfaithful steward , have had even that which they possessed taken from them . The widow and orphan , who had been provided for , by the last affectionate care of dying husbands and fathers  --  the aged and infirm , who had earned some scanty support for the evening of life  --  the industrious and toil-worn , who needed repose , and trusted they had secured it  --  the unprotected woman who had wrought in solitude , to purchase an exemption from dependence in approaching decreptitude-have all been beggared . But the self-adjusting laws of trade are forcing back the restless and misdirected energies to their appropriate channels of industry . These wrecks , and the authors of them , the injured , and those who inflicted the injury , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are disappearing , like the traces of the conflict and the groans of the dying from the field of battle . But what shall calm or purify the volcano of evil principles , which occasioned the wrong ? What laws of trade , what efforts of industry , can repair that moral wreck , which they have made and are making . Forgetting , if we may for a moment , our lofty indignation , at what foreigners say of our national habits and manners-of our refinement , or our want of it-what is to restore our own self-respect ? ourmutual confidence in each other ? What is to give us back that contented integrity , those chastened views of life , that trust in duty performed and guarded honesty , which are as necessary to general prosperity , as those sinews of wealth , which a grasping and cold self-seeking has so recently paralyzed ? The character and conduct of Jay will not be studied in vain by those who are willing to consider these things . In 1826 , the 4th of July being the fiftieth anniversary of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee of the Corporation of the City of New York , addressed a letter to Mr. Jay , then more than eighty years of age , recognizing his high claim to the respect and gratitude of his country , on account of his agency in securing the blessings they then enjoyed , and requested him to be present at the celebration . In his reply , he declined the invitation , on account of age and increasing infirmities , and added : " I can not forbear to embrace the opportunity offered by the present occasion , to express my earnest hope that the peace , happiness , and prosperity , enjoyed by our beloved country , may induce those who direct her national councils , to recommend a general and public return of praise and thanksgiving to Him from whose goodness these blessings descend . The most effectual means of securing a continuance of our civil and religious liberties , is always to remember with reverence and gratitude , the source from which they flow . " In 1828 , on account of continued infirmities , he was unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acting upon the principle that it was not right for him to retain an office , the duties of which he could not well perform , he resigned the Presidency , and accompanied his resignation with a liberal donation to the society . On the evening of the 14th of May , 1829 , he retired to bed in his usual health , and in the course of the night was seized with palsy . He lingered until the 17th of the same month , when he died in the 84th year of his age , and 28 years after his retirement from public life . He had outlived his enemies , if such he could have had , and at the time of his death , there was nothing to jar the general feeling of respect for his character , through the country . It was said of him in an address , soon after his death : " A halo of veneration seemed to encircle him , as one belonging to another world , though lingering in this . When the tidings of his death came to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrow or mourning , but with solemn awe , like that with which we read the mysterious passage of ancient Scripture ; And Enoch walked with God , and was not , or God took him .
