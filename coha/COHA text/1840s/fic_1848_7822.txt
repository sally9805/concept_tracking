Gallagher , William D. ( William Davis ) , 1808-1894 : OH ! THINK NOT LESS I LOVE THEE . from Oh ! think not less I love thee ( 1848 ) Oh ! think not less I love thee , That our paths are parted now  --  For the stars that burn above thee Are not truer than my vow . As the fragrance to the blossom , As the moon unto the night , Our love is to my bosom  --  Its sweetness and its light . Oh , think not less I love thee , That thy hand I thus resign  --  In the heaven that bends above thee , I will claim thee yet as mine . Through the vision of life 's morning , Ever flitted one like thee  --  And thou life 's lapse adorning , Shall hence that vision be .
