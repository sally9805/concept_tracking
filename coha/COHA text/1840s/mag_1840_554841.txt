txt THE extended report contained in the volume , of which the title is prefixed to this article , is the first-fruits of the most munificent literary endowment , originating in individual liberality , which has ever occurred in this country . Indeed , the annals of scholastic foundations in Europe present few instances of equal magnitude , and assuredly not more than two or three which are greater . The name of Stephen Girard has taken a place in the same category with those of // Sir Thomas Gresbam , of Thomas Sutton , and of C eorge Heriot . A curious illustration of the practical operation of our political system , - its influence upon individual enterprise and feeling , - might be traced in the history of the accumulation of a fortune like that amassed by Mr. Girard , and its final appropriation to a plan of purely popular beneficence . A foreigner comes penniless to our shores . The liberal policy of the law and of public opinion receives him into the community . Barely acquainted with the language of the country , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a word , without any means external to himself , he seeks , and without difficulty finds , in an humble line of life , an opening for his industry . The lone man makes himself useftil , and with his usefulness come connexions in business . The field of his labor becomes enlarged and more elevated . The genius for traffic , with which some men are endowed , enables him at every advance to find a firmer footing , and to plant himself more securely . For a time , one of the crew of some of the small craft that ply on a river , he gradually raises himself to some authority on board of a coasting vessel . He relinquishes the vocation of a mariner , and , with his small earnings and savings , stocks a small shop . In a few years he is in a state of transition to the condition of a merchant . Traffic , that scarce ventured beyond the hail of the voice , or the range of a good spyglass , has learned a bolder venture , and begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove successful , or , to speak more accurately , there is in them wisdom and foresight , the compound of boldness and prudence , which makes a merchant 's might . The man , whose trading began in small channels , has gained a standing in the centre of a commercial metropolis . A new department for his skill and enterprise is found , and the successful merchant becomes also the thrifty and prosperous banker ; and thus his wealth , never lying idle , is magnified in a ratio almost exceeding calculation . Such is a hasty sketch of the formation of Stephen Girard 's estate , - the earnings of individual effort , with poverty for a starting-point . He came to this country from France , it is said , as a cabin boy . He was a fresh-water sailor on the river Delaware , and subsequently , as he mentions in his will , he traded to New Orleans , in the first instance , as " first // officer " of the vessel , and afterwards , as " master and partowner . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " mariner and merchant . " He went into commercial business , in a small way , as a grocer . A few years more made him a shipping merchant , and he was for a considerable time the largest ship-owner in the port of Philadelphia . When he became a capitalist , he sought the growing gains of a shrewd and cautious banker , and soon was strong enough to purchase , for his own use of private banking , the building which had been erected and was used as the banking-house of the nation during the continuance of the charter of the first bank of the United States . The accumulation of money was with Girard the one great aim of life , pursued with an unremitting and unwearying assiduity . He was a man , who , having been separated in early life from his kindred , suffered the ties of consanguinity to hang but loosely on him . His habits of living were simple , or rather austere and parsimonious . His sole recreation , and that was recreation mingled with thrift , was rural occupation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which for many years he daily retired , after the business of his banking-house closed . He was a man of close counsels . The work of his life may literally be said to have been achieved by himself alone . No sorcerer ever environed himself with a magic circle more impenetrable , a line to be crossed only at the risk of his displeasure . His temperament was unsocial . There was a wide , and , we may add , a dreary space , between him and his kindred , his connexions , his assistants in business , his fellowlaborers , not companions , in the counting-room and the banking-house , and his fellow-citizens generally . During life , his name was not associated with plans of beneficence . Charity was timid in approaching to solicit a bounty . He was a solitary-hearted being , and his fellow-creatures knew not the avenues to his feelings . When the credit of the national government was depressed during the late war with Great Britain , Girard was one of the capitalists who replenished the treasury of the country from their private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own State by advances , when the work was in danger of standing still , and other men were afraid or unable to give assistance . But , in these cases , the impulse was the foresight of a safe deposit and an increased return , the instinct of investment . // In short , Stephen Girard was such a man , as , had his lot been cast , like that of the London banker , Thomas Sutt*n , the founder of the Charter House , in the same age and in the same community with Ben Jonson , would have furnished a better mark for the dramatist 's satire . If the acquisition of so large an estate by such a man as Girard is any illustration of the political system under which he lived , and which , placing no impediments in his way , gave abundant security to his possession , still more is its ultimate appropriation an evidence of the influence of popular spirit . The laborious earnings of a long , and , in a certain way , self-denying life , were destined , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wealth , but to be diffused amidst the people , for the promotion of the people 's best interests . The idea is not to be entertained for a moment , that there can be any adequate substitute when there is a seclusion from the natural social affections ; because undoubtedly the happiness of mankind is best advanced by the cultivation of kindly emotions , the sympathies of blood and other impulses of nature , which are unwisely sacrificed to any scheme of beneficence , no matter how plausible . Yet there is something redeeming for a career of close-handed money-making , of avarice , denying alike indulgence to self and liberality to others , when the fact comes to light , that all this course of living has had a purpose beyond what the world could see , the blind and heart-chilling lust that gloats over the swelling coffer . It is some justification of a life like Girard 's , that all his labors had a destination into which no selfish principle entered . The city of his adoption , where his money had been earned , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accumulated wealth of years was to be poured . With the exception of comparatively a few legacies , the bulk of his estate , amounting to some six millions of dollars , was bequeathed to the city of Philadelphia , as a trustee to fulfil certain designs , which he supposed best calculated to promote her permanent interests . The final appropriation of Mr. Girard 's property was , during his life , a mystery fruitful of conjectures and speculations ; and when death broke the seal of it , there was amazement in finding , that be had been maturing , in the solitary counsels of his own mind , a great scheme of education . With no pretensions to any acquirements of science or literature , and successful in a worldly way beyond competition without // them , some secret sympathy with the helplessness of ignorance had touched him . Perhaps , when his thoughts were reposing in security upon his millions , some recollection of hours of desolation and friendlessness and anguish in his early days rose among them , and from the recollection sprang the conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the master idea which controlled him . " I have been for a long time , " ( such is the language of his will , ) " impressed with the importance of educating the poor , and of placing them , by the early cultivation of their minds , and the developement of their moral principles , above the many temptations , to which through poverty and ignorance they are exposed ; and I am particularly desirous to provide , for such a number of poor , male , white , orphan children , as can be trained in one institution , a better education , as well as a more comfortable maintenance , than they usually receive from the application of the public funds . " It mitigates the harshness of Mr. Girard 's character , to reflect that he was , as it were , administering his estate so that the sphere of his bounty might be enlarged in proportion to its increase . The dark shades of his parsimony assume a brighter hue , when it is regarded as the stern integrity of a trustee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is husbanding for the good of those whose interests are committed to him . The short extract from Mr. Girard 's will , which we have given above , states the general design of his endowment , to the accomplishment of which , he bequeathed two millions of dollars , with an additional provision , that if the number of orphans applying for admission shall make that sum inadequate to meet their wants , a large residuary fund shall also be appropriated . It may well be questioned whether Mr. Girard displayed his wonted sagacity or shrewdness , when he delegated a trust of this kind to a city corporation , exposed to the frequent fluctuations of party politics , and thereby involving the institution , to which he was solicitous to give permanence and stability , in the jeopardy of changes brought about by the operation of causes entirely extrinsic . The heated atmosphere of party politics has , in this country , become very penetrating , and the time may come when it will be difficult to exclude it from that region in which a different temperature should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of King James the First , devised his estate for the founding of a " hospital , " for the education of " the poor fatherless boyes " of Edinburgh , he had the wisdom to commit to men , whom , modestly , he deemed more competent than himself , the digestion of a plan and accordingly one of his executors , the Rev. Dr. Balcanquall , was intrusted with the responsible duty of drawing up the statutes for the organization and government of the institution , and even of deciding upon the plan of the building . Mr. Girard 's course was a different , and , we apprehend , a less sagacious one . His will presents a remarkable elaboration of directions respecting the edifice for the habitation and use of the orphans , which , it might readily have been anticipated , would be attended with practical difficulties and embarrassrnent . An architectural passion seems to have been predominant in the testator 's mind , and , yielding to it , he has prescribed dimensions , materials , internal arrangements , a marble roof , the staircases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the rise , " and so many " in the tread , " and a hundred such details , the combination of which , in execution , we can well conceive to have been in no small degree perplexing , and perhaps in some particulars impracticable . It is curious , too , to observe how his notions of architectural beauty and propriety seemed to centre round his familiar and favorite places of resort , and his disposition to prescribe them as models of imitation ; " The windows of the second and third stories , I recommend to be made in the style of those in the first and second stories of my present dwellinghouse , . TVorth Water street , on the eastern front thereof ; and outside each window I recommend , that a substantial and neat iron balcony be placed , &amp;c. &amp;c. , as is the case in the lower story of my house at my place in Pass yank township . " Again ; " At each place of entrance there shall be two gates , one opening inward , and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the style of the gates north and south of my banking-house , " &amp;c. &amp;c . We have referred to these matters , because to them , we believe , is ascribed the unlooked-for delay in organizing the institution . A professional interpretation of the terms of the will , does not sanction an opening of the College for the re // ception of the orphans until the buildings are completed . In 1833 , the corner-stone of the main building , a structure of gigantic dimensions and of rich Corinthian style , was laid in the immediate neighhourhood of the city of Philadelphia ; and , though the work has been prosecuted with all the rapidity compatible with its durability and the supply of marble from various quarries of the land , it is understood that the completion can not he looked for in less than four years more . The preparatory measure of electing a President , and delegating him to visit Europe for the purpose of making a thorough examination of the institutions of education in the principal countries , has produced the valuable work now before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , President Bache 's mission may be regarded as possessing an interest not secondary to any mission of diplomacy . The nature of the duties confided to him will appear more clearly from the general instructions contained in the letter addressed to him , by the President of the Board of Trustees of the Girard College , Mr. Nicholas Biddle . rrhe Board of Trustees are charged by the city of Philadelphia to prepare a system of instruction for the Girard College for Orphans . For this purpose , they are anxious to have the most accurate information of the best means used for the same purpose elsewhere , and you have been selected to obtain it . Your object , then , is to visit all establishments in Europe similar to the Girard College ; and , as these are found principally , if not exclusively , in England , Scotland , Ireland , France , Belgium , Holland , Switzerland , Italy , Austria , Prussia , and the rest of the states of Germany , these countries will form the natural limits of your tour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gimard College , or any others which promise to afford useful information in organizing it , you will see and examine . Your own reflection will readily suggest the points of informatioa desired ; and I will , therefore , merely enumerate a few , which may serve as a basis for your own extensive investigation . Of every establishment visited by you , we should wish to know , - 1 . Its history , general administration , and the nature and extent of its funds . 2 . Its interior organization and government ; the names , titles , and duties of all the persons employed in it . 3 . Who are admitted to it , and the forms and terms of admission ; and , where it is professedly for the education of orphans , who are considered as orphans . // 4 . The number and classification of the scholars , and their term of residence . 5 . Their course of studies , in the minutest detail , from the commencement to the end of their residence in the institution , with the text-books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that course , specially important to the Girard College , we should desire to know the regulations or the practice by which , among a large body of scholars , a portion , after continuing for some time in the institution , are permitted to begin their active career in life , - while others , with greater aptitude or greater willingness to learn , are carried up to the higher branches of education . The nature and the mode of that discrimination would be highly interesting , - as would also be , 7 . The precise extent to which moral and religious instruction is proposed to be given , and is actually given , and also by whom and in what form that instruction is conveyed . 8 . The mechanical arts taught , - the mode of teaching them , - the models , tools , and implements of all kinds employed , - and the manner in which the practice of these arts is mingled with the routine of studies . 9 . The system of rewards and punishments in regard to studies or personal conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . ii . The amusements , - gymnastic exercises , - games of all kinds , uniting instruction with agreeable relaxation , - together with the number and extent of the vacations , pecuniary allowance , or personal indulgences , to the scholars . 12 . The diet and clothing of the scholars . 13 . The regulations in regard to health , hours of study and of rest , arrangement as to sleeping and eating , and the whole routine of each day 's employment . 14 . The expenses of the school , including salaries and all incidents , with the average annual expense of each scholar . 15 . The structure of the buildings , the arrangement of dormitories , refectories , playgrounds , and workshops , illustrated by drawings , where they can be procured . 16 . As a proper foundation for similar statistical inquiries in this country , you will collect all the information you can in respect to the proportion of orphans to the rest of the community . " - pp. iv-vi . This was a large field to operate in ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toil , and patience , a powerful and practised observation , and a well disciplined judgment . It was well concluded by Professor Bache , that the limited purpose of the Girard College , - an eleemosynary // institution for the education and care of orphans , - did not preclude the necessity of making an examination of the general establishments of education as well as those more closely resembling it . The chief general value of the Report is founded on the information it furnishes respecting European education , and the actual processes in a great variety of institutions . At the same time , it is due to the author to bear in mind , that his researches , and the report of them , were meant to have a bearing upon one specific object . The compilation of a report from materials so abundant as those collected by Professor Bache , in a tour extended through two years of unintermitted application , must needs , from that very abundance , have been a process of considerable difficulty . A report will often lose much of its value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the opinions of the reporter are suffered to supersede the statements of facts on which those opinions are grounded . On the other band a report may dwindle into a lifeless detail , a spiritless enumeration of particulars , - unless the mind of the reporter shall have a kind of mastery of the whole ground , guiding and controlling the whole subject by inductions and generalizations , instead of limiting itself to a barren process of mere observation . The aim of a report must be , to keep in their true proportions the writer 's general conclusions and the presentation of facts to furnish a test of their accuracy . We find , that Professor Bache 's tour included visits to nearly three hundred schools and institutions of education in Great Britain , France , Switzerland , Holland , Belgium , Austria , Prussia , and the other states of Germany , - constituting the most elaborate mission of the kind ever undertaken . How much of unprofitable and thankless toil must of necessity have been involved in such an examination it is easy to conjecture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refrained from the ungrateful task of recording the numerous failures and mistakes in the work of education , which came under his observation , unless a reference to them was necessary to illustrate some principle , either positively or negatively . His method of presenting the results of his labors appears to us to be the most judicious that could have been adopted , both in reference to an immediate application to the wants of the Girard College , and for its general bearing on the cause of education . A more imposing and osten // tatious plan might have been devised , which would have given greater prominence to the writer 's opinions and theories of education , than the descriptive form admits . " As best calculated to present the impressions of the actual results of education , I have adopted the descriptive form for my Report , and have purposely avoided summing up the conclusions , or presenting a review of them , separately from the facts , that the force of the opinions may not be weakened by appearing out of this connexion . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inductions from numerous facts , and not inferences from single instances ; but these instances serve as their best illustration , if not sufficient , taken singly , to prove that they are just . These remarks suggested themselves at first as queries to be answered by further observation . " - pp. 9 , 10 . This seems to us to be the true philosophical method of dealing with a subject , very modestly stated . The remark suggesting itself at first as a query , is the first act of the mind in its process of induction ; the prudens interrogatio , which has wisely been pronounced the dirnidiurn scientiw ; the questioning , which , so long as it is kept from passing too hastily from interrogation , and thus being converted into dogma , is indeed an anticipation of truth . We are disposed to advert to this matter , because the work before us will , in all probability , have the weight of authority on questions connected with education ; and it is essential in ascertaining its title to authority , to observe the spirit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the execution of his responsible trust an experience in practical education , acquired as a Professor in the University of Pennsylvania but more than this , he brought what was far more valuable than experience , a perfect fairness of mind on the subject he was to deal with . It is impossible to peruse the volume without being struck with the candor , which is its pervading characteristic ; the entire freedom from bias , either of preposession or of prejudice ; the openness of mind to conviction , the want of which too often makes the business of observation itself absolutely futile . Men are much too apt to set out in their investigations with preconceived notions , - with their minds made up , or with such a leaning as amounts to the same thing ; and the consequence inevitably is , that truth must somehow or other ( to borrow a phrase of Shak // speare 's ) be " buckled within the belt of their rule " ; and hence it happens , that she is so often seen sorely girded in the cincture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Bache systematically through the Report , or to scrutinize his opinhions on various principles of education , scattered through it as the results of his investigations and of subsequent reflection . Such an attempt would not only exceed our hounds , but would be an injurious substitute for the accurate statement of his views in connexion with an abundant collection of facts . Our intention is , simply , to give a cursory account of the volume ( which , from its mode of publication , may not be very generally circulated ) , its contents , and the general tone of the author , with a quotation of some passages which have chanced to arrest our attention , rather than any disquisition of our own upon the much discussed subject of education . The general arrangement is thus stated This Report will be divided into two parts , the first relating to the means provided for the education of orphans , the second to the systems of general education . Corresponding to these divisions , there are two groups of institutions which present , in general , different objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline , and domestic economy , as well as the instruction , are to be examined ; while in the second , the instruction is the chief point of interest . Every mdi-. vidual institution in the first group should furnish moral , intellectual , and physical education ; many in the second are necessarily more limited in their design . " - p. 10 . The Report opens with an interesting account of the " Hospital* ' for orphans , founded in Edinburgh by the wellknown George Heriot , rather more than two centuries ago . In his description of the life of the " Heriot 's boys , " we soon find an opportunity of becoming acquainted with Professor Bache 's opinions and feelings on the subject of discipline . The excellent religious instruction and training are represented as operating powerfully on the general deportment of the youthful inmates of the establishment , and also on their subsequent career in active life . An erroneous regulation respecting punishment suggests some remarks on the general subject of discipline , which appear to us to be conceived in the true spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrading kinds of corporal punishment shall be as seldom as possible resorted to , ' and yet counteract the good effect of this provision by directing , that they shall not be inflicted in the private classes , but only in what is called " the public school , " in presence of the house-governor , ' thus rendering the degradation most certain by the publicity of the punishment . it is true , these chastisements are rarely inflicted , and the regulations provide , that they shall not be resorted to for mere literary negligence , if unaccompanied by moral blame . ' The house-governor has great latitude in regard to the character of the l ) unishments , and I am sure exercises a sound discretion in reference to them . " There can be no doubt , that it is more dangerous to blunt the sensibilities of a youth to moral reproog than to harden him by corporal chastisement . Hence such chastisements maybe preferable , in certain cases where reproof has failed , to a continuance of the attempt to correct by admonition . This supposes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a last resort . Some dispositions are better acted upon by the deprivation of indulgences by confinement , and similar penalties of this class , where remonstrances have failed ; while others require something more immediate in its action . In many schools in England , where the rod was once freely used , it has been almost , and in others entirely , laid aside . In schools like these , where the youth is entirely dependent upon the institution , I am fully persuaded , that , with proper treatinent , it need be resorted to very seldom , if at all . Pew dispositions are not open to kindness , especially under these circumstances , and no master has the qualities appropriate to such an institution , who prefers the repulsive system to the encouraging . I refer to the example of the English schools , because they have held out longest against the modern improvements in discipline , and their relinquishment of such means is a stronger argument than could be derived from the more gentle discipline of the continent . The spirit of kindness between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continental schools , the confidence that renders him , as it were , the head of a family circle , are delightful to witness , and insure , better than stripes , the obedience of his pupils . I believe that this species of discipline , which leads the pupil instead of driving him , may be considered as particularly congenial to the American character . The governors of Heriot 's say , that it is earnestly recommended , that as far as possible , prevention of faults be employed ; and that gentle treatment be practised with the children . ' Thus , as far as their recoinrnendation // goes , they are on the side where I should prefer to range myself . " - pp. 27 , 28 . The same sound judgment and kindly feeling are observable , wherever matters of discipline are referred to in the Report . The subject is an important and a difficult one . Its interest and its perplexities will endure , so long as pupils have the traits of youth , its follies and fickleness , its irregularity and immaturity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equalling the meekness of the saints . Discipline is a thing not to be described . It is not severity , with which it is often confounded ; nor is it weak indulgence , which not unfrequently is made the substitute . A change has taken place in public opinion , since the times when the one thing needful was heating . There is a growing tendency , in which we rejoice , to dispense to the utmost possible degree with corporal chastisement . It is a reformation , of which the ej ) och may be computed from the day of that dinner* party at which Cecil entertained the Counsellors of Queen Elizabeth , and with them that gentle-spirited old scholar , Roger Ascham , the court and the attendants of the monarch having retired to Windsor during the prevalence of the plague in London , in the year 1563 . The table-talk took its impulse from the mention of the seemingly unimportant circumstance of some boys having run away from Eton school , for fear of the unmerciful flagellations . The seventies practised at the great schools in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were men of a severe nature , and reprobated by others of a milder disposition , Ascham himself favoring the birch-breakers . There was one of the company , Sir Richard Sackville , the father of Sackville , Lord Buckhurst , the author of the finest poem in the English language between Chaucer and Spenser , who spake not a word ; but soon afterwards , calling Ascham aside , told him his own sad experience of his school-day sufferings , and begged him to commit to writing his views of the good bringing up of children . To this suggestion , prompted by the chance conversation of a company of statesmen and scholars , in a moment of relaxation from the cares of an anxious reign , we are indebted for that excellent and pleasant book , " The Scholemaster , by Roger Ascham , Preceptor to Queen Elizabeth . " We have turned to it , in connexion with the subject of discipline , chiefly for the sake of one // genial passage , in which he describes , very pathetically , the injury that may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-witted child . " - " A child that is still , silent , constant , and somewhat hard of wit , when he cometh to the school , is smally regarded , little looked unto ; he lacketh teaching , he lacketh encouragement , he lacketh all things ; only he never lacketh beating , nor any word that may move him to hate learning , nor any deed , that may drive him from learning to any other kind of living . " Another old worthy , of somewhat later date , that wise and witty divine , Thomas Fuller , has entered his appeal too against the unsparing and indiscriminate use of the rod , in his portraiture of " the good schoolmaster . " " There are scholars , who are ingenious and industrious . To such a frown may be a whipping , and a whipping a death ; yea , where their master whips them once , shame whips them all the week after . - There are scholars that are ingenious and idle . These think , with the hare in the fable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their school-fellows ) they shall come soon enough to the post , though sleeping a good while before their starting . Oh ! a good rod would finely take them napping. - There are those that are dull and diligent . Their dulness is to be borne with , if they be diligent . That schoolmaster deserves to be beaten himself , who beats Nature in a boy for a fault . And I question whether all the whipping in the world can make their parts , which are naturally sluggish , rise one minute before the hour Nature bath appointed . - There are those that are invincihly dull and negligent also . Correction may reform the latter , not amend the former ; all the whetting in the world can never set a razor 's edge on that which bath no steel in it . Such hoys the good schoolmaster consigneth over to other professions . Shipwrights and boatmakers will choose those crooked pieces of timber , which other carpenters refuse . ' * An excess of corporal chastisement was an abuse in the olden time , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if there were no other proof of it . The children of later times enjoy a better heritage . But the comparative disuse of the rod and other implements of bodily infliction , does not insure an exemption from other violations of true discipline . When one error goes out or is driven out , the door is very often left open for another to // walk in . It was a deep reproach against the system of the late Joseph Lancaster , that , while it professed an extraordinary clemency in ahrogating the discipline of corporal punishinent , it resorted to a species of more refined cruelty , substituting insults and ridicule , and making scorn and mockery principles of education . It must never be forgotten , that the heart of childhood is as tender as its body , and that blows may be struck , which will give a wound deeper and harder to heal than those of the birch or the ferule . There may be wanton cruelty in each of these methods , alike injudicious and injurious . But opposite to all this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we apprehend , often more wisdom in the style of driving horses than of governing children . It is the sign of a skilful driver not to use the whip frequently , not to hold a slack rein at one minute , and a tight rein at another ; the animal is fretted and fatigued hy an unsteady hand as well as hy an unsparing lash . It is a well-established fact , that the two kinds of teachers who are most obnoxious to their pupils , are those who punish with severity , and those who indulge with imbecility ; the latter , strange as it may seem , are probably the least liked of the two . Discipline is preventive rather than corrective ; its cardinal properties are foresight , firmness , gentleness , and justice . The best definition of it we remember to have met with , is in one of those aphoristic sentences , sometimes so happily framed by the late Mr. Coleridge . " Discipline , " we quote the words from memory , " is the max*-mum of watchfulness , with the minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of true discipline . It is much easier to be capricious and fitful , passionate and tyrannical , than to govern with the gentleness and dignity of decision ; and it is a vulgar and shallow error to suppose , that a sound disciplinarian is arrayed with terrors . The discipline , over which , in that familiar passage in the " Task , " Cowper pronounced his fine lament , was a personification of no such power ; " His eye was meek and gentle , and a smile Played on his lips , and in his speech was heard Paternal sweetness , dignity , and love . The occupation dearest to his heart Was to encourage goodness . He would stroke The head of modest and ingenuous worth That hlushed at its own praise , and press the youth Close to his side that pleased him . " // We have been led on to say more on this subject than we at first intended , from finding , in various places in the Report , opinions on the mode of governing youth , which have our most hearty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Liverpool Blue-Coat School is indicated by the author as affording one of the best examples he met with , to illustrate the results of the system of mutual instruction introduced by iDr . Bell , generally styled " the Madras system . " " I found all the intelligent persons connected with this institution so thoroughly convinced of the efficacy of the monitonal system , that I paused in drawing conclusions in regard to it , until I had compared this school with others upon the same or a similar system ; it is , however , one of the best examples which I saw of the Bell or Madras system , or , rather , of a modified form of it . The gentlemen above referred to are convinced , that the pupil-teachers are not only competent to give instruction , hut that they frequently communicate it in a more intelligible form than teachers who are further removed by age and knowledge from the boys ; that the emulation among the pupil-teachers of different classes induces their pupils to exert themselves more than if under the charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and impartial in administering the rules of discipline and instruction . I state these opinions broadly , not wishing to conceal that the views of others , who have experience in the matter , are adverse to my own . I observed as closely as my opportunities would permit , here and elsewhere , and came to the conclusion that , in communicating knowledge not merely mechanical , the pupil-teachers are generally at fault , that they fail to keep up the attention of the pupils , and to preserve order among them , except in presence of the master , and that they do not always deal impartially in administering the rules . It is true , that if a class of ninety is to be confided to one master , monitors may be usefully employed to prepare the pupils for him . A similar plan is pursued at the best school on the Bell system which I have seen , the 1*vIiadras College at St. Andrew 's , Scotland . Further than this , I do not believe that monitors can be usefully employed , and , *where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wanting , I would not at all recommend the use of the monitorial system in imparting instruction . " - pp. bl , 52 . The very useful exercise in the Madras system , in which // the pupils question each other , is well carried out in this school ; every boy thus must ask as well as answer questions . It , however , offers considerable practical difficulty . Some hold back from diffidence , others from fear of showing ignorance by their questions , and others are incompetent to it horn ignorance of the subjects . " - p. 53 . We are not surprised to find , that Professor Bache 's observations led him to a conclusion adverse to the artificial systems of gymnastics , which were so much in fashion throughout this country a few years since .

The chapter on Eleemosynary Institutions of Education contains a full and interesting account of that antiquated though admirable establishment , the famous Blue-Coat School of London , the " Christ 's Hospital . " It is an enduring monument to the memory of its founder , " that godly and royal child , King Edward the Sixth , the boy-patron of boys , the serious and holy child , who walked with Cranmer and Iidley , " as he has been eulogized by one who enjoyed the charity , or , as he has been styled in loftier strain , " King , child , and seraph . " Various orphan schools , and other institutions for the education of destitute children , on the continent , are also described . A censure is passed upon a practice observed in one of these , in Holland , of having one of the pupils to read aloud from the Bible during meals . We have some recollection of having heard of such a usage in some institution in this country , and therefore advert to it . The custom is exceptionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the reading is heeded by the eaters , it is unhealthful ; and , if not , there is irreverence . The second and remaining part of the Report is devoted to " Education in General , " the materials being here arranged with reference to the four departments of Infant , Elementary or Primary , Secondary , and Superior Instruction . The plan of this portion of the work is stated as follows . CC After brief notices of certain infant schools , elementary instruction is considered under two heads ; the first , embracing the schools for general purposes , the second , those intended // for special training , as for the education of a rural or industrial population , and of teachers for the elementary schools . Under the former head xviii be given a notice of the provisions for elementary instruction in Great Britain ; a notice of the primary public instruction in France ; a more particular description of the primary system of Holland , and of some schools which illustrate its application ; a history and general sketch of the Prussian system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a notice of the system of primary instruction in Saxony , and of some of the schools , and an account of the method applied in the schools of Bayreuth , in Bavaria . The second division of primary instruction will comprehend descriptions of certain rural schools of Switzerland and Great Britain , an industrial primary school of France , and of some of the schools for primary teachers in Prussia , France , Holland , and Switzerland . " Passing to the head of secondary instruction , the Report will include descriptions and notices of schools in Great Britain , France , Prussia , and Saxony ; each chapter being devoted to a separate country , and preceded by general introductory remarks . Under the division of Superior Instruction will be given descriptions of some special schools for the arts , manufactures , and commerce of France , Prussia , and Austria , and the higher agricultural school of Wirtemburg , besides brief notices of a few other similar institutions .

Its contents must be carefully examined by those who are concerned in the great work of education . To them we desire to commend Professor Bache 's Report , for the sake of the information and the opinions it contains respecting what is truly and comprehensively to be considered as k*ducation , - not the mere conveying of information , more properly called tuition , nor intellectual training , but the process of forming the character of the whole man , physical , intellectual , and moral . We can not , however , turn from the volume , without adverting , in a somewhat desultory way , to a few matters we are desirous of noticing . The chapter upon Infant-School Systems manifests , what we are glad to find , a strong sense , on the part of the author , of the one great danger , the temptation to the overtasking of the feeble powers of infancy . // Too much can not be said on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system , it demands perpetual vigilance to prevent it from becoming absurd , and , worse than absurd , cruel and pernicious . Oberlin 's benevolent conception may , by an ill-judged metamorphosis , be perverted into an engine of torture . We must confess , that we continue to have a little more confidence in Nature than in Mr. Wilderspin , with all his devices for infant training . " The necessity for the existence of such schools must vary much in different countries , and hence their not being adopted in all is no argument against the general principle of infant education . The want of such schools is most felt in a dense and manufacturing population ; least , in a scattered and agricultural one . Independently of essentially different degrees of usefulness , under different circumstances , various prejudices have concurred to prevent the introduction of these schools into some countries . Certain governments , as those of Germany in general , have not lent their influence to them and the clergy have , in some parts of Europe , been as warmly opposed to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deformed models which have been transplanted from England to other countries , have tended in many cases to foster these prejudices . In some of these the intellectual developemerit of the pupils has been attempted to be carried on to their manifest injury , physically and mentally . In others , a mere mechanical and lifeless routine has been followed . The infant schools which I saw at Paris , called 6coles d'asile , ' seem to me to educate upon wrong principles , having adopted the mechanical arrangements of the English infant schools , without having seized their spirit . I believe , that depriving them of the female superintendence which they formerly enjoyed , to make them a part of the government system , will react further very injuriously upon them . " - p. 1&amp;8 . The description of a juvenile training school , at Glasgow , contains the following passage , on a subject of considerable public interest . The play-ground or uncovered school-room , ' is considered the place in which moral training is to be accomplished , where the principles taught in the school may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Accordingly , the play-ground is not merely fitted up with the means of exercise , but is planted , in part , with flowers and fruit , accessible to all , but which are to be enjoyed under the injunction , Smell , see , but touch not . ' It has been , and is , in part , to this day , the reproach // of England and the United States , that public property is always injured ; that flowers can not bloom , nor fruit ripen , unless when enclosed ; and in France , which is considered as offering an exception to this barbarous practice , I fear that the result is produced rather by the certainty of detection and punishment , than by the influence of a higher motive . Education is the true source of relief from this reproach ; if the child be trained to respect what belongs to the public , the man will never injure it . Such views have been decried as visionary , and the idea that a child could be so trained has been scouted . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little in advance of the times , and their training system has succeeded , and its principles will finally he so generally adopted , that to doubt them will be as remarkable as the idea itself originally appeared . In this particular school , upwards of one hundred and eighty scholars , from the manufacturing classes of Glasgow , have been in the habit of using the playground for more than an hour and a quarter every day for two years and a half , without damage to the flowers or fruits which it contains . Great attention is paid to neatness in the playground , that the habits inculcated in the school may be carried out here . It affords , also , opportunities of exemplifying lessons on cruelty to animals , on truth , justice , kindness , and other virtues . The means of healthy exercise are given by the more siniple kinds of gymnastics , one of the most popular and excellent of which is the circular swing . Wooden prisms are furnished for building , and the more ordinary games of ball , &amp;c. , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a full display of character , which , when observed , and rightly managed , leads to the same system employed by a judicious parent at home , with the advantage of better opportunities of judging of the points of character which require developing or repressing , from the influence of numbers in making these points more prominent . " - pp. 187 , 183 . A full account is given of the system of education in Prussia , which has attracted so much attention from its highly advanced condition . A very general misapprehension , which prevails respecting the system , is corrected by Professor Bache in a way that is conclusive . The notion has obtained currency , that the Prussian system is of comparatively recent date , or that it has been , within twenty years , moulded into its present form . This notion is traced to a hasty and erroneous assumption by Cousin , in his celebrated Report on Public instruction in Prussia . The more careful examination of the whole subject by our countryman , conducted more by direct // personal observation , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the system is the result of a long experience , modified and enlarged from time to time , according to the actual results , and the well-ascertained requisitions of the nation . A chapter is devoted to the seminaries for the education of teachers , generally called " Normal Schools . " As it is a subject , which must demand attention with the increase of common schools in this country , we add , in closing this cursory notice of Professor Bache 's Report , a portion of his introductory observations on these establishments . " Originating in Germany , they have been gradually improved there , and brought into their present condition , and have spread into Holland , France , Switzerland , and , more recently , into England , being modified only so far as to adapt them to the circumstances of society and education in these several countries . " The most imperfect arrangement for providing teachers is that whiTh requires an examination into merely the knowledge of the candidates in the branches required to be taught . This is specially imperfect in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in amount , and where the art of teaching finds its most difficult exercise . The erroneous notion , th t an individual can teach whatever he knows , is now generally abandoned , and in those countries which still adhere to the old method , of depending solely upon examinations for securing competent teachers , examination is made not only of the acquirements of a candidate , but of his ability to give instruction . I have called this the most imperfect method , because the mere employment of a teacher , without examination or personal knowledge of his powers , which still occurs in countries where education is neglected , does not deserve to be mentioned in a discussion of the more enlightened national systems . ccrrhe most obvious method of acquiring practice in the art of teaching is by serving in the lower departments of a school , under the eye and direction of an experienced teacher . Accompanied by private study , founded on previous knowledge , and by private lessons , this method may form excellent teachers of those who have particular aptitude for the profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be admitted to have a tendency to produce a routine system in teaching . The pupil-teacher imitates the methods of those with whom he is associated , and which are placed before him as models , // without examining their principles , or discriminating between their merits and defects . He places great stress upon peculiar modes of instruction in particular branches , and when they do not succeed , attributes the fault neither to the methods nor to himself but to the pupil . The habits of observation and reflection , which enable him to profit by experience , are not developed by this method , and thus , though he may consider experience as a merit , it may produce none of its appropriate results in his case . Accordingly , wherever this mode of preparing teachers has been adopted as a system , as in Holland , or has been incidental to the method of examinations , as in Saxony , it has not stood the test of application in the schools where the modern improvements in teaching have been introduced , much less of a comparison with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most efficacious means of securing qualified teachers are to be found in the seminaries , where a number of young men intending to become teachers are collected , receive a common instruction in the subjects required for the grade of schools in which they propose to teach , or revise and extend this knowledge previously acquired , have lessons in the science and art of teaching , and practice the art under intelligent supervision . At first , these seminaries produced good scholars , who were , however , deficient as teachers . Then , to remedy this defect , lectures and lessons on the science and art of teaching were multiplied , forming good theoretical teachers , but who were still wanting in practice , which had to be acquired after entering their profession , and , therefore , at the expense of the first pupils placed under their charge . This difficulty is entirely obviated by schools attached to the seminaries , in which the theoretical lessons may be put in practice , and where the future teachers may observe the methods of others , try their own skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take part in the regular instruction . The profession of the teacher is raised into respectability by the considerable acquirements exacted of him , and his salary is placed upon a footing appropriate to the outlay of time and means which has been made in reaching the profession . It is a mistake to suppose , that the low salaries given in some countries , as in Prussia , for example , indicate that a low estimate is placed upon the station of the teacher ; the very reverse is the fact in the particular country mentioned , and the salary will be found adapted to the scale of expenditure of the country , and to the general style and cost of living . " When education is to be rapidly advanced , seminaries for teachers afford the means of securing this result . An eminent // teacher is selected as director of the seminary , and by the aid of competent assistants , and while benefiting the community by the instruction given in the schools attached to the seminary , trains , yearly , from thirty to forty youths in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn become teachers of schools , which they are fit at once to conduct , without the failures and mistakes usual with novices ; for , though beginners in name , they have acquired , in the course of the two or three years spent at the seminary , an experience equivalent to many years of unguided effort . This result has been fully realized in the success of the attempts to spread the methods of Pestalozzi and others through Prussia . The plan has been adopted , and is yielding its appropriate fruits , in Holland , Switzerland , France , and Saxony , while in Austria , where the method of preparing teachers by their attendance on the primary schools is still adhered to , the schools are stationary , and behind those of Northern and Middle Germany . These seminaries produce a strong esprit de corps among teachers , which tends powerfully to interest them in their profession , to attach them to it , to elevate it in their eyes , and to stimulate them to improve constantly upon the attainments with which they may have commenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the theory and practice of instruction is furnished , which may be fairly exacted of candidates who have chosen a different way to obtain access to the profession . " Objections have been urged against seminaries for teachers , which apply rather to a defective organization than to the system itself . First , that the youths issuing from them being over-taught , are , in consequence , dissatisfied with their duties , and leave the profession to push themselves forward in a different career of life ; and , second , that theoretical , not practical teachers , are formed by them . The first objection points out the necessity for restricting the instruction to that which is essential to a complete fulfilment of the duties of the teachers educated in these schools . The seminary should not go further , and hence the connexion of such establishments with secondary or other higher schools is inadmissible . If the tendency of a seminary course is to render the teacher dissatisfied with his occupation , experience shows that it is a fault in the particular course , the defect not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupil of talent may seek other and more congenial roads to station in life , is no reproach to the seminary where he was educated . The institution secures the services of this pupil to primary instruction by his pledge at entrance , for a number of years , in return for the education // which he has received , and has so far benefited the community . If by any means it prevents the individual from rising to the position where his talents would place him , an act of positive injustice is committed . Not only the instruction , however , but the whole plan of living in the seminary should be adapted to the future destination of the pupil , and indulgences should not be allowed , which would produce wants not subsequently to be gratified ; such is , in fact , the very system of all properly regulated institutions of this class . That mere theoretical teachers are formed in well-conducted seminaries , is by no means the fact . Every care , on the contrary , is taken to avoid this ; it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine in teaching may he avoided but these principles are constantly applied , and under circumstances where error is sure to be pointed out by the observation of classmates and teachers , and where it can hardly escape correction .
