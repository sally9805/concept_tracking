txt IN our last number , we exhibited the proof of the fact that free persons of color , in general , are entitled to the protection guarantied by the Federal Constitution , in Section second of Article fourth of that instrument . We come now to constder the simpler proposition announced at the conclusion of that argument ; that whatever is implied in the term citizen , and whether we were successful or not in establishing a general rule as to its application , the declaration of Massachusetts by her Constitution and laws , and by special act of her legislature , that the colored freemen of that state are citizens of the state , is conclusive as to that fact upon all other powers and upon every tribunal before which it may be called in question . We shall be understood , of course , to refer only to persons of the above description not being aliens by birth . The question , " What is a citizen ? " is obviously and in its very nature distinct from the question , " Who are citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are required to describe the essential attributes of citizenship , considered as a legal status or relation ; in answering the second , to point out the persons or class of persons who in the given state possess those attributes and stand in that relation . We have endeavored , in our discussion thus far , to exhibit those principles of natural , common , and constitutional law , which furnish a general answer to both questions . According to the views which we have expressed , the essential attributes of citizenship , summing all up in one , may be taken to consist in a recog // nized right on the part of the individual to claim protection at the hands of the state , by means of all its appropriate agencies , according to the acknowledged principles of free governments and the declared fundamental laws of our own ; that right being correlative to and growing out of his natural and legal duty , of allegiance and obedience to the state as a sovereign power ; and as such , being recognized and guarantied , or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furthermore asserted the general doctrine , that citizenship , thus described , is coextensive with allegiance . Such is the solution we have given to the two questions , and we believe and know it to be the true solution . The principles on which it depends are drawn from the very source and fountain , the " principium et fons " of American law ; and their application is broad as the country itself . They pervade , as their essential , vital principle , the whole body of our laws and free institutions . Their controlling force , their practical efficacy , have been recognized a thousand times , in all the modes of state action , judicial , legislative and executive . They never would have been called in question , but for the existence ofan anomalous system , a peculiar institution , which can only he defended , and is only defended , by giving the lie to the solemn declaration with which we announced to the nations the commencement of our independent existence as free states . On a doctrine so established we can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition we have now to deal with must still hold good . For whether the essential attributes of citizenship have been correctly assigned or not , and whatever they may in reality be , the question still remains , " What persons , possessing those attributes in any given state , what persons standing in that relation to that state to which those attributes attach , are thereby citizens of the state ? " a question which from the very nature and necessity of the case , can be decided only by an appeal to the state itself and to its laws . If the common and natural law doctrine , whatever that may be , controls , as we hold it does in general control , yet it is only as the accepted law of the state that it has force within the state ; if , in opposition to that law and against natural right , a state chooses to deprive of those attributes any portion of her subjects , to disavow as to them that relation , to make them slaves , aliens , or outlaws , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act the despot , can not be gainsayed ; if on the other hand she expressly declares , as to any class of subjects , that they do possess the attributes and hold the place of citizens , her declaration is conclusive as to the law , and her law establishes the fact . Now this latter is precisely the position of Massachusetts . She has , expressly and repeatedly , asserted the citizenship of the colored freemen within her borders . Nor has she merely called them citizens . She declares that she takes cognizance of no distinctions of color or caste among her subjects , as making a difference either in their rights or her duties . She recognizes the perfect and equal title of every member of her social system , whether in the less or the more favored condition in society , to claim protection at her hands in the enjoyment of every right which can possibly be considered essential to citizenship . And in all this she but affirms what has been her settled law for sixty five years . For the same Constitution which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a citizen . So long as that Constitution stands , and the construction it has uniformly received , even aggressive legislation is impotent against him , to deprive him of that character or of any rights attaching // to it . No tribunal before which the fact of citizenship might be in issue , not even the Supreme Court of the United States could possibly go hack of that fundamental law , thus expounded , applied , declared , in Massachusetts . rfhat high tribunal could define the citizenship intended in the Constitution ; but the question whether the free colored n-ian in Massachusetts is within that definition , it could decide only by resorting to the law of that state , and to the state construction of that law . It could furnish the test of citizenship , but the Massachusetts law must furnish the facts to which , in the particular case , the test must be applied . As between the states , this doctrine has a peculiar force . To them the clause in question is at once a law and a covenant . In adopting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in behalf of its own citizens , for their enjoyment of the rights it contemplates . Massachusetts obtained thereby a distinct guaranty from South Carolina , that her citizens should be entitled in that state to all privileges and immunities of citizens . Now under such a covenant , it were much to concede that South Carolina would have any right whatever to discriminate between persons prima facie citizens of Massachusetts as being her free subjects , and withhold the stipulated privileges from those whom she should see fit to regard as of inferior grade ; for our own part , we believe that even the Suprema Court in construing the disputed clause would refuse to enter upon inquiry with a view to such discrimination , exactly as it undoubtedly would in applying the clause relating to suits between citizens of different states ; but certainly , if the inquiry were to be permitted , the voice of Massachusetts could not be disregarded . It is her sole prerogative , and one of her highest , to fix and declare the position of those under her authority , as members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has been , that those whom God and nature have made her citizens , she will neither disfranchise herself nor suffer other powers to disfranchise . A state , disposed to abide by her covenant , but having a bonajide doubt as to the fact of citizenship , would respect , as she would be bound to respect , the solemn declaration of a sister state ; and one otherwise disposed , certainly ought not to have the power , at once to avoid her obligations and offer a high indignity to a co-equal sovereignty . It could not have been the intention of the states to make a covenant which should thus invite legislation not only injurious but insulting . South Carolina herself would have been the last to accede to such a compact . And here we can not forbear to notice , though at the expense of a digression , the very remarkable position which South Carolina has been forced to assume with reference to this very point . She found herself obliged to meet , in some way , the allegations of Massachusetts . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . In that character , if at all , had the persons whose constitutional rights were involved been injured . As her citizens , Massachusetts had made their cause her own . On their title to that character would depend the decision of any tribunal before which the case might be brought to issue . South Carolina must deny them that character , or surrendering the whole question , seek other and entirely different grounds on which tojustify the obnoxious laws . Her Committee on Federal Relations , at the late session of her legislature , proposed and attempted to do this . The plain , straight-forward way of making up the issue would have been to deny , by resolutions , either that the persons in question were citizens of Massachusetts , or more generally , but to the same effect , that such // persons , that is , free persons of cob or , were citizens of any state . But here arose a difficulty ; one which no man would see quicker than a South Carolinian . The committee , we have no kind of doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their legislature , to make any such denial . They felt , and recoiled from , the gross impropriety , to say the very least , of pronouncing negatively upon the citizenship of colored persons in Maine , Vermont , Rhode Island , &amp;c. , and most of all in Massachusetts , in the face of her express affirmation of it . What then were they to do ? They went around the difficulty , and in this wise . They reported , and the legislature adopted a resolution declaring , that " Free negroes and persons of color are not citizens of the United States , within the meaning , &amp;c. : " a declaration which is totally irrelevant and trifling unless it means that persons of that description are not citizens in the several states ; are not citizens of Maine , of Vermont , &amp;c. , and more especially that they are not citizens of Massachusetts ; unless , in other words , it says indirectly and by construction , what they had shrunk from saying directly . Thus conscience doth make cowards , even of South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase behind which the sovereign state has taken refuge , is one which for twenty five years past she has expressly repudiated ; that all through her nullification troubles it was a capital point in her creed , as it was a necessary consequence of her principles , that there is no such thing as a citizen of the United States , ' that phrase being a mere circumlocution ; and that it is conceded by Mr. Rhett , in his labored defense of South Carolina , that in the only sense in which even as a circumlocution it can be correctly used , its application to free negroes was recognized by Acts of Congress in 1796 and 1803 , and that under the Act of 1796 many free colored seamen actually received certificates that they were " citizens of the United States . " We submit then that it has been proved ; That the word citizen in the contested clause , as every where else in the Constitution comprehends all free persons native born or duly naturalized ; that is , all persons owing allegiance , natural or acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any determinate condition or relation , however described or defined , such as to exclude some of the persons whom we have claimed it includes , then ; That the declared 1a*4 of the particular state must guide and control any judgment or action upon the fact of citizenship ; and That upon such a test the free colored man of Massachusetts is undoubtedly a citizen of that state . Before leaving this part of our subject , we stop to offer a single comment upon the course of reasoning usually pursued in supporting the opposite views . It consists almost always in an attempt to prove that free blacks were not citizens when the Constitution was adopted ; from which fact , supposed to be proved , it is inferred that they can not be protected by the guaranty now , though they may have become undoubted citizens . Now this method of reasoning obviously proceeds on an entire misconception of the true nature and intention of the guaranty . The very essence of it is the relation between the rights secured and the character to which those rights attach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The capital word in it points out at once the nature of the privileges and the nature of the title to them . Rights , growing out of the primary essential relation between the state and the individual , are secured to such individuals as stand // in that relation . The term employed to point out the persons beneficially interested in the guaranty , can not possibly be taken as a word of mere personal description . It indicates not their c*lor , or position in society , but simply their political condition ; points out legal attributes , not physical characteristics ; is a word of definition , not of specific designation . Nor is there any sort of reason ,  --  at least when we look at the clause in its highest character as a law and not merely a covenant , - why it should he tried by any other standard than that of existing law . As a permanent law of the nation , it declares at all times and in words of present time : The citizens of each state-those who are now citizens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every state . In reply to these suggestions , it might he said : that the guaranty of reciprocal privileges to the citizens of different states was given in view of citizenship as it was at the time , and therefore , thou , h a given state may now if she chooses elevate the colored race within her borders to the condition of citizens , yet that she can not , against the original and continuing intent of the other states , introduce new parties to the benefit of the mutual stipulations , and can not therefore make free persons of color citizens within the meaning of the Constitution . The objection we have here stated , we regard as presenting the strongest point which can be made on the other side of the question ; stronger , we think we may venture to say , than any we have seen distinctly presented in the arguments upon that side that have come to our notice . Of course , if it can be made good , the inference from the proposition , which we have been last considering , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effectually , though with necessary brevity . Of course , if the views we have taken be correct , the mere fact of non-citizenship , supposing it proved , will not of itself support the objection . The exclusion would cease with the reason of it . But the argument assumes a distinct understanding , present in the minds of all the contracting parties , that the free blacks as a race were not , and were not to be , included in the operation of the guaranty ; an understanding , forming an essential part of the whole transaction , arid in view of which the parties acted . Such an intention , if it could be clearly and positively proved as having governed the original compact , might he admitted as adequate to control its language and ingraft upon the mutual guaranty a permanent exception in the case of free persons of color . But what amount of extrinsic evidence can establish such an intention , in view of the plain fact , that it was not expressed ? This might have been done , very easily and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of the citizens ' of each state ; and no reason can he assigned why , if this was distinctly intended , it should not have been thus distinctly said . The further fact , that the power to naturalize foreigners was intrusted , without limitation , to Congress , so that that body might at any time introduce aliens of African descent to all the privileges of citizens , is still more decisive . That that power has lain dormant , as far as colored persons are concerned , is true , but the fact is immaterial ; that the states should have distinctly purposed permanently to exclude all colored persons from those privileges , and at the same time put it absolutely into the power of a majority in Congress at any time to defeat that purpose , is utterly impossible . And , on the other hand , the only evidence that ever has been or can be offered to show the existence of such an intention , is the mere presumption that perSons // SO degraded would not have been placed on the footing of citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the fact , that they were placed on such a footing , under the Articles of Con. federation , our readers can judge . Finally , it would be enough to say , that this presumption , as well as the whole argument , assumes as a clearly proved and recognized fact , that there was no such thing as negro citizenship at the time the Constitution was adopted . Now , without resorting to the general argument of our former article , the single fact that under the law of Virginia at that time in force , free negroes , in common with all other free persons born in the state , were declared to be citizens of the state , completely destroys this assumption , the argument based upon it , and the conclusion to which they both lead . And it will not be denied , that in North Carolina , where the colored free man had the right to vote , in the more northern states in which the work of abolition had been commenced , and especially in Massachusetts , whose constitutional law upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the free negro was as clearly a citizen as in Virginia , although those states had not followed her example in expressly affirming with respect to him the common law doctrine of citizenship by birth . Considering it established , that free persons of color in general are protected under the Constitution as citizens , or if not , that at least such persons in Massachusetts are as citizens of that state " entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states , " we are now to consider the question , whether the laws of South Carolina violate in respect to them the constitutional guaranty . The material parts of the law , out of which the controversy has arisen , were quoted in our last num her at page 411 . Recurring to the passage , it will be seen , that the enactment is , " that it shall not be lawful for any free negro or person of color to come into the state on board any vessel , &amp;c. , " and that any such person so entering the state shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon re-entering or continuing in the state , to corporal punishment and to be sold as a slave . The imprisonment , it will be observed , though in the nature of a penalty for entrance contrary to the act , is not inflicted by ordinary process of law , as the sentence of a court after trial and conviction , but summarily by an executive officer , whenever the person is found on board any vessel within the state ; and in the subsequent proceedings the only fact required to be proved is that the person has been in the state before , and received warning to leave it . The question therefore , arising under the Constitution , ishas South Carolina a right to enforce this law upon the citizens of other states ? In prohibiting their entrance into that state , and in subjecting them to arbitrary imprisonment , to inflictions of bodily pain , and to absolute slavery for life , alledging against them no offense except the coming and being within the state , does she , or does she not , deny to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the right of free entrance into any of the states of the Union , and of exemption from arbitrary violence therein , as a consequence of such entrance , among those privileges and immuni-ties ? It never has been doubted , it never can be doubted , that the right of entering any of the states of the Union as freely as the citizens of that state themselves may enter it , is the very first among the privileges of citizens . And if the guaranty is not violated by an absolute and unqualified denial of this right , then // it can not be violated by any act whatever . For if a state retains complete power to exclude , whenever she thinks it necessary or expedient , that is , at her own and sole discretion , the citizens or any class of the citizens , or any single citizen of another state , she certainly must have the power to enforce the exclusion by any means which she can command , whether of precaution or penalty , by walls , gates and forts , or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sheriffs , or of soldiers and bayonets . The power to make any given act a crime , implies the power to make the forfeiture of rights the punishment of the crime . A cheap expedient therefore for withholding from any class of citizens any specific privilege , conceded to be included under the general grant , would be to make their entrance into the state a crime , and a forfeiture of the given privilege the punishment of the crime . The whole law then is plainly a nullity , unless it conveys to the citizens of each state a perfect right to enter and be in any other state ; or at least , as complete a right as the citizens of that state themselves can have . Obviously the right to enjoy any given privilege , or immunity in any state , would be merely nugatory , without the right to enter and be in the state for the purpose of such enjoyment . If a person is excluded from a state , he is necessarily and effectually excluded from all privileges and immunities in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and the first of the privileges granted , as being necessary to the enjoyment of any of them , but it comes within the general description independently , by reason of its intrinsic nature . We have heretofore shown , that the general object of the guaranty was to protect essential rights , those primary rights , which belong to men as members of the state , and which all free states recognize and hold themselves bound to protect ; which the cardinal principles of the common law , adopted in our Constitutions and bills of rights , secure or ought to secure against all invasion , whether by the illegal violence of individuals or by acts of aggressive legislation . Now the effect of this guaranty was to take the citizen of any state out of the condition of alienage , in which as a stranger he would be with respect to other states , and to introduce him at once to the benefits of that common , declared and fundamental law , recognized in all the states as limiting and controlling their action with respect to their members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state in which he chooses , whether temporarily or permanently , to assume that character ; and clothes him in advance with all the rights essentially belonging to that relation . Now the very first of the rights , which belong to man as a member of the state , is the right to live and be in the state . A man born in a state , placed by the act of his Maker under its power and protection , has the highest of all possible titles to existence within the state and under the shelter of its law . If he has not this right , he has no right whatever as against the state ; Just as he has absolutely no rights whatever as against a foreign state , so long as it chooses to withhold the right of coming within its limits . And a state can do no higher violence to the relation which the Author of nature has created between itself and its members in the very act of ordaining their and its existence , making it to live only in their life , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a force as purely physical as that which an individual despot might use , beyond its limits and out of its protection . His right to live in the state is at least only inferior to his right to live . To expel or banish a // citizen , who has committed no crime , has therefore always been regarded as an act of high-handed despotism : and that a citizen shall not be liable to banishment or exile , even as a punishment for crime , is an express provision of many of* our bills of rights . Now it makes no difference as to the essential nature of the act as a violation of natural and civil rights , whether a citizen , who is within the state , is forcibly removed beyond its limits , and forbidden to cross them and come back , or one , who is accidentally without , is absolutely precluded from returning . An act of the Massachusetts legislature , declaring that Gov . Everett , returning to the state from abroad , should not be permitted to enter it , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforced , so long as her Declaration of Rights stands as her fundamental law ; unless the judicial and executive powers , conspiring with the legislative , the whole power of the state should be directed to the forcible subversion of aU his rights as a citizen and a man . And the fundamental law , which , administered by an independent judiciary in Massachusetts , would protect Mr. Everett , being adopted by the Federal Constitution in the capital provision which we are discussing , being made the fundamental law of the land for the protection of every citizen in every state , being administered by the national tribunals , and supported , by the whole power of the Union , would protect Governor Hammond and every other citizen of South Carolina against a similar enactment by the Massachusetts legislature , that he or they should not be permitted to enter that state . In other words , the right of citizens of South Carolina to enter the state of Massachusetts is under the Constitution as high and as sacred as that of the citizen of Massachusetts himself to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Articles of Confederation the guaranty of the right of ingress was one of the specific precautions under the general guaranty , which we are now discussing. * " The people of each state , " it is declared , " shall have free ingress and egress to and from any other state . " And it was well understood , that the right thus given was , as we have described it , the very first among the privileges and immunities intended to be secured to the citizens of each state in every other , and the one on which all the others depend . For , continuing our quota . tion , it is said- " and shall enjoy therein all privileges , &amp;c . " To secure and perpetuate mutual intercourse was , in fact , declared in the preamble to be one of the leading objects of the whole covenant . These provisions , though not transferred to the present Constitution , have not less , either of importance , significance , or force , now , than they had the day they were first adopted . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not because they were withdrawn , but because they were plainly included under the general guaranty . The preamble was omitted , not because of any change of purpose , but because that purpose was so well understood , that a statement of it was not needed . The original covenant between the states and the existing law over them , are , therefore , with a single exception heretofore pointed out , t identical in purpose and effect . Every restraint , imposed on the states under the Confederation , is still in force under the Constitution . This doctrine was decisively affirmed by Judge Washington in the case of Corfield and Coryell , formerly quoted ; j and in fact the right in question was put first , as * See July number , p. 424. t Ibid. pp. 424,425. f See July number , pp. 431 , 433. 4 Wash . C. C. Rep. 471. // we have said it ought to be , in the enumeration of privileges and immunities secured by the constitutional guaranty. his language is : " The right of a citizen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any other state , for purposes of trade , agriculture , professional pursuits , or otherwise ; to claim the benefit of ' the writ of habeas corpus : to institute and maintain actions of any kind in the courts of ' the state : to take , hold , and dispose of property , either real or personal ; and an exemption from higher taxes or impositions than are paid by other citizens of the state ; may be maintained as some of the particular immunities or privileges , which are clearly embraced in the general description of privileges , deemed to be fundamental : to which may be added the elective franchise , as regulated and established by the laws and constitution of the state in which it is to be exercised . " The right of a citizen of one state to enter and continue in any other , is thus shown to be " one of the particular privileges clearly embraced in the general description . " The law therefore of South Carolina , so far as it prohibits such entrance to citizens of Massachusetts or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " privileges and immunities of citizens ; " and all other provisions of the law designed to enforce that prohibition fall of course under the same condemnation . For it is not denied , that exemption from arrest , imprisonment , stripes and enslavement , is one of the immunities which any citizen may claim so long as he violates no law ; but the only enactment , the violation of which is in the present instance alledged as subjecting the free negro to those infictions , is that which forbids his entrance into and continuance in the state : and this is void and no law , if the Constitution , the supreme law of the land , gives and guaranties to him the right of entrance . Here , then , is a plain , direct , and positive conflict between a law of South Carolina and a provision in the Constitution of the United States . The one declares , as really as if those were its very words , the citizen of Massachusetts shall , the other that he shall not , have the right to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the identical privilege , which the other as positively guaranties . What is more , the conflict in the case of any given citizen , upon whom the state law is enforced , is not partial , but to the full extent of the operation , both of that law and of the constitutional guaranty . The language and proper effect of the latter is ,  --  You shall enjoy all privileges and immunities of citizenship in South Carolina : that of the former ,  --  You shall enjoy none of them . This , it would seem , must be the end of the question ; and yet we have only reached the threshold of the discussion . Not that any part of our argument , or rather statement , is controverted : not that the conclusion is impeached on the ground of any logical defect in the connection of the parts : the objection touches neither subject , predicate nor copula , neither major nor minor , in the syllogisms into which our reasoning may be very easily thrown . But it is insisted on behalf of South Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her laws is in positive irreconcilable conflict with a supreme law , that she has nevertheless a constitutional power to make and enforce that law . In justice to South Carolina we must say , that we do not understand her ' to make any such claim on her own behalf . She is willing her laws should be reconciled with the Constitution , if it can be , but she is not anxious for it . The power by virtue of which she claims " the right to exclude from her territories any person whose presence she considers dangerous to her peace , " is ex // pressly that of an " independent state ; " a power not under , but above the Constitution . Of course , we concede and insist that she has actually exercised such a power and no other ; whether rightfully or not it can not be necessary for us to argue . That a South Carolina politician should claim for his state such a power is not at all surprising : but it is surprising that it should be vindicated in any quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to pass laws like the one in question is asserted by southern legislatures and southern men ; that the claim has been urged with pertinacity and eloquence , and in some instances with apparent force of argument , on the floors of Congress : that even so eminent a lawyer as Judge Berrien , in his place in the Senate , and as chairman of the judiciary committee , has avowed " so clear conviction of the perfect constitutionality of such laws , that he should rejoice to see the question put into any form by which it might be brought before the Supreme Court of the United States : " and that the claim has been indirectly sanctioned by Congress , by the passage through both Houses of the bill for the admission of Florida into the Union , no objection being made to a clause in her Constitution , authorizing the legislature of the future state to pass laws for the exclusion of free persons of color . And what is still more important , recent decisions in the Supreme Court have been supposed to favor the doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased confidence and effect ; so that not a few northern men may be found , men of candor and not deficient in legal attainments , who , upon this very point and this alone , fear a decision adverse to the claims of Massachusetts , whenever her controversy may be brought to issue before the national tribunals* A claim so supported , though it reaches apparently to the absurdity of asserting a constitutional power to violate the Constitution , demands the most careful examination which we can give it . And , though we claim to have established our doctrine by arguments of the strongest and most positive character , we concede that we are bound to consider , and , if possible clear away , the difficulties which may attend its reception ; especially if it is really the fact that they are of such a nature as to threaten its ultimate rejection by the court of last resort . We state the position of South Carolina in the language of her legislative Committee on Federal Relations . " The right of excluding from their territories conspirators against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their safety , is essential to every government . It is everywhere exercised by independent states , and there is nothing in the Constitution of the United States which forbids to South Carolina the right , or relieves this legislature from the duty , of providing for the public safety . South Carolina has in no part of the constitutional compact surrendered her right of internal government and police ; and on the contrary thereof , has expressly reserved all powers not delegated by it to the United States , nor prohibited by it to the states . " And in the resolution adopted by her legislature it is said , " Resolved , That the right to exclude from their territories , seditious persons , or others whose presence may be dangerous to their peace , is essential to every independent state . " The right of exclusion asserted , then , extends to such persons as the state may consider dangerous to her peace . And the source from which it is derived is the general power of internal government and police . It is our business therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name or nature of this " police power , " on which South Carolina relies , and of which we have heard so much in connection with this controversy , which can exempt its exercise from the control of the supreme law of the land . We ask , then , What is the police power of the states ? And What is their constitutional police power ? A state may exert its active powers within its own limits , and upon persons or things under its jurisdiction ; or it may extend them beyond the line within which it properly exists and acts , and manifest itself to other states and to their subjects or citizens . It has , itself , intercourse and dealings with other states ; its citizens , going beyond its confines and pursuing their business or pleasure upon the high seas or in other countries , require the active presence of its laws to regulate and its power to defend them ; or , strangers may approach its boundaries and seek intercourse with its citizens , objects at once of its jealous watchfulness and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all these external relations , a state may direct its powers of external action and legislation . In distinction from these , the powers active within its limits , employed upon the internal relations subsisting between its citizens or between itself and its citizens , and upon all things belonging or appertaining to it or them , constitute its powers of internal action arid legislation , of internal or municipal government and police . So speaks substantially the Supreme Court in the case on which so much reliance is placed by those who assert an unlimited police power in the states : in which it is said , that " every law comes within this description " ( of police laws , or laws proceeding from " the power of internal police " ) " which concerns the welfare of the state or any individual within it  --  and whose operation is within the territorial limits of the state and upon the persons or things under its jurisdiction . " And in the same case , " any and every act of legislation " ( directed to " persons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state may deem conducive to the safety , happiness and prosperity of its people , " is placed in the same class and referred to the same source . Such is expressly the meaning of South Carolina , when she claims as against the general government " the right of internal government and police . " If we have been accustomed to assign to the police power ' a narrower range , it is because we have affixed to that term an idea suggested by our habitual language concerning the distribution of powers between the state and general governments , and the limited powers belonging to the latter . We have learned to speak of it as one out of a class of powers , of which the power to regulate commerce is another , that of regulating the currency a third , and the powers of making bankrupt and naturalization laws , of borrowing money and laying taxes are still other examples . All these powers , so far as they operate within its limits , any one of our states , if it were completely independent , would exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution it is delegated to the general government , but as a branch of its general power of internal government . Our statement , therefore , supported by the definition given by the Supreme Court , evinces that quarantine laws , poor laws , and laws incarcerating and whipping negroes , are not the only acts of police regulation of which a state is capable . The laws establishing courts , creating offices , erecting corporations , providing for public instruction , defining and punishing // crimes , imposing taxes , declaring the rights and disabilities of aliens , regulating the course of descents and the mode of transfer of lands , are all just as much police laws as those for the ordinary conservation of the peace and maintenance of general good order , which more commonly receive that name as a specific designation . They are all to be referred to the same general power of internal legislation and government , of municipal regulation and police . The general police power of a state , therefore , ( so far as it is employed in making laws , ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its full extent , is its power to do any act or make any law , operating within its own limits and upon persons or things under its jurisdiction , which it may deem conducive to the safety , hap*4ness or prosperity of its people . But since it is not claimed that any one of the United States , under the Constitution , is clothed with this whole power , without restraint in its actual exercise ; therefore , The constitutional police power of the states is their power to do all acts or make all laws operating as above which they are not by the Constitution restrained in doing or making . In referring , therefore , any act or law of a state to its police power , we have not vindicated it as constitutional , nor advanced a single step towards such a vindication ; the question in every case still remains , is that act or law one which it is any way restrained in doing or making by the Constitution . Now the Constitution of the United States controls state action and legislation mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , consisting of legislative , executive and judiciary departments , clothing them respectively with power , either exclusively or concurrently with the states , to do certain acts and classes of acts , or make certain laws and kinds of laws , and declaring the acts done or laws made in pursuance of that authority to be valid against any state action or legislation whatever ; * secondly , by directly forbidding th%* states to do certain acts and classes of acts , and to make certain laws and kinds of laws ; t thirdly , by specific provisions imposing on the states obligations which they may not avoid ; j and finally , by similar provisions creating rights in individuals which no state action can defeat or impair . In this last category stands the clause now in discussion . Of all or nearly all these restraints the efficacy has been tested before the national tribunals , and numerous acts of state legislation , passed in view of important interests or urgent necessities , enlisting in their support the strongest feelings of state pride , and clothed with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supremacy of the Constitution , and of laws deriving from it their vitality and force . But all or nearly all these cases have presented questions as to specific powers of legislation ; questions whether the power to make the given law had been either surrendered by the states , or transferred to Congress ; if vested in Congress , whether exclusively or concurrently with the states ; or if concurrently , whether there was actual collision between the law of Congress and that of the state . So generally has this been the fact , that it has been almost forgott*n that there ae any other restraints on state action than the class thus brought into discussion . And in this way it has come to pass , that the right of the states has been broadly asserted to make any law whatsoever , unless it has expressly surren * Const . Art . I , except Sect. 10 . Arts . II , III . Art . IV , Sects. 3 and 4 , and last clause of SectYl . Art.V . Art . VI , clause second . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sect. 2. clause second . Ibid. clauses first and third . // dered or transferred its power to make that specific law or kind of laws , or unless Congress has received and exercised the power to make laws of the same description . Thus even the state of South Carolina asserts an unlimited power of internal government and police , as a power " not delegated " ( in the Constitution ) " to the United States , nor prohibited by it to the states . " The classification which we have given shows that there is another and still higher class of restraints upon state legislation . The supreme power , which speaks through the Constitution , is occupied mainly with organizing , not exercising , legislative agencies . Laws operating directly on the mass of individuals , declaring their rights or prescribing their duties , are made for the most part , not by it , but under its authority . It legislates by authorizing legislation . Yet in two remarkable instances it has trusted neither to congressional nor state legislation , but has itself enacted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were to be placed beyond the reach alike of the state and general governments . We have already referred to their place in the Constitution . By one is secured to the owner of a SLAVE , escaping from the state in which he is held a slave , the right to recapture him in any state : by the other are secured to the CITIZEN of any state , " ALL PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF CITIZENS " in any other state . The two stand on the same constitutional platform , and there must stand or fall togeth'er ; alike in every thing , except that the one is designed to protect the rights of the freeman , the other to perpetuate the wrongs of the slave . The one has received its construction from the highest tribunal known to our law : let us apply that judgment to establish the other . We quote the language of the Supreme Court in the case of Prigg versus Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . ( 16 Peters , 539 . ) " The clause in the Constitution manifestly contemplates the existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner of the fugitive slave , which no state law or regulation can in any way qualify , regulate , control , or restrain . " - p. 612 . " The right to seize and recapture fugitive slaves , and the duty to deliver them up , in whatever state of the Union they may be found , is under the Constitution recognized as an absolute positive right and duty , pervading the whole Union with an equal and supreme force , uncontrolled and uncontrollable by state sovereignty or legislation . " - p. 623 . Determine , then , the meaning of the language , " all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states " - fix on any specific right " clearly embraced within the general description , " and it is certain that under the Constitution the right to enjoy those privileges and immunities , or that particular privilege , exists in the citizen of each state as " a positive unqualified right , which no state law or regulation can in any way qualify , regulate , control or restrain . " And if it is established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveys to the citizen of each state as perfect a right to enter and be in any other , as the citizens of that state themselves can have , then that right is to be recognized , under the Constitution , " as an absolute positive right , pervading the whole Union with an equal and supreme force , uncontrolled and uncontrollable by state sovereignty or legislation . " We have endeavored , in the course of the remarks which have been offered , and by means of them , to expose two prevalent and kindred errors ; which would maintain , the first , that the police power is not a general but a specific power , and as such in // some unknown way vested exclusively in the states , just as the power to regulate commerce is in Congress ; and the second , that since it is not surrendered to the general government , nor prohibited to the states , it is no otherwise controlled or restrained , and may therefore be exercised by the states , to any extent , at their sole discretion . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out of which has originated the monstrous thought that there may possibly be a constitutional power to violate the Constitution . We trust we have been successful in withdrawing the subject from the realms of chaos ; and in making it clear that if the right to enter and continue in any state is certainly conveyed and secured by the constitutional grant and guaranty , the enjoyment of it can not be controlled or restrained by any state legislation whatever . We are recalled , therefore , to the single question whether that right is or is not so conveyed and secured , and to our demonstration that it is . Nor has the contrary proposition ever been distinctly affirmed , nor can it be . The facts , as they are in history , in law , and in the nature of the case , are too notorious and too obvious to permit it . The point , however , has been with scrupulous care avoided , in every attempt which we have seen to justify the South Carolina law or similar laws . It is felt that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' In what consist the privileges guarantied by the Constitution ? - however necessary its answer would seem to be to the decision of the main question , Has that guaranty been violated . ' And there is economy as well as prudence manifested in thus declining the attempt to fix a meaning upon the language , " all privileges and immunities of citizens ; " since the ground ultimately taken is in every instance such as to make it a matter of no sort of consequence what that meaning may be , or whether the language has any meaning at all , or any existence at all , as a part of the Constitution . Such plainly is the result of ascribing omnipotence to the police power ; and to this complexion comes at last the only remaining plea set up for South Carolina , as stated in her resolution already quoted , and urged by all who have spoken or written in her behalf . That plea affirms that a state may constitutionally deny the right of coming within its territories , and in so doing of course deny all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other states , but to all whose presence she considers dangerous to her peace . It is impossible not to see that this assumption makes the grant and guaranty of the Constitution as completely nugatory* as if its terms , instead of being what they are , were- ' The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states , except so far as the laws of any state may exclude all or any of them from the enjoyment of any or all of those privileges or immunities . ' Observe , South Carolina does not make her right of exclusion depend on the color of the citizens on whom she has thus far seen fit to exercise it She does , indeed , faintly , and with an attempt at evasion which would be despicable if it were not symptomatic of a conscience , deny that the persons against whom she directs her law are citizens of any state ; but she knows better than to rest her defense either upon that ground , or upon the ground that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the different classes of citizens who approach her shores , and to exclude a part of them , solely on the ground that she apprehends danger from that particular class . But she would probably consider the presence of Rev. Mr. Pennington of Hartford no // more dangerous to her peace than that of Rev. Mr. Torrey , now of the Maryland state prison , or the reverend accomplice , whose name we have forgotten , of Miss Delia Webster , or the veritable Miss Delia herself . She professes to regard the colored mariners , cooks and stewards ' on board Boston vessels , as emissaries , one and all , from the incendiary orators of Marlboro ' Chapel ; would her fears be less awakened by the approach , in proper person , of a whole legion from that Pandemoniurn ? Plainly , if she can make good her position and chooses to avail herself of it , she would be in no want of a pretext for extending her prohibitory enactments to all or any of these characters . She may evea go further and shut up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and subject every citizen of a free state approaching her borders , to an examination as to the extent of his sympathies with the peculiar institution on the one hand , or the victims of it on the other . This , in fact , we understand her to assert a right to do ; and such too we take to be the meaning of Mr. Rhett when he declares that " the state has never surrendered her right to protect her citizens against incendiaries , black or white . " Suppose then that South Carolina should enact , in the terms of her existing laws against free negroes , that it should not be lawful for any member of an anti-slavery association to enter the state , &amp;c. , and the sheriff should attempt to enforce the prohibition against Joshua Leavitt ; does any man suppose that the state law would stand a moment , in the United States courts , as a defense to him against Mr. Leavitt 's action of trespass for the illegal violence ? The language of the court must beWe can not regard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Massachusetts ; we can not look into his opinions nor his principles ; the state law is plainly a violation of the Constitution , and we can not go behind the enactment to ascertain the amount of inducement which the state may have had to make it ; we must in all cases presume that the legislature of a state acted with a view to the good of its people , but we can not sit in judgment to determine the degree of necessity which can elevate into validity a law which the Constitution declares null and void . There are , of course , numerous other dangers and necessities to which the guarantied rights of citizens must per force give way , besides those growing out of southern slavery . Illustrations are at hand , but we do not care to dwell upon them . It is obvious that " an absolute positive right , pervading the Union with an equal and supreme force , " and yet at the mercy of the supposed necessities of the different states , is very little better than if it were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , regard this last plea as presenting any ground of defense for South Carolina , distinct from those already considered , or as making any change in the constitutional aspect of the question . It still asserts a power to violate the supreme law ; an assertion of power to which we do not object , so long as it is called by the right name and referred to the right origin . To all these attempts , by force of police power or otherwise , to upset the Constitution , the quarantine and poor laws have furnished the 2*oi3 ur* . It remains for us to consider how far they afford any analogy , which can supply to the defense set up for South Carolina legislation the want of positive argument , and whether their existence or operation raises any real difficulty adequate to prevent or even to hinder the reception of our doctrine . We will take first , as presenting the stronger case , the quarantine laws . Under their operation , persons coming from countries or dis // tricts infected with disease , whether citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made to perform quarantine for the space of ten , twenty , or thirty days , or until it is sufficiently certain that they may be permitted to land without endangering the public health . The constitutionality of such laws has never been denied . If then a state , in providing for the public safety , may withhold from the citizens of other states , for so long a time as that safety in her opinion requires , the privilege of entering her territories , though that privilege is plainly granted by the Constitution , and her law to that effect stands as valid ; will not the same principle give validity to the laws of the southern states , excluding free blacks from their territories , since their presence among the colored population is at all times a source of public danger ? The assertion is , in other words , that a state law , in conflict with the Constitution , is valid notwithstanding such conflict , as a necessary exercise of the police power for the protection of the community ; and it is claimed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same ground . Now the whole force of the analogy , and it has at first sight great force , depends on the assumption , that the quarantine laws are in conflict with the Constitution , and are validated by the urgent necessity for their enactment ; and this we deny . There is no kind of occasion for any resort to any extraordinary power or to any extreme right of self-protection , in explaining or justifying the operation of these laws . This is obvious enough , so far as they operate , as they may and do , upon the citizens of the state which enacts them ; and a recurrence to principles already established proves the same fact with respect to their action on citizens of other states . We have shown , we think we may say have demonstrated , that the right of entrance into any state of the Union , acquired by the citizens of each state , is precisely such a right , in its nature and extent , as that of the citizens of the state to re-enter it . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as growing out of the primary essential relations between the individual and the state , established upon the first principles of the common law and of natural reason , and recognized by our fundamental law adopting and affirming those principles . We showed it , in short , to be one of the absolute rights of men in their relation to government , as truly as their right to life , liberty or property . But we certainly do not mean by absolute rights , those of which the state , through its laws , may not regulate the exercise . On the contrary , with regard to them all , and to this among the rest , the ever-speaking language of the law is ,  --  Sic UTERE TUO UT ALIENUM NON LEDAS . It acknowledges the rightthe taum , even while speaking imperatively as to the manner of its enjoyment . It says to the absent citizen ,  --  " Your right to return to your native state is sacred , and shall not be denied or withheld ; but you have no right to exercise it in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lives or health of your fellow citizens ; you have no right to bring with you into the streets of a crowded city and introduce among its inhabitants an infectious disease ; and if there is any hazard that you may , you must submit to such restraints upon your right of entrance , to such regulations as to the time and manner of coming within the state , as the laws may justly prescribe in order to guard against such a hazard . " And such is its language to any other person , who approaches its shores , clothed by the compact and guaranty of the state with a " title to all privileges and immunities of citizens " in it . The right of entrance , undoubtedly conveyed under such a guaranty , // does not consist in an absolute pow. er to do the outward act of crossing the state lines at any place , at any time , in any manner which he may choose , and under whatever circumstances ; for it is a right defined and measured in its nature and extent by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not such a right . His right is defined and measured as to its nature and incidents , and particularly as to its liability to be affected by ordinary legislation , by the great principles of our fundamental laws , our constitutions and bills of rights ; if the quarantine laws therefore , in their operation on the citizen of the state which enacts them , violate those principles and invade his rights under them , then the same laws operating under the same circumstances upon the citizens of other states , violate the constitutional guaranty , and illegally invade the rights which it is intended to convey and secure ; and not otherwsse . The quarantine laws , therefore , do not conflict with the Constitution ; certainly not with the controverted clause . And all parts of our exposition , in like manner , stand together . For that clause conveys to the citizens of each state an " absolute positive right and title to all privileges and immunities of citizens " in every other , which no state legislation " can qualify , regulate , control or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulate and restrain , not the right as conveyed by the Constitution , but as existing in its citizens ; a right existing in them by an absolute title , but in its very nature subject to be regulated in the manner of its enjoyment ; and conveyed , affected by the same incidents and liabilities , through the Constitution , to the citizens of other states . The simple right , and its incidents , taken together , make up the entire thing to which the Constitution gives an absolute title . such are the quarantine laws in theory , and such too in practice . The citizen of New York and the citizen of South Carolina , passengers on board the same ship from the Levant , or from a southern port during the sickly season , are subjected to the same detention . The one has no privilege or immunity which is not equally enjoyed by the other . In truth , they are not either of them denied an entrance into the state they are received within its jurisdiction and brought under the protection of its laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchorage at a specified place within the waters of the state , and they are required to continue a certain length of time on board the vessel . The rights of either as a citizen , by birth or adoption , are no more invaded than if , being in the interior of the state and found or suspected to have the small pox or plague , he should be taken to a public hospital or required to confine himself to a particular house and restrained from intercourse with the community at large , so far as might be necessary to prevent contagion . Laws of this description are in the strictest sense of the term police laws ; as much so as those by virtue of which the local authorities draw a cordon sanitaire around an infected district , within the country . That they operate at the borders of the state , and in many , though not in most cases upon foreigners and strangers , is merely accidental , so far as their nature is concerned . They act on such persons , and all persons on whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as inmates , just as truly as the laws for the punishment of crime . And it is for this reason that they are not considered as laws regulating commerce , though they act in general on the agents and instruments of commerce . The analogy , supposed to exist between the two classes of laws , fails therefore at the very point at which the use to be made of it required it should be most clearly es // tablished . And not only so , but the explanations which we have given show a most important difference between them ; a difference not accidental but essential ; a difference in nature and kind , not merely in degree . The right of entrance into a state , we have shown , exists in the citizens of that and other states by an absolute title , but subject to be regulated in the manner of its exercise ; now the quarantine law regulates the exercise , the law of exclusion denies the title . The one says-So enjoy your own right as not to injure another 's ; the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is properly a law of the state , purposing the good of the whole , while it recognizes and respects the rights of each ; the other is an arbitrary exertion by the state of physical force upon persons whom it disowns as members , and refuses to treat even as men . Such a law , if it can be called one , directed by a state against its own citizens , is an act of detestable tyranny ; directed against the citizens or subjects of a friendly nation , or any class of them , is an act of open hostility , unless justified as done in self-defense in view of urgent necessity ; directed against the citizens of a sister state in our federal Union , it abjures the primary , essential covenant , on which that Union was formed and subsists , and violates the most solemn obligations which it imposes . To bring our whole argument upon this subject to a practical test , let us suppose New York and South Carolina to be separate and independent states , the former having a law under which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sickly season , are detained in quarantine-say ten days . Suppose now that New York enacts a law to the effect , that the citizens of South Carolina shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in New York ; no man would think of saying , that such a law would exempt the citizens of South Carolina from the operation of the quarantine law . Yet it must , if the two are in conflict ; for of two laws , proceeding from the same authority , the provisions of which clash with each other , that which is last enacted repeals the other to the extent of the conflict . But if the last mentioned law had found in existence and force a previous enactment , to the effect that it should not be lawful for any citizen of South Carolina or any specified class of citizens , or any specified individual citizen of that state , to enter the state of New York , and subjecting any such citizen found in the state to arrest and imprisonment , there would be as little doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead letter upon the statute book , by the mere force of the grant of privileges . And if those privileges had been secured to the citizens of each state in the other , by a mutual convention between the two , the operation would be the same ; except that the subsequent enforcing by New York of her preexisting law would be a gross violation of her faith pledged in the treaty , and a just cause of war. *@@184069495. txt WE have referred to these Reports , not so much with a view to any examination of their pages , as to express our conviction of the ide.i * The Nineteenth Annual Report of the American Home Missionary Society , presented by the Executive Committee at the anniversary meeting , May 7th , 1*45. 7f he first Report of the Society for the promotion of Collegiate and Theological Education at the West . tity of the objects for which these societies were called into being . The American Home Missionary Society , does indeed , through the medium of its auxiliaries , extend its benefactions to the aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this field is rather an incidental service than part of its primary object . At least it is in // this light we view its present extended effort-an effort which contemplates , as its ultimate purpose , the bringing of the new states of the West under the power of the Gospel . The best means for the accomplishment of such an object , is not matter for conjecture nor idle speculation . The experiment has been too often tried , and with too complete success , to leave room for doubt as to the propriety of the measures to be pursued . The Gospel must first be carried by the living preacher , its truths must be enforced by the melody of the human voice-by the expressive glance of the human eye , made to flash and glow by the fires that are burning within . All the varied circumstances of life must be made available to gain a hold upon the heart-the scenes of affliction  --  the hour of bereavement  --  the mingled influences of joy and sorrow  --  the day of prosperity and the day of adversity-must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulcrum by means of which the power of the . Gospel is to be applied . This can be done only by one conversant with the scenes as they pass , and ready to be made all things to all men , that he may by all means save some . You may sow the good seed as you will , and in such measure as you please , if it be not preceded , at least accompanied , by the living preacher , it is like scattering wheat in the deep recesses of the unenclosed forest ; there is no sunshine to warm it into life , or if it perchance spring up , the wild beasts tread it under foot . We care not with how free a hand the publications of the American Tract Society and the American Bible Society are scattered among the population of the western states . However freely , we say , " God speed " the effort ; and yet we are free to say , that we have no hope of any great good from such efforts , any farther than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry . We would as soon send the sower of the seed far in advance of him who shall break up the fallow ground . We would distribute good books therefore as the best auxiliaries of the living preacher , and auxiliaries of the greater importance when the minister of Christ has but a feeble church , or no church at all , to which he may look for cooperation . We have expressed our hearty concurrence in the largest efforts of this kind , because we have confidence that the wealth and liberality of the churches are equal to the entire work of furnishing the means for evangelizing the West , and doing it in the most thorough and intellectual manner . Did we doubt this , we might feel disposed to put in our plea for a somewhat different apportionment of the funds given , and the labor devoted to the accomplishment of this great object . We repeat that our chief hope , we might almost say , our only hope , of bringing the West under the power of the Gospel , in any such sense as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the establishment and maintenance of permanent institutions , of the same character substantially , as the kindred institutions of the eastern states . In a word , the West , to be truly and permanently benefitted by the promulgation of divine truth , must have its stated ministry intelligent , stable , devout , possessed of the largest liberality , and abounding in every good work ; its colleges and theological seminaries well officered , and amply endowed ; its academies and common schools , its churches and its libraries all established , substantially after the Puritan model , and liberally sustained . Whatever tends most directly to secure these objects will conduce in the highest degree to the developement of sound morals , and the promotion of a cultivated and enduring piety , whose influence shall be felt in all the relations of life , and its // good effects be manifest in all the aspects of society.  - -  The relative importance of the western states in making up the future balance of power in our national confederacy , the prospective millions that are to inhabit those fertile plains , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipated moral conflict , have been so often before the public eye , and in so many and so varied shapes as topics for discussion , that we feel persuaded there is a desire , nay , to a considerable extent , an anxiety on the part of the eastern churches to discharge their duty in this mat. - ter , whatever may be the sacrifice . The conviction has been rapidly deepening for the last few years , that our free institutions can be maintained only by a population made intelligent , on the basis of the Gospel . The skill of the artist , the capital of the tradesman and manufacturer , and the toil of the husbandman , no less than the stock of the banker , are all thrown into the arena , as prizes to be won or lost in every political contest . It is the fashion of the day to make , or seem to make every interest in wealth , in morals , and in religion hang on the issues of each contested election . If it be maintained by any that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inasmuch as there are issues , equally vital , destined ultimately to cover the whole ground , even if those alledged were shown to be false . We think , therefore , that the time has arrived when the whole field of western evangelization should be thoroughly canvassed , and the question be more fully and more intelligently settled , What are the best means for imparting to the growing population of our western states the intelligence , religion , and general character , that shall make their influence upon our national destiny salutary and conservative ? Our character as " New Englanders " will be a sufficient indication of the standard we wish to place before our readers in attempting an answer to this question . We wish to know the best means for making the western states , as one after another they spring into maturity , a reorganization of society after the New England model . Such a work as the one before us can not be accomplished in a moment . Nor will it be the result of transient or spasmodic efforts . There are difficulties to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be fully appreciated only by those who have struggled against them , and seen their magnitude ; and which will yield only to patient labor . We have already intimated that what is done efficiently must be done under the eye of the living preacher . He may call in the cooperation of all the aids he can command , but they must act under his eye , and with his countenance . But the support of men who shall give themselves wholly to the work of the ministry , with not only the duties that are direct , but those that are incidental to the pastoral office in a new state of society , must come in no inconsiderable measure from abroad . We do not claim exact and reliable statistics on which to found the opinion , but we . make no hesitation in saying , that there are not fifty Congregational or Presbyterian churches in the western states , that are not indebted for their existence and early support , to some organization for promoting home missions . When we speak of the western minister , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missionary . Let us take the life of such a laborer as he enters the wide field be . fore us , and see how he is to accomplish his task , and what are the difficulties which he must encounter . Among those by no means the least formidable , we may notice the great diversity in the materials // of which new churches at the West are composed . It has been an important point in the Home Missionary effort from its commencement , to harmonize the scattered communicants of the Presbyterian , Congregational and kindred churches , so far as to gather them into one communion . " The plan of union " received the sanction of the General Assemby and the General Association of Connecticut with this end in view . The greater portion of our western churches are indebted largely to the provisions of that compromise for the present measure of their prosperity . And yet it amounted to little more than an external bond . It brought the scattered members of Christ 's flock around the same table and constituted them one family , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the doctrines of the Bible , their views of the discipline , and of most of the practices of a Christian church , still widely differed . The little church composed of a score of members , is the representative of some half dozen distinct members of our national confederacy , besides a fair delegation from the kingdoms of the old world . Each wishes a minister cast in the same theological mold with himself , attached to the same practices and trained after the same model . Is the sacrament of the Lord 's ' Supper to be administered ? One would have it done " after the approved model of the New England churches ; " another would seat the communicants around " the table " neatly spread along the broad aisle a third insists that the Savior used unleavened bread , and the ordinance is without validity except it be celebrated " after the pattern showed in the mount . " The same diversity appears in their views of the ad. ministration of every religious service , from the highest duties of the sanctuary to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is perhaps now , for the first time , advised thatihere is any other in practice , at least in his own denomination . To relinquish that in which he was educated , and around which his most sacred associations cluster , with the ardor of a first love , is giving up half his religion ; is , at least , stripping it of its embellishments , and taking away its beauty . Nor are these feelings to be trifled with ; they are sacred associations , and may not be roughly handled . When the missionary arrives and gathers such a church , and commences the work of building the spiritual temple , he is often thrown into circumstances that strikingly remind him of the feelings of the Jews , at the building of the second temple . " The chief of the fathers , who were ancient men that had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , wept with a loud voice ; and many shouted aloud for joy . " And yet of these diverse materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homogeneous in its character , having symmetry of form and unity of design , or he fails in the errand which has brought him hither . " All the building " must be " fitly framed together , " or it will not " grow into a holy temple in the Lord , " and form " a habitation of God through the Spirit . " We have now the nucleus of a church . Let us inquire for the source whence the materials for its enlargement are to come . It may have accessions , it doubtless will , in the constant flowing in of emigrants . But these are as dissimilar as were their predecessors . Besides , the proportion of religious people , and especially of our own denomination , to the whole emigra. tion , is small . Almost all Christian denominations are represented whereever a new settlement is planted ; but these add not to the strength of the little band whom we have seen gathered into a church . if it // is to increase and flourish , sinners are to be converted . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they been trained in the nurture and admonition of the Lord ? Are they the children of the covenant , who have left their early religious privileges with regret ? who are eager to listen , and anxious to believe ? who need but the converting grace of God and they shall be able to teach others ? Are they those who from childhood have been made acquainted with the Holy Scriptures ? Far from it . The converts at Corinth were scarcely in a more emphatic sense babes in Christ , than are the lambs of this flock in the wilderness . Such men are to constitute the pillars , if pillars it shall have , in this infant church . And who needs to be told that much ministerial labor and self-denial , and many hours of anxious thought must be experienced by this pastor , before such helpers shall have " learned to use the office of a deacon well , and purchase to themselves a good degree , and great boldness in the faith . " We might dwell at length upon the facility with which every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a state of society  --  the readiness with which error takes root in this fertile soilwhile there are wanting all the arrangements of a well organized society to resist its progress . The pastor , sustained by an intelligent , numerous , and highly cultivated church , encouraged by an organized and homogeneous society , where all is kept in countenance by a chaste public opinion , can never , while destitute of personal experience , be made fully sensible of the difficulties of maintaining discipline , and preserving harmonious movement in a church , such as we have described , while the influences from without , if not adverse , can not be said to be auxiliary . With such materials to build with , and so defective , there is still much to be done that is peculiar to this field of labor . The eye of this stranger , who has cast his lot with others in the wilderness , rests on the forms of society in the land where lies the garnered dust of his fathers . He remembers the neat church edifice , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees which overshadowed it ; the rich tones of the bell ; the Sabbath 's stillness ; the silent and measured tread of the hundreds that flocked to the house of God to worship ; the neatness , and order , and apparent devotion , of the worshipers ; the burial place in the vicinity , its green sod dotted all over with the memorials which affection has planted by the graves of depart . ed love . From these his eye wanders back to his college scenes , to the academy where were nurtured his first aspirations for the sacred office of the ministry , to the common school , whose power and purity have done more than all else , save the Gospel , for the land of the pilgrims . As he returns to gaze upon the scenes of his new home , all these are wanting-or , if a commencement be made , the first rude effort seems scarcely to indicate room for hope of future success . His church edifice is the humblest cabin , whose materials are as the hand of nature 's great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gigantic trunks , and spreads its foliage so dense and high that the breezes scarcely fan , and the sun 's rays can not cheer , this rude abode of the ark of the covenant . A few fresh graves mark the spot designated as the last resting place of these adventurers . The gloom of the deep , dark forest broods over the spot , which has no monument but the fresh earth , and is enclosed only by the interminable wilderness . The Sabbath returns , but who knows that it is the Sabbath . The sound of // the woodman 's axe , the crash of the falling forest , the crack of the hunter 's rifle , and the slow movements of the emigrant 's team , awaken associations of any other than the day of rest . The congregation , when convened , do scarcely more to remind the preacher , except by the contrast , of the pleasant scenes of a New England audience met for God 's worship . And yet it may be , there occupy those rough seats the young men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sway the popular mind as the trees are moved by the tempest-the men on whose will is to hang the destinies of the land , and the prosperity of the church of God . There is energy there , but its fires have not yet been kindled ; there is talent , but like the kernel , which yet the husk envelopes , it can not be seen . How shall it be cultivated ? Whence are to come the means , and where are the provisions for its future training ? The only blow yet struck is the preparation of this rude cabin , which serves the double purpose of the school-house and church . The academy is yet to be furnished ; a conception of its plan , its location , the source from which it is to be derived , are among the things wrapt up in the future . We may not yet ask whether the higher institutions of science are to be enjoyed-and when  --  and where . And yet here is an embryo world ; and as the missionary fastens his eye upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its church , its intelligence , its piety , its institutions of learning and religion , its Sabbath , its revivals , and its hundreds of devout worshipers , all supplanting this wilderness scene , and cheering this now desolate spot . In his hours of despondency he is almost ready to say , " If the Lord would open windows in heaven , then might such a thing be , " but faith triumphs , and he resumes his work , with the inspiration of hope to cheer his heart and nerve his arm , confident of ultimate success . Let us now turn and see if we can discern how these changes are to be accomplished . They are by no means to be sudden and miraculous . The forest melts away as the fruit of patient industry . By a succession of well applied blows , each one of which seems too ineffective to demand notice , one gigantic oak after another is prostrate , till at length the harvest waves luxuriantly upon the soil . By the same slow and steady process , the conveniencies first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegancies of life , succeed to the privations and discomforts of the first rude home in the wilderness . Sometimes , indeed , a tornado will sweep through the forest , prostrating all before it , and seeming at first view to perform the labor of a thousand men , and yet it but increases the toil of the husbandman . The tangled trunks and massive roots that cover the ground , can be removed only at an expense vastly increased above what is demanded in improving the soil in its natural state . The pastor of Christ 's flock in the wilderness derives about the same aid , in kind and degree , from those moral whirlwinds that sometimes pass over the field of his labors , sweeping all before them . The fruit of all wise and thorough experience will , we think , amount to this , that the moral wilderness is to be transformed into the garden of the Lord , and made to bud and blossom as the rose , not by impetuous assaults , nor by rousing the tempest , but by " patient continuance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precept upon precept , here a little and there a little . " But again , the means to be used must be modified essentially by the general character of those to whom the missionary goes on this errand . We have already spoken of the want of homogeneousness in the // materials of ' which western churches are composed . This feature is far more strongly marked in the mass of the population . Like the multitude whom John saw in vision , as they bowed before the throne above , they are " out of every kin . dred , and tongue , and people , and nation . " And yet it is true that there is one feature predominating over every other , and destined ultimately to give shape to the mass . The Puritan element is distributed over this entire field , and is the leaven by which the whole lump shall be leavened . All the means employed and to be employed , in the work of promoting western evangelization , must be selected with this fact in view . So far as the Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its missionaries , with few exceptions , are the descendants of the men who first peopled the rugged shores of New England , whose monuments are the churches , the colleges , seminaries and school-houses , scattered so profusely over the land of the pilgrims . They go forth on their great work of evangelizing the West , imbued with the same love of civil liberty , with the same high estimate of the value of intelligence , as constituting , though not piety itself , yet one of its most valuable auxiliax*es-imparting to it character , strength , stulbility , inflexibility of purpose , and moral courage . They go to establish the largest religious liberty-not a liberty that has its basis in a latitudinarian construction of the Gospel , and a reck. less disregard of every known law of interpretation  --  but a liberty trammeled by few forms , bound by no traditions of the fathers , that makes every man the interpreter of his own duty , under the guidance of divine truth and a chastened conscience . For their success they depend not on costly trappings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt by the use of mysterious symbols , or tinseled drapery , to excite the imagination by imposing on the understanding , but in the simple manner of Paul , " by manifestation of the truth they commend themselves to every mans s conscience in the sight of God . " The law which they inculcate is not that of the letter which killeth , but of the spirit which giveth life . The religion they preach from the pulpit , and illustrate in their lives , is not , on the one hand , a dead *thodoxy which devotes entire sermons to the pins of the tabernacle , while single paragraphs suffice for the ark of the covenant , with its tables of the law and its symbols of the Gospel which overshadow it ; nor , on the other hand , is it the reckless zeal which thirsts for conquest , that it may swell the number of its allies and gratify its own lust of power , while it sticks at the use of no means , if so be that the end is gained . They regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question of divine right , but as a means to an end . That end is the greatest good of the church itself , and its greatest efficiency as a means of good to others in securing their conversion by the grace of God . Local interests , and peculiar circumstances , and the previous habits and personal tastes of the members , are taken into the account in giving shape to , and modifying the form of , the government they adopt . The members must indeed be men of piety and prayer-who walk by faith , not by sight-men of devout lives and holy conversation , and who shall be willing to associate together for mutual watchfulness and mutual assistance in the Christian life ; but whether they shall reserve all their rights and powers to be exercised by the whole body of male members , or whether they shall delegate some or all of these powers to chosen men of good re // port , is a matter for each particular church to decide for itself . The people to whom these missionaries go , are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Puritan principles do not warm their hearts , there is yet Puritan blood there If they are not imbued with the spirit of their fathers , they have not forgotten that they had such sires . If they do not venerate the piety of the men who resisted the despotism of Charles and his Star Chamber , and periled their lives to plant the standard of *berty in the new world , they yet admire their heroism , and their love of freedom , and remember that the same blood flows in their own veins . If on their infant heads was not placed the seal of God 's covenant , the promise of God is not circumscribed within the limits *f a single generation , but children 's children may yet return and walk under its shadow . If they look back and leer at the religious spirit that imbued the common schools of New England in which they were trained , they yet know that the spirit of civil liberty has ever been nurtured in those schools ; and though they talk contemptuously of blue laws and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not unaware that all the liberty we have left us , and all we shall transmit to our descendants , may be traced back to the rigor of those laws and the conservation of the clergy they affect to despise . If they do not refrain from profaning God 's Sabbaths , they can not so far banish the impressions of early childhood , as to withhold the concession that the Sabbath is the bulwark of our national liberties . If they do not love to render spiritual worship within the consecrated walls of the house of God , they still love to see its tall spire overshadowing their dwellings ; they regard it as the chief adornment of their village , and listen to no music more thrilling than the mellow tones of its bell . These men have a conscience ; they have many sacred associations laid deep in the mind and among the early impressions of childhood . They know the value of religion , for their youth was witness of its divine fruits , and , with all their professed contempt of the Gospel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an " aching void the world can never fill . " These men are scattered over the wide West . Whereever there is a water-fall , or a channel deep and silent enough to admit a steamboat upon its bosom , or a valley through which may be excavated a canal , or a plain over which a locomotive may whirl their produce to market , there you find them-they fill the chief stations in society-they give tone to all the laws - they give the decisions and furnish the precedents for future courts of justice-they control the education of the young-they design and execute the public improvementsthey give shape to society . These are the men to whom this Society proposes to preach the Gospel , and whom , by the grace of God , they expect to convert from the error of their ways . Better materials for the formation of intelligent , stable , efficient churches , can not be found on earth . There are men enough of this sort in every state west of the inountains to give tone to morals , and religion , and education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectually to Christ , they will be the salt whose savor is to be everywhere salutary . With the New England population of the *vestern states thoroughly converted , we dread not the assaults of the man of sin . Let him who blasphemously styles himself " the vicar of God on earth , " marshall his minions , send out his Jesuit priesthood by ship-loads , and pour out his funds like water . We only ask the arousing of the Puritan spirit , the planting of Puritan churches , the organization and support of Puritan institutions , and the sustaining // of a well furnished host of Puritan ministers , and our country is safe ; its songs of liberty shall swell forth in sweeter notes ; truth shall have free course ; and the overwhelming influence of an intelligent Christianity-illustrated in the holy living , the pure example , the free spirit of living churches , owned and blessed of God-will do for the groveling , ignorant , and servile population that flows in upon us from the old world , what the personal efforts of an army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish . Romanism , if broken down , and banished from our free country , is to be broken down by the presence and influence of our free institutions-by the Gospel exhibited in its transforming effects upon society-by showing a more excellent way in the life and prosperity of those embracing its truths in their purity . This is the living epistle on which Paul relied for his highest instrurnentality in the world 's conversion . Every church , thus planted and sustained , is a light placed where it must be seen-is the leaven in society , by which the lump is to be leavened . The hardened , the stupid , the bigoted , and corrul ) t devotee , may refuse to read . His priest may burn the Bible and the tract which charity placed in his hand . He may be too deaf to hear the argument which affection presses upon his understanding , and too blind to perceive its conclusions ; but these living , free , and devout churches are before him and around him-amid their members he moves , and with them transacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own personal bigotry shall have closed all the avenues to his soul , his children mingling in the common school , and watching the elasticity of their spirits who breathe the air of religious liberty , will be , sooner or later , imbued by the same spirit ; and what can not be done by precept and argument , will yet be accomplished by the contact of society and an inspiring example . If the views we have advanced are correct , and for their truth we appeal to all who have resided on the soil , and mingled in the scenes of western life , then it seems to follow with the certainty of a corollary in mathematics , that it is an indispensable part of the means for evangelizing the West , that facilities should be furnished for educating thoroughly upon the ground , the teachers and ministers by whose agency the work is to be accomplished . Local circumstances and relations work out singular transformations of character , and with singular rapidity . Had the pilgrims and their descendants continued to dwell in the crowded cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of inspiration to teach him what would have been their dissimilarity to the present population of New England ? The causes that combine to produce change of taste , character and habits , in our western population , are far more numerous than any that existed in the early settlement of New England . Among these , the intermingling , in the population , of people of every conceivable taste and habit , is far from being the least . The results indicate a more rapid ' change than most persons would anticipate . The sturdy old Puritan character does not indeed rapidly pass away . The influence of education , and early moral culture remains , and furnishes a field where the " good seed " may be sown with hope . But the free air they breathe , far away from the restraints of religious teaching and well organized society , modifies essentially their temper and habits . It frequently occurs that those , who in the land of their birth were in the lowest conditions of society , suddenly find themselves standing at its head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary laws of progress , or a prop . er regard to due proportions , is yet absolute as well as relative . Men who in the circles where they had their origin , would have ever stood back , relying upon others ' opinions , are not unfrequently , in a new settlement , thrown upon their own resources , and compelled to think and act ; and hence , by the same law of necessity , they are forced to read , observe , and resort to all available sources for information . Hence it is that the West abounds with what are sometimes called self-made men-men who have fitted themselves for the emergencies into which they are thrown . That such men should be more accessible , or be more easily moved by a ministry , themselves imbued by habit and by education with the same spirit , and familiar with the traits of character with which they are to come in contact , is in accordance with the plainest principles of common sense . We do not say a word to detract from the acknowledged usefulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose labors are already devoted in season and out of season , in carrying the consolations of the Gospel to the millions of our countrymen . We disparage not their efforts when we say that men imbued with the western spirit , trained amid western influences , and educated in the region where they are destined to labor , will have more adaptation , and with greater facility become all things to all men , than those educated abroad . It is not enough that their primary education is obtained at the West . New England might as well expect to increase the usefulness of her future ministry by sendinghersonstoEurope fortheir education , as might the western churches by educating their young men in the colleges of New England . Nor have we taken in the whole view , when we have contemplated this want of adaptation to a new field of labor in the youthful missionary . Many indeed there are of sufficient elasticity of mind , to accommodate themselves with surprising facility to the aspects and condition of society in a new country . There are however men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refined sensibilities , and to whom success would have been certain in a community homogeneous with themselves , who lack the directness , the fire , the pithiness , and the power of adaptation , essential in a western speaker-*vho find their talents undervalued , their tastes ill suited to the state of things around them , and despond under the disappointment . The romance of missionary life vanishes with their first acquaintance in their new station . They expected to find a people tractable , and reverent , paying great deference to the opinions of one of enlarged mental cultivation and full of theological lore  --  a people filled with admiration of the love that could prompt to such self-sacrifice for the single purpose of doing good to men . Instead of this , they find a community many of whom have become so accustomed to self-instruction in other matters that they scarcely feel the necessity of much religious teaching , and who , if they do not " better know the Lord , " are not wanting in the opinion that they are " wiser than their teachers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than receive a favor , when they employ " a missionary from the East , " and " subscribe " three hundred dollars as his annual salary . We would be far from intimating that there are no exceptions to the state of things here described . Nor is it irremediable where it exists . Men who are thoroughly pre-acquainted with the elements with which they have to contend , and who have skill // to meet these elements , will find them by no means among the most difficult , to be molded and shaped into the forms that render society desirable . The transforming power of the Gospel is never more happily illustrated than it has been in its influence upon such communities , in many hundred instances . So far as we have been able to consult facts and make observations , men of western habits and education have been most successful in accomplishing these results . Let it not here he said that we are advancing views antagonistic to the statements made in another part of this article . XVe would by no means forego the Puritan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We only say , let that element be nurtured and developed on the ground where it is to he called into active service . Let it be done in institutions after the New England model , and under the instruction of men themselves deeply imbued with the New Eng* land spirit . We have , before we close , a word to say of the pecuniary support which is to be furnished to the class of thoroughly educated men , who leave the pleasant homes and refined society of the eastern states to devote their lives to the moral and intellectual culture of the West . Men who go there to gratify their ambition , or their love of wealth , find a field equal to their highest hopes . It is rarely true that any class of men , who go to the West relying upon their own resources for support , fail to improve their condition in life . In all the departments of skill and manual labor , industry meets its sure reward . It is otherwise with those who rely for their support on voluntary contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges and theological seminaries , and who labor as ministers of the Gospel , must rely to a considerable extent on the benefactions of eastern churches . Nor is it enough that their persons do not grow lean from hunger , or that they are protected from the elements without . The character of the men who are to be converted , and trained for usefulness on earth and glory in heaven , by their instrumentality , and the nature of the service they are to render , present the strongest argument for an elevated standard of intellectual culture . The West must have men to fill both her chairs of instruction and her pulpits , who shall not be satisfied with the amount of intellectual capital with which they engaged in the service-men who shall employ the best hours of life with intense thought in a well furnished study-men who shall be untrammeled , on the one hand , by the poverty that makes the heart sick ; or , on the other , by those worldly cares which furnish the only alternative when a competence is withheld . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they deserve it who enter the wilderness , and give a life time to the work of gathering an infant church , and setting in order whatever is wanting to make that church , and the community with which it is associated , worthy of our pilgrim ancestry ; worthy of the high destiny of the nation of which they are a part ; worthy of Him who redeemed them with his blood . This competence can not be furnished at the West.
