txt THE present cOnjuncture in our political affairs invokes attention to the subject of legislative control over acts of incorporation . The combination of political factions and pecuniary interests which has attained a temporary ascendancy in the government of the republic , is striving to enthrone a powerful monopoly in absolute supremacy over all the business relations of the community . The probable success of a scheme so inconsistent with every enlightened notion of political economy , so repugnant to the fundamental principles of our civil institutions , and so fraught with practical mischief to all kinds of business , excites inquiry as to the nature and efficacy of the remedy which may be applied when the present dominant party shall have accomplished its work of evil , and returned to its natural and destined minority . We design , therefore , to take a cursory review of the question of the repealability of acts of incorporation ; and we shall consider it , not merely in the form in which it is presented by the case which gives occasion to the discussion , but with reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained , that acts of incorporation are contracts of the government with the corporators , which can not be rescinded except with the consent of the latter - in the case of the States , without a violation of a positive provision of the Constitution , and in the case of the federal government , without a breach of the public faith . A law and a contract are in their natures essentially different . A law is a rule prescribed by a superior to an inferior ; a contract is a voluntary agreement between equals . A law imports power and command in one party , necessity and submission in the other ; a contract imports volition and independence in both parties . // This distinction is regarded in the acts of governments . In the conveyance of the ordinary subjects of private property by a legislature and under a law , the same formalities are employed as in such transactions between individuals . The United States grant lands by a patent , which is an instrument authenticated by the public seal and the signature of the President , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an individual . The State of New York grants and receives lands by patents and deeds . In the ordinary cases of contracts between governments and individuals , the usual forms of private transactions are adhered to . An act of incorporation purports to be , not a contract , but a law ; it has none of the forms of a contract , but all the forms of a law . A construction of an instrument which changes its whole character , the relations of its parties , and its legal effect , can be admitted , if at all , only on the clearest and strongest evidence . Is there anything in the case of an act of incorporation to justify the application to it of a construction so extraordinary l Is there anything in the nature of the rights conferred which has such an effect * A corporation is a mode of association in which several persons exist and act , in law , for certain purposes , as a single individual . It is hence called an artificial person . Its ordinary incidents are , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common name and seal , and to legally actsuing and being sued , and transacting business-by them ; to hold real and personal property ; and to make by-laws for its own government . Limited liability is not essential to the nature of corporations ; and in very many cases , in this country and in England , is not possessed by them . The modes of commercial association are-corporations-limited partnerships  --  and general partnerships . Each mode has its peculiar rights and duties , capacities and disabilities . The essential difference between them is in the extent to which the principle of association enters into their constitution . In the theory of a corporation , the union of the members in a single body is complete ; in that of a partnership it is imperfect . There is nothing in the faculties of a corporation more than in those of a partnership , which requires , to confer them , the exercise of a prerogative of sovereignty superior to ordinary legislation , or which makes the act conferring them of greater solemnity or of a different nature from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to transact business , and to sue and be sued as The Doe Company , is no more of the nature of a contract , than a statute which enables them to transact business as John Doe &amp; Co. , and to sue and be sued jointly by their individual names . A statute which gives // them the power to hold real and personal property as corporators , is no more of the nature of a contract than a statute which gives them the power to do so in the same mode as partners may at common law and in equity . A statute which limits the liability of a corporator to the amount of capital invested , is no more of the nature of a contract , than a statute which , in the same manner , limits the liability of a special partner . So it is with all the faculties of a corporation . They are but modes in which several individuals may exercise in common , rights which they possess separately . The corporate mode of association is more simple and convenient , less embarrassed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the partnership mode . But this difference of convenience can not make a statute establishing the one system a mere law , and a statute establishing the other system a solemn contract . There is no reason why the advantages peculiar to corporations should not be enjoyed by all ; and the tendency of recent legislation and judicial construction has been to impose on corporations some of the liabilities of partnerships , and to confer on partnerships some of the capacities of corporations . It is difficult to conceive how a law , which should at once impart to voluntary associations any or all of the faculties which are now peculiar to corporations , could be deemed a contract , and , as such , exempted from the action of the legislature , in case it should afterward be found to require modification or repeal . On the contrary , it is quite obvious that the whole matter is an appropriate subject of civil regulation . Has an act of incorporation the distinctive attributes of a contract more than other laws , and in such a degree as to justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine the reasoning which is employed to sustain this conclusion . " A charter , " says Judge Story , who is the author and ablest advocate of the doctrine which we are considering , " is in form and substance a contract ; it is a grant of powers , rights , and privileges , and it usually gives a capacity to take and to hold property . It confers rights and privileges , upon the faith of which it is accepted . It imparts obligations and duties on the part of the corporators which they are not at liberty to disregard ; and it implies a contract on the part of the legislature , that the rights and privileges so granted shall be enjoyed . " A charter , in the original sense of the term , was an instrument , executed in writing and with certain forms , as evidence of things done between the parties . In England , corporate privileges were granted by such instruments from the king , and the term having been adopted from that country by us , has come , by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confers corporate privi // leges . The word is evidently used , in the sentence quoted , in its original sense ; for it alludes to the form as well as the substance of the instrument . The reasoning , however , is applied equally to acts of incorporation ; for the author had just before remarked that " a legislature may made contracts or grants directly by law , " and that " the question is not whether such contracts or grants are made directly by law , in the form of legislation , or in any other form , but whether they exist at all . " A grant was an instrument , similar to the primitive charta , originally used to authenticate the transfer of a class of rights known in law as incorporeal hereditaments ; but the term is now equally applied to the instrument ( the same in all respects , except as to its subject-matter ) which is used in the conveyance of corporeal hereditaments , such as lands . The chain of reasoning by which an act of incorporation is made out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a charter ; a charter is a grant ; a grant is an executed contract , that is , a contract of which the object is executed ; an executed contract implies an executory contract , that is , a contract in the ordinary sense of the term , not to reassert the right conveyed . Without testing the tenacity of the other links of the chain , let us inquire , if an act of incorporation be " a grant * " It confers rights ; but does it impart them with the effect of a law- or with the effect of a technical grant * Are the rights held as civil rights bestowed by a law , and subject to be taken away by its repeal - or as property , lands , for instance , under a formal conveyance * They are bestowed by laws ; and must be considered as ordinary civil rights , unless their nature is so different from that of such rights , and so identical with that of property , as to make a law which imparts them necessarily , in substance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are considering ; we have endeavored to show that their nature does not so differ from that of other civil rights , and we have something more to say on the point . An act of incorporation , it is said , " usually gives a capacity to take and to hold property . " More accurately it imparts a capacity to associate property in a particular form with certain peculiar powers and liabilities . This a law of partnership also does ; a law enabling married women to have a separate property , or aliens to possess real estate , does more - it actually confers a capacity . There is a broad distinction between the right to associate property in a certain mode , and the property so possessed . The right to associate it in a corporation , is no more property , in itself , than the right to associate it in a partnership . At common law , on the civil death of a corporation , its real estate reverts to the grantor , its personal estate vests in the people , and the debts due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unjust and injurious are no more necessary than on the termination of a partnership , and grew out of the absurd ideas attached to corporations in ages of ignorance and barbarism - ideas from which we are not yet wholly emancipated . The Revised Statutes of New York provide that , on the dissolution of a corporation , its managers at the time being , unless other persons are specially appointed , become trustees for the creditors and stockholders , with power to settle its affairs , pay its debts , and divide its surplus assets among the stockholders . This provision was taken from a conditional recognition of the right of repeal , which was inserted after a severe contest in an act of incorporation passed in 1822 , we believe , and which established in this State ( N. Y. ) the practice of making such a reservation . For this assertion of a great public right harmonized with private interests , we are largely indebted to a man then just entering upon public life - the morning of whose career was devoted with youthful ardor to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an illustrious champion - SILAS WRIGHT , Jr . An act of incorporation " confers rights and privileges on the faith of which it is accepted . " So does a law which enables a man to entail his estate - to sell lottery tickets - to engage in the business of banking or insurance - or which lays protective duties - gives bounties on production - opens a new business to competition - or removes the restraint on the rate of interest . There is as much of an acceptance of " the rights and privileges " conferred , and as much of an undertaking to discharge " the obligations and duties " imposed , by the formation of a company under the act of special partnerships , as there is in the formation of a corporation under one of our general laws . There is as much an investment of property on the faith of a continuance of the law , in the one case as in the other . And the same thing is substantially true of all the other laws to which we have referred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the corporators which they are not at liberty to disregard . " So do all the laws we have referred to impose obligations and duties on those who act under them and receive the benefits of them . An act of incorporation " implies a contract on the part of the legislature that the rights and privileges so granted shall be enjoyed . " Why more than the laws which we have cited * No feature of a contract can be pointed out in an act of incorporation which is not equally discernible in many of our laws . The same mode of construction would convert half of our statutes into irrepealable contracts , and a little additional ingenuity the whole of them . There are a few prominent cases in regard to which we have some additional comments to make . // A law imposing protective duties offers inducements for the establishment of manufactories on the faith of which individuals invest their property . The " compromise act " of 1833 , fixed the periods for which certain rates of duty were to continue . So definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken of as if it were a contract to violate which would be a breach of public faith . Private interests are more deeply involved in such a law than in one conferring corporate franchises , inasmuch as a vastly larger proportion of the capital employed is invested in permanent erections , which , if diverted from their intended uses , become nearly valueless . Yet it will not be pretended that such a law is of the nature of a positive contract ; or that it would not be subject to modification at the discretion of the Legislature . An obligation would exist to exercise that discretion with equity toward individuals ; but the nature of the obligation would be that of a legislator , which implies judgment-not that of a party to a contract , which is a necessity of acting according to its precise terms . A law creating an office may be regnrded as a contract during its term , on the part of the government to pay a specified salary , and on the part of the incumbent to render the specified services . In English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are classed with corporate franchises , as incorporeal hereditaments ; they are granted from the king by the same instrument , or cliarta . Like corporate franchises they were sometimes sold ; and like them they are by the common law a subject of property . No authority or argument can be adduced for considering a statute creating a corporation a contract , which will not apply with equal force to a statute creating an office . Pressed by this reasoning , Judge Story avows the consequences ; and pronounces such a law to be a contract , and , if made by a State , within the constitutional prohibition , and irrepealable during the term of the incumbent. * With all deference for so distinguished a jurist , this doctrine is not American law nor American practice . It has the same origin , and the same hereditary claim to our adoption , as the kindred dogma in regard to corporations , but it has not succeeded in establishing itself upon our soil . " Property in an office , " says a recent American work , " is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t The doctrine that the power which can establish an office can abolish it , and without reference to the term of its incumbent , has been acted on in numberless instances by the States and by the nation . It has been applied as well to cases in which the tenure of the office was during good behavior , // as to those in which it was for a limited period ; and is too firmly established to be shaken . A law establishing a public corporation , is as much a contract as one establishing a private corporation . The reason for the distinction between the cases assigned by Chancellor Kent , that " in public corporations there is in reality but one party , " the public , is very unsatisfactory . It is a clumsy expedient to escape the logical consequences of an unsound principle . The city of New York is quite a different " public , " from the State of New York . There surely is not such an identity between them as to prevent their being the parties to a contract . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city corporate capacities , for municipal purposes , is no less of the nature of a contract than an act of the State imparting the same capacities to iadix i ( lvIals , for commercial purposes . The corporate privileges of New York are more valuable to her citizens than those of any private association to its members ; they are indispenaable to the protection of a multitude of private interests ; a wanton withdrawal of them would be as great a wrong ; and a couflseation of the property held under them , would be no less a violation of private rights . The distinction between the mere franchise and the property held under it , which is made by Judge Story in this case , we have already shown to be equally applicable to private corporations . In the English law , from which the ideas we have been combating are derived , no difference is recogaised in the natures of public and private corporations ; and the notions of the sanctity and inviolability of corporate franchises which we have inherited , were originally and especially attached to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ municipal corporations from legislative action would be intolerable , they result inevitably from the general principle , and are to be avoided , not by a false refinement of construction to extricate us from the difficulties in which a false refinement of construction has involved us , but by a correction of the orio*nal error . The source of the prevalent fallacies on this subject is easily traced . Charters were originally formal grants , from the sovereign to the subject , of the most important personal and social rights - of which the inagna cliarta is a specimen ; and they were invested with a peculiar sanctity , both from the solemnity with which they were made , and from the nature of the rights which they secured . Even when they conferred corporate franchises , they were essentially of the same character . They erected the inhabitants of a town into a commonalty , with the privilege of having magistrates and a council of their own - of making byVOL . IX . No . XXXVIII. -H // laws for their own government - of building walls for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a security against the lawless violence and rapacity of the age. * Their necessary effect , in such cases , was to relieve the citizens of those towns from a servile dependence on the nobles for safety ; and they often contained provisions of enfranchisement , which converted them from serfs into freemen . Among the earliest of the privileges so bestowed was that of giving away their daughters in marriage without the consent of their lord , and of disposing of their property by will , or of having their children succeed to it instead of their lord . V*Then corporate franchises came to be valuable merely as a convenient mode for associated action for commercial or municipal purposes , the sovereign still retained the right of conferring them ; he conveyed them by the same formal instrument ; he made them the subject of bargain and sale ; he treated them as property . But does it follow that they must , therefore , be property with us , when there is nothing in their nature , or in the act by which they are imparted , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now mere civil rights I Must legal ingenuity be tortured to construe a law conferring them , into the ancient technical grant I Such a doctrine is not reason ; it is not law ; it is abhorrent to the principles of the constitution , which is the supreme law . The dicta of individual judges may imply it ; the principles , to the adoption of which the Supreme Court has boon urged by the strong equities of peculiar cases , may have a perilous proclivity to such a result - principles , the adoption of which has since cost it immense labor of constructive ingenuity to qualify and retract so as to harmonize at all with our institutions ; but that court has never yet formally adjudged that an act of incorporation passed by a State is an irrepealable contract . We venture to say that it never will do so ; it is far more likely to qualify or retract still further , as it has already done to a large extent , the incautious opinions which might lead to such a step . And , meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other directio * . *f States , as Ne*v York has done , are asserting the power of legislation over corporations by statute , and inserting a recognition of it in each act conferring such franchises . And by general laws they are making these convenient faculties , with such modifleations as the public welfare may require , aceessinble to all . They are thus carrying out the principle , which was early adopted in this country , of considering them as civil rights , and not as private property ; to be imparted by ordinary laws , and not by technical grants . And they had the * Suiflis Wealth . of Natiom. by McCulloch , 203. // same right to conform to the principles of our government the tenure of existence of private corporations , as they had to do the same thing - which it is confessed they have done - in the cases of officers and public corporations . They were no more bound by the obsolete absurdities of a barbarous age , or by dogmas peculiar to monarchical institutions , in the one case than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for apprehension as to the operation of the American doctrine on this subject . Under it , corporate privileges are held by the same tenure as many of the most valuable of our individual rights . The power to legislate in the case does not imply a certainty of abuse , or a right to abuse . It is in this case , as in all others , a trust poxver , to be exercised for the public good , and with equity toward the individuals peculiarly affected . We pass now from the general question of legislative control over acts of incorporation , to the particular case which has given rise to this discussion . The power of Congress over a law establishino a National Bank is independent of the general question ; it rests on grounds which are peculiar to the case , and which are in themselves impregnable . It is universally conceded that corporations of a public character are subject to the discretion of the legislature . " There is no doubt , " says Justice Story , " as to public corporations , which exist only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modify , enlarge , and restrain them ; with this limitation , however , that property held by such corporation shall still be secured for the use of those for whom , and at whose expense , it has been acquired . The principle may be stated in a more general form . If a charter be a mere grant of political power , if it create a civil institution , to be employed in the administration of the government , or if the funds be public property alone , and the government alone interested in the management of them , the legislative power over such charter is not restrained by the Constitution , but remains nnlimited. *** " A public corporation , " says Chancellor Kent , " instituted for purposes connected with the administration of the government , may be controlled by the legislature , because such a corporation is not a contract within the purview of the Constitution of the U. S " j Nor can the doctrine be sustained , which was recently asserted by Mr. Berrien in the Senate , that a corporation whose general character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some private interests . Every public corporation of whose existence we are aware does so . Even cities , towns , and counties , which are instanced by Chancellor Kent and Judge Story , as pub 3 Corn . on the Con. 260. f 2 Kent 's Corn . 305. // lic corporations , and which are such , if any exist , are admitted by the latter to " involve some private interests. *** " With regard to political corporations , " says a recent American workt on this subject , " it is true that they involve some private interests yet for the reason already given , they are generally deemed public . " The public corporation of the city of New York embraces more private interests than any private corporation in the country . The fact that the government holds a part of the stock of a private corporation , does not impart to it a public character ; * nor does the fact that individuals hold a part of the stock , or that private interests are otherwise implicated , in a public corporation , impart to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the institution must determine whether it is public or private . A National Bank is a public corporation , not bccause the public holds a share of its stock , but because the whole object of its creation is of a public character , and embraces private interests so far only as is essential to its efficiency as a public institution ; - because it is a part of the machinery of government , and exercises high political functions . On this ground only can the constitutional rittht to establish such an institution be claimed ; on this ground exclusively was that right vindicated by the Supreme Court . We qtiote from the opinion of Chief Justice Marshall in the case of Osborn et al . v. the United States Bank , which states the reasons of the decision in that case , and also in MeCulloch v. the State of Maryland , the only other case in which the constitutional question has been directly passed upon : " The foundation of the argument in favor of the right of a State to tax the bank is laid in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation to have been originated for the management of an individual concern , to be founded upon contract between individuals , having private trade and private profit for its great end and principal object . " if these preniises were true , the conclusion drawn from them would be inevitable . ih*s mere private corporation , engaged in its own business , with its own views , would certainly be subject to the taxing power of the State , as any individual would be ; and the casual circumstance of its being employed by the government in the transaction of it fiscal affairs , would no more exempt its private business from the operation of that power , than it would exempt the private business of any individual employed in the same manner . But the premises are not true . The bank is not considered a private corporation , whose principal object is individual trade and individual profit ; but as a public corporation , created for public and national purposes . That the mere business of banking is , iii its own nature , a private business , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Col. v. Woodward , 4 Wheat . 668. * Ansel and Ames on Corporations . I Marshall , U. S. Bank v. Planters ' Bank , 9 Wheat . 907. // panies , having no political connection with the government , is admitted ; but the hank is not such an individual or company . It was not created for its own sake , or for private purposes . It has never been supposed that Congress could create such a corporation . The whole opinion of the court , in the case of MCulioclt v. the State of Maryland , is fbunded on , and sustained by , the idea that the hank is an instrument which is necessary and proper for carrying into effect the powers vested in the government of the United States . ' It is not an instrument which the government found ready made , and has supposed to he adapted to its purposes ; but one which was created , in the form in which it now appears , for national purposes only . It is , undoubtedly , capable of transacting private as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the fiscal operations of the government are effected , it is also trading with individuals for its own advantage . The appellants endeavor to distinguish between this trade and its agency for the public , between its banking operations and those qualities which it possesses in common with every other corporation , such as individuality , immortality , &amp;c . While they seem to admit the right to preserve this corporate existence , they deny the right to protect it in its trade and business . " The Chief Justice then proceeds to argue that the provisions of the net of incorporation which " authorize its banking operations " are constitutional because " those operations are inseparably connected with the transactions of the government . They enable the bank to render those services to the nation for which it was created , and are therefore of the very essence of its character , as national instruments . The business of the bank constitutes its capacity to perform its functions , as a machine for the money transactions of the government . " Notbin* can be more explicit . A National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such , subject to the legislative action of Congress ; or the act creating it is unconstitutional , and , *pso facto , null and void . The authority of Congress over a law creating a National Bank differs from that of a State Legislature over acts of incorporation in another important respect . The power of the State in such cases is denied , as inconsistent with the clause of the Constitution of the United States which declares that " no State shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts . " By a forced and most unjustifiable construction , a law creating incorporations is transformed into a contract , and all future legislation on the part of a State concerning it , is brought within a prohibition which , it is an ascertained fact of political history , was never intended to apply to such cases . But whatever may be the true construction of that prohibition , it does not reach the action of Congress . Of the perfect legal and constitutional competency of that body to modify or repeal , at its discretion , any act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shadow of doubt . The // only restraint on its action is in the moral obligation to exercise this , as it is bound to exercise all its other powers , for the public good . Nor could a case be presented more imperatively demanding the exercise of an unquestionable power , than the passage of an act establishing a National Bank . Such a law is in itself a violation of the Constitution , which is the most sacred of charters ; and a conviction of this fact alone on the part of Congress would render its repeal an inevitable requirement of public duty . The existence of such an institution is every way incompatible with the public welfare . It would effectually exclude from banking the principle of equal freedom , the application of which to that business is the only adequate measure of reform ; and would perpetuate in it the principle of monopoly , which has caused all the evils of the present system , and written its history in human suffering . It would concentrate in a few irresponsible capitalists a control over every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsistent with individual rights , and ought not to be tolerated in a community of freemen . The successful establishment of a National Bank , moreover , would be the consummation of a great public fraud . Throughout the recent political canvass , the Whigs emphatically repudiated any design , in case of their success , to create such an institution . They selected , as their candidate for the Presidency , Gen. Harrison , who was known to have denied its constitutionality , and who never conceded more to it than to say that he would yield his objections to a clear indication of the public will ; and as their candidate for the Vice-Presidency , Mr. Tyler , who was more thoroughly committed against such an establishment than almost any other man in the country . In Virginia , the address of their State Convention advocated Gen. Harrison 's election on the express ground of his hostility to such a scheme ; and in North Carolina , Mr. Badger , a member of the present cabinet , in a speech of which a hundred thousand copies were circulated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him of being friendly to it , as " false . " In New York , Gov . Seward had , in a public message , hesitated opposition ; most of the leading Whig presses and speakers of the State , disclaimed the measure ; and in the agricultural districts , the assertion that the success of the Whigs would eventuate in its adoption , was treated as a calumny . Even Mr. Clay , who had been an uncompromising advocat eofabank , conceded something to the public sentiment ; in his speech at Hanover , he condescended to express an unaccustomed doubt , and to say that if an adequate substitute could be found , which he still thought there could not , he was ready to acquiesce in its adoption . And yet the success of candidates , holding such sentiments , and // advocated on such grounds , is now claimed to be an instruction by the people in favor of the very measure repudiated , so authoritative as even to preclude all discussion of its propriety ! And the monstrous pretension is asserted , of a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , and to fasten on the country , beyond the control of future representatives and of the people themselves , a governmental machinery which can be constitutionally established , if at all , only as a public institution , but which , once established , becomes sacred as a private contract ! If such a double fraud could be successfully executed , the forms of popular government would be a wretched farce . Unquestionable as is the right to repeal a law creating a National Bank , and imperative as are the considerations which demand the enforcement of the right , it should be exercised with a careful regard to the interests of individuals . The act which withdraws from the institution all its public franchises should secure to its stockholders the property they have invested , and should leave to it the powers necessary to the settlement of its affairs ; and an ample and seasonable notice should be given , by the minority , of their intention to appeal to the people on the question , so that the individuals who may afterward voluntarily implicate their interests with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision , and shall have as little reason to complain of the exercise of the right of repeal , as we have shown that they have to deny its existence . Upon the issue thus made up , the Democracy must take a solemn appeal to the people , to repudiate an institution which is incompatible with the common welfare and with individual rights ; to assert the supremacy of their will over the machinery of government and over their own servants ; to rebuke a detestable and dangerous public fraud ; to vindicate equality against privilege ; and to reclaim to themselves rights without which they can not be free.
