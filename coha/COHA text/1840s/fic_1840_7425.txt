Cranch , Christopher Pearse , 1813-1892 : POEM . from A poem delivered in the first congregational church ( 1840 ) PREFACE . It is with unfeigned reluctance that the author commits this production to the public . It was hastily prepared , on very brief notice , and written rather for delivery than for publication . Besides , a genuine Poem should spring up spontaneously in the subjective atmosphere of the writer 's mind , and not be extorted from him by the artificial forcing-process of a public occasion . It is therefore only in compliance with the urgent request of friends in this vicinity , and the expectation of numerous others at a distance , that , after having more than once abandoned the thought , the author has at length determined on giving it publicity . Should the critic then deem his lines lacking in inspiration , he will appreciate the fact , that it is hard to play the orator and poet on the same stage . Poem section The spell of Beauty is upon the hills , The fields , the forest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , and the hours Move to the dial of the budding flowers . Joy to ye , hills and fountains ! once again Ye have flung off the tyrant winter 's chain : Joy to ye , leaves and blossoms  --  ye are springing Fast to the melodies around you ringing : Joy , joy to all for whom the sunshine brings New life , new thought , midst tame and common things . Poem section How shall I paint thee , gentle May ! how dare To speak in feeble verse thy glories rare ? The soul that truly would commune with thee , Like thee forever born again must be . Yet if we may not praise with lips profane Thy new created beauty , yet O deign To lift our spirits and to purify , That we may feel thy influences nigh . Hail then , most genial season  --  blessed May ! Joy be with all who feel thy smile this day : Hail to yon cedar hills , to crag and tree ! Hail to yon meadows , and yon sparkling sea ! Who needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more romance your May-born youth ? Who , with these skies so blue and fields so green , Would disenchant the life of all the scene , And with quaint memories of things that were Add a remoter charm to what is now so fair ? Footnote : 1Kb Poem section Yet we can not forget , the while we gaze On what this morn hath gilded with its rays , Though all is new , and even the verdant soil Seems made to day , not crowned with ancient toil , That four times fifty years have passed away , Since , in the sunlight of another May , The hardy settler gave this spot a name Culled from the English home from which he came . Footnote : 1Kb We scarce can feel the years that time hath told , While leaves and flowers their breathing life unfold . Yet so it is , with all we see and know : The shadow of the Past , where'er we go , Spreads over all its strange and dreamy hue . Nought but the Soul , which feels it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day . He bids us look O'er the dim leaves of that recorded book Which mortals call the Past . The days of old Come thronging on us fast , as we unfold The mystic pages  --  while unseen flit o'er us Those venerable forms who went before us . Perchance e'en now their consecrated shades Are gazing through the silence that pervades This festive hour : they come with smiles serene , Beaming like holy moonlight o'er the scene :  --  They come , with high and peaceful brows all bright , And crowned with wreaths of amaranthine light : They have no sorrows now : they 've won at last A home whose peace no shadow can o'ercast , Where far beyond the cold wave , and the tomb , They dwell in bowers of eternal bloom . Poem section We tread on hallowed soil . Where now we stand , Two hundred years ago , a feeble band Safe from the tyrant 's chains , the ocean 's foam , Came to these shores to find another home : A home  --  not such as that they left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children find . Like the old patriarch of the Orient They roamed , unknowing whither ' t was they went . No smiling fields with walls and elm trees lined , No harvests waving in the summer wind , No smiling cottages  --  no tall white spires Sprang to the gaze of those old Pilgrim sires . Wild and unbroken in their long repose Forests and rocks in endless prospect rose : All grim and silent slept each granite hill , Where now the clanking chisel and the drill Loosen and shape to symmetry the block , Hewn from the heart of the deep-bedded rock . Around them dashed the waves ;  --  the moaning breeze Swept the untrodden depths of the forest trees ; Then rang the woodman 's axe with steady stroke , Till crashing fell the tall centennial oak : Or leaping out with yell and arrow-twang , The ambushed savage sudden on them sprang , Till frightened by the startling musket 's crack , He vanished to his wildernesses back :  --  Few sounds , few sights but these ,  --  where now the bell Rings out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hath nestled upon Nature 's breast , Like the young infant in its evening rest . Poem section Hard was their lot . What boots it now to tell The stern and various trials which befell ? They trod no flowery walks to wealth and fame , They toiled , endured , and died  --  with scarce a name . Famine and cold and sickness and distress , A ruthless foe , peril and nakedness ;  --  Such was their life  --  and o'er their frozen graves Swept the wild winter snow , or beat the surging waves ! Poem section A stalwart band they were  --  those settlers grave :  --  ' T was not for power and wealth they crossed the wave ; ' T was not to hide like wood-flowers in the shade , That they amid these forests toiled and prayed . They were stanch hands that tilled that rocky sod , Bold , iron hearts that feared no power but God ; A band of daring , much-enduring men , Awed by no warrior 's sword , or statesman 's pen ; Bold and resistless as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shore they lash . Poem section No mines of gold , no power , no office fat , No boyish sighings for a general 's hat , No vision of wild lands and mushroom wealth , No whims dyspeptic about air and health , No Eldorado shining o'er the seas Tempted their barks to steer for shores like these . It seems reserved for our enlightened days , To see the folly of our fathers ' ways ; Those tedious modes of settling we 've outran , We modern pilgrims know a simpler plan . We emigrate to wilderness dreary , For what ? Because of staying still we 're weary ; Or sojourn in some land of milk and honey , With this one noble purpose  --  to make money . We go to speculate  --  not till the sod ; We go to worship Mammon and not God . Some of us migrate , lest the law should vex us , And go by night  --  to Iowa or Texas ; While some , with silent scorn for jails and halters , March proudly off , before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrims in the west , The oddest , wildest , laziest , and the best ; From those who go to raise the wind , or work , To those who roam with Bowie knife and dirk : Thus none can prophesy the coming weather  --  For wheat and tares seem growing there together . Poem section Not so those Pilgrims of the olden time ; No lust of sudden wealth  --  no haunting crime Pursued them from their home ; they came to seek A safe asylum , where to think and speak The deep convictions of their minds was deemed No sin  --  and where a purer spirit streamed Brightening the souls of men , than they had found In the corrupted courts on English ground . Poem section Dishonored be the attempt , Footnote : 1Kb in later days , To rob the Pilgrim of that well-earned praise , He bought from those before us , and to trace The genius that inspired him to a base And grasping thirst for power . O tell it not , When speaking of the sternness of their lot In future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coasts for aught But Truth and Freedom ! What if they abused At times this sacred treasure , nor refused To look on difference of faith as crime ? ' T was but the general error of the time ; Few saw above it  --  few had reached the creed , That all good men are Christ 's , in truth and deed . ' T was no ambitious spirit that inspired Those ocean-drifted exiles ;  --  they desired No other ends than to possess in peace A quiet home , just laws , and a release From the oppressions of their mother-clime . They knew no meaner hope . A faith sublime In the deep might of Truth  --  a patient trust In God , though he should bow them to the dust , And above all , the thought that they were free ,  --  Such was the spirit strong which winged them o'er the sea . Poem section And meet it is that we their sons should bring Unto our thoughts to day that budding spring , When the first woodman 's axe resounded wide Upon yon hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1Kb Wild was the scene  --  unknown the lonely spot , Where first they reared the rude and humble cot . Behind them sparkling in the morning , lay , Blue as the sky , yon calmly heaving bay , On whose broad breast yon capes and isles were seen , Just tinted with the hue of earliest green . No freighted ships with swift and snowy wings Drifted across that solitude of things . Only at times across the water blue Darted the Indian in his bark canoe , Or on the pebbled beach with stealthy tread Glared on the white man as his labor sped . Before them rose the forest wild  --  the pines , The oaks , the cedars hung with trailing vines . They crushed with heedless step the pale wood-flowers , With toil and fast they marked the lonely hours , They watched the savage foe  --  they felled their trees , And sang their rude chant in the evening breeze ; Then kindled they their watchfires , while the howl Of the wild wolf , the shrieking of the owl Rang on their broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to pray . Methinks I hear them in the shadows dim Singing amid the woods their twilight hymn ;  --  The words seem borne away from that old time , And weave themselves amid my humble rhyme . HYMN OF THE PILGRIMS . 1 . Hear us , almighty Father ! No light but thy great eye above us shines ! Darker and darker gather The shades of twilight through the moaning pines  --  Hear while we pray ! 2 . Hear , us , thou great Jehovah ! When , wandering through the tangled wilderness , Cloud after cloud goes over , Forsake us not in our loneliness ! Shield us to-night ! 3 . Guard us from every danger , Thou , who hast ever been our sun and shield , When trials deeper and stranger Swept o'er us , as the wind sweeps o'er the field ! O guard us still ! 4 . From the wild foeman 's arrow  --  From the dread pestilence that walks unseen  --  From sickness and from sorrow , And more than all , from hearts and lips unclean , Save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , great Spirit , All that we are and have would we commit ;  --  Not for thy children 's merit , But through thy own free grace , so clearly writ , Keep us , we pray ! Poem section And did not He who watched above them hear ? And felt they not that He was ever near ? They were not all alone  --  for God was there . And whispered peace amid their fervent prayer .  --  He who dwells not in temples made with hands , But in the heart that yields to His commands , Shone round about them  --  and the Spirit 's ray Turned all their darkest midnights into day . Poem section Yet soon a different scene is painted there ;  --  Hark ! those are not the sounds of work and prayer ! What ! are the Pilgrims dancing ! can it be That the stern Puritans make all this glee ! Are these who trowl the merry catch the same Forlorn and pious-visaged men , who came Seeking a resting place  --  a shrine for prayer ! Hark , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees are hung with blazing lights ! Is this the way they pass their days and nights ! List to the song of Morton 's jovial crew , Footnote : 1Kb While with light feet they dance away the dew . SONG OF THE REVELLERS . 1 . On with your dances free ! Raise , raise the merry glee , Drain the full cup to me , Turn night to day ! Who cares for rigid laws ? Who minds the parson 's saws ? Who heeds the bailiff 's claws ? Let us be gay ! 2 . Ring out the festive strain ! Hence with all care and pain , Pledge me the bowl again , Fill , brothers , fill ! Come on my gallants brave ! Trowl me the merry stave ! Look not so sad and grave ! We 'll have our will . 3 . Down with your church and creed ! Ours is the faith indeed  --  Ours is the life to lead  --  Live while you may ! Tread we a measure then , Fill the round bowl again , We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church 's ban , Fear not the Puritan  --  Fear not the ' salvage man , ' Let us be brave ! Then by some sparkling fount , When we our joys recount , We 'll talk of Merry-Mount By the blue wave ! Well might such sounds move the stern Pilgrim band To sweep these gilded drones from out their land ; Ill could their rigid faith endure to see This idle life  --  this midnight revelry . An odd disorganizer was the man , Who led to scenes like these this sober clan  --  He looked on men as boys just out of school  --  The " law  --  their schoolmaster , " he called a fool : His mode of schooling did not seem to suit  --  Indians he taught , not " young ideas , " to shoot . Footnote : 1Kb All things , in fine , seemed going fast to ruin , Until their neighbors saw the evil brewing  --  They caught the sheepskinned wolf who caused these pranks , And sent him back to England  --  and gave thanks . So when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more , And other settlers came of graver frame , Until the spot and town received a name . But ' t is not mine to trace along its course The stream of history from its early source . I need not chronicle the immortal names , The noble deeds and yet more noble aims , Which shed the lustre of their deathless glory Not o'er this spot alone  --  but through the story , Which proud America records , and which will shine Long as our rocks are wet by ocean 's brine . But while our thoughts are gathering brilliant dreams From the dim Past and its exhaustless themes , Let us look round us and before , to see What we now are  --  and what we yet must be . Our fathers left to us this legacy  --  And wrote it with their blood  --  all men are free . All men are free .  --  They heard these words resound , Long ere their footsteps trod this hallowed ground : They heard it like the voice of God within , When priests and tyrants threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard it when They lay like Daniel in the British Lion 's den . They heard it in the everlasting roar Of the wild sea that drove them to this shore ; They heard it in the thunder and the wind , And in the voices deep and undefined , Which spoke within their hearts , like visions bright , Calling them to obey the inner light . This was their gospel writ on flower and star , This was their creed in peace , their strength in war . It was the beacon-light to guide them on To truths , which after times have seen and won . It was their cherished faith  --  their joy  --  their pride : With this they lived and toiled  --  for this they died . And where is he who thinks that he can crush The God-lit fire of the blazing bush ! And with a little shaking of the head To put the world like a cross child to bed ;  --  To trample out like sparks the waking mind , And quench its aspirations unconfined ;  --  Who seeks by chains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth to an infant school ; When God says to the times  --  " Let there be Light ! " Where skulks the man who prays it may be night ? Let him appear  --  this dweller with the dead ! No  --  let him bury his diminished head , Live with the bats , or burrow with the moles , Nor taint the air which breathes on freeborn souls ! Vain hope ! to hide the coming of a truth , And kindle worn-out dogmas into youth . Go quench the stars !  --  go stop the rivers ' flow ! Say to the sea , " thus far , no farther go ! " Or on some height , when day begins to break , A brimstone match , a pile of faggots take , And ere the Daystar in the east hath shone , Make thee a little fire of thine own  --  Fall down and worship it  --  then turn and say To the great Sun  --  " Sun , I command thee , stay Go back , thou morning , lest thy coming bright , Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shame be to him  --  the narrow-minded man Who lets his soul to a base bigot clan ; Who , be he politician , priest , or pope , Sneers at Humanity 's undying hope ; Sets traps to kill all thoughts of untried wing , As some base sportsmen kill young birds in Spring ; Who sees no truth or good but in the past , And trembles lest the world move on too fast  --  And all who differ from himself miscalls As mystics , infidels , or radicals . If such in our free land and age there be , No friend of truth and liberty is he : He comes an age too late : let him go back , Dwell with the monks , and ply the stake and rack . No , let us guard the birthright of our sires . Quench not the living spirit which aspires After perfection ;  --  let our fathers ' tombs Be the rich soil on which our Progress blooms . He that is free must grow . That which we have Is but a mote compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And fold its shining pinions never more ! With a firm faith in freedom , goodness , truth , And in the soul 's undying power and youth , Discarding bigotry and foolish pride , Receiving fresh ideas from every side . Unchained in charity  --  severe in thought , And living in the truth our souls have caught , Let us pursue the path our fathers marked , And finish the great course on which their souls embarked . For there are times when the awakening mind , Rapt in itself with visions undefined , Longing for light , and yet unreconciled To the old creed its earlier years beguiled , Looks with unsated eye into the past , While dreams of surer truths come thronging fast ; And mounted on the knowledge it hath won  --  Yet , like the Grecian conqueror , sighs to run Another race , and gain another world  --  Or like the Genoese , with sails unfurled , Seeks o'er the boundless ocean of its thought A land of truth scarce known , though often sought . Then Persecution reigns  --  then frowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeers , The withering reproach  --  the slander vile  --  The hot anathema  --  the icy smile  --  The jail , the axe , the rack , the poison bowl , Death for the body  --  curses for the soul ; These are thy playthings  --  these thy livery , Thy noble badge  --  spirit of Bigotry ! Thou spectre hag ! who , in the holy name Of truth and dear Religion , hast with flame And madness fired the world ! Dread Sorceress , Who turnest Eden to a wilderness ! Thou who dost choke the fountains with the blood Of saints and sages  --  blackening Truth and Good With the eclipse of Hell !  --  that strikest down With thy envenomed breath and withering frown All white-winged aspirations , and uprearest Instead of them dire dreams which thou e'en fearest ; O dread unhallowed Spirit ! would that we , In this green land , might be unscathed by thee ! Would that the blighting shadow of thy wings Might ne'er have touched the soil where Freedom springs . Alas  --  thy fiery cup was poured o'er all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Yet may we hope that the enchanter 's rod Hath lightly touched the land the Pilgrim trod  --  Here where no tyrant yet hath set his foot , No Upas tree of vice yet struck its root , Where o'er each ship that wings yon deep blue sea Wave the proud stars and stripes of Liberty ;  --  Where from the meanest drudge that scours the street Up to the ruler on his velvet seat , One voice , one common hope inspires each breast , Here may thy feet , O exiled Freedom , rest . Light must still come . ' T is but our dawning hour  --  The drowsy soul must feel its godlike power . O not in morning dreams of wealth and fame , Must thou , America , pollute thy name , And while the daybreak gleams around thee , steep Thy freeborn youth in enervating sleep . ' T was not for this our venerated sires Tilled the bleak wilds , and marched through battle fire : When war 's wild night with whirlwind fury roared , When those brave hearts their blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then unborn Should doze away in dreams this peaceful morn . But by their cruel stripes while we are healed , Let us receive the light from them concealed ; Shame on us , if we think the task is wrought , And the goal won , which they so fondly sought . The scholar , priest , and statesman still must see More truth and freedom for the true and free . Truth that outlives all visionary dreams ,  --  Freedom which is  --  and not which only seems  --  And both illumined by the Light above , And sanctified by the great law of Love ; When man meets man no more with tyrant 's rod , The brother of his race  --  the child of God . And ye , bright spirits of Columbia 's sires , Ere like Elijah , rapt in heavenward fires , Ye have quite vanished from your children 's gaze , Borne on bright chariots through " the sapphire blaze , " Drop your inspired mantles ere ye go , Upon your sons who linger still below ! ' T is not enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your blest abode . We need , alas ! the wisdom and the might Which touched your prophet-souls with heavenly light . Not for the flashing sword and rolling drum , Not for the withering spell , when kings sat dumb Before your trumpet-blast and thunder-stroke , Do we your presence and your power invoke ; But for the milder spirit which impelled To labors still severer , and upheld Patriot and sage to do and suffer all , Rather than live a priest 's or despot 's thrall ;  --  For the great hope which gleamed on ye afar , In patient thought , as in the storm of war  --  For truth , for holiness , for liberty  --  These are the gifts for which we turn to ye ! Thus while we view with undiverted eyes The vistas of the past and future rise , O deep but trembling are our hopes of thee , America , thou clime of Liberty ! We fondly ask  --  while o'er thy rich expanse The crowds move on , " shall truth with them advance ? While wealth increases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smile of peace ? Shall man be false to man ? shall love of gain Fix in thy soul its desolating reign ? Shall Slavery still curse , intemperance kill , Vice rove unpunished , passions have their will ? Shall truth be fettered , and her pleadings spurned . And sweet Religion to a lie be turned ? " Soul of my Country ! if thou art not hid From thine own eyes , arouse thee and forbid A prophecy so dark ! Wake in thy might , And o'er thy youthful beauty wear the bright And spotless robe of holiness divine , That the whole world may see no brighter land than thine ! Here may the Faith , which other times denied , For which lone sages toiled and martyrs died , Be sought and valued as the purest gem , That sparkles on thy ample diadem . Here may the Hope , so long but feebly cherished In other lands , till it hath well nigh perished , Light up the heart of man with strength divine , Until another golden age shall shine . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man which over all prevaileth , Be to each soul the fixed and central sun ,  --  The smile of God , the boon denied to none  --  The eye of heaven , the sweet expanding light , The cloud by day , the shaft of fire by night ! O then , my Country , when thy tribes shall fill Each flowery valley and each wild green hill , When wealth hath purchased wisdom  --  when thy soil Lies all in bloom beneath the hand of toil ,  --  When the bright chain of love , that God hath given , Extends from heart to heart , and thence to Heaven Footnote : 1Kb  --  And all that souls prophetic dream of thee Is ripening in the smile of Liberty  --  O then , American , thy name shall shine Written in glory by a hand divine ; No blight upon thy beauty , not a shade To dim the robes in which thou art arrayed ; For He , who guided thee through storm and night , Shall be to thee an Everlasting Light .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
