txt tells us how dangerous it is to trust the administration of the state to the hands of the licentious and unprincipled . The record that has come down to us from other nations , written with their own blood , should be a warning to the free citizens of this republic to guard , with a jealous eye , the chair of office and trust . Virtue and principle in the rulers will lead to virtue and welfare among the people . There is a growing neglect on this subject in some of the commonwealths , which forebodes disaster and public evil . In the zeal and strife for success , when partisans of lofty talents are borne on by the tide of feeling , and the great assemblies of the people are excited by the voice of eloquence , there is danger that the vital principles of government will be sacrificed to the rancor and prejudice of party . It must be engrafted into the minds of the nation that government is a divine institution , whose ultimate end is the good of mankind . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be promoted ,  --  that it should send forth from its fountains streams of life and happiness through all the domain over which its influence should extend . He enjoined its constitution by no express command , but by the universal nature and necessities of the creatures whom he made . He committed to men the privilege of forming such a framework of government as their peculiar condition demanded , or their intelligence could devise ; while at the same time he wrote it as a fundamental law for their observance , that in its formation and execution it should tend to and perfect the exalted design of man 's highest good . Hence , it is plain that when the administration of the government is dependent on the suifrages of the people , those suifrages should be given in the manner that will best secure the great ends of society ,  --  the highest welfare of the subjects . Principles , not spoils , should be the price of votes . The ballots of the citizens should be the instruments of exalting the nation 's character ; of infusing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; of imparting vigor and life to its moral actions ; of sending abroad to other nations the influence and the light of an exalted patriotism and a disinterested philanthropy . There are many other subjects of a practical nature to which this discussion naturally leads , and which , by reason of the importance thrown around them at the present time , it would be interesting to examine . But the principles which have been laid down , if true , are sufficient to direct aright in all those particular questions which may be brought before the citizen . It becomes him , above all other things on this subject , to remember that government is a divine institution , whose end is the good of mankind , and to act for the promotion of that end . THE NEW POST-OFFICE LAW . IN the first number of the New Englander , the writer of this article presented to the public some remarks on the Post Office system as an element of modern civilization , and in connection with that general view , some account of the new system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already begun to attract attention in this country ; and it was our wish to do something in the way of giving impulse and direction to public opinion . To resume the subject at this time may seem to some of our readers quite unnecessary . It may be // thought that the subject , which when we first treated it was comparatively new , has now become trite and is well enough understood in all quarters . Nay , have we not already carried our point , to the extent of obtaining a satisfactory reform ? Such a feeling , we are aware , is extensively prevalent ; but it is not our feeling , and we are unwilling that it should he the feeling of any whom we can influence . We rejoice indeed in the change which has been effected , and we accept it as an omen of ultimate and entire success . But such a law as that which went into operation on the first of July last , ought not to be regarded for a moment as having the character of " finality . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commencement of a reform which can never be truly successful till it has become radical and complete . The continued discussion of this subject in every form , and in every place , in which it can be advantageously exhibited to the public mind , is the only way to secure the necessary measure of reform . No matter what party may hold the reins of government , no matter who may be President , or who may be Post-Master General , a thorough reform will never proceed from the administration , or from Congress as influenced by the motives which ordinarily govern public men-certainly not till such time as the people shall decree it , in all its particulars , with a distinctness which shall preclude the possibility of misunderstanding or evasion on the part of their servants . We have no reason to doubt that the stern politician now at the head of the department intends to give the new system a fair trial ; but we have not one particle of confidence in his disposition to carry the reform a step farther . The dead weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was so in England . There all the officials of the post office department , from the PostMaster General downward , resisted to the last the whole system of penny postage , with a resoluteness and stiffness which even our own memorable Mr. Wickliffe was not able to surpass . They were perfectly sure that the proposed reduction of postage would annihilate the revenues of the department . Their partial acquaintance with the subject made them know infallibly , as they thought , that the entire scheme which Rowland Hill had invented , would prove to be chimerical . But the people of Great Britain did not wait for the Post-Master General and his subordinates to be convinced of the necessity or the practicability of the proposed new system . They took the matter into their own hands . Arrangements were made by voluntary combination , in every part of the United Kingdom , and especially at all the great centers of business , to promote the object by the investigation of facts , and by diffusing the knowledge which was necessary to make all classes understand the multiplied absurdities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a few months , such a demand on the part of the public for the penny postage , that the party which was then in power was constrained to comply with that demand , though in so doing the administration expected to be under the odious necessity of imposing new taxes in order to make up that deficiency in the revenue which the abolition of an enormous tax on letters was likely to occasion . A similar system of combined inquiry and general agitation here , if kept clear of all connection with party politics , would soon accomplish the same result . It is in the hope of contributing something to this great public interest , that we again introduce the subject into our pages . It is not our design to examine the provisions of the new law in detail , but rather to propose and illustrate certain leading prin // ciples , disregarded by the old system and not sufficiently regarded in that modification of the old system which has just gone into operation , but which we are confident will commend themselves to the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disregarded no longer . If the principles on which the question of reform ought to be settled are fairly understood and carried out , there will be comparatively little difficulty about the details . First , then , we lay down this principle . The question in regard to postage is primarily and chiefly a question of simple justice . In some countries , and indeed in most countries , postage is professedly a taxa mode of raising money for the general uses of the government . In such countries the post-office is like the custom house , an establishment by means of which the government gets its hands into the pockets of its subjects . The government claims a monopoly of the business of carrying letters , and sometimes a monopoly of the business of carrying passengers as a branch of the same concern ; and this monopoly is claimed and exercised as a means of getting money into the treasury . Of course , under such a theory of the post-office , the question in regard to the assessment of postage will not be , What is just ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest number of people ? - but only , What will be most productive in the way of revenue to the government ? But in this country we have a different theory . With us , the government is expected to organize and maintain the post-office system , not as a government monopely for the sake of imposing a tax upon the correspondence of the people , but only as a matter of public convenience . The idea that the government , or any branch of it , is to be supported in whole or in part by the post-office department ; the idea that the department is to be saddled with any burthen whatever beyond the support of its own necessary expenses-is an idea which needs only to be fairly and frankly proposed in order to be indignantly rejected . The true theory here is that every man has a right to the use of the post-office for the transmission of whatever the post-office undertakes to transmit , on the one condition of his paying his just share of the expenses of the post-office department . The question in regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , written or printed , is simply , What is just ? what share of the expenses of the department justly belongs to this paper or pack-age ? Of course the question , What is the just charge of postage on a given paper or package , written or printed ?  --  or in other words , What share of the expenses of the post-office establishment does justly belong to that paper or package ? - must be decided by some general rules of easy application ; and those general rules must be formed with a view to the accommodation of the greatest possible number of customers , and thus with a view to the reduction of the average expense of each paper or package , written or printed , to the lowest possible rate . Justice in such a case , is neither more nor less than the nearest practicable approximation to such an assessment of postage as shall divide the expenses of the establishment , among those who use it , in exact proportion to the use which they make of it . In other words , justice requires that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of postage , as nearly as may be , just what it costs the department for reception , conveyance and delivery . Whatever inequalities there are in the assessment , should he such only as are incidental to the best general rules . If the rule is formed for the sake of inequality-if one sort of paper or package // is assessed above its known cost for the very purpose that another sort of paper or package may be conveyed and delivered at a rate below the known cost-that is palpable injustice . There are numberless illustrations of this kind of injustice in that old system which has been reformed in part , but which the parties interested in the maintenance of injustice will probably struggle hard to restore . All the franking privileges , for example , of that old system were simply gross injustice . They were nothing but an arrangement to carry and deliver , without any charge whatever , all that a certain class of men might put into the mails , and in effect also , all that they might authorize their friends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the whole expense of this was to be defrayed by an assessment upon what might be put into the mails by other men . Under the system as now modified , the franking privilege is retained in the hands of a somewhat smaller number of individuals , but without any very effectual curtailment , except what may arise from the reduction of postage , which makes the fraudulent use of the privilege less of an object than it has been . The injustice of the privilege , however , is to be somewhat diminished ,  --  or at least the injustice is to be made less gross and less offensive , by paying the postage of franked letters out of the general and more legitimate revenues of the government , instead of paying it by an oppressive tax on the letters of other and more honest men . Another and a much grosser injustice in the old system , and one which till a recent period was quite unsuspected by the mass of those who felt the burthen of it most oppressively , is by the new law entirely abolished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a system by which the unfranked correspondence of the country was taxed exorbitantly , not only for the sake of carrying the correspondence of the privileged orders for nothing , but also for the sake of maintaining lines of four-horse stage-coaches upon routes on which there were not travelers enough to support them , and in those regions of the country where the people are too lazy or too uncivilized to make roads on which a carriage of that kind can run with safety and economy . The post-office department has not merely undertaken to provide for the conveyance of the mails from one point to another , leaving it to the contractor to convey them in the way which he shall find most economical , and only regulating the number of hours which shall be allowed for the performance of the task ,  --  it has undertaken the much more expensive work of providing that the mails shall be transported on certain lines of communication in a particular kind of vehicle for the accommodation of travelers . No matter for the superior expedition and cheapness with which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of a mule , or on thn shoulders of an Indian , or in the lightest kind of two-wheeled vehicle drawn by a single horse ; the coach with the four horses , for the accommodation of here and there a passenger who would otherwise be obliged to travel on horseback , is the main thing ; and under the pretense of being paid for the conveyance of the mail , the contractor must be paid in fact for running a line of stage-coaches . Thus the people of the Northern and Middle States have been taxed by the general government for the support of lines of coaches in the South and Southwest upon roads , or rather upon routes , where stages can not be supported in any other way . And this is held to be perfectly constitutional nay , it is contended for to the last ditch by statesmen from that part of // the country , who hold that for the general government to make a road and pay for it out of the proceeds of duties on imports , or out of the proceeds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burglary as ever was committed . " Had the idea of justice been the regulating idea in the constitution of the post-office system , such an abuse as this would never have been thought of . But so far is justice from being considered in reference to this matter , there are whole districts of our country in which the great end for which the post-office establishment exists has been thought to he the maintenance of lines of coaches and the conveyance of franked documents . It was for the continuance of this gross and intolerable injustice that the battle was fought so strenuously in Congress against the measure of reform which has just gone into operation . And when that half-way reform shall prove to be unsuccessful in a financial point of view , as most probably will be the case , then we may expect another effort to saddle us again with an oppressive tax on our letters for the support of stage-coaches in those parts of the country where they have no roads worthy of the name , and no bridges , and where three out of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post-office as had that worthy Dutchman in the Legend of Sleepy Hollow , who affirmed that he never knew any good to come of this reading and writing. * Another part of the injustice of the old system nppeared in the great * It is alleged in some of the newspapers that notwithstanding the express provisions of the new law , contracts have been made in the South and Southwest by which the law is evaded , and lines of public conveyances , unsupported hy travelers , are supported at the expense of the post-office department . We do not credit the assertion . Yet it is possible that a faithful committee of Congress , appointed to inquire into the law of 1845 , might hring to light many ahuses of this kind . inequality between the postage on letters and that on newspapers . A letter with a bank note or a draft enclosed  --  the whole weighing , perhaps , one fourth of an ounce-might be taxed for postage fifty cents , while a printed sheet , weighing with its wrapper , twelve times as much might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in some cases , as for example from New York to Buffalo , for one cent . No one can fail to see that this is simply injustice of the grossest kind . Nor is this injustice abolished even now . The reduction of postage on letters to a uniform rate of three or even five cents , would have been so much of an approximation towards equality as to leave perhaps no substantial injustice . The publishers of newspapers and other periodicals being wholesale customers of the department , it would seem quite reasonable to assess a somewhat lower rate of postage upon them than upon the writers of letters . But the new system does not approximate towards justice in this particular . It has retained as fundamental in its arrangements the idea that the manufacturers of newspapers are a privileged class  --  a class who have a right to the proceeds of a tax on the writers arid receivers of letters . Accordingly , it not only secures to the newspaper publishers their old privilege of exchanging papers with each other free of all postage , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction in the postage of at least one thousand per cent . in favor of newspapers ; and for all distances over three hundred miles it makes a distinction of two thousand per cent . and in some cases of twice that amount . Nor is this all . This class of citizens , the manufacturers of newspapers , are to have the privilege , hereafter , of sending their wares to any post-office within thirty miles of the place of manufacture " without any charge whatever , " as the // 541 law has it , that is to say , entirely at the charge of the writers and receivers of letters . Certainly justice was not thought of when such a provision was incorporated with the system . There does not appear to have been a man in Congress who suspected that newspaper publishers had not a divine right to some exclusive privileges at the post-office . Is there then any reason of expediency , or public policy , which justifies the granting of these privileges to the publishers of newspapers , and the assessment of the expense on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers , on the whole , in diffusing information through society , and in making the people inquisitive and intelligent , is not in question . But are newspapers exclusively useful in their way ? Are they more useful than books ? or more useful than periodicals in other forms ? What sound reason of expediency is there for extending the patronizing hand of the national government to the New York Herald and not to the Democratic Review ? What good reason is there for giving these privileges to the publishers of the Courier and Inquirer , and withholding them from the American Review ? What reason is there for giving to some low , vile sheet , filled up from week to week with ribaldry and all sorts of incentives to vice , privileges which are withheld from the American Journal of Science ? Why should not Harpers ' illuminated Bible , or the beautiful edition of the Douay Bible issued in numbers by a Roman Catholic publishing house in New York-nay , why should not every copy of the sacred volume printed by the American Bible Society , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be carried to any point in the Union at the rate of two cents for nineteen hundred square inches of paper , as well as a weekly sheet devoted to Fourierism , or Owenism , or Mormonisrn ? Nay if a democratic newspaper , or a whig newspaper , or a liberty party newspaper is so useful in the eyes of all parties , as to justify an oppressive and odious tax for the sake of giving it a free conveyance in the mails , or a conveyance at less than cost ; why shall we not assess a provoking tax upon steamboat and railroad and stage-coach travelers , for the sake of giving extraordinary privileges of locomotion to the political orators of these various parties when they go about to meet the people face to face , and to give them that instruction by word of mouth which is so much more efficient than any thing printed can be ? Why , for example , should Mr. Sherman M. Booth 's newspaper be carried thirty miles for nothing , while Mr. Sherman M. Booth himself , traveling to attend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same object , is compelled to pay for his passage ? Or to take another kind of example , if such journals as the New York Observer , the Christian Advocate , and the Episcopal Recorder are , for their great usefulness , to be distributed over the country gratuitously or for less than cost , and the expense is to be assessed upon the correspondence of the country ; why should not the government in its zeal for doing good , extend its patronage to the bishop on his official visitation , to the Methodist preacher on his circuit , to the Presbyterian minister posting to his synod or his general assembly , to the Congregational pastor on his way to a council or an association , to any and every agent traveling for some benevolent religious institution ? Why not undertake to carry any and every such man , in the performance of his official duty , to any point within thirty miles of his home , for nothing , and to any other point within the limits of the Union , for the tenth part of what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for // these men on account of their usefulness , and pay for it by a tax upon travelers in public conveyances ? We are very far from depreciating the usefulness of newspapers . On the contrary , we believe that the common school system , even where it is best administered , is not more efficient , as an instrumentality in popular education , than the newspaper press . But we can think of something else , the value of which , commercially , intellectually , politically , morally , would not be a jot or tittle inferior to the value of the newspaper press ; and that something else is the cheapest possible uniform postage upon written correspondence , bringing all parts of the country into intimate mutual communication . Itis common to talk of the influence of newspapers in promoting industry and enterprise , in facilitating the operations of commerce , in diffusing political and general information , in elevating the moral sentiments of the people ; and the value of newspapers in all these respects is indeed incalculable , especially when considered as acting in connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions of the country . But we believe that the influence of an unlimited epistolary correspondence of individual with individual , and of family with family  --  or the influence of such a correspondence as would gradually yet rapidly spring up under the lowest possible uniform postage between New England and Ohio-between New England and Illinois-between New En gland and Wisconsin-between New England and Louisiana and Florida-nay , between New England and Texas if you please , and by and by , as soon as the roads and other prelimmanes can be completed , between New England and Oregon and California too-would be worth more than all the influence of the newspapers in diffusing knowledge , in stimulating enterprise , in facilitating commerce , in promoting good morals , in educating the people , and in binding the country together as one body , and sending the pulsations of one heart and the glow of one life to its uttermost extremities . It would be just as reasonable and politic to lay a tax on newspapers for the sake of cheap postage on letters , as it is to lay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impolicy of the arrangement in the old system and in the new , is as gross as its injustice . In this case , as in all others , true justice and true expediency run in the same direction . Simple honesty is the best policy . But some will he disposed to remind us that the British reformed system , which is commonly considered the perfection of cheap postage , carries the discrimination between letters and newspapers to an extreme , putting all the postage upon letters and none upon newspapers . We answer that we are entirely aware of that fact , and that when our government will give us a iiniform postage upon letters of not more than two cents for half an ounce , and will demonstrate by experiment that all the expenses of the department can be met by the avails of postage upon letters at that reduced rate , and not only so , but that there is a surplus revenue from postage , amounting to more than $3,000,000 , and still annually increasing , we for our part will not complain of the injustice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that case would be nothing intolerable ; - though we think it would be wise even in that case to carry a letter for one cent , and a newspaper for another cent , rather than to charge both the cents upon the letter , and break down the the mails with an unlimited freight of newspapers for nothing . But the truth is , it will never be good policy for our government to emulate the British government in car- // 543 rying newspapers for nothing , till our government shall have as good a reason for doing so as that government has . The British government has in two different ways a direct pecuniary interest in promoting the circulation of newspapers . In the first place , every newspaper sheet , whether it ever enters the l ) oSt-office or not , pays a stamp duty of more than the cost of postage , and any printed sheet that does not bear that red stamp upon it , as the sign that it has already paid its taxes , is liable to postage at the same rate by weight with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucrative that the government finds it good economy to encourage the circulation of newspapers by carrying them in the mails for nothing . It is only a mode of making the postage tax on letters increase the avails of the stamp tax on newspapers . In the next place , every advertisement , inserted in a newspaper , pays a tax of its own , quite independent of the stamp tax on the paper itself . This again makes it good economy for the government to encourage advertisers by carry . ing their advertisements in the newspapers to all parts of the United Kingdom for nothing . It makes the tax on letters operate indirectly to increase the proceeds of the tax on advertisements . We need notsay that our government has no such reason , and never can have such a reason for making letters pay postage in behalf of newspapers . Had the special privileges which the new law grants to newspapers , been accompanied with the stipulation that the newspapers in return should give gratuitous publication to the post-office advertisements in the several districts in which they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement ; and along with that justice there would have been two important incidental benefits which the present arrangement does not secure at all . In the first place , the post-office advertise . ments would be effectually publish . ed-that is , they would meet the eye of every man , woman , and child that looks upon a newspaper ; whereas now they are seen by only a few of the multitudes of readers . And in the second place , the whole question about what papers shall enjoy the distinction of publishing these advertisements and the profits of a government job , a question which now occasions so much pitiful altercation , would be effectually disposed of . The new law is better than the old one in that it relieves the post-masters of an irksome responsibility , and of the dishonor of being always obliged to judge that the paper which happens to support the administration for the time being , is the one in which these advertisements will have the greatest publicity . But it would be much better , if newspapers must needs have exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of rendering this service . In this way , too , while the customers of the department , in their capacity as writers and receivers of letters , would have been effectually accommodated , by way of compensation for their postage , so far as such advertisements are in fact for their accommodation , the expenses of the department would have been diminished by all that is now to be paid out for an inadequate amount of advertising . * Thus far we have been illustrating the principle that the question in regard to the assessment of postage is a question of simple justice . And here we might stop . For if this principle could once be established throughout the country , so effectually as to control the legislation of the * The receivers of advertised letters are indeed charged two cents on each letter for the cost of advertising , but advertised letters which remain uncalled for are still a charge to the department for advertising as well as for other expenses . // 544 The New Post-OJJice Law . country-if it could be established as an axiom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that postage is to be assessed not with a view to a revenue for the general uses of the government , nor with a view to the support of lines of stage-coaches , nor with a view to the conferring of exclusive privileges upon any aristocracy of politicians and oflice-holders , nor with a view to the special accommodation of the manufacturers of newspapers , hut simply with a view to make everything which passes through the mails pay its just share of the entire expenses of the establishment ,  --  every thing else in the system would be adjusted with comparative ease . We will however , in this connection , notice more briefly some other principles which in their place are not unimportant . In the second place then , we say that the rule of justice in the assessment of postage should he , not what the writer or receiver of a letter or of anything else can afford to pay or can he induced to pay without complaining , nor what the intrinsic worth of the mail accommodation may be to the writer or the receiver of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving , conveying , and delivering this particular article costs the government . Postage should not be assessed by the rule by which prices are determined in trade . The trader expects to sell his commodities at their value , and their value is not what they cost , hut what they will fetch in open market . This is the explanation of the phenomenon so inexplicable to children and sometimes to country customers , that dry goods ' are sold off so often at cost , ' or at less than cost , ' nay , now and then , as the advertisements assure us , without regard to cost . ' The dry goods vender understands perfectly well that the present value of the goods upon his counter , in Hartford or in Brattleborough , is determined by considerations quite independent of what he gave for them six months ago in Pearl street ; and it is perfectly right for him to sell his goods without regard to cost , for as much less than cost , or as much more , as they are noW worth in open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern in respect to the assessment of postage , and therefore the question which the government ought to ask in respect to postage , is just the reverse of that which the trader asks in respect to the price of his coinmodities . The question is not what is this service worth to the writer or receiver of a letter , or the publisher or receiver of a newspaper ,  --  but what does it cost to the establishment-what share of the expenses of the establishment falls upon this particular article ? The letter which conveys to a man the intelligence that some distant relative whom he never knew , has left him an estate of $100,000 , costs the post-office no more than a dunning letter , and for that reason it ought to pay no more postage than is charged on a dunning letter . On this principle we say that a written letter with a seal on it , but not exceeding half an ounce in weight , costs the government no more than a printed letter of the same weight without a seal ; and therefore if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents , it can afford to carry the other for two cents , and ought to do so . In the light of this principle , we can see a reason why the postage on newspapers and other printed periodical matter , when sent by the publishers to regular customers , should be less , very considerably less , by weight , than the postage on letters . The publisher of a newspaper or other periodical , if he pays postage on the sheets which he publishes , is a wholesale customer of the post-office , and therefore the department can afford to serve him at a much less rate than it can afford to serve the writer of a letter . Letters are deposited in the letterbox // one by one . One by one they must be taken out , stamped , marked , assorted for the different directions in which they are to be carried . They must be made up into bundles , and enclosed in wrappers , - this bundle for one post-office and that for another . And so from beginning to end of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the department in dealing with letters is doing a retail business of the smallest kind . The publisher , on the other hand , of a newspaper or of any other periodical , brings his papers or pamphlets to the office by the wheel-barrow load . They are already , or should be , enclosed in wrappers and made up into bundles for the offices to which they are destined ; and there is nothing to be done but to put them upon the scales and ascertain their weight , and then tumble them into the bngs for transportation . In brief , with letters the the transportation of them as freight from one office to another is the smallest part of the expense ; but with newspapers and other periodicals this is , or should be , the greatest part of the expense ; and for this reason the postage on all sorts of periodicals , if paid by the publisher in the lump at the time of putting them into the post-office , may well be very far below the postage on letters . Pre-payment of postage on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publisher , will be found essential to any equitable arrangement for the lowest possible reduction of the postage on this kind of matter . The importer of dutiable goods pays the duties at the custom house , with the expectation that his customers will repay him that expenditure ; and the duties paid become in this way , to the importer , to the retailer , and to the customer , one part of the cost of the production of those articles . So the manufacturer of any periodical which depends on the post-office for its circulation , should pay the postage with the expectation of getting it back from his customers ; and the postage would thus become , to the manufacturer and to the customer , one item in the cost of the manufacture . Would it be more satisfactory to the importer-would it operate more kindly on the interests of commerce-would it be anything less than bankruptcy to the revenue and an intolerable nuisance to the people-if the duties on imported merchandise , instead of being paid by the importer of a cargo in sums of hundreds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of publicans , in dollars and dimes , and half dimes , and in those swarthier coins which southern chivalry disdains to pay because they are too insignificant to come within the notice of a gentleman ? What wisdom is there then in attempting to collect the postage on periodicals in millions of insignificant payments from the consumers , when it might be collected from the publishers of periodicals with so much more convenience to all parties concerned , and with so much advantage to every interest . And here we insist distinctly that in this matter of posta a0 ' there should be no difference between newspapers and periodicals of other names and of more unfrequent issue . Or if there is any difference , it should be in favor of the bulkier and more unfrequent pamphlets rather than in favor of the weekly or daily sheet . The publisher of a weekly newspaper issues four sheets in a month , each weighing , we will suppose , one ounce . Four times in a month , this sheet of one ounce weight is taken in at one post-office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a month , the post-master at the place of delivery collects the postage from the subscriber , unless as a matter of mutualconvenience , the postage is paid in advance quarterly . // Suppose now these same four sheets , for the month of January are stitched together in the form of a monthly magazine weighing four ounces . What a saving of labor is this to the department . Admitting that the expense of transporting the four ounces at one conveyance is no less than the expense of transporting the four ounces in four separate conveyances ,  --  which is certainly a liberal concesslon ,  --  every other expense on the four ounces is diminished three quarters . So if the thirteen sheets which the publisher of a weekly newspaper issues every quarter , are put into the form of a quarterly review , the labor of taking in that quarterly review at one office , added to the expense of giving it out and collecting the postage on it at another office , is to the corresponding expenses on the thirteen numbers of the newspaper , as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for charging the monthly or the quarterly periodical with more postage by the ounce than is charged upon the weekly or the daily ? A third principle of great importance in the framing of a post-office system is this ,  --  Every practicable arrangement should be made with a view of reducing the postage to as low a rate as possible . The postoffice is the birthright of the million , not the luxury of the few . The million therefore have a right to demand that every arrangement which will save labor at the post-offices , and which will thus tend to make postage cheap , shall be introduced by the government with the least possible delay . In this point of view , the new law seems to us exceedingly defective . In the first place , it does not abolish the necessity of instituting an inquiry over every letter as to the distance of the place to which it is directed , and of marking the postage at one rate or another according to the distance . A uniform rate of postage saves labor at the post-office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second place , this new law contains no provisions to ensure or encourage pro-payment of postage . Nothing is plainer than that postage could be afforded much cheaper if every letter were paid for at its entrance into the office , than when every letter is taken with the risk of never being paid at all . An arrangement to secure the prepayment of postage by doubling the postage upon everything not paid for in advance , would speedily exclude a great mass of matter that now makes a great deal of trouble and pays nothing at all . In the third place , the new law contains no provision to facilitate the payment of postage in large sums by the sale of stamps to those who want to use them . A revenue of three or four millions of dollars is still to be collected in the smallest possible dribblets . And why ? Because some chivalrous ass in Cornrress brayed lustily against the indignity of proposing the use of stamps on letters to free-born Americans whose fathers protested against " the stamp act . " If there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . We propose a fourth principle , of no little consequence in a practical point of view . The idea of compelling the people to use the United States mails , for the conveyance of certain sorts of matter , when they can do better , must be abandoned as obsolete . The notion that because Congress by the Constitution has power to establish post-roads , therefore it has the exclusive right of carrying letters and newspapers and everything else which it may choose to call " mailable matter , " is one of those notions that get currency for a season , " while men sleep , " but upon examination turn out to be unreal . The federal government might deduce from the power to establish post-roads an exclusive right of carrying passengers upon any and every route or thoroughfare which // it may choose to call a post-road , as legitimately as it can deduce from that power an exclusive right of carrying letters . The only way in which Congress or the Post-Master General can permanently put down the private expresses , is to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep it there . This is not done by the new law . Postage on letters can be cheaper than it now is , and in one way or another it will be . Sooner or later , it will be half what the lowest rate now is . The quarter of a dime will one day suffice to carry a letter from Maine to Texas , nay from the mouth of the Hudson to the mouth of the Oregon . When we name two and a half cents , or a quarter of a dime , as a convenient rate of uniform postage , we imply , of course , the adoption of such arrangements on the part of government as shall make it convenient . Let postage stamps , like those used in Great Britain , or like those so recently used in this country by all the private expresses , be prepared under the authority of Congress , and sold at every post-office , and by other licensed venders wherever needed , at the rate of forty for a dollar ; and chivalry itself will soon learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . A serious objection to the reduction of postage below the smallest of our silver coins was found in the fact that in all the southern and south western states , cents are as much unknown to white men as cowries . But give us the convenience of a postage stamp , at the rate of two for a half-dime , and that difficulty will be obviated . Should Congress also cause a coin to be struck , of the same value-not copper , nor silver , for a silver coin of that value would be too small , but of some suitable mixed metal which would permit it to be not larger than a dime-such a measure would supply an obvious defect in our present system of coinage . It was well shown by Mr. Adams in his celebrated " Report on Weights and Measures , " that though the decimal arrangement has very great advantages , the most popular system , or in other words the most convenient to the people at large in their daily transactions , is that which admits of constant division and subdivision by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and measures-and coins come into the same category - is one which combines the decimal method of division and subdivision , with equal facilities for halving and quartering . Accordingly , our coinage provides for a division by halving as low as the half dollar . In gold we have eagles , half eagles , and quarter eagles ; and the quarter eagle , the smallest gold piece , is easily halved in silver . So in silver we have the dollar , the half dollar , and the quarter ; but there this kind of division is interrupted . The necessity of halving the quarter of a dollar keeps in circulation that old worn out Spanish piece , which the Yankees call a ninepence , New Yorkers a shilling , and Philadelphians a levy . But , in deference to the same law of convenience which is overlooked in this instance , the mint , when it gives us dimes , forgets not to give us also half-dimes . But give us now this one coin morethe postage-penny , of the value of a quarter of a dime ; and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar and a quarter , so the quarter of a dollar will be halved by a dime and a quarter , without employing the idiot head of a Spanish Bourbon or the deformity of the Mexican cactus . Such a coin would circulate everywhere ; and cents would be of little use , except with children to buy sugar plums , and with misers to put into the contribution box . We have one more criticism to offer upon this new law . It will fail because it does not meet the actual exigency . It is only a law for a partial reduction of postage . // It is only an attempt to patch up the existing system instead of creating a new one . A true statesmanship , we think , would have seen that the entire system of the post-office department must ere long he reconstructed , and would have instituted legislative inquiries with a view to its being re-constructed in accordance with the recent advancements of civilization . The present law may reasonably be accepted as a temporary expedient  --  a first step of progress ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does not go far enough to be successful . It is an attempt to graft cheap postagewhich yet is not cheap enough to stimulate epistolary correspondence sufficiently-upon an old system , which , administered so long by unscrupulous party politicians for party purposes , has become one great system of political corruption . Let the people institute the inquiry whether some system can not be contrived for the appointment and accountability of deputy post-masters , or rather of men to do the work now committed to those funetionaries ,  --  which shall secure the services of competent and responsible men at the cheapest rate of compensation , instead of committing that office to noisy and vulgar politicians , to whom the pay and perquisites are not simply a fair com pensation for the labor performed in the office , but a reward for party services past , present , and to comeLet the people inquire what is the actual duty which the Constitution imposes upon Congress by giving to that body the power to establish post-roads , and whether the chief part of that duty has riot been , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one solitary instance- Let such points be discussed by the people and before the people , and we shall have light . the necessity of a new system will become palpable , and the outlines of the true system will gradually shape themselves before the public eye . Then , at last , and not till then , the national legislation will reform this great mass of systematized abuses , by utterly removing it . Whether this new law-which we regard as nothing else than a half-way measure destined to be merely temporary-shall be superseded , and that speedily , by a measure of thorough and complete reform , or shall be superseded by a full restoration of the old system in compliance with the clamor of thousands who will hunger after the unclean profits of old abuses ,  --  is a great question in regard to the future progress of American civilization.
