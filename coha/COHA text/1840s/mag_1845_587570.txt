txt WE have refrained hitherto from any notice of these volumes , not because we were ignorant of their interesting contents or insensible to the influence which Lord Eldon 's life has exercised , and is destined to exercise , upon the opinions of men . In these particulars , no hook has appeared for years so abundantly commended to public attention . But we under-lie the misfortune of not being of Lord Eldon 's admirers-and we had no hope of a favorable hearing for our opinions while the ears of the world , were occupied with the lamentations of his friends , and the eulogies of his partisans . There is always a fever of laudation that sets in upon the decease of conspicuous men , especially if they have enjoyed the control of a large official patronage . This fever is not of a dangerous type , if permitted fairly to have its course . Resistance , however , aggravates it . If left to nature it subsides without working much harm . In the case of Eldon , this fever has had its course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glqyification has been omitted , it must be ascribed neither to the indifference of his friends , nor the resistance of his enemies . But the time has arrived finally , we believe , when we may be permitted to scrutinize a little the evidences of Eldon 's claim to the rewards of a just man made perfect , without violating the honest fame of an illustrious man , or seeming too regardless of the sensibilities of those who are interested in its preservation . It is our duty , by every consideration , to enter upon this scrutiny at the earliest opportunity . We know full well that compliments to the dead , engraved upon tombstones rarely change or beget opinions , and that eulogies over the grave are equally harmless ; but when , in process of time , the example of the deceased may be woven into the texture of affairs , to give them color and dimension , it becomes of the last importance that the public sentiment be shaped by other influences than those which gather to the house of mourning or the grave . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the following pages , we do not for a moment think of questioning his extraordinary capacity . Though not a symmetrical man , he was a great man , and his example for good or for evil  --  the latter especially-was proportionately powerful . When we say he was great , we mean merely , that he proved himself to have the abilities which few other men possessed , of achieving what most men would desire to achieve . Though his successes were in our judgment not unfrequently the result of the cooperation of his capacities with his deficiencies , yet without the former , the latter had been unavailing  --  and the reverse we believe , is equally true . If John Scott had not been avaricious , selfish , and wholly destitute4 of magnanimity , he would never have been Lord Eldon , nor would he ever have achieved any considerable distinction . By which we desire it may be inferred , that in our judgment , Lord Eldon 's intellectual characteristics were not more strongly marked than his moral ; and that in seeking the key to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constrained to think the most repulsive part of his nature-his moral constitution . Though he was a man guiltless of any notorious vice , respectful of all the moral convenances of English society , and of the ordinations of the church by act of Parliament established ; yet we feel bound to ascribe to his moral deformities nearly everything which is exceptionable in the lesson of his life . Mr. Twiss , the biographer of Lord Eldon , is his sworn and inexorable friend and defender . From such a quarter we may feel sure that no injustice has been done to the fame of the illustrious ex-Chancellor . And everything may be presumed to have been said in his defence which circumstances would aCmit of . We have read the bi // ography through with great attention twice , that we might be sure that we had derived a permanent impression ; and our conclusion is , that he whose boast it was to have held the Great Seal of the United Kingdom of Great 3ritain and Ireland longer than any Chancellor , was , with all his other endowments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , avaricious and deceitful ; a hypocrite , a sycophant , and a coward . We are well aware that men 's feet are not more variable in size than are their standards of right and wrong ; and that while all agree in approving the one and disapproving the other , yet all would probably disagree upon the rectitude of some particular act which might occur in their respective experiences . We should not , therefore , assume that in the examination to which we propose to subject the life of Lord Eldon , that our readers will agree with us in our estimate of all the acts which seem to illustrate his moral peculiarities . It will be our purpose simply to furnish our readers with the same opportunities for judging that we enjoyed ourselves , without attempting to sway their opinions by recourse to any facts or arguments which can not be verified at once by reference to the volumes before Again us . Nor shall we attempt to favor our case by making out each charge in succession ; we shall adopt the chronological arrangement which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classify those facts as he shall see fit . As the child is sometimes father of the man , we will begin with the infancy of Eldon , and , if possible , discern the tendency which he then exhibited . He has himself left the following passages of his experience before he was 10 years old " I think , " said Lord Eldon to Mrs. Foster , " I write remarkably well , considering how I played truant from the writing school . I remember Harry and 1 , going home one evening , found my father in the dining room . Harry , ' said he , were you at the writing school today . ' Oh yes , papa , ' answered Harry . And were you there , Jack ? ' Now you know my elder brother had said yes , so what could I do but follow his example ? So I said yes , papa . ' And were you there yesterday ? ' Yes , sir . ' And the day before ? ' Yes , sir . ' And the day before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Benson ; ' and from behind the door out walked our writing master , who had come down to complain that we had not been at his school the whole week . We were twice flogged for that , once by my father and once by Mr. Benson . " Vol. i. , p. 3*3 . " I remember , " said Lord Eldon , " my father coming to my bedside , to accuse Harry and me of having robbed an orchard ; some one had come to complain . Now my coat was lying by my bed with its pockets full of apples , and I had hid some more under the bed-clothes , when I heard my father on the stairs : and I was at that moment suffering intolerable torture from those I had eaten . Yet I had the audacity to deny the fact . We were twice flogged for it . " Mr. Foster adds , " when any of his boys were not down stairs at the proper time in the mornin , , Mr. Scott used to ascend to their room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delinquent 's shoulders . Harry and Jack be rather fond of their beds , and apt to receive his chastisement pretty often , determined upon stealing the taws , an exploit they successfully achieved . " Vol. i. , p. 41 . " We used when we were at the Head school , early on the Sunday mornings , to steal flowers from the gardens in the neighborhood of the FORTH , and then we presented them to our sweethearts . " Eldon signalized his career at Oxford by assisting in cutting down a fine tree in All Saints Churchyard , by night , because it intercepted , in one direction , the view of a sick professor : and also by passing off himself and his friend Reay as noblemen , that they might get admission into a house which had been recently finished by a gentleman who had shown some unwillingness to have it exhibited . They were detected , and much rejoiced to retain the privilege of running away , of which they availed themselves incontinently . In his twenty-first year , Eldon eloped with Miss Surtees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunate , yet every circumstance attending its formation was as unpromising as his worst enemies could have desired . He obtained the affections of // this young lady clandestinely , not to say deceitfully , and married her in the same way . He was at the time without money , profession , or any means whatever of support . In a letter to his friend Reay , he darkly insinuates an excuse , which is sufficient for his marriage , but which inculpates him far more deeply than the apparent improvidence of such a step . " You have long known me , Hal ; you will not suspect me of dissimulation , if , where there is so little occasion for any other arguments to disarm you of any suspicions with respect to the rectitude of my conduct , I further assert , in general terms , that I have oniy acted the unavoidable part . I can not honorably descend to such particulars as may prove the assertion . " If we rightly apprehend the meaning of this letter , we can not but think that Mr. Twiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of the dead , by suppressing it . As poverty is ever propitious to the instinct of philoprogenitiveness , in the course of time , Scott had children . Their third child was inoculated for the small pox at about seven months age . Sir Win . Scott-brother of Sir John thus notices the event , and Sir John 's deportment , in a letter to their brother Harry : the pistol lately , by a worthy person who has found out in the year 1792 , that I abused him in a speech in 1759 , and which he never complained of before , though he heard me make it , and I have been his counsel in all his causes ever since . The truth is , three courts thought his conduct so bad that they made him pay a young man of whom they declared he had taken undue advantage , ? 17 , bOO . and all costs , and the fellow is fool enough to suppose he can retrieve his character by insulting me . I have acted at the written . request of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done and all I have declined to do . Thc thing has given me a deal of plague , but I hope it will be over soon . " " The troublesome person mentioned in this letter , " says Mr. Twiss , " was a member of Parliament named Macreth . Sir John Scott , by the advice of his friends at the bar , declined to meet such an antagonist in the way proposed , and put a stop to the annoyance by an appeal to the law . The challenger was convicted of a breach of the peace , and sentenced to the Court of Kings Bench , in the following May , to six week 's imprisonment and a fine of ? 100 . " This is all the explanation of the affair in which Sir John was , as he says , " tempted to the use of the pistol , " though certainly to a most harmless one . One might be led to think , by the way this troublesome fellow is shouldered off to jail , that he was crazy or an idiot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the earliest period " compatible with the well-being of the slaves themselves , with the safety of the colonies , &amp;c. , &amp;c . " " The Chancellor supported the resolutions , questioning , however , the broad assertions that the state of slavery was contrary to the genius of the British Constitution , and to the spirit of the Christian religion . " He could not relinquish his right as an Englishman and a Christian to make slaves when they should be required , though in the cases under consideration he would favor emancipation . That we may do neither more nor less than justice to the character of Eldon 's parliamentary policy , we shall enumerate most of the leading measures with which he was concerned as a legislator , with a glance at the parts he took in disposing of them . It should be borne in mind that Eldon was made Attorney General while all Europe was heaving with revolutionary opinions . The successful issue of the American war had spread the contagious influence of political radicalism throughout Europe , and consequences apparently the most disastrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be threatening the constitutions of all the European powers . Blind to the true signification of all this movement , Sir John felt no emotion but that of hatred to all who were concerned in it . He knew no way of resisting their claims but by oppressing them . It was on the 15th of March , 1793 , that he introduced the " Traitorous Correspondence Bill " which was the first of a series of bills of his devising , which were intended to revive , and , indeed , in some instances to aggravate , the restrictions upon the liberty of the subject , which made the legislation of the Revolution and of the Restoration so odious and oppressive . In a few months after , he advocated the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act , which was continued upon his motions for several successive years . It was in the same year that he instituted the famous prosecutions of Home Tooke and others for high treason , all of which were unsuccessful . In the Session of 1795 , he introduced the " Seditious Meetings Bill " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed like the preceding bills of a kindred character , against the stern and indignant opposition of all the liberal-minded statesmen in Parliament . In 1799 , Sir John is made Chief Justice of the Common Pleas , Baron of Eldon , and takes his seat in the House of Lords . His first speech in the upper house , characteristically enough , was made on the th'ird reading of a bill which passed in 1800 , for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act . In the following year , Lord Eldon succeeds Lord Loughborough , as Chancellor . During the first Session of Parliament after his accession to this new dignity , he addressed the House of Lords at great length in favor of the bill disqualifying persons in holy orders from sitting in the House of Commons . The entrance of the Rev. Home Tooke into that body was the proximate cause of the bill , and Eldon 's former failure to convict him of treason , made him now none the less anxious to disappoint the reverend agitator of any laurels he might reasonably have hoped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Lord Grenville in the House of Lords , and Mr. Fox in the House of Commons called the attention of the country to the claims of the Roman Catholics , by presenting petitions from the leading men of their body in Ireland . It may not be impertinent to mention here , that one of the leading objects of the parliamentary union of Great Britain and Ireland , which was consummated during the former administration of Mr. Pitt , in 1798 , was to make it practicable to relieve the Roman Catholics of that country from their numerous and oppressive disabilities . So long as the two kingdoms had distinct legislatures , to open Parliament and office to the Roman Catholics in Ireland ( where they were three-fourths of the constituent body ) , would be to make the Irish Legislature essentially Roman Catholic , and eventually to substitute the Romish for the Protestant Church in that country . By a unio* and identification , however , of the legislative power of the two kingdoms it was supposed that the aggregate majority of Protestants would prevent any such consequence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholics would then become practicable . It was under this conviction that Pitt urged and effected the legislative union , and it was in attempting to derive the beneficial consequences to the Catholics // which we have just suggested , that he was forced to resign his place at the head of the Government , through the obstinacy of the king , which gave rise to the Addington ministry . Eldon , to whom the wishes of the king were far more controlling than Mr. Pitt 's , quictly holds on , and lays the foundation in the closet counsels of His Majesty for the following well-earned compliment from Mr. Twiss " To no one individual so eminently as to Lord Eldon , was owing the long and successful resistance maintained against the Roman Catholic claims . " True enough it is , that from the day when the petitions to which we have before alluded , were presented by Grenville and Fox , down to the very close of his long life , he never ceased to cry aloud against the toleration of any other than the Established Church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , in 1842 , Lord , Lansdowne moved the second reading of a bill allowing Unitarians to marry in their own churches , and was supported by the Archbishop of Canterbury-the more conscientious Chancellor declared that he could not concur with the most reverend Prelate on this important subject . The Unitarians denied the doctrine of the Trinity . They must not be permitted to marry or to be given in marriage while they countenanced such a fatal heresy . Let them burn at the stake , or in single blessedness-in spite of Saint Paul 's recommendation to the contrary-rather than be permitted to contract a marriage with only the sanction of a believer in a single God . His %appOsition was successful , by a majority of 39 . Thus far Eldon 's parliamentary career has only displayed his legislative capacities . In 1807 , he furnished posterity a specimen of his administrative faculties , which presents his morale in , if possible , a yet more striking aspect . The seizure of the Danish fleet in the harbor of Copenhagen during the fall of that year , unquestionably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numerous acts of foreign oppression of which that nation has ever been guilty , always excepting , of course , her recent invasion of China . The Government affected to fear that Bonaparte intended to press into his service the Danish fleet , which was lying at Copenhagen , for an attack upon England . To counteract this project , the English Government determined to treat with Denmark as they usually have treated with weaker powers , by fitting out a powerful armament , both naval and military , and sending it to the waters in the neighborhood of the party of the second part . At the same time sending an Envoy with instructions to request from the Court of Denmark , a peaceable surrender of the Danish fleet to the British Admiral under a solemn stipulation that it should all be restored upon the conclusion of the war between Great Britain and France . Of course the Danes were frightened and indignant . They refused , and Copenhagen was invested by sea and land . Over a thousand people were slaughtered , a fourth of the city was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Danes were obliged to capitulate after a few days ; the vessels were taken with all the equipments found in the neighboring arsenals and storehouses , brought to England and quietly appropriated to the aggrandizement of the British navy . When at the proper season , it was moved in Parliament by Lord Sidmouth that " no measures should be taken with respect to these ships which might preclude their eventual restitution to Denmark , agreeable to the spirit of the proclamation to the commanders , " Lord Eldon opposed it , and all restitution whatsoever , maintaining that they were lawful spoils of war . In reference to this disgraceful transaction , Lord Eldon , many years afterwards , related the following characteristic anecdote . " Do you recollect when we took the Danish fleet during the war , Mrs. Foster ? We had no right whatever to do so , hut we were ohliged , or it would have fallen into the hands of Bonaparte . We deemed it a matter of necessity . Well we sent an Ambassador , I think it was Mr. Jackson , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ambassador waited on George III . on his return , the King abruptly asked him , Was the Prince Royal up stairs or down when he received you ? ' He was on the ground floor please your Majesty . ' I am glad of it-I am glad of it for your sake , ' rejoined the King , for if he had half the spirit of George III . he would infallibly have kicked you down stairs ! ' " // Robbing the Danes of their ships , in admitted violation of every principle of justice , was sufficiently infamous , but their detention , when the pretence for taking them no longer existed , was an act which can not be characterized by any term too opprobrious . It should have stamped every party to it as a felon in the sight of man , as it must in the sight of God . We hope we may be pardoned for alluding for a moment in this connexion to the burst of indignation which arose from this virtuous people , who are to this day enjoying the fruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a distinguished statesman-whose loss this country has recently been called to deplore-announced among other reasons for the annexation of Texas to the United States , the danger of having an independent power so close upon our border in the event of a foreign war . One would have supposed they had never heard of the law of self-protection among nations ,  --  that the idea of disarming a friendly nation to prevent accidents was unknown in their annals . We proposed to annex a willing people , upon whom we must inevitably confer more benefits than we could hope to receive , not by force of arms or in opposition to their will , but by a liberal treaty , to which they all would look forward with delight . There is scarcely an inch of territory belonging to the British dominions , not excepting the soil on which her capital is planted , which has been acquired so honestly , so decently , or with such substantial respect for the rights of other nations , as the territory of Texas by the United States . On the 26th of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lords , for preventing grants of offices , in reversion , which of course his lordship opposed . This is a species of political iniqoity , of which our country is free and our people ignorant , though we are ruled by the " licentious democracy . " Its title , however , will explain the purpose of the bill , and the inconvenience of its passage to those whose province it was to dispense the patronage of government . Four years later , Eldon was found occupying the same hostile attitude towards a bill sent up from the Commons " to suspend , until the next session , the granting of offices in reversion , " a similar suspension act having been passed in the preceding session . In the course of the Lord Chancellor 's speech , he said : " The noble earl talked of the wisdom of the other House of Parliament . It was a wonderfully wise way of legislating , truly , after their lordships had six times rejected a permanent bill on this subject , to send them up annually a bill of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole measure . " From which statement it appears , that while the people had been calling for more than four years for protection from the abuse of such a privilege by the government , Eldon had as steadily resisted their call , and treated the repetition of their complaints as additional ground for rejecting their petitions . But that our readers may witness Eldon 's statesmanship and philanthropy most harmoniously blended , we beg to direct their attention to his ever consistent and inflexible heathenism upon the subject of capital punishments . This branch of the criminal law had begun to receive much attention through the active zeal of Bentham , and Romilly , and Brougham , and their less distinguished associate reformers , who were striving to mitigate in some measure its brutal severity ; and in 1810 , Romilly had carried through the lower house , a bill to abolish the punishment of death in cases of privately stealing to the amount of Jive shillings in a shop . When the bill came to the House of Lords , the Lord Chancellor in a lengthy speech opposed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the movement was based . In the following year , he spoke at length against a bill which went to remit the capital part of the penalty for privately stealing to the value of 40s. in a dwelling house , Upon the second reading of a similar bill in 1818 , the Chancellor declared that his objection to its principle was unchanged . In 1830 , he opposed the abolition of capital punishment " for the forgery of negotiable securities , stock transfers , or stock receipts , " on the ground that this " was not an offence to be treated lightly " - certainly an acute and learned distinction to take between this and other offences against man 's social rights . In 1832 , this subject was presented // again to the House of Lords by the Lower House , in a bill for abolishing the punishment of death in cases of horse stealing and stealing to the value of ? 5 in a dwelling house . " According to his experience , the fear of death did very often operate to prevent the commission of those crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly not very startling or novel proposition , he proceeds to invoke his professional experience , and proves his proposition with all the success that might be expected , considering the difficulties he had to encounter , but entirely forgetting that his proposition was not at all quod erat demonstrandum . He was eighty-one years of age at this time and very much broken , we are bound to say in his justification ; though we look in vain for any symptom of an excuse for the diligent and almost fiendish obstinacy , with which he threw himself in the way of all the efforts of much wiser and better men than himself , to amneliorate this criminal code for the twenty years previous . We fear we fatigue our readers by these details , but it should be borne in mind that Eldon was at the head of the government , or attached to it , during very nearly all his parliamentary life , and consequently that in nearly every leading measure with which his name is associated , his policy was sustained by daunting majorities ; and we present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how much evil may be accomplished by a single statesman without rendering his name infamous among men , and without bringing upon him any of the penalties of the criminal code of his country , which would hurry a man to the gallows for stealing a hat . This sketch would be very imperfect without some notice of Eldon 's judicial delays , which were so notorious as to have made his name a byeword among the members of the bar . We shall plead the notoriety of this feature of his judicial career , and the length to which our strictures have already extended , for being very under which England groaned for about twenty years , and which shows how , in the felicitous language of Sidney Smith , " Lord Eldon and the Court of Chancery pressed heavily on mankind . " The recep tion he gave to a motion by Sir Francis Burdett , in the House of Commons , " That there be laid before this House a list of all causes that have been heard by the Lord Chancellor during the last eighteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time when heard , " &amp;c. , will exemplify in a measure , the nature of the judicial oppression . This order , says Mr. Twiss , passed the Commons without a word of observation . Would any one think of treating such a motion as an act of captiousness , intended merely for annoyance and for political effect ? So Lord Eldon affected to esteem it , and resented it with vehemence , in a letter to Lord Liverpool , the Prime Minister , of which the following is an extract : " I find myself placed in my court , by this proceeding , in a state in which it is unfit that a Chancellor should be , and , with respect to the public , Ifear I am doing very wrong , in letting down the dignity and respect due not to me , but to the Chancellor , who holds an office which should be filled with a person respected by the public , and protected , if he deserves so to be , against resolutions which clearly mean to impute or to lay the grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I have every feeling of good will and kind regard towards every individual with whom I am associated as a servant of his Majesty and I trust I need not mention what are my feelings towards yourself  --  but to all of them and to you I owe it as a duty to take care that the abuse thrown upon me daily , should not through me affect their and your utility . What obedience to that vote might furnish of information with respect to my conduct I know not , but if it furnished all that I could wish , the mischief that must be done before its result could be known is incalculably great . That in the course of eighteen years , for such is the period to which this vote refers , I can not doubt ( I can not however hot hope that they may be such as my general conduct in office might atone for ) that there may be many things represented as omissions of duty during eighteen years which are not such , but which it is impossible to find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obvious . I can not doubt that the multiplicity of my engagements may have led to omission and neglect as to some of them . " Under these circumstances , my dear lord , I wish very much to know now whether the motion of Sir F. B. if it does not require renewal , is to be discharged // by government by any proceeding when the House meets or if it does require renewal , whether it is then to be suffered to be renewed without opposition on the part of the government . My object in seeking this now , is that I may so apply myself ( without engaging further than I must in this new business ) to what is depending , as to be able to retire about the time of Parliament meeting , if the King will graciously please to dismiss me , and not theo to leave causes which have been heard , to be either heard over again , or the judgments of a retired Chancellor to be given in fact though not in form , as I myself have formerly acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F 's motion was passed ( at least I sincerely so believe ) without on the part of the government or its friends , any ill will , I can almost say without any positive inattention to me but by actual surprise ( ? ) The effects , however , the evil effects of it are very great , as great as if the causes of it were different ; and many have been the mortifying inquiries made of me by those who do not know how this happened ,  - -  to account for not having as they supposed , one person in the House of Commons to say one word against such a proceeding for of the fact that this was effected by surprise the public can not be conversant . If out of office , I ca n't take the situation of Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords  --  but I should attend the Scotch causes , and I might be voted into the chair as a peer . " I am , my dear Lord , " Most sincerely , Your attached friend and servant , ELDON . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House of Commons to ask a list of all the arguments of eighteen years ' standing , yet undecided , in his Lordship 's court . The gross impertinence of such curiosity " lambs could not forgive , nor worms forget . " Suppose they did wish to re-organize , and strengthen the judicial force of the Chancery Court , they have no right to make his clerks answer questions which would subject him to censure . Besides , he could do up the arrears if he were only kept in Lord Chancellor long enough , and the House of Commons would attend to their own business . Time was all that was required , and change , least of all such change as they would bring , was most to be deprecated . In the foregoing letter our readers may judge Chancellor Eldon out of his own mouth ; in the following case they may judge him out of the mouth of his biogiapher : for the latter admits all the facts in the following letter which are material to the case , barring the death from a broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parties , in the case of Ware vs .

Ilarwood-My LordMy clients have great reason to complain of the great injury suffered by them in consequence of these causes not keeping their station at the head of your Lordship 's paper , agreeably to your Lordship 's order , repeatedly given in my hearing . It is now nearly seven years since they have been waiting for your Lordship 's judgment ; and upwards of two years ago they had arrived at the top of the paper , at which place I humbly entreat they may , until you can decide upon them , remain . There is a fund of ? 1U , OOO and upwards locked up in Court until your Lordship decides in these causes , and it is , therefore , matter of great importance to my unfortunate clients that your Lordship 's decision may not be delayed by the circumstances to which I have above alluded . It is painful to me to state to your Lordship that I have learnt from authority which I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit these suits were instituted , twenty years ago , died of a broken heart , on account of being kept out of his property , and that I have to contend against the bitter feelings of his relations . Under these distressing circumstances , knowing that your Lordship will pardon the liberty I have taken in thus addressing you , and which nothing but the imperious necessity of the case would have induced me to have done . I have the honor , &amp;c . " The Edinburgh Review of October , 1823 , after giving this letter , proceeds thus " The Solicitor was immediately sent for to the private room of the Chancellor , and attendances on his Lordship upon this very singular and special mission were charged in the bill of costs , one item of which ran in the following form : To attendance upon his Lordship in his private room , when his Lordship begged for farther indulgence till to-morrow . ' The thing went on , his Lordship , having begged and obtained farther respite , was as good as his word , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Twiss has no defence for this which does not substantially admit all , the facts . We need not say that the // facts being admitted the charge admits of no defence . Again : we quote from Mr. Twiss . " The Chancery Commission of 1824 brought to public notice another instance of a judgment unreasonably delayed , of which it may be proper very briefly to state the circumstances . It was in the case of Erskine v. Garthshore , mentioned by Mr. Leake , on his examination before that Commission . From November , 1816 , when the Chancellor heard it , expressing his opinion and promising to give the judgment in form within a few days , the parties had allowed the matter to sleep until 1820 ; and as the Chancellor had at the hearing intimated his view , which was generally found to satisfy the parties without a formal judgment , there had been no great reason to suppose that the formal judgment would ever be called for . On this occasion , however , the matter was not destined to adjust itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Leake , who was himself one of the solicitors in the cause , wrote to the Chancellor , humbly entreating ' his lordship 's judgment . Meanwhile the papers having been removed ( it does not appear how or when ) from the table which the Chancellor allotted to his unfinished judgments , he had dismissed the cause from his mind as one that bad been settled between the parties themselves . He wrote the following answer to Mr. Leake " In the case of Erskine v. Garthshore , the papers were long ago taken from my table . I have desired Mr. Hand ( an official attendant of Lord Eldon ) to make an inquiry for them ; and , understanding from your note that I have been mistaken in supposing that that cause was arranged , as soon as I get the papers I will dispose of it . " Yours with much respect , " It should seem that the papers were never recovered : for , at the time of Mr. Leake 's examination in 1825 , the judgment had not been given , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ( as in the instance of Ware v. Harwood ) if the materials for it had not been extinct . " peared in the eyes of the illustrious Chancellor and his faithful biographer . We will remark , however , that it has been esteemed of sufficient weight to constitute a precedent even in a court of our own country in later times . An illustrious judge of this city-yet bearing his garlands and judicial robes about him , doubtless with Eldon 's sufficing example before his eyes-lost the papers in a case by which the counsel were kept waiting months and years for a decision . One day , his servant in getting some wood from the pile , discovered the long-lost papers , and brought them to his Honor , who sagaciously remarked on returning them , with his explanation , to the counsel , " So you see they wer'nt lost , for I was sure to burn down to them . " It will be observed that Mr. Twiss considers the Chancellor fully defended in this transaction by the fact that " at the hearing he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfy the parties without a formal judgment , " and therefore , that " there had been no great reason to suppose that the formal judgment would ever be called for . " The practitioners in his court seemed pretty well to understand his Lordship 's habits , when they went off satisfied with an intimation of his views . People are said sometimes to be satisfied when they have enough , and some tunes when they have all they can get . The latter is the kind of satisfaction we presume to which Mr. Twiss refers , and which Lord Eldon was mostly in the habit of granting to his suitors . It has been so much the custom abroad to answer every charge against Eldon 's judicial delays , by invoking his " spotless integrity , " that we feel justified in presenting to our readers the sentiments entertained and expressed on this subject by some of his contemporaries who were fully responsible for what they said , and who neither spoke heedlessly nor without regard for the great fame which they impeached . The writer , it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which at this distance of time we are prepared to adopt as demonstrated con-clusions " But it seems that the spotless integThis exc qwq understand it , that , in pronouncing his judgments , he stands free from all suspicion of personal corruption , the compliment is surely of a very homely texture . That which is common to so many can no longer operate as a distinction . If , as there is too much reason for believing , that judges of former times did not stand clear in their great office , that fashion of depravity at least has long since passed away . To doubt of Lord Bacon 's lamentable infection is , we fear , hopeless and impossible ; yet was such conduct , even in those days , distinguished by its singularity , and stigmatized as an exception ; while the admirers of Bacon , if they are compelled to admit that sordid vice which condemns him as the meanest of mankind , find a refuge for his character in his nobler qualities , and appeal to all posterity that he was also the wisest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he was not disturbed and hindered by the influence of the Court , which was then , it seems , the prevailing stumbling-block , and where the parties , Samuel Smith and Joseph Jones , had no more properties of attraction or repulsion than the letters of which their names were composed , was himself an upright judge . Every age has its peculiar habits and manners , and a train of thinking , in a great degree , conformable to them ; and that which nobody imagines can possibly be done , becomes in a little time , morally speaking , impossible . To affirm of the learned judges of the land , from the Chancellor downwards , in these our days , that they have not an itching palm ' - that they do not take provoking gold in either hand ' - that , when they are holding the scales of justice , they do not allow the instrument of corruption to be cast into either to falsify the account ,  --  - is indeed , true , but , as a subject of commendation , is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a man of the first condition and character in the country , that he can walk up and down St. James 's , or ( what perhaps would be more to the purpose ) Lombard street , twice a day , without ever attempting to thrust his band into a single pocket . To feel , that however ( unfortunately for the other part of his character ) he may he in the cabinet a politician , he is a lawyer on the seat of judgment , and to act accordingly : -  --  to look down , from that great elevation to which his merit or his fortune has raised him , upoA the subjected profession with care , and watchfulness , and impartiality :  --  to cultivate that profession to which , whatever others may think of it , he owes all his honors and and all his prosperity , and to advance it , if possible , in credit , and dignity , and public esteem : -  --  to deal with every man , placed under his great and absolute power , according to his merits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chase away the assiduities of interest , and the importunities of power , if they should attempt to traverse the even and lofty tenor of his course :  --  to obtain a noble victory over jealousies , and animosities , and resentments , if such should assail him , and to render the transcendant dignity of the officer superior to the natural , and , therefore , inevitable , frailties of the man . This , in our humble apprehension ,  --  - this is the only integrity that should be spoken of as honorable to a Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain . Of the twopenny integrity , more common infinitely than copper coin , and therefore less valuable , which has not only never been denied , but has never come into question , we shall , for that reason , say no more . "  - -  Ed . Rev. , 1824 . If space permitted we would have been glad to have touched upon many other points in Lord Eldon 's career , not less salient than those we have already indicated . In particular , we would have referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about the formation of the Pitt ministry , and also during the debate in the House of Commons on his attack made from the woolsack upon Abereromby 's veracity . We should have noticed the roasting he received in the House of Lords for fixing the Great Seal to Bills during the King 's in sanity . His base desertion of Queen Caroline to whom he was bound by every personal and professional consideration-to become the servile instrument of her royal oppressor . His appointment of Sir William Garrow as Attorney General and Judge in the Court of Exchequer , whose professional qualifications he himself made a scoff of . His affectations about the fatigues of office , and his disinclination thereto , in connexion with the childish mortification he expressed at not being invited to take part in the Wellington Ministry in 1828 , when he was in his 77th year . But it is idle to proceed with a catalogue to which we could not give interest or variety . We could present nothing that could deepen or vary the impression which the preceding facts should leave upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these records for anything to mitigate our indignation at Eldon 's settled and inexorable hostility to every Iileasure // of public policy , having more the happiness of mankind than of himself for its object ; to excuse the cold and heartless indifference with which he witnessed the misery and wretchedness about him , without a pulse of sympathy beating , or a finger for assistance being raised to afford relief . Occupying a public station of more influence and power than was enjoyed by almost any other living man , instead of using it to increase and extend the happiness of his kind , he makes it ever the instrument of his consuming selfishness , and like a political Juggernaut , rides over the hearts and happiness of millions of his fellow beings to satisfy his insatiable and unscrupulous ambition . Too narrow-minded to embrace the interests of the race in his own , and too mean to tolerate a policy in which his own was not consulted ; he always resisted any measure tending , even in principle , to recognize the happiness of man , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowardly , and cruel , he would plant himself beside a measure he disliked like the serpent in the garden , fast by the tree of life , and with his wiles and corrupting whispers , thwart the purposes and the efforts of men whose shoe-latchets he was not worthy to unloose . One word more and we have done . There are more Eldons in the world than Mr. Twiss has written the life of . We have them in our own country , and in every party and sect of politics and religion . They are called prudent and safe men . They usually spring from poverty rather by meanness than talent , and become rich , and cut all their relatives and acquaintances less wealthy than themselves ; they are generally officers of some church and of sundry benevolent societies , to which institutions their charity will shine , as we are told charity should , conspicuous above all other virtues , while at the same time they have perhaps , a mother or a sister elsewhere , daily eating the bread of another 's bounty . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they bear all things . In politics they are conservative . They like low taxes but liberal monopolies , sound currency but high interest , and are always ready , whether in religion or politics , " To compound for sins they are inclined to By damning those they have no mind to . " Offences against property they think much more serious than those against the person . Capital punishments they believe to be necessary to the very existence of man in society , and imprisonment for debt indispensable to his prosperity and virtue . They foresee anarchy in every popular demonstration , and public ruin in every reform . In short they bear the same relation to society that the vis inertia does to matter . They have always to be overcome before there can be any progress . They are the natural enemies of the philanthropist and reformer , and the most incessant vigilance is necessary to guard against their machinations . Our deep sense of this truth must be our excuse for devoting so much space to the dissection of one who is eminently an archetype of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign nation and less than a first rate man ; and though his life and labors , when fairly weighed and balanced , may be looked upon by the eyes of finite intelligence as a curse rather than a benefaction.
