txt IN order that church psalmody may accomplish its high end in public worship , its various branches must be cultivated with a zeal corresponding to the general culture of the age . It must win to its service the best efforts of genius in poetry and in musical composition ; and these labors in its higher departments , must be made to move and elevate the whole public mind by means of widely spread and judicious instruction in sacred music . The songs of public *vorship are one of the most powerful auxiliaries for accomplishing the ends of the Christian ministry and of the Sabbath . In the weekly assembling of a congregation , when the high and the low , the rich and the poor meet together , there is found a diversity of habits , of character and of ternperarnent , which the unaided accents of instruction and prayer may in vain labor to unite and move with a pervading and deep emotion . The minister rises in the pulpit on Sabbath morning to begin the service . As he opens his lips to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thin ; his words seem to flit away into empty air , or if they come back to him from the distant walls , they come hack mingled with the noise of rustling garments , shuf fling feet and the tramp of late corners . Thus hegoes on , well reminded of his weakness , through the invocation , the reading of the Scriptures and of the hymn . If now the singing that is to follow be what it should be , how great a change soon comes over that assembly . The Christian psalm , when sacred words , rendered doubly sacred by long association , are uttered in full choral harmony-to what shall we compare it ? It is not a stream nor a shower ; it is rather the breeze from heaven , pervading all hearts crc its presence is known . The united voice of the choir speaks to all hearts . It is so pure and elevated that the most refined forget that they can criticise ; it is so powerful that the dullest can not but feel . The heart torn with passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trifles and sinful thoughts have passed away , and the soul finds itself arrcsted and still in the presence of eternal things . Meanwhile the minister has shared to the full the influence which is uniting and kindling the hearts around him . The chill of depression with which he commenced has passed away . His heart is warmed ; his hopes rise ; he feels that he has found his people , and now when // he prays or preaches , they have communion with him . This precious influence , however , is not a thing of course . It is not felt wherever a choir sing psalms and hymns in meeting ; nor in the most favored cases do we believe we have felt or witnessed more than the first fruits of its promised power . The demands of sacred music on all who would aid in its advancement , are strict and high . Its success requires a combination of faithful labor , from the highest efforts in composition , down to the simplest elements of practice . When this important cause is left to languish without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who should support it ; when the influential members of a parish will not cultivate sacred music themselves , nor give their countenance and money for the aid of those who will ; when in the singing on the Sabbath there is neither " voice** nor " verse " worthy of the name ; when the leader of the choir has for his chief qualification the power to make a loud noise , and the hand around him see no higher end before them than to emulate their leader ; when the best training the best of them have had , has been in a stormy singing school , and scarcely a Sabbath passes without some failure so obvious as to render the performance a matter of sport to all the frivolous minds in the house ; when such is the condition of this sacred art , what can we expect will come of it . It is not enough to say , that here must be an utter loss of the great spiritual good which church music rightly performed , will , through the divine blessing , bring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this were all . But widespread mischief has been done . The services of the house of God have become cheap , and an occasion of ridicule in the eyes of the very persons whose salvation , in God 's ordinary providence , must come from this same source . Those who have neglected to honor and advance this precious means of grace , have sown not chaff merely , but tares and thorns ; and they and their children will bring the harvest home . While the apathy and negligence on the subject of church music in many places is g*adually undermining the respect for all the institutions of the church ; we gladly notice the general fact of a decided improvement in the character of both sacred music and poetry , and in the general diffusion of elementary instruction in singing . We are not fond of the language of complaint ; we prefer rather to weiceme cheerfully what signs of improvement there are , and offer our small tribute of thought to the advancement of a groxving cause . We shall limit our observations to a single branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and here we shall have a few things to say , as our limits will allow , both on books of music , and on books of psalms and hymns . In regard to the first of these , it would seem desirahie that a better understanding should exist between the professors of the art , and the public . On the publication of every new singing ho oh , we bear the complaint repeated of the innovations made in old and time-hallowed tunes . XVere this complaint uttered by those persons only to whom association is dearer than thought , and with whom change of every kind is an evil ; if it were not uttered by those whose culture and position give them a title to be heard , the omission to notice it altogether , would be an appropriate and sufficient answer . But when , as in some instances has happened , a considerably numerous body of clergymen have united in a public expression of their dissatisfaction with the course pursued by the editors of singing hooks , we think the question involved in the complaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not // 337 occasion for complaint ; but we wish to know how general and sweeping the complaint should he , and on what grounds it should rest . As we understand the case , the aggrieved persons protest against alt changes in the old and standard tunes of our church music ; especially those masterpieces , which , like gold in the furnace , have for ages stood the fire of criticism . These tunes are linked with their dearest recollections of Christian experience and personal history . rfhey were the medium through which the awakening and sublime truths of religion first entered their souls ; and through the successive stages of their Christian life , these old and hallowed strains have consoled and quickened , allured and cheered them on . It seems scarcely lcss than s*crilege for young professors of music , under pretense of scIence , to break in upon this " linked sweetness , " all instinct to their minds with the very sotil of religious feeling . We endeavor to state the feeling which prompts these complaints fatly and fairly , for , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing in ourselves what they are ; and further , we would in any case , treat them with entire respect . Vie say wj th respect , and here we stop for it is not every thing which is respeciable that should be allowed to ruic us . We say with Pope , we would not willingly see cxen an old post dug up , urile s ureess *y re ( luired it ; but we add , if t xxeie necessary to set a new post in the same place , we should uioc*ed to dig up the old one with c Let us not be rnvuinderstood . We do not say we ad*ocate great chan*es in our o1d c&gt;rroh tunes . That is a question we have not yet come to ; hut we say the complaints made do not rest on any sufficient basis ; they are not discriminating ; they are made on a principle which would itself annihilate the complaint . For , we ask , how far hack shall this act of immunity from innovation extend ? Shall it reach hack one generation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gregory ? Who does not see that , fix it when you will , you tolerate all Innovation up to that time ? We know indeed the answer that is attempted to he given to the question we have put . These tunes , it is said , should he suffered to remain in the form which the general voice of the public has agreed to accept as their highest and best form . Now this answer we may easily see contains nothing hut words . There is no such accredited form , sanctioned by the united voices of the public . There was a time when this form first appeared ; when , for example , Old Hundred was first printed in half notes instead of quarter notes , and so of alt others ; and when that was done , he the date of the change what it may , the objector may assure himself , it was done , not by the united voices of the public , but by some innovator to the decided annoyance of the public . Then as well as now , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changes that were taking place in music . Then , as now , audacious editors troubled the public by altering tunes ; or else we should have inherited Old hundred in its genuine form , and have the happiness of singing it now in the same kind of time in which we sing Wells . Thus it is through this very innovation , now deprecated , that we come to possess the old tunes in the form we so much admire . The protest against innovation is in fact only the individual 's plea for repose in his old habits . The feeling which prompts the complaint is not wrong , but only the complaint . This feeling indiscriminately applied would be fatal to all progress , and would have nipped in the bud , the fairest fruits which it is our inheritance to reap . Shall we reap where others have // 338 Music in C/Lurches. sown , and yet in our turn refuse to sow ? As we can not repay to our fathers ' ashes the debt we owe them , what remains for us but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , while we treat the past with respect , know assuredly that the present is better , and that it alone is ours . Are we then in favor of frequent changes in our church tunes ? It is sufficiently evident from what has been said , that this question admits of no categorical answer . Every instance of change must be judged by itself on principles of sound and liberal criticism . The change in itself is an evil . The question must be , in each separate case , does the change , along with the evil , secure a preponderating good ? We say this is a question for criticism . And by criticism we mean something more than a reference to the caprice of one who happens to be entitled professor of music , and something more than an appeal to the technical terms of thorough base . We have small respect for such appeals , for the purpose now before us . Not that some technical knowledge of harmony is not requisite for an intelligible criticism of the plainest hymn tune , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicated in an entirely mechanical form , and is useful only for the purpose of mechanical execution . As the wit has said that " All the rhetorician 's rules Teach only how to name his tools ; " so in music , the laws which are available for the purposes of effective composition or criticism , underlie all that the usual books on harmony furnish . That our definite meaning here may be understood , we remark that every tune , ( we mean every good tune , ) is marked by a specific character and aim . It is designed , and more or less adapted , to awaken and express a specific emotion . The value of a tune depends on these two things ; the greatness or beauty of its leading idea , and the degree of perfection with which its 1 ) arts are adapted to give that idea expression . Every particular then in the composition is to be judged in view of its adaptedness to contribute to the inain end . In this view every part of the composition is subject to criticism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the musical grammar . The merits of a tune can be judged of only by one who clearly apprehends the aim of the tune , and can appreciate the degree in which its successive notes contribute to that end . It is not enough to quote the rules of harmony in justification of a particular chord ; to say that such a dissonance must be followed by such a chord ; for after that is done , both the dissonance and the concord into which it flows must , in turn , be regarded as a single element , and its occurrence justified or condemned by examining its connection with what precedes , and its influence on what is to follow . Here then , we say , is a broad and well defined field for the exercise of criticism on the changes made in church tunes . Those who are grieved at these changes have here a fair arena for sustaining , if they can , the charges they make . Let them by an intelligible and strict criticism show that a tune has been rendered less expressive of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will have done a service for which all interested in sacred music will thank them . But till this is done we can not expect that the complaints made will gain the ear of scientific men , or influence the public in any desirable way . To illustrate the idea we have suggested , let us suppose Old Hundred to be the tune in which alterations are the subject of complaint . As no tune is more deeply engraved on the popular mind , in none do // the changes that from time to time appear , occasion greater offense . Let the question now before us have respect to the position of a single note , the first note of the third line in the base ; whether that note should be on the letter A , the key note of the tune , or on the relative minor . Now it is not a matter of indifference or accident which note is here employed ; nor is the question to be settled by old use , or by the rausict 1 primer . The elementary rules of harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chord is admissihle in the succession which would there occur . The answer must be sought in a study of the leading idea of the tone , and the manner in which the successive strains contribute to express it . Let us , for the time , accept the common arrangement of the tune , and inquire what is the signiflcancy of having the first chord of the third line in the minor mode ? We shall not stop here to characterize the minor mode in general further than to say , as its broadest designation , that it is the natural expression of the passive attitude of the mind in contradistinction from the active . To describe it as expressive of plaintive emotions merely , is to give it a very inadequate designation . Whenever the mind , overpowered by the greatness of the truths presented to it , or exhausted from the intenseness of its own activity , and recoiling from weakness or from awe , seeks repose , that posture of the soul finds its natural expression in music in the minor mode . Hence such passages fitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the soul that has risen heavenward , and lost itself in the song of the blessed before the throne , is reminded of its frail and sinful self , as it soon must be , then the tide of song is checked , the strong pinions of the soul falter , and she sinks down to some resting place uttering the plaintive wail , " who can show forth all his praise . " This is the minor key . It is die utterance of the overaxved spirit , saying with Isaiah in the heavenly vision , " Woe is rae , for mine eyes have seen the king , the Lord of hosts ; " saying with David , " when I consider the heavens , the work of thy fingers , what is man ; " or with John , falling down as one dead when he saw the throne of God and of the Lamb . It is in this pbint of view that we see the true use of the minor chord in the place we have mentioned in Old Hundred . It expresses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The majestic march of the second line causes the mind to recoil and find rest for a moment in the minor key . And this idea is beautifully carried out in the remaining harmony of the line . From the relative minor it passes to the chord of the fifth , which is soothing in its character , and this chord recurs again in the next accented note ; and the line from this point onward expresses the gradual recovering of the mind and the gathering up of its strength for the last grand line . Here the passive and soothing element has entirely disappeared , and the tide of harmony swells with cumulative strength , like the billow rolling landward till it breaks and melts along the shore . This remarkable tune , the one tune known of Protestant Christendom , is all it is described to be , and much more . It is usually designated as remarkable for its grandeur , but it is not more remarkable for grandeur than for its sympathy and winning love . While it invites a thousand voices to join with highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken up by a few at the Christian communion , and it is then no weariness , but a joy and rest to sing it . It is this quality , taken in connection with its obvious // and acknowledged grandeur , that constitutes the most remarkable feature of the tune . It is full of humanity . It is no angel 's song . It is the song of Christian pilgrims , sympathizing with the present and the earthly , while uttering the heavenly and eternal . If now we revert to the proposed change in the harmony , we hardly need say that an alteration in the first note of the third line would require changes in the notes which follow in order to preserve the unity of the tune , and these changes would essentially modify its character . If equally grand in its changed form , it would lose the peculiar charm which , more than any thing else , has enshrined it in all hearts . We have spoken of the chord of the flftb* ns soothing in its character , expressive of serenity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplest elements of harmony in giving character to the music , we will refer to a well known hymntune in which this chord may be said to predominate  --  the common meter tune Ferry . The character of this tune is very marked and simple . It is serious and soothing , with a tendency to the plaintive exI ) resston . On examining the harmonv , it will be found that not only does the chord of the fifth recur frequently , hut , what is not less import ut , it is thrown in most cases on the accented part of the measure , thus giving to this element its utmost power . That we may look for a moment at the above positions in the light of contrast , we will refer to the common meter tune Christmas , the opposite of the last named tune in all its lending characteristics . Perhaps * If the expression " chord of the fifth " seems to the musical reader somewhat indefinite , he may understand the writer as intending , in his criticism , to define the character and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air and base . the whole circle of our church music does not furnish so animating a strain as these few notes of Handel . The epithet we have chosen is the appropriate one to express the spirit of the tune . It is not joy , for the music suggests nothing already achieved to serve as the basis of joy ; it is not praise , for there is here no forgetfulness of self , no surrender of the personal to the heavenly and divine . It is intensely individual and self-collected . It is a trumpet call to battle , and the answering shout ; as if an angel stood , and , while he blew the piercing notes , pointed the armed Christian through the ranks of his enemies to the golden city , on whose walls the blessed are walking in white , and have turned to look down and watch the coming conflict . We are aware that this tune is at present but little used ; and it is not difficult perhaps to state some reasons for its disuse . So strongly marked is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone , that it is not often that a hymn entirely fitting is found for it ; and besides it is no easy tune to sing . With all its apparent simplicity , it requires for its effective performance a degree of accuracy in time which is seldom attained by the best choirs . We speak considerately when we say that a choir may learn to perform with applause a score of rapid and fuguing tunes , and yet in this one so fail in the time as to deprive it of half its power . The demand for accuracy in time is here most imperative , for being , as itis , a rousing appeal to the active powers , the slightest wavering from the exact time dissipates instantly its sublime charm . Then , the tune has been a thousand times misapplied . Its simplicity of structure has deceived the ignorant , who have thought it a very pretty sort of tune , and a very convenient carrier , so to speak , for all sorts of hymns . To set this tune to a hymn of ordinary // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck clothed With thunder , to the rich man 's ph*-ton , and trotting him about the lawn . Perhaps the true reason why we do not rise to the idea of this tune and use it , is the spiritual one that we have not faith nor hope nor zeal enough to sing it , and so we let it alone . Our object however in mentioning this tune was to compare its harmony with that of Ferry , from which it differs so widely in its general character . This comnarison will show that the chord of the fifth so prominent in the former is scarcely found in the latter . We shall not stop here to characterize the tune further , for our object is not to furnish a general analysis of it , but to snow by a few simple examples that some of the most important elements in giving character to our church music are so obvious as to lie within the reach of all who will study the subject with any seriousness and attention . If this be so , it is the anyilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public on church music , to speak intelligibly , and we hope they will avail themselves of it . We have spoken of the melody and harmony of tunes . Scarcely less important in determining their character is the time in which they flow . Each tune has its appropriate time , which serves better than any other to aid in the expression of its leading idea . XVe do not mean here by time , slowness or rapidity of movement , but the relative length of notes compared with each other . The sentiment which is naturally expressed in even time is not well expressed in triple time ; and each character of time has its peculiar and exclusive powers . For illustration of this point , and of the others we have mentioned , we refer to one more tune ; now for the most part thrown out of use , like an old giant 's armor . We mean Colchester . The character of this tune is quite different from either of those we have described - Though a tune of great animation and strength , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor is it like Old Hundred , a majestic expression of objective truth . To designate the tune by a single phrase , we would say it is the highest utterance of religioits confidence . While it expresses the most pervading and penetrating sense of the infinite and eternal , it yet suggests throughout , the relation of the individual to that infinite and eternal ; and this relation is that of reconciliation and peace , and hence of calm triumph in God . It is the steadfast joy of faith , a faith that lready possesses the foretaste of the eternal rest . If now we examine the harmony of this tune , we shall find an alternation between the soothing chord of the fifth and the more majestic chord of the key ; the latter giving utterance to the mighty truths , and the former assuring the soul of its inheritance in them . But there is another element , contributing to the expression of this tune , the time . It is in triple time , and this feature is not an accidental one ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described it . Let the time be changed to even time , and the peculiar power of the tune would be lost . It would no longer be the utterance of the emotions above described , but an attempt to utter the truths which should awaken the emotions . The expression passes from the first person into the third . It ceases to be dramatic , and becomes hortatory . Hence its soothing notes become expressive of indifference , while its more powerful chords are a laborious clamor of sounds , bereft of half their meaning ; and the whole tune , instead of being easier for a choir to sing , than before , is in fact , notwithstanding its shortened time , more wearisome and exhausting . The same remark will apply in reference to the change from triple to evea time sometimes made in Mear . The change is // made with the praiseworthy design of bringing the tune more entirely within the physical powers of the choir ; hut this is short-sighted policy ; for while the physical difficulties are thus diminished one third , the inward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than before . We have in the above cases applied a principle , before stating what that principle is . We remark , then , that the expression of triple time differs from that of even time in this , that to the dynamic accent or emphasis of the latter there is added the emphasis of time . Triple time is therefore , rhetorically considered , the reinforced or stronger form of expression . It follows from this , that it is the appropriate form in the utterance of thoughts which , if read or recited , would demand the rhetorical emphasis of time ; and is inappropriate in cases where such emphasis is not admissible . Hence it is suited to express entreaty , but not warning ; for , in the reading of poetry , expressions of entreaty would naturally take the emphasis of time ; while the utterance of warning would be in repressed and even tones . We have given these very brief and general illustrations rather to excite an interest in this branch of our subject , than with any thought of their adequacy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , so far as our present inquiries are concerned , church music is only a more impressive mode of uttering the language of sacred poetry . Every element , then , in a tune , and every particular in its performance in this choral recitation , is legitimate matter for criticism , as much as the tones of a reader 's voice . And the final appeal in this criticism is not to books and rules , but to the soul ; for rules and hooks are worthless except as they teach us better to understand what the soul felt before hooks were written , and what it feels without their aid . We will close our remarks on this branch of our subject , by noticing some changes that have recently been made in a few of our church tunes . rj* first instance we will speak of , is in a tune where the old movement of time was so firmly intrenched hy long usage , thataslight change in two measures has served almost to unfit the tune for present popular use . In no instance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tune occasioned such universal and marked offense , for it is a tune which every body sings , and its rhythm constitutes a very prominent feati re in its general effect . Yet the change that has been made is strictly defensible , and was imperatively called for . We would advocate it , even should it seem to throw the tune out of use for a whole generation . Let it lie in silence , if it needs must , till the remembrance of its old rhythms shall have quite died out , nd then it can be taken up and sung as it should be , and without offense . We refer to the tune XVindham ; and the change is in the last line , where the immediate succession of four quarter notes is change d , and a rhythm substituted to correspond with the preceding lines . The whole time of the tune has indeed been changed from common to triple time , but no important change is felt except at the point we have named . The change is justified by the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar in effect to the hurried reading of the closing line in a solemn stanza in poetry . The increased power of the tune is at once perceptible to one who can listen to it free from the hondage of association and with an ear open to its true expression . A similar change of time has been made , with entirely different effect , in two other tunes , Sterling and 01-mutz. here the feeling does not demand a fall and prolonged utterance , and hence the check given to // the flow of the rhythm is at war with its leading aim . A much greater injury has been done by the change of time made in the tune Marlow . This chant , one of the most powerful in our collections of tunes , in its former rhythm of even time , has , by the change in its time , been deprived of all that is distinctive and grand in its character ; and , from being a most exciting and elevating strain , has become a merely commonplace medium for the singing of indifferent hymns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been willing to exchange the irrepressible power of the last line , in its old form , for the tame and flat conclusion we now hear , we can not surmise . It may be said that the new arrangement has at least the advantage of avoiding some harsh discords that injured the tune in its former state . We think it may be shown that a change in the harmony was entirely uncalled for in the former arrangement . Strong as the discords were , and they were the strongest , such was the power of the tune that they were borne along and reduced into perfect unison with its leading idea . No better proof of this need be given than the fact that the power and spirit of a choir uniformly rises while performing this tune in its old and majestic style . The extent to which the preceding remarks have been carried will induce us to limit what we have to say on the subject of psalm-books to a single particular ; and that most closely connected with music . The increasing attention recently paid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption of systems of notation in the printing of hymns , as a guide to the choir in their performance . Without stopping here to compare the advantages and disadvantages of such a system of notation , we may say that the work of affixing such a system of marks to a body of psalms and hymns is one of great delicacy and responsibility . Here is no field for the display of individual fancies and caprices of taste . It is a transaction with the common heart of a whole people ; and he who has not a quick and sure sympathy with its p'ulsations should not volunteer in such a work . It is by no means certain that the exclusive pursuit of sacred music as a profession , with all its seeming advantages , may not tend in some important respects to disqualify a person for such a work . The singer or musician has necessarily much to think of besides the moral effect of the music or the hymn . He can not well forget his professional place , and may , with the best intentions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man 's worst enemies in such a case ) will encourage him to regard as graces and signs of genius ; and thus the favorite feats at the organ , or with the voice , the startling tricks of soft and loud , cc*me to be looked on by the fond performer as illustrations of high laws of taste . Alas ! for the victims of such practice . They come and sit together in the holy place , and wait in stillness that they may be rapt in sweet and awful song ; and what do they hear ? The organ , the choir , the chief singer . They think of the singing school , of the organist or fldd*er , and xvonder how he performs such feats . It might not be quite in keeping to describe such ambitious performers by the pastoral phrase ready made to our use " who their lean and flashy songs Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw , " But certain it is " The hungry sheep look up , and are not fed . " We have seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that then the influence of the music is entirely aside from its true aim . We may remark further , that the performer can not know so well as // another the effect which music has on those who listen . 1-us mind is necessarily in the active and not in the passive attitude . We should therefore expect to find the best knowledge of musical effect in one , who , while he was not ignorant of music , should not be occupied in its performance . We cheerfully acknowledge whatever special advantages there are on the side of the professed musician , and accept gladly all the aid offered to the cause of church psalmody from whatever quarter it may come . In inquiring into the wants of the New England Congregational churches in reference to the present subject , our attention is naturally directed to the two books of psalms and hymns which alone , since the exclusive use of Watts in the original form and of Watts as edited by Dwight , have been extensively adopted among us  --  the Christian Psalmody , edited by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently introduced . Of the former it may be enough to say , that it was a great advance on what had been before , while its defects were sufficient to encourage farther attempts in the same line . That some of these defects should be remedied in the more recent work , is no more than might have been with confidence expected from the talents and the opportunities of its editors . The work is marked by a strict attention to lyrical structure , and the careful rejection of faulty expressions . There is also a large addition to the number of hymns before in use . But we are constrained to add that if this book presents us with the best collection of sacred hymns which our language can afford , we must feel that as yet we are not rich in sacred poetry . Our particular object however is to speak of the system of notation adopted in this work , as the guide in musical expression . We are aware of the claims to a candid and indulgent criticism which any attempt of this kind presents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be perfect . It is a work of taste , in a department of acknowledged difficulty , where the canons of criticism have yet to be written . The most that should be demanded by the public , in such a case , is that too much should not be attempted ; that what is done be based on broad and unquestionable principles ; and that the execution of th' work exhibit , throughout , the assiduous application of musical and poetic culture . If these conditions are fulfilled , the occasional occurrence of a faulty direction will not constitute a valid objection to the work . The strictures we have to make however do not relate to faults of this minor or accidental character ; but to faults where the principle of notation is utterly indefensible , and the errors so marked as to defeat , where they occur , the aim both of the poetry and of the music . That we may have distinctly in view the general principles by which we must test the instances we shall adduce , we remark that so far as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical expression must be the same as the rules for expression in rhetorical reading . They are both limited to the same sphere . If tones in reading-observe we do not say words , for they have by arbitrary association an independent meaning-if tones in reading can not describe external objects , nor even suggest any thing in space , but only what is internal , so it is with tones in singing . The descriptive powers of music are limited strictly to what falls in time , and can never pass into space . True , it is said Haydn has described the objects of nature in the Creation . But how has he done this ? Masses of powerful disconnected sound do not // suggest an elephant or leviathan ; hut they may , by natural association , be suggestive of huge ungainly motion , and if , meanwhile , the accompanying words tell of the elephant or leviathan , these suggested motions may be attributed to the creatures named , and thus the description be made more picturesque by the aid of music . And this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which music can be suggestive of objects in external nature . We remark , further , as a rule for both musical and rhetorical expression , that when an idea is brought into bold relief by means of contrast , the voice should harmonize with the leading idea , and not become pantomimic of the secondary idea , which is only introduced as a foil to set off the principal thought . Thus , if the language expresses joy on deliverance from peril , the tone of voice harmonizes with the present triumph , and not with the past danger . If the words deplore the fall from a former happy state , the tones harmonize with the present wretchedness , not with the past joy . The contrasted ideas may indeed be so expanded as to demand that the voice take the tone of each successively . But we are now treating of those brief expressions where there is no description , but only the utterance of feeling through the aid of contrasted ideas . As in the following instances . We quote from Church Psalmody , affixing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Begirt with thee , my fearless soul , p . The gloomy vale shall tread . On what principle , we ask , is the second of these lines to be sung soft ? We can easily see what probably led to the notation , and as easily see that the notation is entirely wrong . Here is no description of the gloomy vale . A gloomy vale can not be described by musical sounds , but only the feelings or actions of one passing through it . But the feelings of the person here passing through it are triumphant , and not sad . The moment the voice falls into the soft expression in this line , the tone belies the whole sentiment of the couplet . Instead of treading the gloomy vale fearlessly , it falters at the very mention of it . We have read of one Faithful who actually went through the gloomy vale , uttering somewhat loudly these same cheering words as he went , so that his fellow pilgrim in the darkness behind him was encouraged on his way . We were taught to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a brave man ; but it seems that his manner was in bad taste . It must be urged in apology for him that he was a somewhat antiquated personage , and probably his old hymn-book had not the marks of expression in it . But , to treat this notation with a seriousness it does not deserve , we will put it to the test of reading . No good reader would read the couplet as it is here marked , and this is decisive of the question . Is it asked , what shall express the character of the vale , if the soft expression of voice is not to do it ? XVe answer the adjective gloomy ; and for the force of this the inquirer must go to the dictionary . We have dwelt the longer on this example , because its notation is characteristic of a numerous class of cases in the book . Witness the following : Then let our humble faith address his mercy and his power ; mf . We shall obtain deliverin* grnce &gt; In each distressing hour . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere mention of the evil triumphed over , makes the heart faint and the tongue falter . Can there he a more utter incongruity in any thing pertaining to art ? In that noble breathing for the // Holy Spirit , the property of all Christian hearts , the devotional feelings of the congregation are trifled with as follows : mf . Come , Holy Spirit , heavenly Dove , With all thy quickening powers ; &gt; Come shed abroad a Saviours love , And that shall kindle ours . We quote again : snf . With joy , whereer thy hand shall lead. , p . The darkest path I 'll tread f . With joy I 'll quit these mortal shores , Len . And mingle with the dead . What confusion is here ! the words expressing courage throughout ; the music expressing cournge where there is nothing to try it , but quail . ing the moment the appalling object comes to view . Once more : Bright garlands of immortal joy Shall bloom on every head ; &gt; While sorrow , sighing , and distress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words in characterizing this last notation . We recommend to all , who shall undertake to supply marks of expression for the use of singers , to study the fact that the dictionary is designed to teach the meaning of words ; and the varied tones of voice , to express the emotions which the words awaken . We are by no means unmindful of the many merits of the work we have here noticed ; but its faults can not be lightly spoken of . We think the labor of furnishing to our churches such a hymn-book as the times demand , waits for other hands . He who shall embody and bring before the public the best treasures our language contains in sacred poetry , at once simple and glowing , chaste in form and instinct with the - fire of holy feeling , will do an important work for the souls of the people  --  a work too , which , what . ever be its pretensions in regard to directing the singer 's performance , will have a most happy influence on the general taste , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
