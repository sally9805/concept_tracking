txt WE are happy to infer , from various signs , that a new interest is awakened in the study of the early history of these now United States . The brilliant events of the Revolution , and the exciting topics , which had their origin in the formation of a new government , subsequent to the establishment of independence , seemed for a number of years to absorb almost the whole of // public attention , and to cast a shadow over the equally important events , which led to the establishment of our institutions , and prepared the way for our national existence . In our admiration of our successful government , we hardly thought of going beyond the Revolution to discover its origin . We had almost forgotten what trials were endured , and sacrifices made , at an earlier day . Nor did we sufficiently remember how much we were indebted to those who were the pioneers of civilization in the western world , and who laid the foundation of free institutions upon the broad basis of learning and religion . The frequent publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which have taken place in all the chief towns of the north , within a few years , have given a new direction to public attention ; and we are now beginning to regard our whole history , from the settlement of the country to the present time , as but one chain of events , each and every link of which is equally important and equally necessary to the consummation of its grand design . Among the local histories , which the prolific press has sent forth within a few years , there is none of greater interest than that of the colony of New Plymouth , by Mr. Baylies . The subject itself has the strongest claim upon attention , and the author has collected and arranged his materials with most praiseworthy research and good judgment . We owe to him the first entire history of the colony , which has been published . Other writers have given faithful and minute delineations of detached portions of the subject , but no one before Mr. Baylies has attempted to bring these detached portions together , and to present us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during its whole existence . A work upon a theme so important , executed with such ability and care , deserves to be greeted as a valuable public service . But our purpose is not to review the history of Mr. Baylies , so much as it is to give some account of the colony itself . It is the oldest of the New England colonies , and to its early success may he traced the origin of all the others . It is the place where civilization and Christianity were first introduced into New England . It has been the scene of many a trial , and of the fulfilment of many a high and holy resolve . It was here that government , based on the will of the governed , was first established on the American continent , and the great principle , that all should obey such laws as a majority of the // people should make , distinctly acknowledged . To this colony , we trace the first practical recognition of those political principles , which now form the basis of all the institutions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the settlement was made , its history , after a government went into regular operation , and especially the history of its legislation , are entitled to more attention than we suppose them to have commonly received . The history of this colony extends through a period of only seventy-one years ; namely , from 1620 to 1691 , when it was united to Massachusetts , becoming a part of the Province of Massachusetts Bay . Its territory , comprising most of the present counties of Plymouth , Barnstable , and Bristol , together with a small tract of land on its southerly side , now included within the limits of Rhode Island , contained about eleven hundred square miles , or about one seventh of the present territory of this Commonwealth . It is described in the charter to William Bradford and his associates , as bounded on the north by Cohasset river , on the south by the Narragansett river , on the east by the western ocean , and on the west by the utmost limits of the " Pahoninutt country . " During the existence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose names are still retained , and into twenty townships and districts , containing , as is supposed , at the union in 1691 , a population of about nine thousand . The same territory is now divided into upwards of fifty townships , and contains a population of about one hundred and forty thousand . The origin of this colony is too well known to require recapitulation . It is enough to say , that it owed its existence to persecution for religion 's sake . As early as 1602 , a number of persons in England , feeling themselves aggrieved , began to converse upon the subject of removing from that country ; but they took no measures for that purpose till 1610 , when a small company of Puritans , with the distinguished Robinson for a pastor , settled at Leyden , in Holland . Here they were well received , and protected in the enjoyment of their religion . During their whole stay in that country , it appears they were on the most friendly terms with its inhabitants . But still they were not satisfied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not understand , and whose morals were far below the elevated standard which they had prescribed for themselves . Nor did they find there such means of education as they desired for their children but , on the other hand , had reason to fear that they would suffer from evil example , and that , by joining the Hollanders , either as soldiers or sailors , the identity of their little community would be lost , and its members be dispersed . They never had a cordial sympathy with the people of that country , but felt that they were strangers and sojourners , and that here was not their home . After about nine years ' residence they began seriously to think of a second removal , but they knew not where to go . They still had attachments for England , but her partial and rigid laws would not protect them in the enjoyment of their rights . They desired to retain for their children their language as well as their religion , and for this reason they preferred a residence in a wilderness to an alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at length determined to make America their place of refuge ; and , soon after , negotiations for settlement were entered into with the merchant adventurers , and with them a hard bargain for the Puritans was concluded . Various accidents and difficulties detained them in Holland till July , 1620 . They then commenced their adventurous voyage . They first sailed to Southampton in England , where they remained till the 5th of August . Soon after , one of their vessels becoming leaky , they put into Dartmouth to repair her . These repairs having proved insufficient , they were again compelled to put into Plymouth , where they were detained till the 6th of September . They then left , most of them for ever , their native country ; and , after a perilous voyage of about two months , made land at Cape Cod . It was about six weeks after this , before they made the first permanent settlement at Plymouth , on the 22d of December . It is well known , that their original destination was near Hudson 's river , and within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made a contract for settlement , and that , by bribery ( as is supposed ) , the master of the vessel was induced to land them on the barren shores of New Plymouth . On their arrival they found themselves without government , and without any constituted authority by which the // members of their little community could be restrained , and its affairs managed . They still acknowledged themselves subjects of the king of England , and knew they were within his dominions . Yet they were too insignificant , as well as too remote , to feel or fear his authority , or to expect any protection . They were literally free from all political restraints , and as favorably situated as any people ever were to begin the world anew , and to establish well such a government and institutions as were suited to their new condition . From the peculiar character and situation of the Pilgrims , we might naturally expect a political organization different from any the world had before seen . No people had so fully appreciated the value of the rights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply the great cause of humanity , or entertained such cheering hopes of human improvement . They regarded the forms and institutions of society then existing in the old world as wholly unfit for the advancement of the true objects , for which society was formed , and civil governments instituted . They had fled from a government which they believed to be tyrannical , and it is not strange , that they should have used every precaution to resist , in their new situation , the evils from which they had escaped . The remark of Burke is as true of them as of their descendants , - that " they judged of an evil in government , not by the pressure of the grievance , but by the badness of the principle . They augured misgovernment at a distance , and snuffed the approach of tyranny in every tainted breeze . " In their new situation they were free from all political restraints , and could make , in the establishment of their government and institutions , a practical recognition of those political principles upon which they believed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had an advantage over most of the other American colonies , for which governments were formed previous to their settlement by means of charters from the King . The government of the colony dates its origin from November 11th , 1620 , when the Pilgrim fathers met in convention for the purpose of forming a social compact . This is the first meeting of the kind , of which the history of the world gives us any information ; and , if we may judge of the wisdom of its deliberations by their results , it has never been sur // passed . The experience of more than two hundred years has hardly suggested any improvement in the principles discussed and adopted by this infant colony , congregated in the dark and crowded cabin of the JJ/Iayflozver , as she lay at anchor by the shore of the new world . After declaring themselves the loyal subjects of King James , and that their undertaking was for the advancement of the Christian faith , and for the honor of their king and country , they say , that " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , consort and combine into a civil body politic , for their better ordering and preservation , and furtherance of the ends aforesaid ; and by virtue thereof do enact , constitute , and frame such equal laws , ordinances , acts , constitutions , and offices , from time to time , as shall be thought most convenient for the general good of the colony. ** To this compact they all promised submission and obedience , thereby investing a majority with the whole political power , and recognising to its fullest extent the right of such a majority to govern . Unlike the constitutions of the United States and the several States , it made no division of political power , contained no checks , imposed no restraints upon the government , but left the whole to the rule and decision of a bare majority . It did not even prescribe what officers should be chosen , or point out their duties and powers , but left the whole to be determined as circumstances should from time to time require . Of all the governments which ever existed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none was ever better suited to the condition and wants of the people that established it . During the whole existence of the colony , this form of polity was continued ; and though , at a subsequent period , there was some division of political power , and some restrictions were imposed upon the government , yet this was all done by mere acts of legislation , which could at any moment be annulled by the legislative power . This compact may properly be considered the only valid constitution which the colony ever had , and to it they clung with the greatest tenacity . Among themselves this was their strong bond of union , and , had they not had fears of the government at home , it would have been the only authority for legislation which they would have ever sought . But they were not then in a situation to // act with entire independence , and it became necessary to submit , at least nominally , to a higher authority , and to attain some assurance from that authority , that their rights should be protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilgrims were coasting along Cape Cod , the King granted to the " Council at Plymouth in the County of Devon , for the planting , ruling , ordering , and governing of New England in America , all the American territory between 40 and 48 degrees of north latitude , and extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific ; " including , of course , all the territory comprised in the colony of New Plymouth . This company had authority to sell and convey any portion of their territory , and , before the surrender of their charter in 1635 , did in fact dispose of several large tracts of land , conveying the same right to the soil , waters , and fisheries , which the company itself had . It was soon ascertained by the Plymouth colonists , that this company were claimants to all the territory occupied by them , and that they claimed it under the King , who was then admitted to have authority to dispose of a continent , to which he had no other claim than that some of his subjects , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid molestation , it therefore became necessary to purchase the rights of this company , which , after a long negotiation , was accomplished in 1629 , when the charter from the Council at Plymouth was granted to XVilliam Bradford and his associates , of all the territory comprised within the colony of New Plymouth . This charter can be reg*urded in no other light than as a common deed of conveyance , giving them a right to the soil , but no authority to establish a new government , or to exercise jurisdiction over it . It was no more a charter of government than the hundred conveyances from the natives , and so the colonists always considered it , - for they spared no efforts to obtain the sanction of the King to it ; being aware that , without this , they had no assurance that he would do them the favor to let them alone . These efforts , however , were unavailing . The King never gave his sanction ; and , from the beginning of the colony to its end , its government can properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will of the colonists themselves . For this reason we see , that in every period of their history , they exhibited a constant solicitude , not only as to the validity of their government , but as to the extent of the // powers , which they might exercise under it . It was early a grave question , whether they could inflict capital punishment in case of murder , and regarded as of so much importance that they sought the advice of the governor of Massachusetts upon it . He told thorn they had such authority , not on the ground , however , of any chartered rights , hut " that the land should he purged from blood . " The result proved , that this charter was regarded with the same respect as the other New England charters , and with them it suffered a common ruin under the arbitrary reign of James the Second . For the first sixteen years we have but a meagre account of the legislation of the colony . During this period , the population was small , and probably at no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would require many rules and regulations to preserve its harmony , and secure to each member his rights , yet , since such rules and regulations were adopted in general assembly , they were known to all , and were commonly of so temporary a character , that they were scarcely thought worthy of committing to public record . The colonists during this period hardly considered themselves as permanently settled . They were looking for a more propitious soil , and at one time came nigh leaving their frail and temporary habitations at Plymouth , and removing to the fertile valley of the Connecticut . Besides , they lived rather as a social than a political community , bound together as one family , by common interests and objects , and enduring common sufferings and privations . And it is not strange that , under such circumstances , they should have left us a record of so few of their public acts . Our surprise should rather be , that so many of them have come down to us , affording us , at the end of two centuries , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framers . The records of the colony begin in 1623 , and there is still standing at their head a law providing , " that all criminall acts , and also all matters of trespasses and debts betweene man and man , should be tried by the verdict of twelve honest men , to be impannelled by authority in forme of a jury upon their oath . " The other laws , adopted during this period , relate principally to the estates of deceased persons , the division of lands , the defence of the colony , and the security of its trade and fisheries . In 1627 , it was enacted , that no dwellinghouse // should be covered with any kind of thatch , as straw , reeds , &amp;c . The inimediate occasion of this act was a destructive fire , which the colony had just suffered , by reason of their buildings having been covered with such combustible materials . In 1636 , a new era occurred in its legislation . The colony had increased considerably in system which answered their purpose while all lived in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice of their valiant chieftain , was no longer suited to their condition . They had long waited , but in vain , for a confirmation of their charter by the King . They now found it necessary to create new officers , define their powers , establish fixed laws , and declare more fully the authority under which they acted . For this purpose a General Court was called in October , at which a committee of fourteen persons was appointed , with full authority to revise the laws , and to report their proceedings to the next General Court . The duties of this committee were performed with great despatch ; for within five weeks a new code was prepared , reported , and adopted . It does not appear to have created much discussion , nor have we any evidence that it met with serious opposition ; for it appears by the records to have been all adopted in a single day , and perhaps in a single hour . This code first gave form to the government of the colony , and invested it with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colonists to make laws , and declares , that , as freeborn subjects of England , they were possessed of all the rights of Englishmen ; and that , as such , no law , imposition , or ordinance should be made or imposed on them but by their consent ; the very doctrine maintained by their descendants a century and a half afterward , in the declaration of American independence . It further provided , that an election should be held on the first Tuesday of March annually , at which all their officers should be chosen , namely , a Governor , seven Assistants , a Clerk , Treasurer , Coroner , Messenger , and Constables . The duties and powers of these officers were to a considerable extent defined . The Governor had authority to summon and dissolve the General Court , and was made a conser // vator of the public peace ; hut in other respects he had little more authority than any of the other magistrates , except that he could cast a double vote in the General Court . The Assistants composed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers . An oath of office was prescribed for each of the public officers , as well as for the freemen , by which it appears , that they were all required to swear allegiance , not only to the king of England , but to the government of the colony of New Plymouth . The Messenger was the chief executive officer of the General Court , and performed duties very similar to those of a sheriff at the present day . His name was retained till within three or four years by an officer of the General Court of Massachusetts , who still possesses some of his powers , and performs most of his duties , but is now known by the foreign name of sergeant-at-arms . All the freemen in General Court took part in enacting the laws , till 1639 , and it was regarded by them not as a privilege merely , which they might exercise or not as they pleased , but as a duty which , under a penalty , they bound themselves to exercise . It was enacted , that a person who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ten shillings sterling . The privilege of suffrage was regarded by them , as it always will be by all men who value free institutions , as one that should never be neglected , and in which the public , as well as the individual , have an interest . This system was continued till the population had become so extended that it became extremely burdensome to such of the freemen as lived in Duxbury and Scituate . To remedy the evils arising from this cause , the General Court in September , 1638 , enacted , that each town in the colony , except Plymouth , should choose two persons , and Plymouth four , who , with the Governor and Assistants , should " make all good and wholesome laws as would be for the benefit of the colony , " provided , that all the laws so made should be proposed at one General Court , and remain to be considered at the next . It was also further provided , that , if any law so enacted should be found prejudicial , all the freemen assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputies were at first called Committees , and were paid by the towns that sent them . And , since all the inhabitants were bound to bear a portion of // the expense , it was provided , that not only freemen , but all the inhabitants , who had taken the oath of fidelity and were heads of families , should have a voice in their election . This was the beginning of the representative system of the colony , and from this time to its union with Massachusetts most of the laws were made by the Governor , Assistants , and Deputies , composing a single body ; though at all times the freemen claimed , and not unfrequently exercised , the right of assembling , and enacting or repealing laws for themselves . The election of Deputies was regarded as a matter of convenience , and not as precluding them from the rights of legislating for themselves . In all cases of great importance , where the representatives did not wish to take the responsibility , the freemen were called together , or their wishes were otherwise ascertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their whole power could he taken from them , even while they remained in office . In 1646 , a law was made fixing the time of meeting of the General Court , which shows , that a great change in the business habits of our legislators , as in every thing else , has taken place since the days of the Pilgrim fathers . By this law , that body was required to meet in the summer at seven o'clock in the morning , and in the winter at eight o'clock and to remain in session till half past eleven ; when an adjournment took place for dinner . After dinner they were required to hold another session , till such hour in the evening as the Governor thought proper . And , in order to ensure punctuality and constant attendance , each member was liable to a fine of a sixpence for tardiness , and also for each hour 's absence during the session . Before 1658 , no measures were adopted for the publication of the laws . They were kept hy the Secretary , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not in a volume by themselves , but in connexion with all the other records he was required to make . In the same manuscript volume we find the general laws , the judicial proceedings of the court of Assistants , the records of deeds , wills , births , marriages , deaths , coroners ' inquests , and accounts of special providences ; - all mixed together , and all apparently regarded as of equal importance . On one page we find the treaty with Massassoit ; on another , an inventory of the valuable library of Elder Brewster ; // while on a third appears an account of the belligerent proceedings of the colony against the Dutch . ruben comes the record of a general law requiring every householder to keep a ladder , which would reach to the top of his house , or providing that every town shall have a cage for the accommodation of offenders . In this way , the records had grown to be so voluminous , that it became necessary to adopt some new measures to determine what laws were actually in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of repealing and amending laws then in use ; which was to erase or expunge , and this was generally done much more thoroughly than hy the drawing of black lines around the obnoxious law . During the first twenty or thirty years most of the laws were repealed and amended in this manner , and oftentimes without giving the date when the expunging process took place . The oaths of office underwent this process , - first , by erasing the words of allegiance to king Charles and his successor , and interlining " the government of England as it now stands , " and afterwards by having the interImeation erased , and the original phraseology restored . At a General Court held in 165S , a committee was appointed " to peruse the laws , and reduce them to better order . " They made a selection from the whole body of laws , suggested such amendments as they thought proper , and arranged them in alphahetical order , in one manuscript volume . This volume was then suhmitted to the General Court and formally enacted . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , explaining their views in the enactment of laws . In this they say , " We have had an eye primarily and principally unto the Jewish platform , and unto the right iml ) rOVement of the liberties granted unto us by our superiors , the state of England at the first beginning of this infant plantation , which was to enact such laws as should most befit a state in the nonage thereof , not rejecting , or omitting to observe , such of the laws of our native country , as would conduce unto the good and growth of so weak a beginning as ours in this wilderness . " The Secretary was directed to prepare a manuscript volume of these laws for each of the towns in the colony , in whose meetings they were to be read at least once a year . The towns were required to furnish the Secretary with paper , and , in case of their neglect , he was // authorized to purchase it on their account . Nathaniel Morton was then Secretary , and he discharged his duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of his copies of the laws are still extant . There was one , which belonged to the town of Taunton in a good state of preservation , but which was unfortunately destroyed with most of the records of the town in the great fire , which occurred in that place two years ago . No other revision of the laws took place till 1671 , when a digest of them was prepared and enacted , and then they were for the first time printed . At the same time the colonies of Massachusetts and Connecticut digested their laws , and also bad them printed . In all improvements of this kind , the New England colonies went together . Their legislation was nearly the same , embracing in substance the same principles , and securing the same rights ; and it is not unusual to find the same law , nearly word for word , adopted in all the colonies at about the same time . Another revision was made in 1685 , and they were again printed . No other edition of the Ply .. mouth Colony laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by order of the Legislature of Massachusetts as matters of early history , important to be preserved . The judicial system of the colony was simple and efficient . They adopted so much of the common law of England as was suited to their new condition , taking full liberty to amend or change it as they saw fit . Trial by jury was adopted , as has been seen , in 1623 . Before this , all trials were had before the assembled colony , and the accused was acquitted or convicted by the popular voice . Leister and Doty , the first duellists in New England , were convicted by this public tribunal ; and the penalty inflicted by tying together the culprits hand and foot , and keeping them for a reasonable time in a state of fasting , shows that it possessed a good share of wisdom , and was guided by a proper sense of justice . For a number of years , the General Court exercised a large portion of the judicial powers , and , during the whole existence of the colony , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the supreme judicial tribunal . Next to it was the court of assistants , which in process of time became the principal judicial tribunal . In 1685 , county courts were established , having original jurisdiction in most of the cases before determined by the court of Assistants , except in those of a // capital nature . All smaller matters were determined by a single magistrate , or by the selectmen of towns , who were invested with judicial authority for that purpose . How far our ancestors adopted the common law of England , has often been made a question , and is still a matter of dispute . In the colony of New Plymouth there is abundant evidence , that they had the strongest attachment to it , and intended to adopt it so far as it suited their new condition . It is true , that they incorporated into their system much of the Jewish code ; but it was that portion , chiefly , which related to crimes and punishments . Their civil rights as members of the community , so far as related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedial processes for the protection and recovery of rights , were all based on the common law of England . This they claimed as their birthright , and they always regarded it as the wisest means of protection . The colonists were not lawyers , nor were they much skilled in the science and technicalities of the law ; yet they knew enough of its general principles , and of the free spirit which it breathed , properly to estimate its value . It is not strange , that persons thus situated should have made great encroachments upon the system of jurisprudence adopted in the mother country . Our surprise should rather be , that they were able to follow it so closely , and to retain every thing in it that was valuable . Without skill and learning in the law , and without a distinct class of men devoted to its practice and determination , it became necessary , and in that state of society perfectly proper , that every process should be simple , and that every case should be decided by such considerations of equity as should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles , which become necessary in a more complicated state of society . The informal proceedings , which they so frequently adopted , did not affect the great principles which they maintained , but only the manner of carrying those principles into effect . An indictment for the highest crime might be contained in a single line ; yet even this could not be found without the assent of the general inquest , and the accused still had a right of trial by jury . The general good of the colony formed the great rule of action adopted by the General Court . In one sense , it was , like the Parliament of England , omnipotent . From the be // ginning it exercised a constant supervision , not only over the business and employments of the people , but over their habits and morals . In 1626 , the exportation of corn , beans , and peas , was prohibited , and the employment of mechanics regulated . In 1636 , the Governor and Assistants were authorized to punish the drunkard at their own discretion , and , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of punishing all persons who drew " strong waters without a license . In 1635 , it was enacted , that none should become housekeepers , or build cottages , without the consent of the Governor and Assistants . The same authority was afterwards granted to selectmen of towns , who were by no means remiss in its exercise . They were further empowered , in 1 669 , to forbid any person to live by himself , or to board in a family which they did not approve . In 163S , laborers ' wages were fixed at twelve pence per day with board , and eighteen pence per day without it . in 1639 , every householder was required to sow at least one square rod of hemp or flax each year ; and in 1669 , the constables were ordered to look after all persons who slept in church , and report their names to the General Court . And so we might enumerate a hundred other laws , which restrained or directly affected the industry and habits of the people . To us many of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were designed to meet the wants of the people at that time , and , so long as they did so , we have no right to say they were not salutary . To them the rights of the individual were nothing compared with the general good of the colony , which they supposed could best be promoted by bringing all to the standard which a majority prescribed . In its criminal law , the colony was comparatively mild and hutnane . This may be regarded as its general character , though some crimes were punished with an undue degree of severity . All punishments were left to the discretion of the court till 1636 . The capital crimes at this time were only eight . The number was afterwards increased , and in 1671 there were sixteen ; of which one was witchcraft , or , as expressed by the act , " the solemn consortion or conversing with the Divell by the way of witchcraft , conjoration , or the like " ; another , blasphemy ; and a third , cursing or smiting father or mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child could show that his education had been neglected , or that he had been improperly provoked ; and , to the honor of the colony , no execution for witchcraft ever took place within its limits . Most of the smaller offences were punished by fine , setting in the stocks , imprisonment in the town cage or colony prison , or by whipping and branding . The burglar was branded for his first offence with the letter B on his right hand , and , for his second , with the same letter on his left . If the offence was committed on Sunday , the brand was set on the forehead . Other offences were punished by requiring the culprit to wear for a limited time large letters upon his clothing , signifying the crime he had committed . In all of these punishments , the court possessed a large discretionary power , which was exercised according to the nature and character of the offence . The legislation of the colony bears traces of increasing hostility to the use of tobacco , and of the ineffectual attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for home consumption was prohibited . Three years earlier , the General Court declared , that , " whereas there is great abuse in taking tobacco in a very uncivil manner , openly in the town streets , and as men pass upon the highways , to the great reproach of government , it is enacted , if any one is found or seen taking tobacco in the streets , or in any building or field within a mile of a dwelling-house , he shall be fined twelve pence . And , if he be a boy or a servant , without money to pay his fine , he shall be put in the stocks or whipped . " In 1650 , it was provided , that every juror , who used tobacco , should be fined five shillings . ml 669 , it was enacted , " that every person found smoking in the streets on the Lord 's day , going to or returning from meeting within two miles of the meetinghouse , should be fined twelve pence . " All of these provisions of law , without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colony ; and probably had no other effect than to make the smokers and chewers of tobacco a little more cautious , and at the same time to increase their attachment for their favorite but persecuted weed . The great reluctance of the people of the colony to the holding of public offices forms one of their most striking peculiarities . Among them there were no office-seekers , - no lovers of the spoils . They had other and different views in // taking the high and responsible offices of government . For a long time this reluctance was so strong , that it became necessary to compel men under a penalty to accept the highest and most honorable offices in the colony . In 1632 , it was enacted , that , if " any one were elected to the office of Governor , and would not stand to the election , nor hold his office for one year , he should be assessed ? 20 sterling , " with a proviso , that no one should be required to serve two years in succession . It was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he should be liable to a fine of ? 10 sterling , if he did not stand to the election . " In 1637 , Thomas Prince was elected Governor , He was then resident at Duxhury , and a law of the colony required the Governor to reside at Plymouth . At first he declined the office ; hut , after much solicitation , he agreed to accept it on two conditions ; namely , that Governor Bradford , who was then in office , should continue to discharge its duties , till he was ready to assume them , and that he might be permitted to reside at Duxbury . These conditions were acceded to by the General Court , and at the same time it was enacted , that the old officers should continue in office till Governor Prince was ready to discharge the duties of his office , and that they should act under their former oaths . The colony made no provision for the support of the clergy till 1655 . Previously to this , the strong and almost universal attachment of the colonists to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , in process of time , a party grew up which was opposed to the present faith and the established church discipline . It was about this time that the Quakers began to make their appearance , and to sow strife and contention , not only in the church , but in the commonwealth . Opposition to the clergy became more open , and a neglect to make the proper contributions more apparent . At length it became necessary for the General Court to give their attention to it . They appear to have approached the subject with great caution , and to have hesitated to adopt at once a compulsory process . They said , " If there appears to be a real defect in the hearers of the ministers complaining , the magistrate shall use all gentle means to persuade them to do their duty . And , if any one of them shall not thereby be reclaimed , but shall persist through plain // obstinacy against the ordinance of God , then it shall be in the power of the magistrates to use such means as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of law was found insufficient . Two years afterward , the General Court , having declared that all were hound to aid in the support of the ministry , and that there was great neglect in this respect , enjoined that each town should choose four men to assess the inhabitants according to their several estates , leaving it to the ministers to collect these assessments , if they could . Some paid them , others refused ; and , since there was no legal means of enforcing payment , the law soon became a dead letter , and the whole matter was actually left where it was before , - to voluntary contributions . In 1662 , a resolve was passed recommending it to the several towns in the colony to appropriate a portion of the proceeds of all whales cast on shore , for the support of the ministry , which at that time was the source of a considerable income , it being , if we can judge from the constant legislation upon the subject , of very frequent occurrence . In 1669 , the General Court took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public worship , authorizing any magistrate or selectman to compel any delinquent to pay double the amount of his tax . Still the collection of the taxes was left to the clergy . But the system soon became so odious , that , in the following year , the General Court , after declaring that its tendency was to create prejudice against the clergy , provided that each town should choose two collectors of these taxes , and pay the same to the ministers . They further declared their intention to support public worship in all the towns in the colony , and their right to impose any tax for that purpose ; and , as a practical illustration of that right , it was enacted , that fifteen pounds should be raised in the town of Dartmouth . No material change was made in the laws for the support of public worship after this time till the union . They still remain as evidence , not only of the great solicitude of a large majority of the colonists to support public worship , but of the indifference in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people . No measures were adopted for the support of public schools till 1663 , and then the subject was merely recommended to the towns for their consideration . In 1674 , the profits of the // fishery at Cape Cod were appropriated to that purpose ; and it appears from the act , that it was for the support of a single school at Plymouth , which was attended by only eight or ten scholars . The first act , requiring all the inhabitants to support puI*ic schools by a tax , was passed in 1677 , when every town having fifty families was required to raise at least ? 12 per annum for the support of a grammar school . About ten years after , when the colony was divided into counties , each county town was required to support a Latin school , in which young men could be fitted for college . It must not , however , be supposed , from these small efforts of the General Court in the support of public schools , that they were indifferent to this subject . Education was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were always solicitous that the whole people should enjoy its benefits . That they neglected so long to make legal provision for the support of schools , is no proof of indifference ; it rather shows , that such a provision was not then necessary . The colonists were poor , and were all about equally poor ; yet there is abundant evidence of the deep solicitude they felt , and the great exertions they made , to give all their children the benefits of such an education as could then be had . Nor were their efforts confined to that colony alone . On the contrary , when applied to by President IDunster , of Harvard College , to do something for that institution , then in its infancy , and borne down with poverty , they , like all the rest of New England , generously contributed from their scanty means . It is true , their contributions were small , oftentimes consisting of nothing more than a j ) eck or half peck of corn or beans . Yet this was all they had to give . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submit to the arbitrary rule of Sir Edmund Andros , in 1686 ; and , during the three succeeding years , she , like them , suffered one continued series of wrongs . Tier General Court was abolished ; town meetings were forbidden ; land titles were disputed ; taxes illegally and arbitrarily imposed ; her citizens imprisoned without cause ; and , in short , every thing was done , which would characterize a tyrant . It was to them a period of darkness and trial , and for a time it seemed that every thing most valued was lost . But the day of retribution and of deliverance soon came ; and the people here , imme // diately on hearing of the revolution in England , like their neighbours in Massachusetts , threw off the Governor 's authority ; resumed their former government , recalled their old officers , and declared their allegiance to the Protestant sovereigns of England . After this revolution , new efforts were made by this , as well as by several other American colonies , to procure a charter . T hey were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct colonial existence . They were aware , that efforts were making to annex them to some other colony , than which they imagined no greater calamity . It became necessary , in order to prevent this , to adopt the most vigorous measures ; and , accordingly , Sir Henry Ashurst , the Reverend Ichabod Wiswell of Duxhury , and the Reverend Increase Mather of Boston , were appointed agents in behalf of the colony , to obtain a charter . Mather was then in England , having escaped from Boston in the night , during the administration of Andros , for the purpose of laying the complaints of the Massachusetts colony before the King . He was known to have influence at court , and it was supposed that he might exert this for the benefit of the colony . Of his influence there is no doubt ; but the results of the negotiation led to the suspicion , that he regarded the interests of Massachusetts rather than of Plymouth . Such was the opinion of Wiswell , who , in a letter to Governor Hiockley , speaks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " All the frame of heaven moves on one axis , and the whole of New England 's interest seems designed to be loaden on one bottom , and her particular motions to concentrate to the Massachusetts tropic . You know who were wont to trot after the bay horse . Your distance is your advantage , by which you may observe their motions . I do believe , that Plymouth 's silence , Hampshire 's neglect , and the rashness and impudence of one , at least , who fled from New England in disguise by night , hath not a little contributed to our general disappointment . " Mather , however , always pretended to have acted in good faith , and claimed the honor of having Plymouth annexed to Massachusetts instead of New York , in whose charter it was , at first , included . A separate colonial existence could not then have been obtained ; and , since a ' union with some other colony was necessary , there is no // doubt that such a union with Massachusetts would best promote the interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their wishes . There is no evidence of the bad faith of Mather ; and the letter of his associate was probably written under feelings of extreme disappointment . The union , at first , was bitter to the people of J*lymouth . They felt , that they had lost their distinctive political character , and that , as the immediate descendants of the Pilgrims , their rights had not been sufficiently respected . rllhese feelings did not entirely subside for a number of years ; hut at length a common origin and common interest made the people of the two colonies one in feeling , as they were one in their political organization ; and they now claim protection from the same free constitution of the Commonwealth , and feel a common pride and satisfaction in the heroic deeds , liberal views , and generous philanthropy of their fathers . There was a distinction between the early settlers of the two colonies . Those of Plymouth were almost entirely English ; and there is probably no l ) Ortion of North America , which has at the present day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They , however , had not the wealth , rank , or learning of many of the early settlers of Massachusetts . They were men of strong minds , and made a proper estimate of the value of their political and religious principles . They placed but little value on wealth or rank . They acted from higher motives than these afford , and regarded the promotion of the good and happiness of the whole as the great object of government . They had , however , among them some men of preeminent talents and character . As a civil magistrate , Bradford , the father of the colony , ( for Carver , who , chosen to set his name first to the charter , must be taken for " the noblest Roman of them all , " died the first winter , ) and for twenty-one years its governor , would , by his sound good sense and elevated patriotism , have done honor to any age . To his wisdom and discretion the colony owed much of its prosperity , and undoubtedly its prolonged political existence . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high an estimate . For twenty-four years he was the spiritual father and guide of the colony . He came with the Pilgrims , and with them he was willing to endure and suffer . Of the intrepid and courageous Standish , the leader in all military // enterprises , whether against the Indians , the followers of Morton at Merry Mount , or their Dutch neighbours , it was as true as of the Trojan , that success was never to be despaired of , when he led the way . So the Winslows , Allerton , Alden , Hatherly , Prince , and Hinckley were all good men and true , who , in all their efforts and sacrifices , had no other object in view than their country 's good , and the progress of truth and righteousness . This colony was small and its duration short ; but its influence on the character and condition of this people , and ultimately of the human race , was destined to be most important . Never was there a more successful experiment of popular government , combining all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and security of a republic . During the whole seventy-one years of the colony 's existence , there were but six governors ; and two of these were in office during thirtynine years of this period , - a period , too , not of repose and quiet , but of peril and excitement . In their intercourse with the Indians , the people of the colony present a bright example of humanity , and the same sense of justice is here witnessed , that pervaded all their public and private acts . Not a foot of the soil was taken from the natives without their consent , nor without the payment of an equivalent . The treaty with Massassoit for a half century was most scrupulously observed ; and it was not their fault , or the fault of that faithful sachem , but of his treacherous son , that it was at last violated . In their conduct towards the Quakers they were comparatively mild and humane , preferring to let their errors be promulgated , and die unobserved , rather than make them martyrs by the prison or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a loyalty to their own government and principles rather than to any foreign power . It was a love of liberty , and an adherence to the rights of Englishmen . None of the passengers of the . Mayftower survived the colony . Most of them died within thirty or thirty-five years after their arrival . The last survivor was John Alden , who lived till 1686.
