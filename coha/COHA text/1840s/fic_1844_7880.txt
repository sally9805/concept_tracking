Smith , Samuel Francis , 1808-1895 : PROVIDENCE . from Poems , in Lyric gems 1844 S. F. SMITH . Through all the years of childhood 's prime Changes on changes roll ; Each brings its varied scenes of bliss Or sorrow to the soul ; In infant joys and infant griefs A little life we live  --  A miniature of all the scenes That future years shall give . But not a scene in life comes on  --  Of gladness or of tears  --  Where not the hand of him that rules Our mortal state appears ; Each change that comes , of joy or wo , Is fixed by heaven 's decree  --  Nor would we alter aught that God Wished from eternity . O no , we would not alter aught That wisdom hath designed To train for everlasting bliss The wandering , wayward mind ; It is our joy that he we love Will be our guide forever ; Nor aught from his paternal care Our interests shall sever . Smith , Samuel Francis , 1808-1895 : NEW-YEAR . from Poems , in Lyric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past  --  The eventful years that roll ; The sands of life are dropping fast  --  The racer nears the goal  --  The ship upon the stormy sea Rests not for adverse weather , Until she reach her port , or sink , Cargo and men together . Thou art the racer to the goal , Swift o'er the level plain ; Thine are the rapid sands that roll  --  How few may yet remain ! Thine is the good ship on the sea , Tossed by the tempests round her ; One tempest more , and all thy hopes Of earthly joy may founder . Seek then in heaven a holy arm , To be thy strength and stay , To save thy spirit from alarm , When all things pass away ; So shall a holy hope be thine , If future years roll o'er thee ; Or this , in glorious welcome , spread The gates of heaven before thee . Smith , Samuel Francis , 1808-1895 : AUTUMNAL HYMN . from Poems , in Lyric gems 1844 The leaves , around me falling , Are preaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come , pilgrim , come away ! " The day , in night declining , Says , I must too decline , The year , its bloom resigning  --  Its lot foreshadows mine ! The light my path surrounding , The loves to which I cling , The hopes within me bounding , The joys that round me wing  --  All , all , like stars at even , Just gleam and shoot away , Pass on before to heaven , And chide at my delay . The friends gone there before me Are calling from on high , And happy angels o'er me Tempt sweetly to the sky . " Why wait , " they say , " and wither , ' Mid scenes of death and sin ? O rise to glory hither , And find true life begin ! " I hear the invitation , And fain would rise and come , A sinner to salvation , An exile to his home ; But while I here must linger , Thus , thus , let all I see Point on with faithful finger , To heaven , O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1808-1895 : THE UNOPENED LETTER . from Poems , in Lyric gems 1844 S. F. SMITH . Month after month the sickly youth wasted and pined away , Far from the kindred friends who in his heart 's affections lay ; He left the cherished joys of home to seek a milder sky , That waning health might be restored ;  --  but left that home  --  to die . The wintry tempests came and passed  --  the spring-flowers shed their bloom ,  --  And summer shone in gorgeousness around his future tomb ; The glimmering hope was in the breast of those who loved him well , That in their own endeared abode , at home , he yet might dwell . That glimmering hope was like the light the autumn eve brings on ; Serene and beautiful , but brief  --  too quickly fled and gone ; ' T was in the earliest days in which the leaf begins to wither , The joyous hope and life itself faded and fled together . Silent and feeble lay the youth , while ebbed the living tide ; Strangers were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A letter came from those he loved  --  written with hearts of joy  --  A letter full of tenderness  --  sent to their darling boy . " Lay it aside "  --  he said , as life its sands was spending fast ; Heaven 's holy hope shone in his soul  --  earth from his memory passed ; That letter  --  it was laid aside  --  affection 's anxious token ; The sainted spirit rose to God  --  the seal remained unbroken . Smith , Samuel Francis , 1808-1895 : THE DEPARTED . from Poems , in Lyric gems 1844 S. F. SMITH . When spirits from their cumbering clay Ascend to heaven 's bright shore , Our hoping hearts with triumph say  --  " Not lost , but gone before . " The wheel lies broken at the fount , The pitcher at the spring ; But upward doth the spirit mount , And notes of glory sing . Then calmly may our spirits bow Beneath affliction 's rod ; Who , who would murmur that his friend Is safe in joy and God ?      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
