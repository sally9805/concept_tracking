txt qwq what force and fire they may contain , in those channels where birth has placed them . This is more especially true in all monarchical and aristocratical governments . The iron frame-work they stretch over the human race effectually presses down every throb that would otherwise send an undulation over the mass . No head can lift itself except in the legitimate way , while very small heads that happen to hit the aperture aristocracy has kindly left open may reach a high elevation . Revolution rends this frame-work as if it were a cobweb , and lets the struggling , panting mass beneath suddenly erect themselves to their full height and fling abroad their arms in their full strength . The surface , which before kept its even plane except where a star or decoration told the right of the wearer to overlook his fellow , becomes all at once a wild waste of rolling billows . Then man is known by the force within him , and not by the pomp about him . There is also a prejudice and bigotry always attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while it will not measure by a just standard , because that would depreciate its own excellence . Those , on the contrary , who obtain influence through the soul and force they carry within them , appreciate these things alone in others , and hence judge them by a true criterion . Thus Bonaparte-himself sprung from the middle class of society-selected men to lead his armies from their personal qualities alone . This is the great secret of his astonishing victories . Dukes and princes led the allied armies , while men headed the battalions of France . Bonaparte judged men by what they could do , and not by their genealogy . He looked not at the decorations that adorned the breast , but the deeds that stamped the warrior-not at the learning that made the perfect tactician , but the real practical force that wrought out great achievements . Victorious battlefields were to him the birthplace of titles and the commencement of genealogies ; and stars were hung on scarred and war-battered , rather than noble breasts . Napoleon had learned the truth taught in every physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our race always spring from the middle and lower classes . All reformers also start there and they always must , for not only is their sight clearer and their judgment more just , but their earnest language is adapted to the thoughts and sympathies of the many . Those men also who rise to power through themselves alone , feel it is by themselves alone they must stand , hence the impelling motive is not so much greatness to be won ; as the choice between it and their original nothingness . Bonaparte was aware of this , and of all his generals who have gone down to immortality with him , how few were taken from the upper classes . Augereau was the son of a grocer , Bernadotte of an attorney , and both commenced their career as private soldiers . Berthier , Bessi*res , St. Cyr , Jourdan and the fiery Junot , all entered the army as privates . Kleber was an architect , the impetuous Lannes the son of a poor mechanic ; Lefevre , Loison and the bold Scotchman Macdonald were all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , and the reckless , chivalric Murat the son of a country landlord . Victor , Suchet , Pichegru , Oudinot , and the stern and steady Soult , were each and all of humble origin , and commenced their ascent from the lowest step of fame 's ladder . And last of all NEY , the " Bravest of the Brave , " was the son of a poor tradesman of Sarre Louis . He was born in 1770 , and at the age of thirteen became a notary of the village . Tbe stirring events passing around him inflamed his youthful imagination , and at the age of seventeen he entered the army as a hussar , and commenced his military career . We do not design to follow him through all his history , but select out those acts which illustrate the great and striking qualities he possessed . His air and bearing stamped him as a soldier , and made him from the first a great favorite in his corps . Being selected by them to challenge the fencing master of another regiment , for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The day was appointed to settle the difficulty , but just as the combatants had crossed their sabres , they were arrested by their officers and thrown into prison . As soon , however , as young Ney was released , he renewed the quarrel , and having met his antagonist in a secret place , fought and wounded him in the hand , so that he was unable to practise his profession , and was consequently reduced to pov // erty . Ney did not forget him in the day of his greatness , and settled on the poor fencing master a pension for life . ml 793 , he was promoted for his bravery and skill , and the next year , being then twenty-four years of age , he was presented with a company . General Kleber having noticed his admirable qualities , placed him at the head of a corps composed of five hundred partisans , who received no pay and lived on plunder . It was their duty to reconnoitre the enemy 's position and cut off their convoys , which exposed them to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Young Ney being resolved on promotion , brought to this perilous service all his mental and physical powers . His iron will seemed to compensate for the loss of sleep and food and rest . Daunted by no danger , exhausted by no toil , caught by no stratagem , he acquired at the head of this bold band of warriors the sobriquet of the " Indefatigable . " Three years after he found occasion to distinguish himself in the engagements of Dierdorf Altenkirchen , and Montabour . With one hundred cavalry he took two thousand prisoners and obtained possession of Wurtzberg. lie led two columns straight into the river , aud forcing the opposite banks , though lined with cannon , made himself master of Forsheim . For these exploits he was appointed general of a brigade . At the battle of Neuwied he had charge of the cavalry , and in a desperate charge passed entirely through the Austrian lines ; but being surrounded by a superior force he was compelled to retreat , and his horse having fallen under him , he was taken ptisoner . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank of general of division . For awhile after the peace of Leoben , he remained in Paris , and having joined the Clichian party became entangled in politics . But the commencement of hostilities in 1799 , found Ney again in the field of battle , struggling with the allied forces on the banks of the Rhine . Here occurred one of those adventures that belong rather to the period of romance , than to the practical history of our times . The Rhine flowed between him and the city of Manheim , which was strongly garrisoned and filled with stores of every kind . It was a matter of much discussion how this key of Germany should be taken . The generals of the army met in frequent consultation , on the best mode of attacking it . Ney , in the mean time , thinking it could be better taken by surprise , resolved to visit it in disguise and ascertain its weak points . So , one evening assuming the garb of a peasant , he entered the city , and , after satisfying himself as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and fifty brave men , he recrossed the river at eight in the evening , and at eleven made a furious assault on the outposts . A portion of the garrison having made a sally he repulsed them , and following hard after the fugitives entered the town with them , and after a short but desperate engagement captured it . This fixed his rising fame . At Worms , and Frankenthal , and Frankfort , and Stuttgard , and Zurich , he maintained the character he had gained . In 1802 , we find him again in Paris , holding the office of inspector-general of cavalry . He there married Mademoiselle Augn* , an intimate friend of Hortense Beauharnais . Bonaparte presented him at the nuptials with a magnificent Egyptian sabre , which eventually cost the bold marshal his life . In 1803 , he was sent as Minister Plenipotentiary into Switzerland , where he exhibited those higher qualities of justice and kindness so uniformly , that the Swiss Cantons presented him with a medal on his departure . The next year Bonaparte made him a Marshal . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in honor of the battle he there fought . In the campaigns of 1806-7 , he reached the height of his fame and power , and ever alter Bonaparte regarded him as one of the strongest pillars of his power . The three great distinguishing characteristics of Ney were great personal bravery almost unparalleled coolness in the hour of peril , and an excellent judgment . In the first two , all writers are agreed , while the last is not generally conceded to him . No man can deny he was brave , for there can be no appeal from the decision of an army of heroes , who named him " bravest of the brave . " Such a distinction among the men and in the times he lived , was not won by ordinary actions . In an army where Davoust , Junot , Macdonald , Murat and Lannes , commanded , to be crowned " bravest of // the brave , " was the highest honor a military chieftain could desire . But his courage was not the rashness of headlong excitement , like that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of battle amid the tossing of plumes , the tramping of the host , the shout of trumpets and roar of cannon , has always been found sufficient to hurl man into any scene of horror or peril . Junot could coolly sit and write to Bonaparte 's dictation , while the shot whistled around him , and laughingly shake the paper as a cannon ball ploughing past him threw the dirt over it ; with the exclamation " This is lucky , I shall have*io need of sand . " Murat could ride on his magnificent steed up to a whole company of Cossacks , and disperse them by a single wave of the hand . Davoust could forage like the lion mid the foe at Montihello , while the cannon shot wasted so awfully around him , that he himself said afterward , " I could hear the bones crash in my division like hail-stones against a window . " Yet each of these was but one among a thousand heroic acts , and gained for their authors no such title as that given to Ney . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth by sudden emergencies , such as the commonest soldier often exhibits in the heat of battle . Ney 's courao*e was something more than all this . ft dared just as much without the least apparent excitement . His thoughts were just as clear , and his eye as quiet amid the falling ranks , as if he were standing on some far observatory and looking over the scene of slaughter . He would stand almost within the blaze of two hundred cannon , and while his horses were sinking under him , his guard falling around him , and whole companies melting like frost-work before his eyes , give orders as calmly as though manmuvering at a grand review . It was his wonderful , almost marble calmness in the most sudden and extremest danger , that struck even heroes with astonishment . He would stand within musket shot of a most terrific and hotly worked battery , and while the storm of bullets swept where he stood , eye all its operations , and scan its assailable points with imperturbable quietness . The fierce shock of cavalry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one moment divert his gaze , or disturb the clear and natural operations of his mind . The alarming cry through his own ranks , " Sauve qui peut , " or the full belief that all was lost , could not shake his rock-fast steadiness . One would have thought him a marbleman , strung with no ordinary nerves , had they not seen him in a desperate charge . Then his eye glanced like an eagle 's , and with his form towering amid the smoke of battle and flash of sabres , he seemed an embodied hurricane sweeping over the field . Much of this doubtless was constitutional , and much was owing to the wonderful power of mental concentration . He could literally shut up his mind to the one object he had in view . The overthrow of the enemy absorbed every thought within him , and he had none to give to danger or death . XVhere he placed his mind he held it , and not all the uproar and confusion of battle could divert it . He would not allow himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insensible to the danger around him , as a deaf and dumb and blind man would have been . He himself once expressed the true secret of his calmness , when after one of these exhibitions of composure , amid the most awful carnage , one of his officers asked him if he never felt fear , he replied , " I never had time . " This was another way of saying that fear and danger had nothing to do with the object before him , and therefore he would not suffer hi* thoughts to rest on them for a single moment . It would not require much " time , " we should think , to see the danger of marching straight into the flash of a hundred cannon , or to feel a thrill of terror , as the last discharge left him almost alone , amid his dead and dying guard . But he had trained his mind not to see these things for the time being . This devotion and concentration of all his powers , gave him great advantage in moments of peril and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . Where other men would become confused in the confusion around them , he was as clear as ever , and hence was able frequently to redeem everything , when everything seemed lost , lie would not be beat , and in the last extremity , rallied like a dying man for a final blow , then planted it where the clearest practical wisdom would have done . His tenacity of resolution was equal to his bravery . He disputed every inch he yielded , as if // it were his last hope , and fought on the threshold of the next as if that were but the commencement of the struggle . So in encountering obstacles in the execution of any plan he had formed , he would scarcely admit their existence , and seemed to think he coulA wring the decree against him out of the iron hand of fate itself . These qualities rendered him an invaluable ally to Bonaparte in his great battles . Standing in his observatory , and looking over the conflict , Napoleon often saw where the whole issue turned on a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lines broken or a certain battery carried , or the day was lost . On such missions he always sent Ney , knowing if human skill and valor could avail , it would be done . When he saw him start with his column and move down towards the spot where the fate of the battle was vibrating , his countenance always wore a complacent look . Again and again , did he fling his crown and France into Ney 's keeping , and that of his legion ; and almost without fear , see them borne on into the smoke of battle . The bold Marshal never disappointed him , and it was for this reason Bonaparte placed his throne and empire into his hands , and saw them both go down in the last charge of the Old Guard at Waterloo . Even here Ney would have saved his master , if bravery and devotion could have done it . During the whole campaign of 1806-7 , Ney moves before us as some hero of former ages . We see him at Jena , when borne on by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the next instant found himself surrounded by an army that no other man would have thought of resisting . But though hemmed in , and apparently overwhelmed , instead of yielding , as prudence itself seemed to dictate , he immediately formed his men into squares : and kept up such a rolling , devouring fire , on every side , that the headlong masses fell by hundreds at every discharge . Bonaparte , seeing the imminent peril of his brave marshal , detached Bertrand with several regiments of horse to his relief . No sooner was he extricated , than he unrolled his men again into column , and with a firm and rapid step ascended the hill on which Vierzehn Heiligen stood , and after a fierce conflict , took it . This was the centre of the enemy 's position , and Napoleon saw from a distance with delight his favorite marshal in the very heart of the Prussian lines . Repulsing for awhile with prodigious slaughter every attempt of the enemy to regain it , he again unrolled his column and marched through a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tempest of musketry and grape through which he advanced , drove like a storm of sleet in the face of his men ; but nothing could resist his impetuous charge , and the right line of the allies was swept away . Around the wall of Erfurt and Magdeburg-crossing the Vistu*i-at the terrible battle of Soldau-annihilating a Russian corps at Deppen , at Gustadt and Amskerdorfl ' - he is the same calm , determined and terrible man . In the picture our imagination draws of the battle of Friedland , Ney always occupies the foreground . There , as usual , he was appointed to commence the action . The engagements with detached corps had ceased , and both armies were drawn up in battle array . For several hours there had been no firing , and it being now four o'clock , the Russian general supposed there would be no engagement till morning . But at five o'clock the sudden discharge of twenty cannon from the French centre , the signal of attack , announced to the Russian army that the day was to end in blood . they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next moment the head of Ney 's mighty column was seen to emerge from the wood behind P6sthenen and stretch itself like a huge Anaconda out into the open field . In close array and quick time it moved straight upon Friedland . The sun was stooping to the western horizon as if hasting from the scene of carnage about to open - yet his departing light gave new splendor to the magnificent array . A forest of glittering steel seemed moving over the field . From the steeples and towers of Friedland the countless thousands of those that still remained in the wood were visible . But all eyes were directed on Ney and his magnificent column , that , crossing the field at a rapid step , scattered like a whirlwind everything that opposed their progress . Whole regiments of cavalry and Cossacks , the chasseurs of the guard , militia and all , went down , or were driven before the tide-like movement of that column . On every side were seen flying // horsemen and scattered infantry . The other divisions now advanced to the attack , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for he was close upon Friedland , and a shout rolling along the wbole column and heard above the roar of battle , announced that the town was about to he carried by assault . But just at this crisis the Russian Imperial Guard was ordered to advance . With fixed bayonets , this mass of living valor hurled itself on its adversary . The bead of Ney 's column went down before the terrific charge , and the whole body was rolled back over the field . But falling on Victor 's corps rapidly advancing to sustain him , he rallied his broken ranks and again pressed to tbe assault . Friedland was carried after an obstinate reistance and immense slaughter , and soon the bridges in the rear over the Alle were in flames . The smoke rolled over the field of battle like that of a burning forest  --  the sun went down in gloom , and the dead were piled over the ground , and Ney had made Bonaparte again conqueror by his indomitable valor . Napoleon 's confidence in him was almost unbounded . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sheltered by a height in front of the town , at his breakfast , when su denly he heard the sound of Ney 's guns thundering on the left . At the same instant a bomb burst over his head . XVithout noticing the bursting shell , he sat down and wrote to Marie Louise that the victory was gained . He waited only to learn that Ney was where the crisis turned , to be sure of victory . Yet Ney has been often accused of wanting generalship . Mr. Alison makes him a brave man and no more . This decision is based on a single declaration of Bonaparte ,  --  speakiug once of Ney , he said " he was the bravest of men ; there terminated all his faculties . " Now we do not place the least confidence in this assertion of Napoleon . His opinion of his generals changed with their success . A brilliant achievement brought down on them the most extravagant encomiums from the Emperor ; a defeat , on the contrary , his bitterest invectives . This disparagement of Ney was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marshal was implicated . Besides , Bonaparte was the last man we should choose , to estimate the character of his own officers . He rated all military leaders low but himself . Accustomed to plan for his generals , he came to think they could not plan for themselves . So also their achievements , when put in comparison with his own , he invariably depreciated . Bonaparte made the pass of St. Bernard , and he wished it to stand alone beside that of hannibal 's : so that McDonald 's passage of the Splugen , to which his own was mere child 's play , he declared repeatedly to have been no great affair , and so reported it to the French Government at home . The whole history of Bonaparte 's career  --  the confidence he everywhere reposed in Ney 's skill as well as bravery , pronounce this declaration false , while the manner in which he managed the rear guard in that awful and disastrous retreat of the grand army from Russia , , shows the injustice of the charge in every way . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French there , and Bonaparte knew it . He never placed Ney at the head of the army in invading Russia , and in the rear when retreating from it , simply because he was a brave man . His actions and statements here contradict each other , and the former is more likely to be honest than the latter . The two great and ruinous errors of BonnParte 's ambitious career would have been prevented had he listened to Ney 's counsel . The conquest of Spain brought nothing but disaster , and the invasion of Russia overturned his throne . Against both these Ney urged his strenuous remonstrance as long as it seemed of any avail , and then did his utmost to prevent the ruin he knew must follow . One day at Madrid Napoleon entered the room where Ney and several other officers were standing , and said in great glee , " Everything goes on well ; Romana will be reduced in a fortnight ; the English are defeated and will be unable to advance ; in three months the war will be finished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reply ; but Ney , shaking his head , said with his characteristic bluntness , " Sire , this war has lasted long already , and our affairs are not improved . These people are obstinate , even their women and children fight ; they massacre our men in detail . To-day we cut the enemy in pieces , to-morrow we have to oppose another twice as // numerous . It is not an army we have to fight , it is a whole nation , I see no end to this business . " Bonaparte followed his own inclinations and was eventually defeated . Ney saw the difference between conquering an army and a people . Though engaged in no general battle while in Spain , he exhibited his wonted skill and bravery in Asturia . But it is in the Russian campaign that he displayed his greatest qualities as a commander . The history of the Grand Army in its invasion of Russia and retreat from it , combines more of glory and of gloom than anything of its kind in the annals of man . The contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing the Niemen in presence of Napoleon , as he sat in his tower and saw those glorious legions move in beautiful order and high spirits before him ; and the remnant of that scattered army in rags , wan and ghastly , following their iron-hearted leader as he strode on foot over the same river , always fills one with the profoundest melancholy . At Smoleusko , Ney made a last effort to dissuade the Emperor from pressing into Russia so late in the season . But neither he nor the other generals that formed his council could divert his purpose . The battles of Valentini and Krasnoi soon followed , and last of all came Borodino , in which Ney " outdid himself , " and earned the title Napoleon gave him on the spot of " Prince of Moskwa . " At the commencement of that action Bonaparte kept Ney close beside him , and would not for a long time allow him to take any part in the conflict . There they stood within hailing distance of each other , and gazed on the battle that raged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and gave his last orders . The drums beat their wild and hurried charge , and Ney with his three divisions hurled themselves on the foe . The enemy 's artillery swept within a certain limit every inch of ground , and it seemed impossible that a body of men could stand there a single moment . Bonaparte watched the progress of the column till it at length entered the storm of grape shot , when the head of it sunk down and disappeared like snow when it meets the river . Yet Ney still towered unhurt amid his falling column , and without faltering a moment , led the remnant of his divisions straight VOL . XYI. *-NO . LXXXII. 27 through the destructive fire , up to the very intrenchments , and carried them . Then commenced that terrific struggle for the heights of Demenowskoie . Davoust and Ney strove together with more than human valor to gain the eminence . After four hours of steady , unparalleled effort against superior force , and in the midst of incessant discharges of artillery , Ney sent to Bonaparte for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered down , while Napoleon wheeled four hundred cannon on the redoubt . Under cover of this terrible fire , the mighty columns of ? *avalry and infantry moved to the assault . The Russian artillery from the batteries stretched whole battalions on the field at every discharge . But it was all in vain . The rent columns closed again as before , " each treading where his comrade stood , " and pressed on like the in-rolling wave of the sea . Finding the French were gaining ground , the Russian commander ordered his whole left wing to leave the intrenchments and meet the French in the plain below . The shock was awful . Eighty thousand men were crowded into a small space , and for more than an hour raged against each other in all the ferocity of war , while seven hundred pieces of cannon played incessantly upon the dense masses of living flesh . Ney moved amid this wild storm the same calm and determined man as ever . His uniform riddled with balls , and his face begrimed with powder and smoke , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his troops , and with his cool bravery held his exhausted men to the encounter with a tenacity that could not be overcome , and which saved Bonaparte that day from a ruinous defeat . Napoleon often gazed with astonishment on the movements of his favorite marshal . The quiet determination with which he set out to execute the most hopeless order  --  the progress he would make against the most desperate odds , and the victory he would wring from defeat itself , brought even from Napoleon bursts of admiration . The blazing towers of Moscow , the turning point of Napoleon 's invasion and his fortune , have scarcely crumbled to ashes before the fated army turn their faces homeward . We should like to be made acquainted with the conversations of Napoleon and Ney as they sat together in the Kremlin and talked over // qwq hour , then forming a body of 4000 men , turned north towards the Dnieper . Having reached the stream in safety , he arranged his fragment of an army so as to march over the ice at a moment 's warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weak and wounded stragglers to come in . Pressed by the most appalling dangers he still yielded to the dictates of mercy . There on the banks of the frozen river , and during this time of intense anxiety , did this strange indomitable man lie down with his martial cloak around him , and sleep . Bonaparte , far in advance , struggling forward on foot with a birch stick in his hand to keep him from falling on the ice , surrounded by his few exhausted yet faithful followers , was pressed with anxiety for the fate of Ney-his now last remaining hope . But the marshal , with only three thousand men , had still a wilderness between him and his Emperor , and that wilderness was filled with Cossacks . For sixty miles he struggled on with his weary columns amid six thousand of these wild warriors . At one time they got in advance of him and fell unexpectedly upon his advanced posts , which were immediately driven in , and all was given up as lost . But Ney ordered the trumpets to sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comrades , now is the moment ; forward , they are ours , " rallied their courage to the assault , and the Cossacks fled . Thinking their general saw what they did not see , and that the enemy were cut off , the soldiers pressed forward where otherwise they would have yielded and fled . At length with onlyfifteex hundred men out of the forty thousand with which he had started , he arrived near Orcha and near the French army . When Bonaparte heard of it , he exclaimed , " I have three hundred millions in my coffers in the Tuileries , I would willingly have given them to save Marshal Ney . " Well he might , and half his empire with it , for without him he had been a throneless Emperor . The meeting of Bonaparte and his brave Marshal shows the profound impression the conduct of the latter had made on him . As his eye fell on the worn yet still proud unconquerable veteran , he exclaimed , " What a man , what a soldier ! " But words failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his bosom and embraced him with all the rapture one hero embraces another . But Ney 's exhausting efforts were not yet over . Bonaparte dared not relieve him from his dangerous and important post . Though the rear guard had melted away again and again under his command , he still renewed its ranks , and presented the same determined front to the enemy . At the awful passage of the Beresina , he stood again between the army and destruction . At length the scattered remnants of the French Legions reached the Niemen , the boundary of the Russian territory . Ney arrived destitute of troops  --  the * rear guard had again melted away . Collecting in baste a few hundred men whom he found in the town ( Wilna ) , he planted twenty-four cannon on the redoubts , and kept back the enemy all day , while the army was retiring . The next morning he continued his defence , but the soldiers , seeing their comrades bending their footsteps towards France , and away from the bullets of the Russians , began to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his duty be continued to cover the retreat of the army he had so often saved . All had not yet passed the Niemen , and by dint of persuasion , and threats , and promises , he collected thirty men around him , and with musket in hand defended with this handful the gate of Wilna . At length , when the last soldier was over , he slowly retired through the streets with his face to the enemy , and crossing the river , " was the last of the Grand Army who left the Russian territory . " Gumbinnen was the first place in Germany , after crossing the river , it which rest could be obtained . General Dumas , who was sick , had just entered the house of a French physician in this town , when a man accosted him wnom he took to be a perfect stranger . His powerful form was wrapped in a large military cloak-his beard was long and untrimmed-his countenance begrimed with powder , and his whiskers half burned off , while his emaciated face spoke of toils and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned with that lustre no one ever forgot who once saw it in battle . " What , " said the stranger , " General Dumas , do you not know me ? " " * replied Dumas , " Who are you ? " " I am the rear guard of the grand Army- // Marshal Ney . I have fired the last musket-shot on the bridge of Kowno ; I have thrown into the Niemen the last of our arms ; and I have walked hither as you see me across the forests . " lie had done all that man could do-fought till his army was annihilated , then formed another-created means where they did not exist-sustained the sinking courage of his followers when all before him was blank and hopelessstruggled at last with a few hundred and then thirty , and then alone , as rear guard of the army , and finally on foot and almost unattended crossed the forests to the remnant of that army . We can not follow him through the campaign of 1813 . He fought beside the Emperor , though his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dresden , Denonewitz , Leipsic and many other places , he exhibited his accustomed skill and bravery . After the abdication of Napoleon he lived in Paris in almost entire seclusion . Too rough for the polished society of the French capital , and too stern and grave to be dissipated , he dwelt by himself . His palace was elegantly furnished ; and his wife , fond of gaiety and luxury , entertained her friends there , while he would be dining by himself , musing over the stormy and adventurous life he had led . Sick of the inactive monotonous life of Paris , he retired to his country-seat , where , in the sports of the field , he could find some relief to his restlessness . It was here he received his unexpected order to join the Sixth Military Division . On arriving at Paris he learned to his astonishment that Bon*parte had left Elba and was on his way to the capital . Here we approach the only dark spot in his history . The defence his own friends make for him fails to exculpate him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his exile , and Ney did perfectly right to sustain the government of France but he had no right to betray the trust his Monarch reposed in him , and go over with his army to the side of the invader . He , by this act , became a traitor ; but his treason had more excuses than the like crime ever had before . At first he regarded the descent of Napoleon on the shores of France , as the most extravagant rashness , and designed , as he declared , to bring him a prisoner to Paris . But lie bad hardly set out on his expedition before Bonaparte began to ply him with those arts he knew so well how to use . He had made Ney what he was , and he appealed to the gratitude of the noble-hearted veteran . He had stood by his side in the smoke and thunder of battle , and he recalled these scenes to his imagination . They had been warriors together in danger , and Bonaparte excited him with those recollections , so calculated to move a heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , representing to him the utter feebleness and imbecility of the Bourbon throne - he called him again the " Bravest of the Brave , " and entreated him not to fight against his old companion and King . At the same time he promised peace to France , and all that Ney could desire . A plain blunt soldier-with a heart full of great affections for heroes like himself , what wonder is it that his constancy shook ! Added to all this , the emissaries of Bonaparte had at length affected the fidelity of the army , and while Ney was wavering , his soldiers had already determined for Napoleon . He felt he could not resist the tide if he would , while he evidently had lost all desire to do so . His act of treason has many palliations ; still it was unworthy of him . If his old affections and his gratitude were too strong to allow him to fight against his former Monarch , his honor should have prevented him from fighting against his new one . He should have returned and resigned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards felt so . The excitement and enthusiasm under which he had acted had passed away , and he saw the transaction in a clear and just light . It weighed on his heart , and he grew melancholy and spiritless . He had lost his self-respect ; and his honor , which he heretofore had kept bright as his sword , was tarnished . Kindly feelings had conquered him whom no enemy could subdue , and now the eye no danger could daunt or hardship dim , , became dull and lustreless . That glorious forehead , that had been the terror of so many hundred battles , had a spot upon it , and Ney felt feebler than in the hour of extremest peril . Remorse gnawed at his heart , and the feeling of personal dignity was gone for ever . He became morose and restless , and not until ordered by Bonaparte to Lille , " if he would see the first battle , " did he evince any of his old fire . This single fact is the greatest apology we could // offer for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his heart was not that of a traitor . It was not the deliberate treason of a villain , hut the sudden impulse of a man too frequently governed by his feelings . He afterwards doubtless hoped , in the excitement of battle , to rid himself of his remorse , and perhaps by his valor to wipe out the disgrace he had brought on his name . His last charge at Waterloo showed that the firmness and bravery of the man was undiminished . It is true the Old Guard was not what it had been . It required the experience and training of the veterans that fell in the snowdrifts of Russia . But still it was " the Old Guard , " which had ever regarded itself the prop and pride of Bonaparte . It was the same that had gained him so many battles  --  the same that at Krasnoi , in the retreat from Russia , when reduced to a little band , closed round their emperor and marched past the Russian batteries ; playing in the hottest of the fire the popular air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 " It was the " unconquerable guard . " From eleven in the morning till four in the afternoon , the battle had raged , while victory perched on neither standard . The heavy French cavalry had charged the English squares in vain . Jerome Bonaparte had left 1400 men around Hougonmont . The centre of the English lines had not yielded an inch , yet , exhausted and worn , they stood less firmly in their places . The Old Guard had remained passive spectators of the scene during the whole day , being reserved for the last moment to complete the victory . At this juncture , the head of the Prussian columns appeared on the field . Fifty thousand fresh troops added to the English army would make the odds too great . Instead of retiring till Grouchy could come up and restore the balance , Bonaparte took the rash and desperate resolution of bringing his entire reserve into the field , and with one awful charge break the centre , and prevent the threatened junction of the two armies . For this purpose he called up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched down the slope , and halting in a hollow , addressed them in his fiery , vehement manner . He told them everything r&amp;ted on their valor . They answered with the shout , " Vice l'Empereur , " that was heard all along the British lines . He then placed them under Ney , who ordered the charge . Bonaparte has been blamed for not heading this charge himself ; but he knew he could not carry that guard so far , nor hold them so long before the artillery , as Ney . The moral power Ney carried with him , from the reputation he had gained of being the " bravest of the brave , " was worth a whole battalion . Whenever a column saw him at their head , they knew that it was to be victory or annihilation . With the exception of Macdonald , we do not know a general in the two armies who could hold his soldiers so long in the very face of destru*aion as he . The whole continental struggle exhibited no sublimer spectacle than this last effort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put upon the plains of Waterloo to be battled for . The greatest military energy and skill the world possessed had been tasked to the utmost during the day . Thrones were tottering on the ensanguined field , and the shadows of fugitive kings flitted through the smoke of battle . Bonaparte 's star trembled in the zenith , now blazing out in its ancient splendor , now suddenly paling before his anxious eye . At length , when the Prussians appeared on the field , he resolved to put Europe on one bold throw . He committed himself and France to Ney , and saw hi* empire rest on a single charge . We almost forget Napoleon 's ambition and guilt in our sympathy with him in this critical moment of his life . The intense anxiety with which he watched the advance of that column , and the terrible suspense he suffered when the smoke of battle wrapped it from sight , and the utter despair of his great heart when the curtain lifted over a fugitive army , and the despairing shriek rung on every side , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " make us for the moment almost wish he had gained the day . Ney lilt the immense responsibility resting upon him . He felt the pressure of an empire on his brave heart , and resolved not to prove unworthy of the great trust committed to hi* care . Nothing could be more imposing than the movement of that grand column to the assault . That guard had never yet recoiled before a human foe , and the allied forces beheld with awe its firm and terrible advance to the final // charge . For a moment the batteries stopped playing , and the firing ceased along the British lines . Without the beating of a drum or the blast of a bugle , to cheer their steady courage , they moved in dead silence over the plain . The next moment the artillery opened , and the head of that gallant column seemed to sink into the earth . Rank after rank went down , yet they neither stopped nor faltered . Dissolving squadrons , and whole columns disappearing one after another in the destructive fire , affected not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and each treading over his fallen comrade , pressed firmly on . The horse which Ney rode fell under him , and he had scarcely mounted another before it also sunk to the earth . Again and again did that unflinching man feel his steed sink down , till Jive had been shot under him . Then , with his uniform riddled with bullets , and his face singed and blackened with powder , he marched on foot with drawn sabre at the head of his column . In vain did the artillery hurl its storm of fire and lead into that living mass . Up to the very muzzles they pressed , and driving the artillerymen from their own pieces , pushed on through the English lines . But the sudden firing of that hitherto unseen rank into their very faces , pouring a sheet of flame into their bosoms , was too much for human courage . They reeled , shook , turned and fled . Ney was borne back in the refluent tide , and hurried over the field . But for the crowd of fugitives that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen in his footsteps . As it was , disdaining to fly though the whole army was flying , he formed his men into two immense squares , and endeavored to stem the terrific tide , and would have done so had it not been for the fifty thousand fresh Prussians that pressed on his exhausted ranks . For a long time they stood and let the artillery plough through them . But the fate of Napoleon was writ , and though we believe Ney did what no other man in Europe could have done , the decree could not he reversed . The star that had blazed so balefully over the world went down in blood , and the " bravest of the brave " had fought his last battle . It was worthy of his great name , and the charge of the Old Guard at Waterloo with him at their head will he pointed to by remotest generations with a shudder . We now come to the expiation of his treason by a public execution . The allies , after they assembled in Paris , demanded some victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better counsel prevailed , and they were saved . Ney was a prominent example ; he had routed their armies too frequently and too nearly wrested their crowns from them at Waterloo , to be forgiven . Though no more guilty than marshal Soult , and many others , it was impossible to save him . It was intended at first to try him by martial law , but the marshals of France refused to sit in judgment on so brave , generous , and heroic a warrior . By a royal ordinance , the Chamber of Peers was directed to try him . Scorning to take advantage of any technicalities of law , he was speedily found guilty and condemned to death , by a majority of a hundred and fifty-two . Seventeen only were found to vote in his favor . That he was guilty of treason , in the letter of the charge , . is evident , but not to that extent which demanded his death . No man had done more for France than he , or loved herhonor and glory with a higher affection ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French nation . Justice was the excuse not the ground of his condemnation . To have carried out the principle on which his sentence was based , would have ended in a pub -- lic massacre . Ney and Labedoyere were the only victims offered up to appease an unjust hatred . Wellington should have interfered to save so gallant an enemy at the hazard of his own life ; but honor was forgotten in the public clamor , and the sentence , which might at least have been commuted into banishment , was carried out to the letter . Ney was publicly shot by Frenchmen . His last moments did not disgrace his life . He was called from his bed to hear his sentence read . As the preamble went on enumerating his many titles , he hastily broke in- " why can not you simply call me Michael Ney ,  --  now a French soldier and soon a heap of dust ? " The last interview with his wife and children shook his stern heart more than all the battles he had passed through , or his approaching death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply to one of his sentinels , who said , " larshal , you should - // now think of death , " he replied , " Do you suppose any one should teach me to die ? " But recollecting himself , he added in a milder tone , " Comrade , you are right , send for the Curate of St. Sulpice ; I will die as becomes a Christian ! " The place is still shown in the gardens of the Luxembourg where he was executed . As he alighted from the coach , he advanced towards the file of soldiers drawn up as executioners , with the same calm mien he was wont to exhibit on the field of battle . An officer stepping forward to bandage his eyes , he stopped him with the proud interrogation , " Are you ignorant that for twenty-five years I have been accustomed to face both ball and bullets ? " He then took off his hat , and with his eagle eye , now subdued and solemn , turned towards heaven , said with the same calm and decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I declare before God and man , that 1 have never betrayed my country ; may my death render her happy , vive la France . " ' He then turned to the soldiers , and gazing on them a moment , struck one hand upon his heart and said , " my comrades , fire on me . " Ten balls entered him , and he fell dead . Shame upon his judges that for a single act could condemn one braver and nobler than them all , to so base a deat.h . If France never has a worse traitor , the day of her betrayal will never come , and if she never has a worse defender , disgrace will never visit her armies . Says Colonel Napier , in speaking of his death , " thus he who had fought five hundred battles for France-not one against her-was shot as a traitor . " His father , who loved him tenderly as the son of his pride and the glory of his name , was never told of his ignominious death . He was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a hundred years old . He saw by the mourning weeds on his family that some catastrophe had happened , and his father 's heart told but too well where the bolt had struck ; but he made no inquiries , and though he lived twelve years after , never mentioned his son s name , and was never told of his fate . He knew he was dead , but he asked not how n*r where he died . The great fault in Ney 's character was indolence . Unless his energies were summoned from their repose by some pressing danger lie was inclined to inactivity . Yet this tendency , which has so often been severely censured , is almost necessarily associated with the prodigious power and resolution he possessed . The Lion is not easily roused , and strength is always immobile till there is a call equal to its capacity . The heavy English squares can never be converted into light troops without losing their invincible tenacity . Bonaparte possessed in an extraordinary degree the strange combination of high nervous excitement-constant activity and headlong impetuosity-with unconquerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this he was unlike almost any other man in history . Ney had not this combination , and we would like to have those who criticise his character point to one besides Napoleon that has . He was also plain and direct even to bluntness , and often ofk*nded his friends by the freedom with which he spoke of their errors . He never lost sight of his low origin , and was never ashamed of it . To some young officers boasting of their rank , titles , etc. , he said , " Gentlemen , I was less fortunate than you . I got nothing from my family , and I esteemed myself rich at Metz , when I had two loves of bread on my table . " Simple and austere in his habits , he reminds one of an old Greek or Roman hero . The vacillation of feeling which caused him to commit the great error of his life , adds to our sympathy for him , while it injures the pertection of his character . It led him to be a humane soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the execution of criminals . He was a kind yet fearless commander , an untiring and skilful leader , and a warm-hearted and noble man . We have said nothing of the work from which we have taken some of the minor incidents of his life , for we have never before seen so poor a book made from such excellent materials . Next to Bonaparte , Marshel Ney furnishes the best character for a memoir , of any modern general . His life is full of adventure , and characterized throughout by great actions . Yet his friends , in compiling these Memoirs , have followed no law but chronological order . All his papers and letters , both those written by himself and those received from others , seem to have been arranged according to their dates , and printed in a // volume form . There is no grouping and no unity , and the reader stumbles on amid a mass of ill-arranged matter , wondering how human ingenuity could produce so stupid a book , from such abundant and interesting materials . There is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while with all the heterogeneous mass gathered together , the work is still incomplete . The life of Marshal Ney is yet to be written.
