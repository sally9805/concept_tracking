txt IT is instructive to observe how much is done in the government of the world by the ignorance of men more than by their knowledge . What we do from design is of small amount compared with what we do beyond our forethought . In all our plans we prophesy in part . The action of to-day generates the action of to-morrow . The scheme widens as it advances from purpose towards accomplishment . The one thing intended , brings along with it a host of things not intended ; and as our vision takes a wider compass , consequences and contingencies are seen to multiply . One man creates the void , and another gives it occupancy . One agency unlocks the stream , and a multitude are in waiting to affect its course and issue* Evil comes from good , and good comes from evil . Thus mockery is cast over all human foresight* In this twilight of perception the greatest men have labored-Wycliffe and Luther , Columbus and Bacon . Much that was in their heart they have done , but much more which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they still speak and the*r still act  --  but the further the undulations of their influence extend , the less is the semblance between the things which are realized and the things which were expected . They have done less than they hoped , and more-much that they would have done , and much that they would nc , t have done . In short , in the providence of our world , enough is plain and fixed to give pulsation to virtue and hope in the right-hearted ; but enough is obscure and uncertain to rebuke impatience , and to suggest many a lesson of humility . it was the pleasure of Elizabeth , and of her successors James and Charles , to take upon them the office of the persecutor . In that honorable vocation they found coadjotors , of suitable capacity and temper , in Whitgift , Bancroft and Laud . The sovereign and the priest gave themselves to such employment , in the sagacious expectation that the opinions of men were matters to be shaped according to the royal l ) leasure , with little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy intended to secure an abject submission at home , became the unwilling parent of an enlightened independence abroad . Intolerance of freedom forced it upon new experiments , and proved eminently favorable to its development and power . The seed cast out found a better lodgment , and sent forth a richer fruit . The new world afforded space for its germination and growth which the old could not have supplied ; and the new world has reacted upon the old , in the cause of freedom , as the old could not have acted upon itself . Even now , also , we are only in the beginning of that great outburst of enterprise arid improvement which we trace to those memorable times , and , in great part , to the narrow and selfish policy of the agents above named . The mind of the people of England , two centuries since , teemed with thoughts and excitements , of which the men of our time have no just conception . Our knowledge in this respect must depend on the force of our imagination , hardly less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions , both , in politics an.d religion , which then XLVIII . LiVING AGE . VOL. v. 5 agitated society , were comparative novelties . The wonders of the new world , and of the whole southern hemisphere , were discoveries of yesterday . National questions , accordingly , were debated with a degree of passionateness and earnestness , such as we seldom feel ; while distant regions loomed before the fancies of men in alliance with everything shadowy , strange and mysterious* The old world seemed to be waking at their side , as from the sleep of ages ; and a new world rose to their view , presenting treasures which seemed to be inexhaustible . Th e wonder of to-day was succeeded by the greater wondet of to-morrow , and the revelations seemed to have no end . At the same time , to very many , their native land had become as a house of bondage , and the waters of the Atlantic were the stream which separated between them and their promised home . That feeling is now among the bygone in our social history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discoverable . The broader and deeper stream , now rolling on , leaves its nooks and eddying points , where something of the past still retains a place , and still secures to it some influence over the present . It is now about twice seven years since we passed  --  a few pleasant weeks in one of the less peopled districts of Dorsetshire-that county which Charles II . is said to have described as the only county in England fit to be the home of a gentleman . What the qualities were which , in the estimation of royalty , gave 50 much of the air proper to the home of gentle blood to the county of Dorset , it will not be difficult to conjecture . Dorsetshire is remarkable for the almost total absence of the usual signs of trade and manufactures . It is no less remarkable , as a natural consequence , for the absence of any considerable middle class to separate between the serfs who till the ground , and the lords who own it . Even agriculture is prosecuted within such limits as may consist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good feudal condition of extended sheepwalks and open dewns . Such IDorsetshire has ever been , such it still is ; but , thanks to projected railroads , such we trust it is not always to be . On the occasion adverted to , we were indebted for a season to the hospitahities of an honest yeoman , whose residence had been occupied , in other days , by personages of much higher pretension than our host . It was an ancient mansion on a hill-side , overlooking an extended valley , which , from the corresponding forms of the hills fronting each other , resembled the bed of some departed Ganges , or St. Lawrence . The lower part of the valley was cultivated and wooded , but the high slopes of the hills were treeless and shrubless , except on the spot where the dwelling of our yeoman friend presented itself . That structure , with its somewhat castellated front , with its long ascent of half-decayed steps , its mutilated balustrades , and its ample terrace , rose amid lofty elms and chesnuts , forming a picture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast with the surrounding barrenness . Altogether this Dorset mansion was of a sort to work powerfully on that superstitious feeling and credulity , which are so deeply rooted in the mind of every rural and secluded . population . The sounds which came after nightfall , in the autumnal and winter season , across that valley , from the distant sea , and which passed in such wild and strange notes through the branches of those ancient trees , and through the crazy apertures of that more ancient building , did 73 // not fall upon the ear without some awakening effect upon the imagination . The dead , who once had paced those terrace walks , were not forgotten ; and where could there be a more fitting haunt for those sights which " we , fools of nature , " shrink from , than the spaces covered with the deep shadows of those overhanging trees  --  the living things , which budded and grew in the times of other generations , and which seemed to lift themselves aloft , as in a proud consciousness of being more associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also , there was much to strengthen fancies of this complexion . There were the gloomy stairs , with their dark walls , their long worn steps , and their railwork of massy oak . Apartments , with their antique panellings , their faded tapestry , and their concealed doorways . At night , the birds , who chose their lodgment amidst the ancient masonry of the chimneys , failed not to send their tokens of inquietude into the chambers below , as the gale from the neighboring channel came with tumultuous force upon the land . Part of the building , also , had become a ruin , thickly mantled with ivy , where owls might have pleaded their long holding as a right of tenantry , and from which they sallied forth at such times , as if glad to mingle their screams with the night storm , or to flap their wings against the casement of the sleeper . To one apartment in that interior a special myste*ry attached . ltbore the name of the bookroom . Of that room the master of the house always retained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the contents of the book-room should on no account be disturbed . Among those conitents , beside a curious library , were many other *eurious things-such as a bonnet , said to have been worn by Queen Elizabeth when visiting those western parts of her dominions ; also a fan , which had been wielded by that royal hand ; a whole suit of kingly apparel , reported to have been worn by Charles II. , and to have been left at the mansion by its royal visitor . Above all , a skull was there . It was the skull of a murdered man . The mark of the death wound was visible upon it . Tradition said that the victim of human violence was an African  --  a faithful servant in the family which once found its stately home beneath that venerable roof . Amidst so much pointing to the dim past , we may be sure that the imagination of the dwellers in the old hall on the hill-side was not by any means unproductive . Of course we must not confess to any participation in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dark night , and a rough one too , when we obtained our first admission to the mysterious book-room . By the aid of our lamp , we explored the matters of virtu which it con'tained examined the dreaded cranium , and found the mark of the wound upon it , strictly as reported . But our attention was soon directed from the curiosities to the literature . The contents of the library we found in no very orderly condition , and not a few of its treasures had evidently suffered much from the state of uselessness to which the whole had been for so long a time reduced . The books were partly on shelves and tables , and partly in *heaps upon the floor . Among them were many existing in all the venerableness of the times before the invention of the printing-press . One of these sets proved to be an illuminated vellum transcript of the epistles of Innocent 111.  --  a pontiff who , in common with many of his race , during the middle age , conducted a correspondence , exceeding that of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were there , and many learned volumes which had strayed from their fellows , and which bore upon them the marks of having suffered much in their watiderings . But the point which has brought the old Dorset hall on the hill-side , in this manner to our memory is , that , among the printed works in this long-neglected library , was a number of tracts , and pamphlets , and small publications , relating to the countries of the new world , and to the marvels of recent voyaging . Some of them bore date as far back as the times of Elizabeth , but most of them were of the time of James I. , and a little later . Some hours passed , and we were still beguiled by the perusal and comparison of these remains , which , like some newly-discovered fossil bed , pointed our imagination to a former condition of society , if not to a former world . We felt as though drifted back to those times . We thought we saw good Mr. White , the puritan minister of the neighboring town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the little band , who , more than two centuries since , sought their spiritual as well as their natural home on the shores of New England . We seemed to listen to the talk of such men as the brave John Smith , and the Governor Winthorp ; and to be witnesses to the conferences of such men as the Lords Say and Brooke , Harry Vane , and John 1-Iampden , as they cogitated their schemes of settlement for injured and free-hearted men on the other side the Western Ocean . We remembered Queen Elizabeth , toothe grave men who were honored as her counsellors , her own stately presence , her own pliant but masculine temper , and the skill with which she dispensed the tokens both of her pleasure and of her pride . Her arts of cajolery to-day , her haughty invective to-morrow , her ambition-her innate love of rule at all times , and in all things . Her successor , also , we remembered  --  the king whose flesh gave signs of fear at the sight of a drawn sword . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief over the bravest of nations . The monarch who presumed that he was born a great king , and who supposed that he had made himself a great clerk . The ruler whose soul was below all feeling of enterprise , presiding among a people with whom that feeling was strong , irrepressible , almost boundless . The frivolous imbecile , whose days were spent at the chase or at the cock-pit , and whose nights were given to court gambols , sensuality , and drunkenness ; while around him were minds teeming with principles of the most solemn import , and with feelings of the purest and loftiest aspiration . The king who hated the name of freedom . and who strained his feeble and tremulous nerves to curb the genius of a people determined to be free . The least manly of all the sovereigns of Europe , claiming to be honored as a demi-god by a nation animated with the stern thought , and full-grown feeling of manhood , beyond any other nation in Christendom , and perhaps beyond all the nations of Christendom collectively in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the unnatural , and the source of much inevitable mischief . But this mischief fell with its greatest weight on religion , and on the consciences of devout men . Many of the restless spirits of the time  --  the gallants as they were called-manifested their inquietude beneath this uncongenial control 74 // and no scene of action being open to them , either as soldiers abroad , or as inviting them to do some fine thing at home , they many of them turned their attention to the newly-discovered regions of the earth , and to plans of colonization . But your gallants are not good at colonization . That sort of enterprise demands something more rare than courage , and something more valuable than ordinary worldly sagacity . Social virtue is nowhere tested as in infant settlements . Men who go upon such experiments need rooted principle , no less than stoutness of heart , and a spirit of patient endurance . In England , at the time to which we refer , it was on minds of this better order that the pressure in favor of emigration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a double empire . She claimed dominion over the soul as truly as over the body . By her ecclesiastical supremacy , she took under her jurisdiction , not only the things which belonged to Ciesar , but the things which belonged to God . Her prescriptions on the matter of religion , embraced all that her people should believe , and all that they should do . From her pleasure they were to receive every article of their creed , and every direction , even the minutest , in regard to worship . No pontiff had ever exercised a more rigorous domination in this respect , when seated in the midst of his cardinals , than was exercised by Elizabeth , when presiding in her assembly of ecclesiastical commissioners . The men who should deny the right of the pope to assume such powers might be burned before St. Peter 's . The men who made the same denial in respect to Elizabeth were hanged at Tyburn . The queen , indeed , was head of the church in a more intimate degree than of the state , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one , than her parliaments were found to be in relation to the other . Her power in this department was greater than in any other ; and by her proud Tudor temper it was guarded with proportionate solicitude , arid exercised with proportionate freedom . In her view , to deny her right to rule the conscience of her subjects , was to deny her right to rule at all , and therefore treason , and an offence to be punished as treason . In stating thus much , we are not venturing upon ground open to debate . We merely refer to the unquestionable facts of history-facts deplored , we presume , by the modern churchman as sincerely as by the modern dissenter . The quarrel between Elizabeth and the puritans did not involve any direct impeachment of the ecclesiastical supremacy of the crown . The complaint of the puritan was , not that the queen had presumed to meddle with church affairs , but that she had not exercised her authority in such matters after the puritan fashion . It was deemed just that the sovereign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline and worship ; but the puritan claimed to be the judge as to the doctrine , regimen , or ritual , which should be so regarded . Hence conflict ensued between the royal-conscience and the subject-conscience . Opinions which the crown had ruled as being scriptural , the puritan denounced as erroneous ; and regulations enjoined as seemly and devout by the one , were described as superstitious or profane by the other . In the ecclesiastical history of England , the genius of presbyterianism has never proceeded beyond this point . In Scotland , of late years , it has been otherwise . But in our own earlier history , the adherents of that system , while they claimed exemption in some things from the interference of the civil power , in other , and in greater things , they have clung to the aids of that power with a marked tenacity . The history of English presbyterianism , accordingly , has been too much a struggle for ascendency , and too little a struggle for freedom . But ascendency , not based on right , must not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strongest , and it must be sustained by mere strength , more than by principle , virtue or goodness . Even in the age of Elizabeth , however , there were men who had passed beyond the point adverted to-men who could draw the line , not with an infallible , but certainly with a vigorous hand between the secular and the spiritual-men who maintained that membership in a Christian church should be restricted to persons of Christian character that the ministers of churches so constituted should be Christian men , approved as such by the persons to whom they minister ; and that the worship and discipline of those voluntary assemblies should be determined wholly by themselves , and not at all by the secular power . Ta the reign of Mary , an act of state had set forth the whole people of England as constituting a popish church . On the accession of Elizabeth , an act of state had set forth the same nation as constituting a protestant church . In both cases the people were the same , and the priesthood for the most part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer demurred to this manner of proceeding . The mixed multitude of people so spoken of , no doubt included many enlightened and sincere Christians , but could not , it was alleged , be described in any sober sense as being truly a church . In like manner , the ministry of such a church might include many devout men ; but the validity of a ministry so appointed must rest on moral grounds , and not in any degree on the state sanctions which might favor . - be urged in its These principles , simple and harmless as they may now seem , struck at the root of the ecclesiastical supremacy then clainied by the crown . Elizabeth saw that if such doctrines became prevalent , the one half of her empire , and the half which she especially valued , must pass to other hands . Opinions of this nature , accordingly , were in her view treasonable-treasonable in the worst sense . They embraced that very principle of divided allegiance which had caused Romanism to become so obnoxious . The catholic gave his conscience in religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protestants gave their conscience immediately to God . In either case , the body and the outward only were reserved in allegiance to the throne , the soul and the inward were given to another . In the judgment of Elizabeth , the man holding such a doctrine could be only half a subject , and its natural tendency was to reduce every crowned head to the condition of being only half a sovereign . Robert Brown , a clergymen by education and office , and a kinsman to the great Lord Treasurer Burleigh , distinguished himself , about the middle of the reign of Elizabeth , as the promulgator of such opinions . This divine was a personage of ready , earnest , and impassioned utterance , and in his pulpit exhibitions was eminently popular . Crowds assembled to hear him at Cambridge , and // subsequently at Norwich , where he was beneficed . As a preacher he was well known through great part of England , and with his itinerant and irregular services in that capacity , he connected the publication of his opinions from the press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance . In prosecuting his vocation , he found that bonds and imprisonment commonly awaited him . These he bore through many years with the most dogged obstinacy , if not with the most exemplary patience . It was his boast that he had been committed to more than thirty prisons , in some of which his hand could not be seen at noonday . To escape from this inconvenient usage , and from some more severe treatment with which he was threatened , Brown fled to Middleburgh in Zealand , and instituted a church in that city after his own model . But the pastor soon found occasion of disagreement with his new charge , and returning to England , he submitted to the authorities to which he had been so much opposed , and again became a beneficed clergyman . Brown lived to an extreme old age , but the last forty years of his life were the years of a sorry worldling , and his death is said to have been brought on by one of those fits of passion and self-will to which he was liable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of a class  --  a zealot in religion , without being religious . His hatred of some real or supposed Christian abuses , was presumed to be evidence of his own Christian character ; but while doing so much to mend the religion of other men , it was ere long to be manifest that he had no religion of his own . Passionate opposition to error is not the surest way to truth . Piety is self-government in its highest form . It is the Christian temper which must regenerate Christian institutions . It was natural that the men who embraced the principles once avowed by this apostate should be solicitous not to be called by his name . But their enemies were no less solicitous to fasten that reproach upon them . To call them Brownists , was to identify them with the extravagant , the fickle , and the base in the career of Robert Brown . What theologian , or what philosopher even , could be expected to forego so felicitous an occasion of using a nickname . The principles of the said Brown were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But how much was to be gained by not seeming to perceive that distinction The learned and the vulgar-philosophy and Billingsgate-are found , on such occasions , to possess much more in common than is commonly supposed . But whatever may have been the case with their persecutors , the conscientious men holding the principles which Brown had abandoned , were philosophers enough not to allow themselves to be scared from great truths by the accident of an infelicitous association . They held their secret assemblies . They possessed a private printingpress , and issued tracts and treatises , sometimes grave and sometimes satirical , impugning the order of things in the established church , and inculeatincr their own avidely different views on such subjects . In some of these pieces the language employed was not always the softest which might have been chosen . But men perishing under the weight of hard blows , may be excused if they sometimes use hard words . Proclamations were issued to suppress these irregular proceedings , and many of the alleged delinquents were made to feel that these intimations of the royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers , named John Copping and Elias Thacker , were imprisoned in Bury St. Edmund 's , on the charge of dispersing books opposed to the ecclesiastical supremacy of the crown , and acknowledging the authority of the queen in civil matters only . Within our own memory , confinement in a jail , especially in some provincial districts , has been connected with enough of the loathsome and the horrible . But of the miseries of such a durance in the age of Elizabeth , we have little conception , except as suggested by some of those painful descriptions which have reached us from the cells of such sufferers . Copping and Thacker might have obtained their liberty on renouncing their errors , and promising conformity . During five long winters their wants and wretchedness were made to plead on the side of submission , but though examined once and again , they wavered not . At length they were apprised that their life would be the cost of their further contumacy . On the 4th of June , 1583 , Thacker was led to the place of execution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned in his presence , and the injured man gave noble proof that his religious principles were stronger than his fear of death . Two days afterwards , Copping was conducted to the same spot , and having witnessed the same proceedings , died with the same martyr firmness . It is sonething to meet death as the soldier meets it , when multitudes share in the common peril ; it is more to submit to it in the comparative solitariness of martyrdom , when nothing can come from man except the influence of distant sympathy or admniration ; but these sufferers bade adieu to earth amidst circumstances which left them no sustaining power , beside their simple hope of heaven . The scattered and bleeding remnant who would honor their memory , were a people despised as much as they were wronged . The heart is formed to crave a sympathetic power from other hearts , and can be strong without it only as strength shall come to it from a much higher source . Man becomes superior to the terrors of this world , in such circumstances , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The houses of persons suspected of embracing the opinions professed by these men were often rigorously searched . The officers employed on those occasions frequently ill-treated even the women and the children of such families , and , under various pretences , often added the spoiling of their goods to insult and oppression . In 1592 , fifty-six men of this sect were apprehended while holding a secret assembly for religious worship in a large room in the parish of Islington . The place of meeting was that in which the persecuted protestants had often worshipped during the reign of Queen Mary . These persons were committed to the dungeon in Newgate , the Fleet , Bridewell , and other prisons in the metropolis . One of their number states that their persecutors " would allow them neither meat , drink , fire nor lodging , nor suffer any , whose hearts the Lord would stir up for their relief , to have any access to them ; purposing , belike , to imprison them to death , as they have done seventeen or eighteen others , in the same noisome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these men were needy persons , with fami 76 // qwq // I am to leave behind me , or any other outward thing , should enforce me , by the denial of God 's truth , contrary to my conscience , to sell my own soul .

A mean and base outward state , according to my mean condition , I was content with .

Subscribed with the heart and the hand which never devised or wrote anything to the discredit or defamation of my sovereign Queen Elizabeth , I take it on my death as I hope to have a life after this . By me , John Penry . " Penry wrote in terms equally noble-hearted and devout to the brethren of the fugitive church adhering to his principles , and still existing in London . On the eighth day after his trial , a warrant was issued for his execution ; and on that same day , preparations were made for giving it effect . He was taken in a cart from the Queen 's Bench prison , Southwark , to St. Thomas Waterings , the place where the gallows then stood . All had been done with indecent haste . No crowd had assembled to stimulate him to manhood by their presence , or to greet him with their sympathies . No friend stood near to drop one word of counsel or encouragement . He had his place alone . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man-could he look . The life in his veins flowed in its full vigor , for he was still in the thirty-fourth year of his age . But the power to which he was subject had no pity ; the rope was placed about his neck ; the signal was given , and for a cause which scarcely merited punishment at all , he hung there until dead  --  the scholar , and the man of piety , consigned to the same doom with the murderer . But the good people of England , and especially of the metropolis , had their musings and speeches about these proceedings . The men so dealt with were known to be sound protestants-men of piety , loyalty , and learning ; and concerning the government , the prelates , and , above all , concerning Whitgift , the Archbishop of Canterbury , and the great patron of these measures , much was said , which conveyed a meaning that could not have been welcome in those quarters . From this time the punishment of such alleged offences by hanging was deemed inexpedient . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of imprisonment or banishment . The instincts of humanity have often risen up in this form , as a monitory and controlling power , which even the strongest despotism has not reckoned it prudent wholly to disregard . The most successful tyrants have been thus made to learn that there is a point beyond which outraged humanity must not be expected to be silent or submissive . But imprisonment in those times , from its duration and its miseries , was hardly less terrible , to those who really knew what it meant , than capital punishment ; and the long-harassed people to whom we refer began to think very generally of voluntary exile as their wisest expedient . Even this course , however , was beset with difficulty . They could escape only by secret means ; to be detected was to fall into the snare they were so much concerned to avoid . But the thought of the religious freedom which might be enjoyed in Holland was so welcome , that for that object numbers became willing to bear the pains of separation from their native land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Many made that attempt with success , but some were less fortunate . An instance of the latter kind is recorded in the history of Robinson , a clergyman , who had embraced the principles of the Brownists , but who so far modified those principles on some points as to bring them more into the form of modern congregationalism , and who , on that account , is generally regarded as the father of the English Independents . Robinson , and a large company , contracted with the master of a ship for a passage to Holland . They were to embark at Boston , in Lincolushire , on a certain day , and from a point agreed upon . The captain was not punctual . At length , however , the vessel arrived and , under cover of the night , the melt , and women , and children , all reached the ship in safety . But the captain was a villain . He betrayed them to the officers of the port . The passengers and their goods were immediately removed from the vessel to several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was turned over and examined , and not a little of it rifled . The persons of the men were searched " even to their shirts , " and the women were treated with indelicacy and rudeness . When these unhappy people reached the town , crowds assembled to gaze upon them , and many mocked and derided them . Nor was their condition improved when brought before the magistrates . Several were bound over to the assizes , and all were committed to prison . Some were released after the confinement of a few weeks , others after a longer period . This happened in 1602 . In the following spring , Robinson and his friends resolved on making a second attempt of this nature . They made an arrangement for this purpose with a Dutch captain ; and their plan now was , that the men should assemble on a large common , between Grimsby and Hull , a place chosen on account of its remoteness from any town ; while the women , the children , and the property of these parties , were to be conveyed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men made their way to the place of rendezvous , in small companies , by land . But the barque reached its destination a day before the ship . The swell of the sea was considerable , and as the females were suffering greatly from that cause , the sailors ran the barque into the shelter of a small creek . The next morning the ship arrived , but through some negligence on the part of the seamen , the vessel containing the women , their little ones , and the property , had run aground . The men stood in groups on the shore , and that no time might be lost , the captain of the ship sent his boat to convey some of them on board . But by this time , so considerable a gathering of people in such a place , and in a manner so unusual , had attracted attention ; information had been conveyed to persons of authority in the neighborhood ; and as the boat which had taken the greater part of the men to the ship was proceeding again towards the shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swords and muskets , and con-78 // sisting of horse and foot , advancing towards the point where the barque was still ashore , and where the few remaining men had grouped together . Fearing the consequences of his illicit compact , the captain returned to the ship , hoisted sail , and was speedily at sea . Robinson-honest and able general as he was in every sense-had resolved to be the last to embark . He was a witness , accordingly , of the scene of distress and agony which ensued . The outburst of grief was not to be restrained . Some of the women wept aloud , others felt too deeply , or were too much bewildered , to indulge in utterance of any kind ; while the children , partly from seeing what had happened , and partly from a vague impression that something dreadful had come , mingled their sobs and cries in the general lamentation . As the sail of that ship faded away upon the distant waters , the wives felt as if one stroke had reduced them all to widowhood , and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one who in a moment had become fatherless . But thus dark are the chapters in human affairs in which the good have often to become students , and from which they have commonly had to learn their special lessons . The ship soon encountered foul weather , and after being driven far along the coast of Nor*vay , all hope of saving her being at one time abandoned , she at length safely reached Holland . In the mean while , persecution at home was found to have become a more tedious and odious affair than formerly , and it so happened , in consequence , that by the year 1608 , Robinson and the remainder of his company succeeded in leaving their native country , and in obtaining a quiet settlement in Leyden . In that city the church under the care of Robin50fl increased until it numbered more than three hundred members , consisting almost wholly of English exiles Robinson himself was greatly respected by the clergy ( if Leyden , and by the professors in the university , and on more than one occasion the pastor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his piety , his amiableness , and his eminently practical understanding , were allied with sound scholarship , and with much intellectual vigor and acuteness . , He succeeded , also , in communicating much of his own well-regulated temper to his charge . We have good reason to believe that no church in Europe in that age exhibited more of the wise simplicity of a primitive church , or more of that correctness of habit by which we suppose the primitive churches to have been distinguished . But there are affinities between certain seeds and certain soils , and where these are wanting , the husbandman may labor never so wisely , arid still reap only a small return . It is with the mental in this respect as with the physical . This fact is illustrated in the history of Independency in Holland . In the hands of Robinson that system was exhibited with every advantage , but the Hollanders were not to be attracted by it . On the contrary , the intermarriages between the exiles and the Dutch , the necessity laid upon many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other causes , tended to diminish the number of the Independents , so that , after the lapse of ten years , it began to be apprehended that if some new course were not taken , the principles of the settlers , so far , at least , as Holland was concerned , were iikely to become extinct ; and , which was more painful still , there was as little prospect as ever of those principles finding any friendly shelter in England . It was this state of things which suggested the expediency of attempting a settlement in the New World . Persecution in England , and apathy in Holland , seemed to point to that course . Nor were the feelings of loyalty without their influence in this matter . Even in the land of the stranger , this much-injured people never failed to evince some pride in speaking of King James as their " natural prince ; " and they manifestly shrunk from the thought of seeing their children cease to be subjects of the British crown . England was still their mother-land ; its institutions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all their ill treatment , to no spot on earth did the generous nature of these exiles turn with so much force of affection . Their fear , they say , was , " that their posterity would in a few generations become Dutch , and so lose their interest in the English nation ; " while their own desire rather was , " to enlarge his majesty 's dominions , and to live under their natural prince . " Moreover , " a great hope and inward zeal they had of laying some good foundation , or , at least , to make some way thereunto for the propagating and advancement of the gospel of the kingdom of Christ in those remote parts of the world-yea , although they should be but as stepping-stones unto others for the performance of so great a work . " These reasons in favor of such an enterprise were first debated in private . The more they were weighed , the more did obedience to them appear to be a duty . At length they were propounded in public . Solemn days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be known . Some of those days were given to private meditation and prayer . On others , the heavenly guidance was sought by conjoint supplications in the house of God . In the end it was agreed- " that part of the church should go before their brethren into America , to prepare for the rest . And if in case the major part of the church should choose to go over with the first , then the pastor should go along with them ; but if the major part stayed , that he should then stay with them . " Our own age is not likely to appreciate the spirit which prompted to this movement in the age of which we are writing . Our philosophy , in connexions of this sort , vain as we sometimes are of it , is , for the most part , a very superficial affair . Our greatest pretenders to sagacity in this shape , judge too much of other times by their own , and of other men by themselves . The theology of the Congregationalists in Leyden was that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to church polity and religious worship were peculiar to themselves . These principles , moreover , were not adopted as so many points of the expedient or the seemly , but were regarded as taught in the Scriptures , and . as taught there no less certainly than the doctrines of their theology . In their judgment , the hand from which they had re-* ceived the one had given them the other . The polity had come with the theology , because the former was in its nature the best adapted to secure the ends of the latter . Ages of darkness had obscured both , but the time had come in which the influence of the spirit of the Reformation should be extended equally to both . Care about the one was as truly a religious duty as care about the other . Churches constituted as those maxims required , were churches which must cease to be 79 // of the world , and must stand forth as the manifest work of God . In them , the power of the worldly , which had done so much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . In their instance , the religious must be fully emancipated from the control of the secular ; and the church , possessed of her proper freedom , be prepared to enter on the discharge of her proper mission . Every such church is an enfranchised body , vested with the full power of self-government . It is the government of the religious in the church , adumbrating the just government of the virtuous and the state . It exhibits man religiously as man should be socially . It exacts a moral fitness , preparatory to the conferring of this franchise , and it confers the franchise wherever that fitness is realized . It is a polity devised by Infinite Wisdom to conserve religious truth and religious order ; and it contains many suggestive lessons , which , if wisely applied , might suffice to regenerate the condition of the world . Among the means of human improvement , accordingly , these principles are entitled to the highest place . Men have done well in having done so much to rescue from threatened oblivion the remains of ancient literature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried amidst the ruins of the middle age , there were treasures of much greater worth . The precious things of the scholar or the virtuoso were so many fragments recovered from the past genius of man , but these elements of spiritual government were so much wisdom recovered from the lost revelation of God  --  the former might contribute to embellish the present , the latter possessed a power to embellish and ennoble the present and the future . Robinson and his coadjutors may not have been accustomed to express themselves in these precise terms , but the thoughts which these terms convey were all familiar to them ; and it was with views thus devout and expanded , that they contemplated their removal to the distant regions of the west . Seed so precious was not to be lost , and how best to conserve it until its wider diffusion should place its extinction beyond all danger , was their great solicitude . It is manifest , from their subsequent history , that in some respects they still needed , further light concerning the province of the magistrate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had fairly proceeded . It may be said , indeed , that all this was so much delusion ; the notions so valued are not taught in the New Testament , nor can they he shown to be pregnant with any such marvellous tendencies as are thus ascribed to them . Our answer is , that we are not concerned just now with the question of the truth or falsehood of these opinions , nor with their real or supposed tendencies . We look to these principles simply as having been entertained ; and as having been thus viewed ; and in this matter of fact alone , we find enough to impart to the conduct of the pilgrim fathers the strictest consistency , and , withal , a dignity  --  a high moral heroism , which has not been surpassed , and which can hardly be said to have been equalled , in the history of ancient or modern nations . Until 1614 , the whole extent of country from Florida to Canada bore the name of North and South Virginia . From that year the northern division began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James had chartered two companies of merchants , the one in London and the other in Plymouth , empowering them to make and regu late settlements along that extended coast , and to the distance of a hundred miles inland . The Plymouth company had made little use of their patent , until occasion was afforded them of doing so by the project of the congregation at Leyden . So many of those persons as had resolved to become colonists sold their property and threw the proceeds into a common stock , and their first expenditure from that fund was in the purchase of a small vessel of sixty tons , which bore the name of the Speedwell . In that vessel several of the brethren , who were deputed to make some requisite negotiations in England , performed their voyage and returned . But the Mayflower , a ship of one hundred and eighty tons , was hired in London , to sail in company with the Speedwell . The former vessel was secured for the voyage only , the latter , the colonists meant to retain for the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the brethren of the deputation proceeded inland to Leyden , and reported faithfully to the congregation the result of their embassy . They had obtained a document which secured to them liberty of worship , and had made the best terms they could , in other respects , with the company of merchant adventurers at Plymouth . And now came the season for separation . He was a bold man who was the first to commit himself to a passage across that world of waters which has been since found to separate between the shores of Europe and Africa , and those of the great western continent . We have sometimes thought , that of all the tests which have been applied to the courage and firmness of the human spirit , that must have been the greatest . Nor was it soon that the dangers and hardships of such a voyage began to be thought inconsiderable . Pirates , and the ships of hostile nations , generally infested those seas . The vessels of those times , also , were few of them of a structure adapted to brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy of ships , if we may so speak , down to a comparatively recent period , left those who made long voyages subject to inconvenience , want , and disease , in a degree happily little known to us . It was from these causes that so long an interval passed after the discovery of North America , and so little was done towards establishing any important relation between that continent and Great Britain . We can excuse the pious men and women of the congregation at Leyden , if when they looked ' forward to such a voyage , and to the possible beyond it , they had their moments in which the prospect awakened in them something like dismay . But with them , prayer had always been the antagonist of fear . To look to their God in the time of trouble was to become strong . On this memorable occasion , accordingly , they gave themselves to religious exercises of special solemnity . A day of humiliation was appointed . On that day their pastor addressed them from the language of the prophet Ezra- " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we might afflict our souls before God , to seek of him a right way for us and for our little ones , and for all our substance . " Many suitable counsels were given to them , of the nature of which some judgment may be formed from the following passage " Brethren , " said Robinson , " we are now quickly to part from one another , and whether I may ever live to see your face on earth any more , the God of heaven only kmws ; but whether the Lord has appointed that or no , I charge you , before 80 // qwq // purpose of the colonists in that respect . This he did by entangling the ship amidst shoals and breakers , instead of putting out to sea , and foul weather coming on in the early part of the second day , they were driven back to the Cape . It was now the middle of November . The shelter offered at the Cape was inviting . The captain became impatient to dispose of his company and return . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his men to the hazard of wanting provisions . Unless they meant , therefore , that he should at once set them and their goods on shore and leave them to their course , it would behove them to adopt their own measures and to act upon them without delay They knew that the documents they had brougot with them from England gave them no authority to attempt a settlement on the land now before them . But the plea of necessity was upon them , and was more than enough to justify them in selecting a home wherever it might be found . The voyage had reduced most of them to a weak and sickly condition . The wild country , as the ' gazed upon it from their ship , was seen to be covered with thickets and dense woods , and already wore the aspect of winter . No medical aid awaited them on that shore , no friendly greetings , but hardship and danger in every form . They felt that their safety , and such poor comfort as might be left to them , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . Hence , before they left the Mayflower , they constituted themselves as subjects of " their dread sovereign lord King James , " into a body politic , and bound themselves to such obedience in all things as the majority should impose . The men all signed the instrument drawn up for this purpose , but they did not exceed forty-one in number , themselves and their families numbering one hundred and one . Mr. John Carver was chosen as their governor for one year , and the first act of the new chief was to place himself at the head of sixteen armed men for the purpose of ezploring the country . When they had extended their inspections to somewhat more than a mile from the coast , they discovere ( l five Indians , whom they followed several miles forther , in the hope of bringing them to some friendly communication , but without success . Directing their steps again towards the shore , they came to a cleared space , where some families of Indians had been not long since resident . But no spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their number saw a young tree bent down to the earth , apparently by artificial means , and being curious to know what this thing meant , the white man ventured near , when on a sudden the tree sprung up , and in a moment our good pilgrim was seen suspended by the heel in the air . He had been caught in an Indian deertrap , and we can suppose that even so grave a company would be somewhat amused at such an incident , especially when they had fully eztricated their incautious brother without further mischief . The Bay of Cape Cod is formed by a tongue of land , which juts out from the continent for thirty miles directly eastward into the sea ; it then curves to the north , and stretches as a still narrower strip in that direction to about the same extent . The bay itself , accordingly , is somewhere about thirty miles across either way , being bounded by the main land on the west , by a curved tongue of land on the south and east , and being open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north . The second THE PILGRtM FATHERS . exploring expedition from the Mayflower was made with a boat , under the direction of the master , and consisted of thirty men . They sailed several leagues along the coast without discovering any inlet which could serve the purpose of a harbor . In running up a small creek , sufficient to receive boats , but too shallow for shipping , they saw two huts , formed with stakes and covered with mats , which , on their approach , were hastily deserted by the natives who inhabited them . Some of the company would have attempted a settlement at that point , the ground being already cleared , and the place being such as promised to be healthy , while it admitted of being put into a posture of defence . The setting in of winter , of which the colonists were made more sensible every day , manifestly prompted this counsel . But others advised that an excursion should be made twenty leagues northward , where it was certain they might secure good harbors and fishing stations . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which should go round the shores of the whole bay , was resolved upon . The chief of the colonists were of this company ; Carver , Bradford , Winslow and Standish-all afterwards men of renown-were of the number , with eight or ten seamen . It was the sixth of December , when they descended from the deck of the Mayflower to the boat . So extreme was the cold , that the spray of the sea as it fell on them became ice , and was shaken in heavy fragments from their apparel , which at times was so overlaid as to give them the appearance of men clad in mail . The landscape , as they coasted along , presented little to attract them . Its forests were black and leafless , and its open spaces were covered with snow more than half a foot deep . As they looked round on that scene , they had to remember that they were five hundred miles from the nearest English settlement , and that Port Royal , the nearest French colony , was at a still greater distance In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayed that their landing might not be in winter  --  but such was their lot . That day they reached the spot now known by the name of Billingsgate Point , at the bottom of the bay . Landing in the evening , they passed the night on shore without disturbance . In the morning , they divided their company , and directing their course westward , some coasted along in the boat , and others explored the land , crossing its snow-covered hills , and threading its dells and forests with no little difficulty . But this second day was as barren of discovery as the preceding . In the evening , they ran the boat into a creek , and constructing a barricade of trees and logs , they all slept on shore . They rose at five in the morning , and continued in their prayers till daybreak , when suddenly loud and strange cries were heard , and a shower of arrows was poured in upon them . The Indians had attacked them . They seized their arms , but had not more than four muskets with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The assailants did not disperse on the first fire . One of them , with great courage and dexterity , took his position behind a tree , withstood three volleys , and discharged three arrows in return . But the object of the enemy was to scare rather than to conquer ; and when they had retired , the pilgrims again bowed themselves in prayer and thanksgiving before God . They now committed themselves to their third day of search . // Nearly fifty miles of coast they inspected , but the long-sought good  --  a convenient harbor-was still undiscovered . The pilot , however , had visited those regions before , and assured them , that if they would trust themselves to his guidance , they would reach a good haven before night . But the elements did not seem to favor this prediction . The heavens become dark . Heavy rain and snow begin to fall ; the wind becomes boisterous ; the sea swells ; and in the tossings which follow , the rudder is broken , and the boat must now be steered by oars . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the land ; but all is gloomy , pitiless , and menacing . The storm increases ; it is perilous to bear much sail , but all that can be horee must be spread , or it will be in vain to dream of reaching the expected shelter before night . A sudden wave throws the boat upon the wind ; in a moment , her mast is rifted into three pieces-mast , sail and tackling are cut away with the utmost speed , and are seen floating on the distant waves . The tide , however , is favorable , but the pilot , in dismay , would now run the boat on shore in a cove full of breakers . The moment is as the hinge ' of life to all on board . A stouthearted seaman exclaims- " If you are men , about with her , or we are gone ! " The words are electric ; the prow of the boat is again turned to the elements ; they make their way through the surf ; and within an hour , they enter a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small rise of land . It is now dark ; the rain beats furiously ; that dimly-seen shore is the home , probably , of savage men ; to descend upon it and to kindle a fire must be perilous-may be fatal . But the men are so xvet , so cold , so exhausted ! They resolve to land . With difficulty the newlygathered wood is made to send forth its welcome glow ; and then they make such provision as they may for the night . As the day began to dawn , they found the place on which they had landed to be a small island within the entrance of a harbor . This day was Saturday , and many of their company were so weak and sickly , that the greater part of it was given to rest , and to such preparations as were necessary for exploring the country . But the next day , being the Sabbath , could not be so employed . The pilgrims felt the advancing season , knew the haste of the captain and crew to return , and remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had now been absent three days ; but nothing could induce them to overlook the claims of the Christian 's day of rest . On the morning of Monday , the 11th of December , old style , these fathers landed at a point , to which they gave the name of New Plymouth , in grateful memory of the hospitality shown there in the last English port from which they sailed . On that spot they resolved to fix their settlement . The anniversary of their lauding still calls forth the gratitude and reverence of their posterity , and the rock on which they first planted their foot , may be seen , within an appropriate inclosure , in front of a building of the modern town , which bears the name of the Pilgrims ' Hall . In a few days , the Mayflower entered the harbor of New Plymouth . But the shore was such , that in landing their goods , it was necessary the men should wade considerably in water , which added greatly to the subsequent sickness among them . On the 19th , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building a storehouse , in raising small dwelling-houses , and in disposing of the adjacent ground . In respect to religion , everything had been determined before their embarkation , and in respect to civil affairs , they had already adopted their polity . Popular government , in its fullest extent , was the element both of the civil and of the ecclesiastical constitution , which thee ' had before approved , and which they now confirmed . Their state polity , indeed , was the pure and natural result of circumstances ; but their religious polity , as that of an independent or congregational church , they ascribed to a higher source-the authority of Holy Scripture . Had New England been colonized at an earlier period in our history , or had its first successful settlement originated in almost any other manner than that we have described , everything in its social condition would have derived a strong impression from the older institutions of the mother country . But now , all was free , and the great advantage of beginning well was secured , But , intent as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor in that respect proceeded slowly . The season of the year left them only short days , and often on those days only brief intervals , between the storms of sleet , and snow , that could be so employed . Nearly all were suffering from fevers , an d* coughs , and general sickness , brought on by long exposure to unwonted hardships . As the cold increased , disease strengthened , and deaths became frequent . The comparatively healthy were little able to bestow the required attention on the sick , and every funeral was as if the dying had been called to the burying of the dead . At one season , there were not more than seven persons capable of performing such offices . Amongst those who were the earliest cut off , was a son of Carver , the governor . His own sickness and death soon followed ; and then his affectionate wife sunk broken-hearted to the grave . Carver was a man of a noble and generous nature . He had sold considerable estates , and had assigned the whole value to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no man descended more readily to the humblest service in behalf of the meanest . The mourning colonists buried him with such military honors as they could command , discharging several volleys of musketry over his grave . William Bradford , the subsequent historian of the colony , was chosen his successor . But in the course of this melancholy winter , of the hundred and one settlers , fifty were removed by death ! In March , the cold abated , the wind came from the south , and " the birds sung pleasantly in the woods . " The Mayflower now left the harbor , and returned to England . But after so many had fallen victims to exposure and climate , the remainder were in danger of perishing from want . In the autumn new emigrants arrived . They came without provision . The pilgrim families could not see them die of hunger , and during six months they all subsisted on half allowance only . " I have seen men stagger , " says Winslow , " by reason of faintness for want of food . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that famine should destroy them . They were saved by the compassion of fishermen whom foul weather had driven to their coast . Nor did these things soon end . Even in the third year of their settlement , their provisions were so far spent , that , in their own language , " they knew not at night where to find a bit in the morning . " It is said , that in the spring of 1623 , they were reduced to the last pint 83 // of corn . That precious pittance , we are told , was parched , and distributed equally among them , and yielded them five grains apiece . In the summer of that year , they had no corn whatever , during a space of three or four months . When some of their old friends from Leyden arrived to join them , a piece of fish , with a cup of spring-water , but without bread , was the best supply to which they could bid them welcome . Yet their heart drooped not . The God who had tried them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such has become their history . One cause of this protracted suffering was the common property system , on which the settlement had been founded . Even in a colony of pilgrims , such a merging of the individual in the general interest was found to be too large a demand on the self-denial of human nature . Religion and philosophy may dream of communities as prospering on such a basis , but it will be all a dream . Amidst the extreme privations of the spring of 1623 , it was resolved that this policy should be abandoned . Each family was in future to possess its own piece of land , and to reap the fruit of its own toil . Contentment and general activity were the result . Even women and children went into the work of the field , and before many more springs had passed , the corn raised in the neighborhood of New Plymouth became an important article of traffic . Happily , the danger of the colonists from the Indians in those early days was not considerable . Had they proceeded , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribes in possession of those parts were so powerful as to leave little room to doubt that the fate of so feeble a company would have been to perish by the weapons of the natives . But in the neighborhood of Ne*v Plymouth , the tribe which had for some time peopled that district had been of late almost wholly swept away by the ravages of the small-pox-an apt illustration of that freedom from disease which some romantic speculators on the history of society are disposed to reckon among the many felicities of savage life . is it not strange that these sentimental votaries of primitive barbarism are never seen making any attempt towards returning to the state to which they do such worship ? They load our civilization with every sort of abuse , and still they cling to it-cling to it , in all its forms , with a tenacity inferior only to that with which they cling to life .

On that day , an Indian , who had learned a little English from some English fishermen , entered the town ; his bow arid arrows vere in his hand , but his manner , while erect and selfpossessed , was peaceful . He exclaimed , and repeated the exclamation- " Welcome , English ! " The name of this man was Samoset ; the country of this tribe extended to about five days ' journey distant . The settlers showed their best hospitality to the visitor , and obtained from him information concerning the nature of the country , and the number and condition of its inhabitants . Some days afterwards , Samoset revisited the colony , bringing along with him several of his countrymen . The chief of this company wore a wildcatskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the rest were partially clothed in deer-skins , but Samoset was naked , with the exception of a garment of leather worn about his waist . Their hair was short in front , but hung at great length down their backs . They are described as being tall , well-formed men , of a gipsy color in complexion . The colonists feasted their visitors , and their visitors in return amused them with some Indian dances ; and , on taking their leave , promised to bring Massasoiet , their king , to pay his respects to his new neighbors , very soon . On the 22d of March , Massasoiet , with his brother , and about sixty of his people , came to New Plymouth . They came without arms . Captain Standish received them at the head of a file of musketeers , and then conducted the king to the seat of state provided for him , which consisted of three or four cushions piled upon a green rug . The person of Massasoiet was tall and well proportioned , his countenance was grave and thoughtful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which distinguished him from his attendants was a chain of fish-bones , which he wore about his neck . His face was painted of a red color , and on this state occasion both his face and his head were washed over with oil . The governor entered the apartment , preceded by persons who marched to the sound of the drum and trumpet . Massasoiet rose and kissed his excellency , and governor and king then sat down together . The result of this interview was a treaty of amity between the colonists and the natives , Massasoiet ceding to the pilgrims the possession of the spot on which they dwelt and much of the adjoining territory , and becoming himself a subject of their " sovereign lord King James . " These negotiations were much facilitated by the services of an Indian named Squanto . Squanto had been taken captive by the Spaniards , but making his escape to England , and having been kindly treated by the English master in whose hands he had fallen , this rude son of the wilderness manifested his gratitude in his disposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as interpreter between Massasuiet and the governor , in their conference ; and when the king returned , the interpreter remained with the new-corners , and rendered them , in many respects , important service . In the following July , an embassy was sent by the settlers to the residence of Massasoiet , and Squanto was again called to the office of initerpreter . In the country through which this enibassy passed they saw many corn-fields and considerable pasture land , but the late pestilence appeared to have left every place without inhabitants . The subjects of Massasoiet , who came to meet the ambassadors , showed the friends of their monarch no little kindness-supplying them with the best provisions , bearing their persons on their shoulders across the rivers , and carrying their luggage many miles under the scorching heat of a midsummer sun . When introduced to the king , the Englishmen presented his majesty with a red cotton coat , trimmed with lace , which the monarch received with manifest tokens of pleasure , and in return carried out his utmost notions of courtesy in his conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qwq // founding a new empire in the New World-an empire not only additional to all that had gone before , but different in its spirit , its institutions , and its religion , from all that had hitherto obtained a place in history . While many of the exiled independents removed from Holland to New England , many remained in the former country , in hope that the posture of affairs at home might become such as to allow of their return . It was pleasant to think that their ashes might still be laid in the land of their fathers , and that something might still be done by them towards the enlightenment , the freedom , and the happiness of their native country . These hopes were not indulged in vain . In 1642 , just about two centuries since , the change came which had been so devoutly , wished , and from that time Independency has never ceased to be one of the forms of Christianity professed in this country . But what has been its history ? - what is its present condition l During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thesagacity and energy allied with that system were not altogether unworthy of it  --  but what has it done since We admit that almost everything around it has been uncongenial . Its greatest foes , however , have been from within . It has too often fainted in the face of rebuke-it has not always folded its vesture about it , and fronted the storm as it should have done-it has been wanting , too , we think , in some graver matters . Indeed , in all the points in which the Pilgrim Fathers were strong , modern independency has shown itself weak . Nothing is more marked in the character of the devout men who found their home at New Plymouth , than the clearness with which they apprehended their distinctive principles , and the importance which they attached to them . It was that they might save those principles from again falling into oblivion that they had become exiles , and that , having become exiles , they still conimitted themselves to the perils , and hardships , and griefs , of becoming colonists-colonists in one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men who hold principle with a grasp of this order , always hold it to some purpose . The truth thus embraced , is truth that may not die . Then there were the children of these people . The good most valued by the parents , it was natural they should be most concerned to bequeath to their offspring . Every father in the memorable forty-one who embarked in the Mayflower was as the father of Hannibal* : **the war against error being committed as a legacy to his children . It was the fact , that some of these were seen falling from their steadfastness by reason of their connexion with strangers , and the hope that such danger would be effectually precluded by such renioval , that prompted the heads of the pilgrim families to their memorable expedition westward . Butthese plain , thonghtfnl men looked not to their immediate children only ; they looked to a distant posterity , to the future church of God  --  the future generations of mankind . There was magnanimity in them , largeness of thought and largeness of feeling . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much mere sentimentalitynot a selfish vanity taking the guise of better affection . Their conduct towards the settlers of New Weyrnouth is evidence that they were men superior to littleness of soul-men of exalted and generous sentiments . They lived not to themselves . It was their study that their path might be that of benefactors to the living and to the unborn . But strong as was the attachment of these confessors to that order in church government and worship which they were so careful to observe , all principle of that nature was viewed as subordinate to piety , and was valued in proportion to its supposed conduciveness to piety . What feeling inferior to that of a most conscientious homage to the Invisible , could have led these people to expose themselves to so much suffering , or could have sustained them under the pressure of that suffering ? in all their ways they sought a higher guidance than that of mortals . The day of fasting and prayer went before every step of moment in their history . Their first act on touching the soil of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their spiritual priesthood before God ; and when exploring the winter shores of that region , you see them employed hours before day in presenting thanksgiving and supplication to their Maker . They believed in God ; they were assured of his presence ; they confided in him with the fear and the affection of children . The elements were of him-men were of himand could do no more than his bidding . They loved their polity because it aided their piety . In their case it was not a barren framework , thrust into the place of piety . It was valued because it gave them a real Christian fellowship , and because in so doing it strengthened their Christianity . Hence it happened , that the strength of their adhesion to their principles as congregationalists , was not more remarkable , than the catholicity of their spirit towards devout men of all other communions . " Their resideiice in Holland , " it is said , " had made them acquainted with various forms of Christianity ; a wide experience had emancipated them from bigotry , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Such is the testimony of Bancroft , whose work on this interesting department of modern history is the most authentic and able in our language . But this result , so little to have been expected in those times , may be traced to the personal character of Robinson , fully as much as to residence in Holland . In respect to certain great principles , that excellent man concluded that he had arrived at certainty ; but in many things , as we have seen from his own language , he supposed that both himself and others were still in need of further light . Independency in his hands was fixed in regard to its great principles , but was left to a candid latitude in respect to lesser things . Hence , Mr. Edward Winslow , some time governor of New Plymouth , speaks of the rule of this first proper congregational church in respect to communion in the following terms : - " It is true we profess and desire to practise a separation from the world and the works of it , and are willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we admit to church fellowship . But we do not renounce all other churches ; nay , if any joining to us formerly at Leyden , or here in New England , have , with the confession of their faith , held forth the duty of an entire separation from the church of England , I have divers times heard either Mr. Robinson our pastor , or Mr. Brewster our elder , stop them forthwith , showing that we required no such thing at their hands , but only to hold forth@@184023798.txt RUNNING almost due north and south , at an average distance of about 500 miles from the waters of the Pacific , a ridge of lofty mountains may be traced on the map of the New World . To the north , this savage ridge faaes off into the inhospitable plains that skirt the Mackenzie River , to the margin of the Arctic Sea ; to the south , it is continued into another climate , to cast its shadows over more luxuriant scenes , by that chain which is known amongst geographers as the Mexican Alps ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denominations , the course of the mighty Andes , which , from one extremity of the continent to another , from Cape Horn to the Arctic Circle , extends over a distance of 10,000 miles . This ridge is called the Rocky Mountains . Its desolate peaks vary considerably in height , from 10,000 to 16,000 feet above the level of the sea . Its arid steeps and dismal gorges present no variety of surface , except where accumulated snow lies frost-locked in its sightless depths , or where a gigantic forest climbs the face of the precipice , or some rare nook in the recesses of the stony hills , instead of being a quarry , as it ought to be , is prankt out by the capricious hand of nature with wild and scanty pasturage . This grim barrier limits the British Canadian possessions on the west down to nearly the forty-ninth degree of latitude , and then forms the north-western , as it is the natural frontier in that direction of the United States . A desert plain stretches from its base to the south-east , and beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunters , squatters , trampers , trappers , Lynchers , and bowie-knife men . * , Vith that side of the mountains we have nothing to do . Our present business lies on the other side . The region between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Ocean  --  or rather that portion of it which is bounded south and north by California and Russian America-is called the Oregon Territory . A glance at the map will enable the reader to fix its limits at once , for they are so intellinibly indicated by unerring landmarks , as not to be mistaken . With the Rocky Mountains on the east , and the ocean on the west , a chain of lakes , rivers , and rocks on the north , and the grisly Klamet hills , and the sandy plains and salt springs of California on the south , there is no difficulty in ascertaining the natural outline of the Oregon Territory . Differences of opinion exist as to the political boundaries ; the American government is for extending them , the British for *ontracting them . But these differences are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right of either over any , and what portion of this disputed country , whose political geography is so dubious . The character of a region , thus hemmed in and scarred in every direction by great mountains , traversed by innumerable streams , and dotted all over by lakes and swamps , can not be supposed to be especially favorable to vegetation . Within a hundred miles of the sea , and parallel with the Rocky Mountains , rises another enormous chain of mountains , bearing evident marks of volcanic action at a remote period . The Americans have appropriated the cap of nearly every peak of this stupendous range to their own glorification , and christened them after the names of their presidents - so that Tyler has his cap , and Harrison has his cap , and even Van Buren has his cap , without waiting for the settlement of the rigltt by which alone any of these worthies will be suffered to wear their caps in the presence of posterity . No doubt Mr. Polk will come in for a peak of his own in the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeing , that of all the American presidents , he is the only one who has ventured to assert that the region belongs to America , in the teeth of a treaty which , at least , leaves that question open by the common consent of both countries . The name assigned by Humboldt to this range , is that of the Californian Maritime Alps . The space westward to the sea is the most fertile on the whole surface , with the exception of a broad and tolerably rich plain to the south of the Columbia river . All the rest is rank , or barren-vast forlorn steppes , hopeless jungle , marsh , lake , sterile rocks , and aboriginal woods . Here and there may be found patches of practicable soil , but nothing grows in them except by dint of incredible labor ; and when wheat and potatoes require to be forced with the care and outlay of the daintiest hot-house fruit , it is not difficult to anticipate the issue of agricultural experiments in such districts . The Hudson 's Bay Company have a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve the local purpose for which they were undertaken , sustaining a few settlers who , from one cause or another , have clustered round the fur stations ; but agricultural speculations on a large scale can never be undertaken in that major section of the territory which is shut up between the Rocky Mountains and the Maritime Alps . Indeed , the only places in the interior which present any temptations to the agricultural experimentalist , are those which lie on the banks of the rivers , especially the great Columbia river , the principal stream in Oregon . The Columbia rises in the Rocky Mountains , pursues a vagrant and sinuous course to the sea , is occasionally expanded into a line of lakes , by the accession of numerous tributary waters , and frequently broken in its downward race by rapids , falls , and eddies . In the intervals of these obstructions , it is available only to boats and canoes ; but vessels of twelve feet draft may sail up 120 miles from the embouchure , where they are stopped by rapids . Beyond the rapids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; above that point , the river is accessible only to the boats or canoes of the country . But , although the Oregon Territory is not very seductive to the agriculturist , it has some natural advantages of a commercial kind . It abounds in valuable timber-ash , cedar , arbor-251 // vitie ; its rivers and bays swarm with fishsalmon , sturgeon , cod , herring ; whales and sea otters sport along its coasts ; and the interior is inconveniently populated with antelopes , elks , wolves , rats , and buffaloes . Out of all this live stock a brisk trade could be got up in a variety of articles , which in course of time might furnish materials for the establishment of a respectable tariff between Oregon and most parts of the Pacific . But as yet few people seem to consider the speculation a safe one . Not a single independent British settler has struck his spade in the earth , warned off partly , perhaps , by those prudential considerations which always hover round disputed titles , and partly by the exclusive privileges guaranteed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who possess complete jurisdiction over the whole of the territory claimed by the British government . The only stray individuals who have ventured into Oregon , with a view to colonize on their own account , are Americans . We hear of caravans of these adventurous people-whose lives seem to be of as little value as their bonds-setting out for the R.ocky Mountains , and making their way by the help of canoes , hatchets , and horses , into the savage defiles . But even the American historians who record these exploits , confess that they have never heard what became of their heroic countrymen . Upwards of a thousand emigrants went off in this way from the United States in the years 1842 and 1843 , and more have gone since , and more , we believe , are still going , in defiance of all perils by land , water , and treaty ; and all that is known about them is , that a few families are squatted somewhere on farms so small and miserable , that the only wonder is that they should still survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compatriots . The American passion fur going a-head , and keeping in perpetual motion , so curiously exemplified on quarter-day in the large towns , by wagon-loads of flitting furniture , is exhibited in its last agony by this desperate emigration beyond the Rocky Mountains . The journey itself-which we shall presently take an opportunity of touching uponis replete with hardships and dangers ; its successful accomplishment is extremely improbable ; and its results , when accomplished , are for the most part such as , instead of drawing men from their homesteads , would deter any other human beings except the restless and reckless race that rove about the United States . They have not even the excuse for expatriation which is furnished by over-populated soils ; for the population of the United States , replenished as it is every day by draughts from all other parts of the habitable globe , is insufficient for the daily necessities of the country . Nor have they the plausible pretence of bettering their condition ; for it requires , in Oregon , the labor of three men to effect the same quanti*y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labor of one . Nor have they the higher plea of desiring to render available to the commonwealth this immense tract of territory , by carrying into it their arts and their patriotism ; for Oregon , to whomsoever it may be ceded in the long run , certainly does not belong to the United States yet , and never may belong to them . So that this daring movement is unsustained by a single prudential consideration , is opposed , on the contrary , to every argument of policy or expediency , and must be referred to that inexplicable love of change and contempt for consequences , by which Brother Jonathan is preeminently distinguished in all the affairs , great and small , in which he is engaged . As we have alluded to the difficulties of the journey over the continent , and across the Rocky Mountains in the Oregon Territory , it may be as well to show what they are . The expedition of Lewis and Clarke , undertaken at the instance of the American government , in 1804 , may be selected as the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanction of advantages which no private party of emigrants could , under any possible circumstances , be supposed to possess . The party consisted of forty-four men , who embarked in three boats on the Missouri , in the month of May , well supplied with all resources necessary for the journey . They worked slowly and laboriously against the mighty current until the month of October , when , finding themselves no further advanced than the country of the Mandan Indians , they disembarked to winter on the shore , further progress at that season of the year being impracticable . Here they were compelled to remain until the following April , when they resumed the ascent of the river with thirty men , having sent the others back , for reasons which it is unnecessary to investigate . At the end of three weeks they reached the junction of the Yellow Stone , and towards the Middle of June were arrested by the falls of the Missouri , a series of stupendous cataracts which extend over a distance of ten miles . At this point their boats became useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls , they embarked in canoes hollowed from the trunks of the cotton-wood trees that grow on the banks of the river . On the 19th of July they reached the gates of the Rocky Mountains , where the Missouri narrows itself into a dark and and rapid channel between perpendicular rocks , rising 1200 feet above its surface . They had now been out fourteen months , and had only gained the entrance to the mountains , where the most formidable difficulties of the journey really began . The passage of the Rocky Mountains occupied them three weeks . Their sufferings and privations were of a kind to appal the stoutest nerves . The anguish of a fatiguing and apparently hopeless expedition through the dreary gorges , and over the fearful heights , crossing streams which they dared not venture to navigate , and pursuing tracks which they were constantly obliged to abandon , was enhanced by the extreme severity of the cold and the want of provisions . Before they had entered upon this passage they had buried their goods and canoes in pits , and they must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guides which they were lucky enough to procure from a party of Shoshonee Indians . From July to October they were unable to find a stream upon which it was considered safe to intrust themselves , subsisting the whole way upon a scanty and precarious supply of berries , dried fish , and the carcases of dogs and horses . At last , in the beginning of October , they embarked upon the Kooskooskee river , for which they constructed five canoes , and at last reached the Columbia . The passage down the Columbia was sufficiently dangerous , but having , by an infinite variety of stratagems , and at a cost of toil and endurance which can not be very easily estimated at a distance , succeeded in evading the 252 // perils of the falls and rapids-they finally made the mouth of the river on the 15th of November , 1805 . The whole journey consequently occupied eighteen months . From this bare outline , dropping out all those startling incidents and shuddering details which constitute the actual terrors of such an undertaking , somc slight notion may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter , and of the contingencies which render it unlikely in the last degree that they shall ever be able to conduct the stream of emigration in that direction with the remotest chance of success . Several routes have been subsequently attempted , but with no better results . They differ from each other only in the privations to which the adventurers were exposed and the difficulties are , in fact , so overwhelming as to justify this conclusion - that no highway can ever be established between the United States and Oregon for the overland conveyance of emigrants . " None but the wild and free trappers , " says Mr. Dunn , " who know the country well , can clamber over these precipices , and tread these deserts with security ; and even these are quitting them as haunts , and now using them only as unavoidable tracks . " For hundreds of miles the tracks are barren under foot . with scorching heat or piercing cold over head . The country west of the Rocky Mountains is described by the same competent authority as being broken up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which the traveller can not draw a drop of water to allay his raging thirst ; and the soil is either so sandy , that he sinks into it at every step , or formed of such sharp and rugged stones , that it lacerates his feet . Fruit there is none-except berries , which are scarce , penurious , and not always safe . Farnham tells us that his party were at last obliged to kill their favorite dog , and economize his flesh ; and that during eight days ' journey he did not meet a solitary acre of land capable of producing ve*etation of any kind . Townsend , an American traveller , gives even a still more dreadful picture of the miseries of the journey . Intense thirst is one of the inflictions , produced by the naked heat of the sun upon the exposed surface , and the consequent desiccation to which everything is subject . " The air , " he says , " feels like the breath of a sirocco ; the tongue becomes parched and horny ; and the eyes , mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulverized lava , which rises from the ground with the least breath of air . Bullets , pebbles of chalcedony , and pieces of smooth obsidian , were in great requisition ; almost every man was mumbling some of these substances to assuage his burning thirst . " They have recourse to leaden bullets and other substances for the purpose of producing saliva , which they swallow to prevent inflammation and death . Such are the terrors of the passage from the United States into the Oregon Territory ; terrors so repulsive that they seem as if nature had forever prohibited the two regions from holding free intercourse with each other . On the other hand , if any political or international value can be reasonably attached to proximity of position , and comparative facility of access , the short and easy transit which we can command from the remotest point of our Canadian possessions to the shores of the Pacific , invests us with geographical advantages , which it would be impolitic , not to say hopeless , to contest . Whatever becomes of Oregon , the English , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains , and who have long wielded direct sway over the disputed territory itself , through the numerous locations of the Hudson 's Bay Company , must always exercise an inevitable influence over its destinies . If Oregon were ceded to the United States to-morrow , British influence must still predominate from the source of the Columbia to the sea ; a state of things which , so far from producing any practical benefits to the Union , would be attended by disastrous consequences sooner or later . Confident as the citizens of the " model republic " may be of the solidity of their institutions , there is nothing more certain than this , that the moment they embark in any project of aggrandizement likely to create jealousy amongst other powers , or to precipitate serious divisions of opinion at home , they strike a vital blow at their independence . And of all conceivable designs , that of embroiling themselves with Canada would be the most unfortunate ; for , whatever foolish calculations they may raise upon the discontent of the habitaas , now rapidly vanishing before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured that there is no part of the globe where their intrusion or interference would be met with a more determined resistance . There are certain gloomy memories haunting the borders of Maine which it would be a deplorable mistake to revive ; nor can that people who invaded Florida with bloodhounds , and banished the aborigines from their hunting-grounds across the Mississippi , expect a much better reception from the Indians of British America . All parties in Canada , however they may differ on other subjects , are unanimous about Uncle Sam . Lewis and Clarke , as we have seen , were eighteen months on their journey . The passage from Montreal to Fort George can be made on ordinary occasions in less than a fourth of that time ; and , where expedition is necessary , in less than a sixth . The fact is sufficiently notorious to everybody acquainted with the country ; but we prefer stating it explicitly on the authority of M. Mofras , because that gentleman displays such miserable animosity against England in his useless volumes on Oregon and California , that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexceptionable when it can be cited in favor of the accidental superiority of our activity or our position . " The entire distance , " says M. Mofras , " from Montreal to the Pacific Ocean , at the embouchure of the Columbia , is exactly 1800 leagues , and the journey occupies four months and a half . During this l ) eriod they are obliged to travel on horseback seventy-five leagues , or about thirteen days ; the remainder is done by boats . We have not calculated the days necessarily devoted to repose , or business , at the different stations ; and the delays are sometimes so long that a party which leaves Montreal in the beginning of May , probably may not reach Fort Vancouver till the following October ; they return towards the end of March , and arrive at Montreal about the close of September . But it ought to be remarked that on such occasions the caravan is generally composed of sixty or eighty persons , and ten or twelve canoes , frequently carrying baggage or merchandize . If they travel unencumbered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from time to time by the company , they can make the distance from the Columbia to the St. Lawrence in less than three months . " There can be no doubt on which side lies the 253 // greater facility of access to the mountain-bound territory of Oregon . The consequence is , that nearly the whole civilized population consists of the servants and settlers of the Hudson 's Bay Company . M. Mofras says , that there are about 200 Americans grouped upon the river Onallamet ; he estimates the servants in the immediate employment of the company at 100 more ( calculated by Mr. Greenhow at 400 , ) and the French Canadians at 3000 . This division of the population is clearly incorrect , if it be intended to imply that these French Canadians are independent settlers but the actual numbers , on the whole , are probably accurate enough . The remaituing population is cootposed of native Indians , scattered over the face of the country . It is nearly impossible to ascertain their numbers . They were formerly very numerous , but successive visitations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away so rapidly , that they are now reduced to a mere remnant . Mr. Greenhow says , that the whole of the native tribes , and all other persons inhabiting Oregon , together , do not exceed 20,000 . We are inclined to regard this statement as in excess ; but we have no means of approximating more closely to the fact . There is no doubt , however , that some of the Indian tribes are extinct , and the rest not likely , under the influence of white civilization , to bring up their physical statistics to their ancient average . Two rather important inferences may be drawn from these statements . First , that geographical proximity gives to British America a complete command over the Oregon Territory . Second , that the Oregon Territory is now , and has been for upwards of a century and a half , since the incorporation of the Hudson 's Bay Company , whose power has gone on gradually increasing , and consolidating , and acquiring a more systematized form up to the present hour , under the direct influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter into the abstract question of right , at issue between England and the United States , form , at least , material elements in the discussion , and add considerable force to the claim on the part of Great Britain . Let us now examine the question of right set lip between the two countries , strictly confining ourselves to the historical points upon which alone it can be adjudicated . But we can not avoid observing at the outset that th' claim to the entire sovereignty over Oregon by the American government is of recent birth . Up to 1814 , they were satisfied with asserting a claim to joint occupancy ; up to 1827 , they never asserted a right of any kind beyond the foTty-nioth degree ; in 1843 , the president announced , to the astonishment of the world , that the whole territory belonged to America ; and in 1844 , a bill was actually brought into congress , " to organize a territorial government in the Orecron Territory , and for other purposes ! " this bill , which pledges the government to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing treaty with England , comes before the senate in December next . We believe it will be thrown out , because , in the interval , all reasonable people will have time to comprehend the extent of its perfidious impracticability ; but whether it be thrown out or not , it must remain forever in evidence against the United States , as an instance of that indecent contempt of all honorable obligations , for which they have been of late year pily conspicuous . 5 50 unhap The origin of the American claim to the Oregon Territory can not be more precisely stated than in the words of Mr. Greenhow , the ablest of the American writers on this subject . We choose his statement , because it relieves us from all suspicion of misrepresentation , and enables us to avoid the possibility of unconsciously coloring the facts by any inadvertent expression of our own feelings and convictions . After having informed his readers that the " discovery " of the Columbia river by Gray , an American , was not made known until 1798 , by the publication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for many years afterwards , thought the river , or anything connected with it , could ever become interesting to the United States , he proceeds to lay down the actual limits of the States at that period . " The territories of the United States were at that time ( 1798 ) all included between the Atlantic Ocean on the east , and the Mississipi river on the west . In the north were the British provinces ; in the south lay Florida , belonging to Spain ; and beyond the Mississipi the Spaniards also claimed the vast region called Louisiana , stretching from the Gulf of Mexico , northward and north-westward to an indefinite extent . Thus , all communication between the states of the Federal Union and the Pacific was completely cut off , by the interposition of countries possessed by forcion and u nations . then , b nfriendly that up to 1798 the Oregon Territory never entered into the wildest dreams of the United States , and that whatever real or imaginary claims they may have upon it must have arisen since . But at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perplexity on the score of prior discovery , to observe that , in 1778 , before the Federal Union was called into existence , the whole coast of the Pacific was explored by Cooke up to the fortyeighth degree ; that , in 1787 , Berkeley and Dixon , both English navigators , explored the Strait of Fuca and Queen Charlotte 's Island ; that , in 1787 , Lieutenant Mears surveyed the Strait of Fuca and Nootka Sound , where he established a factory , and took possession of the circumjacent country in the name of his Britannic Majesty ; that in 1792 , 1793 , and 1794 , Vancouver , who was sent out expressly by the English government , surveyed and sounded every mile of that intricate coast ; that , in 1792 , Broughton , Vancouver 's lieutenant , explored the Columbia river , as far as 100 miles upwards , and took possession of it in the name of his sovereign ; and that , in 1793 , when most of the north-west continent was unknown , M'Kenzie , an officer in the Hudson 's Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coiitinent from coast to coast , and executed it with a courage and sagacity unparalleled in the history of discovery . The honor of having originally discovered the Columbia belongs to the Spaniards . Heceta , in 1775 , was the first person who gazed upon its waters . All this time the whole region was a terra incognita to the people of the United States . They knew nothing about it all the time our navigators were exploring and surveying the coasts , and taking possession uif the country . The only other nation that ever possessed a scintilla of a right to possession in those latitudes , or that ever pretended to such a right , was Spain ; and the rights of Spain and England were finally declared and settled in // who in 1792 got into an inlet , which he presumed to be the Columbia river , was captain of a ship trading along the north-west coast . He neither discovered the river , nor explored it , nor took possession of it . It is more than certain that he never even saw it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bay where he was weatherbound for ten days-at a distance of sixteen miles front the entrance to the river****and then departed upon his trading concerns , to dodge about for furs , utterly innocent of all claim to the glory of being handed down to posterity in the pages of history . Indeed , his name would never have been heard of bad it not been for the generous allusion made to him by Vacouver , in his narrative published six years afterwards . Disentangling the question , therefore , of all doubts as to discovery , settlement , and possession-seeing that we had taken possession of this territory , and entered into a convention with Spain , the original discoverer , for the recognition and security of our rights , before the United States knew anything about the Oregon Territory , or could have reached it if they had , we reduce the American claim to the simplest possible basis , which we are willing to accept in the very terms put forward by the Americans themselves . Having shown that in 1798 , and for several years afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Oregon Territory , but had no suspicion that they ever should possess any , Mr. Greenhow goes on to state when it was , and under what circumstances , they acquired the right *vh.ich they have only lately asserted for the first time in full . " The position of the United States , and of their governotent and people , " says Mr. Greenhow , " with regard to the north-western portion of the continent , was , however , entirely changed after the 30th of April , 1803 , when Louisiana , which had been ceded by Spain to France in 1800 , came into their possession by purchase from the latter power . From that moment the route across the continent from the Atlantic to the Pac*flc lay open to the Americans ; and nothing could be anticipated capable of arresting their progress in the occupation of the whole territory included between these seas . " In this passage there are two very distinct assertions : I. That , in 1803 , the United States purchased Louisiana from France ; II . That the consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route to the Pacific . The first is a matter of fact , upon which we are all agreed ; for there is no doubt that the United States purchased Louisiana from France . The second is a deduction from the first , and , like all deductions , must depend for its validity on the soundness of the premises . If the purchase of Louisiana threw open to the Americans the territory west of the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific , then Louisiana must have extended over the whole of that region . The question is-Did Louisiana occupy that extent-a space on the west of the map nearly equal to the whole of the United States on the east1 Upon the answer to this question-upon the actual boundaries of the country known by the name of Louisiana in 1803  --  the American claim to the Oregon Territory , mainly , if not altogether , depends . If France sold to the United States any territory west of the Rocky Mountains , France must * Vancouver , ii . 255 have been in possession of such territory . Now France derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Spain . But we have already seen that Spain possessed no such right herself , and , therefore , could not cede it to France : consequently , France could not sell any such territory to the United States . She could not sell that which she did not possess . In order , however , to ascertain clearly and circumstantially , what were the original Spanish rights from whence this cession descended , it will be necessary to revert to the discovery of the Oregon Territory , and to trace the foot-prints of adventure and settlement from that time to the moment when the United States first set up this imaginary claim . Having exhausted this branch of the inquiry , we will recall the reader to the point from which we start on this unavoidable excursion in the argument . It is necessary to observe , for the better understanding of the mere question of discovery , that the whole of the Oregon coast lies between the forty-second and fifty-fourth degrees of latitude . In 1578 , Drake discovered this coast to the forty-eighth degree-about two degrees above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discredit this fact ; but his motive is too transparent , and his evasive treatment of the subject too obvious , to demand any exposure at our hands . The fact itself , however , although we hold it to be indisputable , is of no importance whatever . We can afford to make the United States a present of all the advantages we could possibly derive from it . If our right to the Oregon Territory rested upon priority , it could be established beyond all cavil . But mere discovery gives no title to possession ; and as we made no settlement in Oregon for upwards of two centuries afterwards , the long interval would have been equivalent to an abandonment of the country , if during that period any other government had thought proper to appropriate the soil . But no government did so appropriate the soil : and even waiving our claim on the ground of discovery , we are prepared to assert it on the ground of settlement . We were the first settlers in Oregon  --  the first to assume the rights of sovereignty over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only settlers there , as we shall show presently , when the federal government purchased Louisiana from France . Of the Spanish navigators in these waters , the first who is admitted on all hands to a place in the discussion is Juan Perez . He sailed from Mexico in 1764 , and the first land he saw was in the 54 parallel of latitude . But he could not land , and sailing to the southward was driven out to sea . He again made land in latitude 470 47 ' , and coasted home , having literally made no observations whatever . This expedition was considered to he so disgraceful a failure , that the Spanish government su* ) pressed the account of it ; and even Mr. Greenhow , in his hesitating way , allows that the discovery of Nootka Sound " is now , by general consent , assigned to Captain Cook . " In 1776 , another expedition of two vessels was fitted up under the command of Bruno Heceta , and Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra , who succeeded to the command of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is unnecessary to detail the vicissitudes of a voyage in which the ' commander , says Mr. Greenhow , " certainly acquired no laurels . " The highest point made was ' the fifty-eighth degree of latitude ; and having ' : // THE OREGON TERRITORY . qwq // the Spaniards , whose conduct throughout these transactions ( without touching the question of right one way or the other ) is universally admitted to have been base and treacherous . We need not detain the reader by entering upon the details , but will reduce the case at once to the simple point in which this outrage was fiuially narrowed , in the subsequent negotiations between the two countries . Mears having brought the affair under the consideration of the British government , restitution and satisfaction were instantly demanded of the Court of Spain , to which demand an answer was given , that the Viceroy of Mexico had already restored the captured vessels and liberated the crews , on the supposition , however , that their owners were ignorant of the exclusive rights of Spain . This answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , was held to be so unwarrantable , that it was at once met by a message to parliament , asking for supplies to enable his majesty to vindicate the rights of his subjects to " a free and uninterrupted navigation , commerce , and fishery , and to the possession of such establishments as they should form " on the coast . The supplies were granted with enthusiasm , and preparations for war were immediately set on foot ; so clearly did the British government comprehend their rights , and so determined were they to enforce them . On the same day a note was addressed to the Spanish ambassador in London , in which his majesty declared that " lie would take the most effectual pacific measures to prevent his subjects from trespassing on the just and acknowledged rights of Spain ; but that he could not accede to the pretensions of absolute sovereigiity , commerce , and navigation , which appeared to be the principal objects of the last note from the Spanish ambassador . " Nothing could be more explicit on both sides . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country ; the English government denied that they possessed any such right , showing at the same time that they regarded their own title to be so clear , that they actually expended 3,000,0001. sterling in active preparations to maintain and establish its validity . The English government would certainly never have incurred so enormous an expenditure , if they had not fully recognized the proceedings of Mears in taking possession of the country . Spain , however , did not see fit to push her claim to extremities . She argued the case with a downward sophistry , abandoning her high position step by step , and gradually begging the question by observing , that " although Spain may not have establishments or colonies planted on the coasts or in the ports in dispute , it does not follow that such coast or port does not belong to her . " To which the British government contented itself by simply reisserting the " indisputable right " of British subjects to free navigation , commerce and fishery , and to the possession of any establishments they might form with the consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any European nation . Spain herself admitted in these negotiations that she had never occupied the country , so that , according to every received principle of law and justice , her claim fell to the ground . The attitude taken by England was not to be misunderstood ; and the demands of Spain at last shrunk into a treaty . This was the Convention of the Escurial , which in America goes rather significantly by the name of the Nootka Treaty , seeing that it restored and recognized in full the rights of the English in that quarter . By this convention it was stipulated that all the buildings and tracts of land on the North-west coast , of which British subjects were dispossessed , should be restored ; that just reparation should be made for all acts of hostility ; that both parties should have free right to navigate in the Pacific Ocean or the South Seas , or to carry on commerce or establish settlements in places not already occupied , and that the subjects of both powers should have access to any settlements subsequently formed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the places they had previously occupied , and threw open to both powers the right of settling in all places then unoccupied . After this convention , Spain had undoubtedly as good a right to form settlements in Oregon as we had . The effect of the convention was distinctly and unequivocally to annul or forego all previous claims to sovereignty over the country on both sides , and to treat the territory as an open waste , upon which either party was at liberty to form any settlements it might think proper , provided they did not interfere with any settlements already formed , there being at the time btit two in existence , those of the English at Nootka Sound , arid at Port Cox , about sixteen leagues to the southward , which this very treaty expressly recognized . What followed upon this convention The English government immediately proceeded to carry out their intentions , in conformity with that official interprctation of the treaty which was accepted by both governments , and sent out Vancouver , in 1792 , to take possession of the restored settlements , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Nootka he was formally put in possession of the buildings and lands belonging to the English , and having surveyed the coast from 390 20 ' south latitude to the Strait of Juan de Fuca , and finding it all unoccupied , he took possession of it in the name of his Britannic Majesty , under the right accor*ied and guaranteed by the express stipulations of the convention . By this legal and official act , the country was annexed to the British crown forever . The act was notified to the whole world ; it was published under the sanction of government in Vancouver 's narrative everybody knew it ; nobody disputed it . If Spain regarded this act or declaration of sovereignty as an infringement of her rights , she would have remonstrated or protested . But she did neither the one nor the other . On the contrary , from that hour she abandoned the shores of the north-western region ; and has never appeared upon them since . It seems rather unreasonable , then , that if Spain never afterwards asserted any right of territory in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain by virtue of a subsequent transactton . Under the Nootka treaty , Spain , had she been in time , and had she thought proper to do so , might have taken possession of all the unoccupied land ; and if she had , we xnust have allowed the legality of her title . But she not only did not avail herself of the opportunity , but does not appear to have contemplated such a measure . In fact , she never at any period formed a settlement in Oregon , as was frankly admitted in the diplomatic 257 // notes which passed between the courts of Madrid and London on the occasion of these negotiations . She had enough to do in New Mexico . From this review of the actual events which determined in the British crown all rights of sovereignty in the Oregon Territory , it will be seen that the claims of Spain , whatever they might have been before , were now finally set aside . This recalls us to the point which , for the first time , introduces the United States into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceded by the Spaniards . As Spain had no possessions in Oregon , she clearly could not have included in her cession to France any portion of that region . The question then is , what district of country did she cede to France under the name of Louisiana* It is much more easy to answer this question in the negative than in the affirmative . We can much more readily decide what was not Louisiana than determine what was understood to be included under that designation . The Americans themselves never had any clear notion of that district ; they very candidly avow that its boundaries were indefinite from the earliest period ; and the Spaniards , who protested against the sale to the United States , as being a violation of suhsisting engagements on the part of France , and who were well disposed to dispute the entrance of the Americans , declared that France had no right to a foot of territory west of the Mississippi . In this dilemma we are thrown upon a complicated tissue of treaties , to trace amongst them , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Louisiana . One thing alone is certain , that they could not , by any political or geographical stratagem , be strained across the Rocky Mountains into the Oregon Territory . The confusion respecting these boundaries is perfectly bewildering . Louisiana was originally a French colony . It was settled by a charter of Louis XIV. , which charter left its eastern and western frontiers to the imagination of the settlers . The Sieur Crozat , to whom this ambiguous charter was granted in 1712 , was glad to give it up in 1717 . Probably , he was afraid of committing involuntary trespasses on the property of others . The Illinois country was then annexed to it , the Illinois country itself being in a similar condition of doubt . This , of course , only increased the perplexity . Louisiana , thus rendered more difficult of definition than ever , was made over by royal decree to Law 's Mississippi Company , who escaped from their vague responsibility in 1732 . The onus of this boundless province then reverted to the crown of France , and the said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cession to the crown of Spain . But Spain seems to have been as uneasy under the obligation as France , and ceded it back again in 1800 . The sly terms of these cessions arid retrocessions are distinguished by a spirit of evasive finesse worthy of the palmiest days of the French and Spanish comedy . It would puzzle a conjuror to discov ' *r from these documents what country it was that was thus ceded and retroceded . France gave to Spain " all that country known under the name of Louisiana , " and Spain gave back to France this same Louisiana , taking care to guard against accidents , by adding " with the same extent that it now has in the hands of Spain , and that it had when France possessed it . " The conscientious caution of the Spaniard can not be too highly commended . In this condition France sold the unmapped Louisiana to the United States for 15,000,000 dollars ; and the United States are now trying to make the most of their bargain . Finding that the limits of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world that it had no limits but the ocean . rhe way in which Mr. Greenhow speaks of Louisiana forms a suggestive commentary on this curious dilemma . He says , that from the time when Louisiana was ceded to Spain , until it " came into the possession of the United States , its extent and limits were not defined . " This is tolerably decisive of the difficulty America has yet to encounter in the attempt to prove that it extended to the Pacific , seeing , on the confession of the Americans themselves , that its extent was not defined . But this is nothing in comparison with the admissions made in the following remarkable passage , which , if there be any meaning at all to be wrung from the English language , when it is employed by American historians , sets the question *tt rest forever . " How far Louisiana extended westward , when it was ceded by France to Spain , history offers no means of determining . The charter granted to Crozat , in 1712 , included only the territories drained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the illinois was annexed to Louisiana in 1717 , nothing can be found showing what territories were comprehended under that general appellation . In the old French maps , New France is represented as extending across the continent to the Pacific ; in British maps , of the same period , a large portion of the territory thus assigned to New France , appears as New England , or as Virginia ; while the Spanish geographers claimed the same portion for their sovereign , under the names of New Mexico and California . While Louisiana remained in the possession of Spain , it was certainly never considered as embracing New Mexico or *2a4fornia ; though whether it was so considered or not , is immaterial to the question as to its western limits in 1803 , which were , by the treaty , to be the same as in 1762 . In the absence of all light on the subject from history , we are forced to regard the boundaries indicated by nature-namely , the highlands separating the waters of the Mississippi from those flowing into the Pacific or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the United States by France in 1803 . " The completeness of this admission-that the western boundary of Louisiana was the chain of the Rocky Mountains , and that , consequently , America acquired no rights by her purchase beyond that boundary-is final . But we must not , therefore , pass over in silence the spirit of subterfuge that runs through this very disingenuous passage . Notwithstanding that Mr. Greenhow is thoroughly convinced that Louisiana never could , in the nature of things , have extended beyond the mountains , and , indeed , does not hesitate , at last , to say so , he tries to insinuate , that in 1762 it might have extended to the Pacific . Mr. Greenhow knows perfectly well that New Mexico , or California , never belonged to France , and , therefore , could not have formed a part of the territory called Louisiana , which was ceded by France to Spain , in 1762 . The question turns upon what was Louisiana in 1762 , for we have seen that Spain returned it back again , precisely as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as clear as the sun at noonday , that New Mexico could have been no 258 // portion of it ; for this very reason , that in 1762 , when the original cession was made , New Mexico belonged to Spain herself . The whole of the territory in that direction , west of the Rocky Mountains , was Spanish ground , adjoining this vague Louisiana , a fact which Mr. Greenhow , only two or three pages before , frankly , but perhaps unconsciously , states in very exact terms . " That any settlement , " he observes , " of the western boundaries of Louisiana , should have been made on the conclusion of the treaty of 1762 , is not probable . It would have been superfluous , as Louisiana would certainly have joined the other territories of Spain in that direction . " It is impossible , upon the whole of this evidence , to make a loophole for the slightest doubt on this point-that in purchasing Louisiana from France , the United States acquired no rights beyond the base of the Rocky Mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written at the time of the purchase . " The boundary , " says Jefferson , " which I deem not admitting question , are the highlands on the western side of the Mississippi , enclosing all its waters  --  the Missouri of course  --  and terminating in a line drawn from the north-western point , from the Lake of the Woods to the nearest source of the Mississippi , as lately settled between Great Britain and the United States . " And in some negotiations which took place four years afterwards , he desired the omission of a clause which referred to the north-west territory , because it " could have no other effect , than as an offensive intimation to Spain that the claims of the United States extend to the Pacific Ocean . " We , therefore , dismiss this branch of the subject , by restating the only conclusion consonant with the facts of history , at which any human being can arrive , after a sifting investigation of the whole question-namely , that the claim set up by the United States to a right of territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1803 , is utterly fallacious , and totally unfounded . Recalling the reader , then , to the point from which we started , we ask what is to be thought of the integrity of the writer who , with all these facts and disproofs before him , could be capable of making the sweeping assertion already quoted , that from the moment of the purchase , " the route across the continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific lay open to the Americans * " We have been accused of dealing severely with the poets of America ( an accusation which in good time we shall notice as it deserves ; ) but we confess we are in some doubt whether they should not be called upon to evacuate the regions of fiction and givo place to the historians . The settlement between the United States and Great Britain , alluded to by President Jefferson , took place in 1783 . It recognized the independence of the States and fixed their boundaries but does not in any way affect the Oregon question , which at that time had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time , we shall now proceed to state the steps that were taken by America in consequence of her presumed claim , and the arrangements of every kind that have been entered into since 1803 in reference to that claim ; conducting the inquiry chronologieally to the present moment , so that the English reader may be put in possession of the exact state of the case as it now stands in litigation between the two countries . In 1805 , Lewis and Clarke were commissioned by President Jefferson to explore the country west of the Rocky Mountains . We have already stated that , according to the constitution of the United States , the president can not exercise any act of sovereignty-he can not annex new territories to the Union . This commission , therefore , was not invested with an official character , and could not take possession of the country in the name of the American government . No title , consequently , can be raised upon this exploring expedition ; nor is any such title asserted . " Politically , " says Mr. Greenhow , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention of the American government to occupy and settle the countries explored . " " But , " rejoins Mr. Falconer , " such intention had already been announced to the world by the English government in a public , authentic , and legal manner , and its sovereignty over the country declared . " In 1810 , an attempt was made by a Captain Smith to found a post for trade with the Indians on the south bank of the Columbia . He built a house and laid out a garden , but the speculation was a failure , and he abandoned it before the close of the year . Mr. Falconer very properly observes , that this was the act of a private individual , and does not carry any political inference whatever . In the same year the fur station called Astoria , rendered famous by Washington Irving 's romance , was founded by a German merchant of New York , Jacob Astor , near the mouth of the Columbia . This was simply a private trading speculation , and although it has been dragged into the Oregon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim , we need scarcely observe that it has no political character at all . The government of the United States might as well set up pretensions to sovereign authority in England because some stray ship-broker from New York establishes a packet-office in Liverpool , as pretend to any right over Oregon arising out of Mr. Astor 's attempt to establish a fur company there . The brief history of the affair is as follows Mr. Astor , whose experience in the commerce of the Pacific pointed out to him some probabilities of success in such an experiment , devised a scheme for the establishment of a Pacific Fur Company . The rivalry he principally apprehended was from the North-west Company of Montreal ( which has been since amalgamated with the Hudson 's Bay Company ; ) and he was so impressed with the policy of conciliating the English interest that he offered one third of the project to that company . But they prudently declined the offer . The company , however , was formed , and although it originated with an American merchant , such was the unavoidable ascendancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greenhow admits that , " the majority not only of the inferior servants , but also of the partners , were British subjects . " This majority was so decisive that a reasonable doubt arises whether Astoria was not actually an English settlement ; and when , in October , 1813 , it was found necessary to dissolve the partnership , the whole of the establishment and stock being then sold to the North-West Company , the immediate cause of the dissolution is directly traced by Mr. Greenhow to the fact , that the company was governed by English and not by American directors . He puts this statement into italics by way of marking its importance ; we adopt his italics for the same reason . " The 259 // Pacific Company , nevertheless , " says Mr. Greenhow , " might , and probably would , have withstood all these difficulties , alluding to the war with England , *f the directing parties on the columbia had been Americans , instead of being , as the greater part of them were , men unconnected with the United States by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties . " This statement is conclusive as to the character of the settlement , and shows unequivocally , that whatever American ingredients may have been mixed up in its formation , it was to all intents and purposes amenable to British influence . It could not have been otherwise , for the Americans had never subjected Oregon to their authority . They had no official servants in the country of any class , judicial , military , or naval . Suppose any civil question had arisen during the brief existence of Astoria , to what authority could it have been referred If America had any rights in Oregon she must surely have had some machinery of government by which her rights could have been enforced and protected . But she never did establish any such machinery , and if the handfol of Americans who were embarked in the Astoria speculation had been at any moment compelled into a civil procedure , they must of necessity have appealed to the English law , under which alone they could derive legal protection . The failure of Astoria led , as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North-West Company in 1813 , when the name of the establishment was immediately changed to that of Fort George . It was now English by purchase , and it has remained in the hands of the English e*.rer since . At the termination of the war , in 1814 , America claimed the restoration of the post sold by the Pacific Company , as belonging to the United States , and as having been taken during the war . The answer was obvious , that it had been bought , not captured , that the territory had been taken possession of long before in the name of his Britannic Majesty , and that it had all along been considered as a part of his majesty 's dominions . The discussions on this point were drawn to a close by leaving the question of title to be discussed in a future negotiation . While the main question was thus left in abeyance , the fort was restored ; and the best proof that can be afforded of the slender faith placed by the Americans in their right of repossession is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never occupied the fort up to the present hour . It is now in the hands of the Hudson 's Bay Company . It ought to be observed , also , that while we thus consented to restore the fort , we have consistently and invariably protested against the American claim to any territorial rights . Early in 1818 , Lord Castlereagh , writing *o the British minister at Washington , says , " In signifying to Mr. Adams the full acquiescence of your government in the re*iccupation of the limited position which the United States held in the Columbia at the breaking out of the war , you will , at the same time , assert the claim of Great Britain to that territory , upon which the American settlement must be considered as an encroachment . " The same language was subsequently employed by Lord Bathurst , and has been persevered in throughout all the negotiations that since have taken place on the subject . If any claim could possibly arise out of such a settlement as that of Astoria , unauthorized by any act of Congress , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score of priority ; for , in addition to the former settlement at Nootka Sound and Port Cox , an English party , commissioned by the North-West Company , formed an establishment , in 1806 , on Frazer 's Lake , in the fifty-fourth degree of latitnde. * These were all authentic arrangements under the sanction of the British jurisdiction , already formally proclaimed in the Columbia and up the coast many years before . America has no title , in short , on the ground of occupancy ; for she has never yet occupied a yard of the country-none on the ground of discovery ; for Drake , and Cooke , and Heceta , were there before her-none on the ground of exploration ; for Broughton was up the Columbia first  --  and none on the ground of any declaration of annexation or any act of possession ; for up to this hour she has not taken one single legal step towards the assertion of a legal right of any nature whatsoever . The next point in the progress of the debate , which was now insensibly assuming every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a convention ratified between Great Britain and America in 1818 , by which the rights of both were submitted to a temporary suspension . A boundary line was agreed upon which should run along the forty-ninth degree of latitude , from the Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains ; and the whole of the country west of the Rocky Mountains was pronounced free to both for the term of ten years , without prejudice to the claims of either . The question of title was , consequently , still left open . And now we arrive at the most material transaction in the history of this prolonged dispute : -a transaction upon the interpretation of which the American claim finally rests , at some cost of consistency in the variegated arguments by which it had been hitherto maintained . rrhe obscurity in which the transfer of Louisiana in 1803 had left the actual boundary lines of that large extent of country , rendered it necessary that some understanding should be entered into on the subject , and a declaratory treaty , known as the Florida Treaty , was accordingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries were fixed , running on the west of the United States in an irregular line from the Sabine river to the forty-second degree of latitude , and then along that parallel west to the Pacific . A clause was inserted in the treaty by which the united States renounced all pretension to the territories west and south of this boundary , and Spain ceded to the United States all rights , claims , and pretensions to the territories on its north and east . Upon this clause , America mainly relies for the proof of her Oregon claim . We need not re*rgue the incompetency of Spain to cede to America territories over which she possessed no rights herself . This clause , to be of any value at all , must depend upon the power of the donor to bestow , not on the willingness of the receiver to accept . America is willing enough to accept Oregon at the hands of Spain ; but the real question at issue is , has Spain the power of bestowing Oregon on Amer * Mr. Greenhow 's book contains so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we set out of exposing them in detail . But we can not suffer his assertion , that " this was the first settlement or post of any kind made by British subjects west of the Rocky Mountains , " to pass uncorrected . His own book contains the refutation of this strange historical mistake . 260 // ica We answer , No . Spain never was in possession of Oregon ; and , whatever debatable title she might have previously had , she distinctly and irrevocably resigned it by the stringent conditions of the Nootka Convention in 1790 . From that moment Spain relinquished her claims forever ; Great Britain immediately afterwards took possession of the country , and the Spanish flag has never , from that day to this , appeared off the Oregon coast . It is impossible to imagine a clearer case . The Spanish title is not merely defective but non-existent . Spain had no title after 1790 . Even M. Mofras , in his work on Oregon and California , which betrays all throughout a spirit of malignant hostility against England , is reluctantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States no rights whatever in Oregon . He says that it could not be construed to invalidate the convention of 1790 , that it constitutes a simple renunciation , and that the Americans ought to respect the rights which were previously recognized by Spain as existing in the English . " If we had now , " he adds , " to give an opinion upon this important question , we should , in spite of our sympathies for the United States , and our aversion against the aggressive system of the English , be compelled to acknowledge that reason and right are this time on their side . We are even astonished that , foregoing their habitual tenacity , they should have made , in the course of their negotiations , such large sacrifices to the Americans . " Every impartial and honorable mind must feel the reluctant justice of these observations , and acknowledge , as frankly as M. Mofras , that no title can be sustained through the Treaty of Florida . Conscious , no doubt , of this insuperable difficulty , America endeavors to make out her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida treaty-grounds which are so signally contradictory of each other , as to annihilate her claim altogether . For if her claim be rightful on any one of these grounds , it is untenable on the others , and vice versa ; and , as it is needless to insist upon an adherence to some clear principle in the conduct of such negotiations , we are content to submit these grounds , without a syllable of commentary , to the common sense of the world . She claims , first , through Gray 's discovery of the Colombia . If that claim be good , it vitiates at once all claim through the purchase of Louisiana from France , and through treaty with Spain ; for neither France nor Spain could confer upon America that which already belonged to America . She claims , next , through the purchase of Louisiana from France , which purchase rested upon a cession from Spain to France . If that claim be good , Spain must have ceded the Oregon territory to France , which she not only declared she had not done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously acquired that territory through Gray 's discovery . She next claims by virtue of occupancy in 1814 , although that occupancy was chiefly carried out by an English company , and was relinquished by a regular deed of sale . And she finally claims under the Florida treaty of 1819 , by cession from Spain . This is the title that stultifies all the rest . For if the treaty of 1819 be alleged as conferring any title , then the pretensions to a title arising from occupancy in 1814 must have been wholly without foundation . If , on the other hand , America relies upon her title of 1814 , she can not go to Spain for a title in 1819 . She is in this dilemma-either that her pretensions in 1814 were false , and that , consequently , the " occupation " of the Columbia by Great Britain was rightful , as against her ; oi that , claiming under the treaty of 1819 , her title is limited to the territory lying south of the British settlements on the Columbia , over which Spain could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America to extricate herself from this dilemma as creditably as she can . But it is sufficiently apparent that she must relinquish her claim altogether , or rest it upon some intelligible basis . She has hitherto resisted every approach to a candid and equitable adjustment with England . Mr. Canning and Mr. Huskisson proposed that a boundary line should be drawn westward along the forty-ninth parallel of latitude , from the Rocky Mountains to the north-easternmost branch of the Columbia river , and thence down the centre of the stream to the sea . This proposition was rejected . All negotiation , with a view to a moderate and amicable adjudication of the respective claims of England and the United States having failed , the convention of 1818 was renewed in 1827 , and the provisions , instead of being limited to ten years , were extended to an indefinite period , either party having the right , upon a year 's notice , to withdraw from the agreement . In this condition the question remains . The violent and unstatesmanlike declaration of Mr. Polk , in his inaugural address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion of Europe . He thought proper to launch upon the furious tide of the democratic passions which carried him into office a wilful mis-statement , couched in the most offensive language . The had taste and worse policy of that very foolish proceeding , must recoil upon himself . But we earnestly hope , for the sake of the paramount interests of peace and civilization , that the calmer judgment of the ministers by whom he is surrounded may avert the consequences from his country . He will have time to reflect in the interval before the next meeting of congress , and it is gratifying to observe that nearly the whole press of America in the mean while protests against his conduct . The bill for the occupation of Oregon comes before congress in December . We venture to predict that it will be thrown out ; simply because it can not be carried without involving the United States in a war with England ; and there are three sound reasons why America can not go to warshe has neither men , money , nor credit . NoAmerica will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is peace . Washington declared that the moment she committed herself to schemes of aggression and aggrandizement , her power was at an end . She can not extend her territory without the risk of weakening it . She has not enough of population as it is to defend the shores of the Atlantic in the event of hostilities : by what process of conjuration then can she undertake to occupy and defend territories remote from her own states and difficult of access If she got possession of Oregon to-morrow , she could not maintain it . Her sovereignty in that distant region could be preserved only by the presence of an imposing force , and by a chain of strong military outposts from the Missouri across the continent to the sea . How is she to 261 // organize this force How is she to supply this enormous machinery of defence1 Even if she could succeed in laying down such a plan of warlike preparations , she must still fail in securing a permanent occupation of the north-western coast , which , it is notorious , can only be reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cover her land force by a powerful naval armament . Where is she to get the means1 Overwhelmed with debts , and dragging her reputation as she is at a discount through the exchanges of the world , is she prepared to incur still greater odium and an impossible outlay We believe there is not a sensible man in America who does not denounce the Quixotic project which points at the hopeless occupation of Oregon . The British minister has solemnly announced that he is not only resolved but prepared to assert the rights of the British crown in the Oregon Territory . This is not an idle threat ; and it has been echoed back by the universal conviction of a country too well instructed in its own power , too confident in the integrity of its cause , and too well assured of the advantages of peace , to embark hastily in an expensive war . We have the means of vindicating our rights , and we will employ them should it become necessary . The mere addition to our naval estimates this year amounts to 1,000,0001. sterling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States  --  and our squadron in the Pacific under Admiral Seymour is a sufficient pledge of the sincerity of our intentions in that quarter . But we do not believe that America will submit the Oregon question to solution in the field of battle . She is not in a condition for such dangerous experiments , and , if she were , a dispassionate investigation of the case must finally satisfy her that the claim she sets up could be settled much more speedily , to her own honor and ultimate advantage , by peaceful arbitration . It is the interest of both countries to settle their claims amicably ; but it is chiefly the interest of America , for the experience of all history concurs in this warning-that when a subject in litigation between two powers is removed from the cabinet to the camp , it must be at the cost of the weaker party.
