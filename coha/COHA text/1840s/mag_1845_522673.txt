txt For several ages , the three questions most difficult of practical solution seem to have been , what shall I eat ? what shall I drink ? and , what shall I put on ? for man was originally made an eatinoand di inking being , and , as we all kn ow , he soon fell into a clothes-wearing being . In solving these problems , the energies of men , both physical and spiritual , were drawn out , to some extent , in united , harmonious development . The meeting of their lower wants required the exertion of their higher faculties . The hook , out of which they were obliged to read a livelihood , necessitated the birth , and growth , and constant exercise of thought . Fortunately , however , or unfortunately , for a considerable portion of mankind , modern invention has nearly or quite obviated this necessity . By the ingenuity of a few , the elements have been catight and tamed into our service . We have but to produce a little stamped paper , and say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fire , wind , and water , here , spin me this weed into clothes , or turn me this soil into foodcarry me to the other side of creation , or bring the other side of creation to me ,  - -  and they forthwith do it ; so that little or nothing is now left for our bodies to do , but eat , an ( I sleep , and digest . The mind , then , being no longer called upon to provide food for the body , has hut to keep the body in a condition to masticate and assimilate the food already provided . The three questions , therefore , which were once so hard of solution , are now answered at our hands ; and the question , what shall I read ? is taking their place . An accurate and adequate solution of this latter question is truly becoming difficult enough . Happily , however , most people , having their taste chiefly in the mouth , and their intellect chiefly in the stomach , and their conscience chiefly in the purse , find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the lightest and frothiest books of course float at the top , so that most people probably can not suit themseves better than by shutting their eyes , and taking the first they come at . Being no longer required to act as commissary for the stomach , the mind has only to dose ; and literature , urged on by need , and greed , and vainglory , is busy , turning wind into help for the mind in this arduous labor . Perhaps the two most prominent features in human nature are , love of sloth and dread of vacancy . These two things , so opposite and seemingly incompatible , the fashionable literature of the day is especially designed and fitted to reconcile . Our most popular books and booklets consist , for most part , of nothing but stimulants for the sensibility and soporifics for the intellect . Doubtless all are aware that our bodies , at certain intervals of time , are capable of certain agreeable sensations . What we most especially need , therefore , is something to help us kill the intervening periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ease the pains of vacancy without marring the repose of sloth , literature comes in , and annihilates these intervals of time for us , with its " sweet , oblivious antidotes " of thought . It seems manufactured on purpose to keep ennui away from disturbing the sleep of indolence . Its sovereign grace and glory are , that it can be read and understood in a state of intellectual yawning . Thus does the genius of popular literature , balancing itself on the two wings of frivolity and sentimentality , stand ready in every emergency , to waft our sleeping spirits sweetly and smoothly over from one agreeable sensation to another . But perhaps the virtues of this literature may be best seen in the social , or rather , gregarious intercourse of its students . Their ideal of sociality seems to be , a Mr. Doublet-and-hose , bowing , and smiling , and rattling his tongue at a Miss Scarf-and-pettycoat . A gentleman who can call the names and tell the additions of those present , describe the costume of the last novel , and , scrqwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed ! indeed , Ah is the very pink of social perfection ; people will almost run over each other to touch but the hem of his garment . Fashionable gallantry is little , if anything , but a complimentary flippancy to a pretty face , a fine fortune , a distinguished name , or a fashionable , animated dress . Nay , gentlemen of this // sort often appear to think society better adapted to their wants than reading . These walking digesters , and clothesframes may sometimes be heard intimating , plainly enough , that they can kill time rather more effectually in the company of ladies , than in the company of books . With their hearts full of themselves , and their heads full of nothing , they may well afford to honor others with such compliments . In this state of things , a few words on the subject of reading can not be regarded as out of place . All honest and judicious efforts to remand people to the well-nigh forgotten springs of intellectual life are surely deserving of indulgence , if not of encouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our friends , in the world of thinking and thoughtless , of faithful and faithless beings called books , are no very easy or trifling questions . To these questions , however , we shall now address ourselves to the best of our ability . Milton nobly says , " A good book is the life-blood of a master spirit , embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life . " It is , indeed , a treasury of the inextinguishable light and the inexpugnible strength of a human soulthe earthly immortality of God 's image , human reason . It is the eye , tongue , sword , which some hero and high priest of humanity bath bequeathed to us ; a portion of the indestructible patrimony which the Present inherits of the Past . There are none of us so poor , but " Books are ours , Within whose silent chambers treasure lies Preserved from age to age ; more precious far Than that accumulated store of gold And orient gems , which , for a day of need , The sultan hides deep iii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanities and frivolities of the giddy and trifling world ; when cheated and wounded in our heart 's holiest affections by the hollowness and heartlessness of worldly society ; there are none of us but may rejoice to know that " Books , Are a substantial world , both pure and good . Round these , with tendrils strong as flesh and blood , Our pastime and our happiness may grow . " In this so hollow , but solid-seeming world , good books are almost the only friends we can safely trust ; the only friends that are such , simply because they have the power to make us wiser , and better , amid happier by their society . Books , moreover , we mean genuine books , not mere shams , vanities , and vacua in books ' clothing , are about the only friends that will tell us the truth without either flattery or personality ; and with whom there is neither variableness nor shadow of turning ; so that , if they seem different at different times , we may know the change is in ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mind 's regard ; with them The future can not contradict the past ; Mortality 's last exercise and proot Is undergone ; the transit made , that shows The very soul . " Themselves translations from " that infinite , mysterious volume , whose author and writer is God , " we may always find in them a supply of what we ought most to desire , and a refuge from what we ought most to fear . But such books obviously are not the things to dream , or doze , or yawn over . In reading them , if our object be a worthy one , energy and vigilance of faculty are quite indispensable . A thing which we can read and comprehend , lying on our backs , in an intellectual snooze or snore , plainly has no use for us . Such things we call not books , but vacua in book 's clothing . To read them , is worse even than a waste of time ; for it generates at once the habit of wastng it , and the inability to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let us read to understand it , and be instructed by it ; if it have not , then it is no book , and belongs only to the fire or the paper-mill . If we must dream , let us at least be original about it ; let us go to sleep , and dream dreams of our own , and not merely doze , to re-dream the dreams of others . We are apt , indeed , to prize a hook according to the ease with which it is read . Scott , says one , is certainly an invaluable author ; he gives one so much without any effort . Why , I can read from cover to cover , and understand the whole perfectly , without the slightest labor ! Now , if this be not to " damn with faint praise , " we should like to know what is . Says another , Coleridge must be *n egregious dunce ! Why , to save my life , I ca n't understand him . What , has he no idea of what a book ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; hut he has no idea of writing such a thing as you call a book . He wrote to make you wiser , not to make you lazier , or himself richer . That he wrote to make you think , not to divert you from thinking , isthe very thing that makes him worth your reading , and the only thing that makes anyone worth your reading . For it is not the idleness with which we read , hut the very intensity of labor which our reading calls forth , that does us good . We are benefited not so much by the attainment , as by the earnest pursuit of truth . To think ourselves into error , is far better than to sleep ourselves into truth . If the Lord had designed we should be wise and happy without thought , he would have made us brutes , and done with it . The easy picking-up and pocketing of an author 's thoughts , is good for nothing but to help us along in intellectual foppery. it is the severe labor of thinking , producing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth of reading . An author enriches us , not so much by giving us his ideas , as by unfolding in us the same powers that originated them . Reading , in short , if it be truly such , and not a mere imparted mental drowsiness , involves a development of the same activities , and a voluntary reproduction of the same states of mind , of which the author was subject in writing . The divine light reading , which is deified so much , can serve no earthly purpose , but to make us light-headed ; the more we take of it , the emptier shall we assuredly become . Flour may indeed be baked and eaten without much labor , but will not grow ; and seed-wheat will produce nothing without patient toil and tillage . Knowest thou not , that the bread which thou eatest without the sweat of thy brow , can be no hread to thee ? Why , it will turn into poison , and kill you with the gout , or the apoplexy , or some such disease . Would exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuredly all good reading is hard work ; nay it is good chiefly because it is hard , plucking our laziness by the nose , in order to give us health and strength . if an author do anything but revive our old thoughts in a new dress , assuredly we must work to IblIow him ; and if that be all he does , why not let him Alone and cultivate a few sprouts of our own ? That the literature in question is uttery worthless , is proven by the fact , that it keeps people constantly eating , without ever feeding them. - While their hunger and thirst of soul remain unsatisfied , they keep crying , give , give , ignorant that they are starving from a defect in the quality , not in the quantity of their food . They ask for bread and literature gives them wind ; nevertheless , they down with whatever comes to them , thinking their hunger continues because they have not enough , not because they have mere wind . They may cry , peace , peace , as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , till they have some work . Such , at least , is our hope . He who truly reads a few genuine books , a few " books that are books , " will spend much of his time in thinking ; he who is too lazy to think at all , will probably spend all of his time in reading . We can digest wind much easier than bacon . But reading without thought , had as it is , is little if any worse than reading with too much thought , People often defeat their own efforts , by reading to give rather than get instruction . In the words of Goethe , they undertake to oversee an author , before they get to see him . Sterne very naturally wished for a reader who , yielding up the reins of his faculties into the hands of his author , would be content to be pleased , he knew not why and cared not wherefore . A compliance with this wish would no doubt be as beneficial to readers , as satisfactory to authors . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows more of what he is wiiting about than we do . if an author be truly worth the reading , it will belong enough before we get to see him ; and when we get competent to oversee him , it would really seem hardly worth our while to trouble our heads about him . All true books are but spectacles to read nature with ; and all true readers employ these , to look through , not to look at . If we can not look through them , then they are not spectacles to us , but only gewgaws ; and what is the use of playing with them , and looking at them , and criticizing them ? Moreover , it is not by speaking this truth or that truth , our truth or your truth , but by simply speaking truth , what is true to him , that a man shames the devil . The devil himself sometimes tells truth ; but he does it hypocritically , and therefore is only the more devilish for telling it . it is an author 's business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect our own ; to be our teacher , not our looking-glass . The genuineness of his writings consists in their truth to Nature // as she appears to him ; and should he attempt to look through our eyes , and speak with our tongues , he would do nothing hut lie . All those authors and politicians who speak only to please the people , who are always listening to catch the popular breeze , and trying to look through the people 's eyes , and make themselves the weathercocks of public opinion , are nothing hut literary and political liars , if an author 's vision serve to correct or extend our own , let us use it , and trust it , and he thankful for it ; if it do not , let us throw it away , and use our own , or seek one that will . Whether he reports truly of things as they appear from his point of view , can be known , only by placing ourselves in the same point ; and a disposition to quarrel with him affords presumptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But perhaps a still greater difficulty with many people , in reading , is , a redundancy of conscience . They seem afflicted with a shrinking moral apprehensiveness , which is always multiplying and magnifying the objects of moral censure , and blinding them to every thing hut the sources of moral danger . It is as if one , from fear of drowning , should avoid the water until he had learnt to swin . One would really think it were hetrer to he drowned , and done with it , than thus to die of hydrophohia . Now , a good conscience is undoubtedly the brightest jexvel in the crown of our humanity ; hut a good quality and a great quantity of conscience are by no means convertible terms . We hayesoinetimes known , and often heard of people who seemed constantly struggling to become all conscience ; and whose moral censures were so abundant , that one had need to transform himself altogether into a pair of moral ears , to keep pace with them . This , then , is what we mean by redundancy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so afflicted with a sort of prurient anxiety to frown , that they were perpetually converting innocent trifles into huge vices , that they might have objects enough to frown upon ; and which , in the absence of other objects , would spend whole years in frowning upon abstract ideas . As might be expected , people of such consciences usually think very much of their own virtue . So choice of it are they , indeed , that they seldom go out without wiapping it up in their great conscience-blanket , against the follies and vices they expect to find . They seem aware , in snort , that their virtue is of the more delicate , fragile kind , and very naturally regard a sort of conscience-crust as its only adequate protection from the inclemencies of the moral atmospheres around them . But this is not all . A great conscience naturally values itself , and seeks to he valued chiefly for its abundance , its display ; a good conscience does not value itself or seek to he valued at all . Moreover , a very small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plainly enough to cognize and correct one 's own faults ; hut one obviously needs a very large conscience to cognize and correct the faults of all ahout him . And besides , unless a man he altogether hollow , it must perforce take much more to cover than to line him ; an outward conscience , therefore , must he much larger than an inward one . I-fence it is , doubtless , that the sort and size , the quality and the quantity of any given conscience , are so generally found to be in inverse proportion to each other . But seriously : it is a great mistake , to suppose that the growth and health of our virtue are best promoted by encasing it in a conscience-crust . It were surely a poor remedy for a disease or weakness of the lungs , to confine the patient under an exhausted receiver . On the whole , breathing machines may as well be dispensed with , when they get to stopping the breath . One would really think our virtue hardly worth the saving , if " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped up in a great-coat of precaution against the sunshine and the breeze . " We had best give it an occasional airing , even though we thereby run a little risk of exposure . A morality without eyes may , indeed , be exempt from the allurements of the eye ; but then it must also lose the divine splendors that exist for its vision . Moreover , a disposition to pass moral judgment on every thing we see , is fa , from indicating a sound and vigorous mc rality . It rather indicates a species o moral coxcombry , that is always tryin* to find or make occasions to display itself To forget , occasionally , that we are moro beings , is , after all , the best proof that w. are so . It is far better to strengthen th. moral sense by keeping it within its na tural sphere , than to waste its energic by multiplying and magnifying its object If we expend it too freely on all occasions perhaps we may not have enough left fc occasions that really require it . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from meeting one day , encountered a man lying drunk in the road . Upon the man 's desiring to get up into the wagon , and ride to some house , the good deacon bawled out , so loud the neighbors might hear him , that he would not defile his wagon with such a creature . We thought the deacon must be a saint , sure enough , then ; but we have since compared his conduct with that of a certain rough-voiced old gentleman who , finding a wretched daughter of vice fallen down in the street , forgetting every thing but her present distress , took her up in his arms , carried her into his house , and nursed her into health . Even virtue and vice themselves should not always be contemplated through conscientious eyes ; we need to view them not with the conscience only , but with the whole mind and heart ; for vice is mean as well as wrong , and virtue is beautiful as well as right ; and we may be so engrossed in viewing them simply as right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scorn , and no beauty in virtue to love . But above all , if we would have a good conscience and a pure , we must not think to wear it on the outside for the benefit of others , hut keep it within for the benefit of ourselves ; and we may be assured , that the more it is worth to ourselves , the less shall we be disposed to show it to others . Let us not imagine , then , that we can transfer it to the outside , and convert it into an outlooking , argus-eyed envelopment , without spoiling it ; for it will thereby become mere cloth , and hide our outward , only to betray our inward , nakedness . Doubtless many of our readers are aware , that in the Greek Mythology , Hercules was the impersonation of moral energy . The fable of his life and adventures is replete with the finest illustration of the growth and development of moral heroism . Perhaps nothing can surpass the truth and beauty of the fiction which represents him as strangling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It is even so with us all . Serpents come to us in our cradles , ' and we must destroy them there , or be destroyed by them . We should be taught in our youth to fear nothing but doing wrong ; to face down evil , not to flee from it ; to crush the serpents , not to run from them ; and to possess our safety in ourselves , not in ourcondition . If nothing less than Hercules , the boy , could have strangled serpents in the cradle , nothing less than the strangling of them there could have made Hercules , the man . The truth is , there is neither safety nor sense in bandaging our eyes and corking our ears , to the shows and persuasions of vice and falsehood . We must be taught to know both good and evil ; to meet them both , face to face ; to see into , and see through them both ; to recognize and cleave to the former in spite of all her seventies and self-denials ; and to detect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blandishments and captivations . We do not , we can not become truly virtuous , except by disciplining ourselves into that force , and purity , and perspicacity of soul , in whose presence vice and falsehood lose all their attractions , and sink into impotence and insignificance before the immortal and irresistible beauty of truth and virtue -- as the false Florimel , of Spenser 's Fairy Queen , faded and vanished into nothing , beside that heavenly Beauty whose form and features she had stolen , to deceive and betray . It is true , we are taught to pray , " lead us not into temptation ; " but we are not taught to pray , lead us away from temptation : and it would seem the dictate of common sense , that , if we would learn to swim , it were best neither to shun the water altogether , nor to plunge into the torrent of Niagara . In short , our truest benefactor is , not he who keeps us entirely away from temptation , or keeps temptation entirely away from us ; but he who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . A Shakespeare , who , carrying us through scenes of vice , still keeps our feelings and judgment on the side of virtue , is a far better teacher of morals , than one who , with fastidious precaution , leaves no room for feeling or judgment of any kind whatever . Of the proper materials of reading , much might be said ; far more , indeed , than we have time or strength to say , or our readers have patience or need to hear . On the immense , chaotic wilderness of books , of course , but general remarks can be made ; and the defect of such remarks is , that they necessarily leave out of view the wants and capacities of individual minds . As there are many books fit for none , so there are few books fit for all . What will create in one place , may destroy in another ; what were a crushing burden to this mind , may be but healthful exercise to that ; what were a healthful exercise to that may be but enfeebling indolence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books that will impart life and strength to all for it is alike useless to read what is above and what is below the vigorous exercise of our powers . Some general remarks , however , we will try to give ; the choice of particular books , must , of course , be left to individual readers . And with a worthy object in view , and with a firm conviction that " light which leads astray can not be light from heaven , " readers may be safely enough left to themselves . Without these , indeed , the most studied and judicious selection would be made in vain . But there is a preliminary consideration , to which , both for its difficulty and its importance , we would first invite especial attention . It is this : that different hooks are often the production of different faculties , or different combinations of I*culties , and therefore addressed to different powers . In the poetry of Byron , for example , one activity may be predominant ; in that of Wordsworth , another ; in that of Southey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XVordsworth neither beauty nor meaning , it follows , not that he is a dunce , nor that we are a dunce , but simply that the activity , to which he speaks , is yet undeveloped within us . It is not , perhaps , that we want the degree , but that we want the kind , of development necessary to understand and enjoy him . Again : two authors , Webster and Burke , for example , may have certain qualities in common ; nay , in Webster these qualities may exist in much the greater degree ; but with these common qualities Burke may join other qualities , different , and even superior , in kind . If , then , a man have faculties developed only for these common qualities , he will , of course , prefer Webster to Burke ; if he have faculties developed for all Burke 's qualities , he may greatly prefer him to Webster ; and if he have faculties only for Burke 's peculiar qualities , he may take him with enthusiasm and reject Webster altogether . Once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single quality in common . Now , we may understand , and may therefore greatly prefer Coleridge ; another man may understand , and greatly prefer Dr. Paley . But does this prove that we are superior to him ? By no means ; it proves neither that we are superior , nor that we are inferior to him , but only that we are different from him . Nay , he may greatly surpass us in degree of development , only he lacks the particular kind of development required by the work in question ; and hence , though , perhaps , inferior to him , on the whole , we may be able to understrnd what he does not and can not understand . Now , to say nothing of want of modesty , it would really seem uncourteous and uncandid for him to call our author a dunce for being unintelligible to him , and us unfortunate dupes for loving him . Nevertheless , he sneeringly says to us , Sir , I do nt understand this passage : come , explain ; tell me what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he says . You ask us to tell you in what other form you already know his meaning ; but the truth is , you do not know it at all , in this , or any other form whatever . You ask us to teach you through one faculty what is addressed to an altogether different faculty ; a faculty yet undeveloped within you ; develope yourself , sir , and then , perhaps , you will not need an explanation . But the fact is , some minds , by confining themselves to a certain round of ideas , contract so fixed a bias , become so hardened into a particular shape , that it seems impossible to develope them into any other shape at all . The growth of some faculties becomes so large , as to prevent the vegetation of other faculties . The understanding , for example , comes to cast so broad and thick a shade , that imagination is forced to slumber on in the germ . But , says our worthy friend , I understand and admire Shakspeare ; and you admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ; but we have a word more to say , touching this thing . Now , in Shakspeare , all the faculties appear , working harmoniously and simultaneously together , freely interchanging their functions and l ) rovinces . In the words of Hazlitt , " he was just like any other man , but that he was like all other men . " His mind , as bath been said , was the very sphere of humanity ; ubiquity and omniformity were its distinctive attributes . None of us can speak at all , without using some portion of his Ianguag* and therefore whenever he speaks , we are obliged to understand something of what he says . With an understanding that traverses the earth , he joins an imagination that traverses the heavens . With a gentleness that echoes the tenderest note of affection , he unites a strength that might have governed the mightiest states . He speaks alike to all the faculties ; hence all , who have any faculties whatever , un ( lerstand // enough to enjoy him . Touching all the strings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must perforce vibrate to some of his sounds . Hence it is , that so many relish , without beginning to appreciate him . He brings us flowers and fragrances from every torest and garden in creation ; so that if we have ever been in forest or garden at all , we can not but recognize some among his flowers , that have been wont to breathe and smile on ourselves . All , of course , know and love the specimens from their own fields and gardens ; but that boundless collection , from climes they have never visited , they know not , nor do they stop to examine . The apt figures , fine sentiments , pithy aphorisms , and graceful expressions , which he has in common with many others , they understand well enough ; but these are only the dress and drapery which he throws over excellencies of a far deeper and rarer kind . He is , indeed , a good intellectual tailor ; but Sir Walter Scott is nearly , or quite as good a tailor as he : and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is , " that Shakspeare begins at the heart of a subject , and works outwards towards the surface ; while Scott begins at the surface , and works inwards , but never gets at the heart of it at all . Many others , indeed , have made nearly as good surfaces as Shakspeare ; and those who are fond of fine clothes , and never look any deeper than dress , though unable to see any such wonderful difference between him and others , will doubtless find something in him to admire . Hence it is , that many people , with a profusion of Shakspeare 's words , and figures , and phrases on their tongues , fancy they know all about him ; while , in fact , they have not the first idea , either of his individual conceptions or of his dramatic combinations of character ; and yet , it is on these very points that he is most distinguished from and above all other men that have ever written . " To return ; it is not of individual books , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . And the first classification that we shall propose is , into works of genius , and works of talent . The distinction between these two forms of mind , though readily enough admitted by the common sense of mankind , is by no means easily explained . The difference between their productions is , indeed , too great and too obvious , not to be im 489 mediately felt , and is seen to be inexplicable , except by supposing a corresponding difference in the productive powers . But to analyze these powers ; to ascertain their respective elements ; and to draw a mutually exclusive line of distinction between them ; - is a task which few have the ability or the inclination to perform . Great and obvious , however , as is this distinction , we have often heard it treated with derision , backed up by a sort of triumphant call for its explanation . The truth is , there are some people , whose faith is only in things that are seen , and to whom a clear and complete explanation is the only rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to give such an explanation . To such people , therefore , we have nothing to say . So small , in fact , is the amount of our demonstrative knowledge , that we are strongly inclined to make up the deficiency , in part , by believing some things which we can not fully prove . We do freely acknowledge , that the things which we see force upon us a belief in something unseen ; and we are so credulous as to admit the reality of many things which we can not explain . If others , by denying the existence of anything beyond the scope of their vision , have convinced themselves that they know everything , they are certainly quite welcome to enjoy their conviction . But , for ourselves , though we can assert , with some confidence , the reality of what we see , we can not so confidently deny the reality of many things which we have not seen , but of which we have been assured by those whose eyes seem quite as good as our own . Nor can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are some things which we do not know , but are desirous to learn , we have yet room for improvement ; and we must think that an effort to learn them is better than to console ourselves with the assurance that they do not exist . But how difficult soever it may be to explain the distinction between the powers of Milton and Locke , for example , it were surely absurd to refer Paradise Lost and Essay on the Understanding to the agency of the same power . To class the logical concatenations of the one with the living , breathing pages of the other , were nearly or quite as unphilosophical as to refer the actions of a man and a brute to the same constitution of nature . Such an attempt , however plausible in // theory , would at once be defeated by that surest test of all our theories , the common sense and common feeling of mankind . For if few can explain the difference between those powers , none can account for such different results from the same rower ; and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more philosophical than to refer such different productions to the same origin ; for if the one be , frankly to confess our ignorance , the other were , boldly to maintain an absurdity . But hard of explanation as is this difference in respect of the powers themselves , it is easily discerned and traced in their respective works ; and it is probably by tracing it there , that the superiority of works of genius , for all the higher ends of reading , may be best shown . What , then , it may be asked , is it that has given Bunyan and Burns , untaught and unlearned as they were , such a resistless influence over the minds of men ? an influence which Locke and Read , with all their learning and speculative subtilty , could never hope to attain . They approach us with but a whisper , a tale , or a song ; and yet , in one minute , they finish a work which a whole host of logical artillerymen , with the labor of years , could not begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with the least stroke of his pen , awakens a chord within us which all the learning and logic in the world could never reach ? He comes to us , not as our sovereign , to exact our allegiance , but as our smiling brother ; and yet he seats himself on the throne of our souls , and holds our hearts in willing and cheerful submission to his power . Undisciplined and uninstructed as he was , the least sound of his voice teaches us a lesson which Johnson , with all his erudition , his logical acumen , and grandiloquent diction , might have labored forever in vain to teach . Why is it that the rapt Milton , with one sweep of his awful lyre , or one motion of his singing robes , raises us to a height which all the scientific and argumentative ladder-makers in creation could never enable us to reach ? or that the calm , pensive Wordsworth , with one note of his Orphean harp , or one breath of his moral minstrelsy , moves us to a purity and intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never awaken ? We answer , it is the possession of a mysterious something , which others have not , and can not obtain ; whose power and excellence we can all feel , but whose nature we can not explain . This mysterious something , which works within us with such secret , but resistless energy , like some spiritual electricity or magnetism , has been baptized into the name of Genius ; and is no other than , " the vision and the faculty divine ; " the power to " Add the gleam , The light that never was on sea or land , The consecration and the poet 's dream . " It is not to be had for study , nor for price ; a man may be familiar with all science , as with household words , and yet not have this unacquirable and incommunicable knowledge ; he may sport with all languages , as with his mothertongue , and yet know nothing of this universal language , which reaches every mind , and leads captive every heart . Take all the men of mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melt them down into one intellectual mountain-building , star-grasping giant , and still it is not in him . He may open upon us his batteries of logic and argument in vain : he may carry all the outposts and spike all the guns of the understanding , by storm ; but he can not move the heart or the will ; and yet but a whisper from one of these marvellous soul-touchers , in whom dwells a portion of this wonderful gift , and he leads us whithersoever he lists . One important distinction between talent and genius is , that talent gives us information of the objects and agencies that exist and act around us ; genius calls up and draws out what is within us ; gives life and reality to the slumbering possibilities of our being . The man of genius does not try to tell us wherein life , and thought , and feeling , and action consist , but causes us to live , and think , and feel , and act . He does not tell us how , or why , or what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mouths , and a feeling into our hearts . He does not speak of our nature , but to our nature ; and it is his triumph so to speak that the answer can not be withheld . Instead of doing up our thinking and feeling for us , he simply sets us to thinking and feeling for ourselves-The man of talent triumphs over us in the superiority of his own power ; the man of genius causes us to triumph in the new power he awakens within us . The mere reasoning moralist may convince us , by the force of his logic , of the duty or advantage of kindness and // brotherly love ; but this is all he can do . Meanwhile , there comes along a Wordsworth or a Burns , and , with " one touch of nature , makes the whole world kin . " Talent , in short , informs , genius inspires Us ; the former speaks to us about truth , the latter speaks truth into us , and makes truth speak out of us . Jt is the striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it finds or creates itself in all who come within its reach . The man of talent can only impart us his knowledge ; he can not impart us his power , or himself ; he may act upon us as an external force , but can call up no ally within . But the man of genius transforms us , for the time , into what he is himself ; there is enchantment in his words ,  --  a spell-like power , that makes the listener to become a genius too . While he is speaking , we ourselves can speak as well as he ; but the moment he leaves us , why , " Richard is himself again . " What he teaches us seems but a revival of what we have always known-as if we had learned it in a previous state of being ; and we wonder that truths once so familiar , and now so precious , should have been so long forgotten . But there are other points of distinction equally decisive . Talent proves ; genius reveals : the former speaks to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only marshals what it finds without into the service and support of a given proposition ; it brings all its evidence from external sources . Genius needs no evidence to authenticate its words , but what it creates in the tribunal to which it appeals . The message it has to deliver but sleeps within us , and starts up at the sound of its voice . it gives only what it finds in us , but what we could never find without its help . Talent , then , is like a mirror , which only collects and transfers the light it receives from other sources ; genius is like the sun , which pours forth light as from a fountain , at once revealin* itself and the objects on which it shines . With talent , moreover , the mind works in but one of its faculties or activities at once . The head and heart will not beat time together ; one of them is always pulling the other under ; the subject stops feeling as soon as he begins to think , or stops thinking as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrow a figure , he is either like the moon , all light and no heat , or like a stove , all heat and no light . But with genius the head and the heart are always acting in 491 concert and reciprocity . The perceptive , reflective , creative , and sensitive faculties interpenetrate each other , so that all work in each , and each works in all . The subject , therefore , gives us truth , beauty , thought , passion , all in a state of interfusion . Every word he utters is the result of his whole mind , and brings contributions from its inmost depths ; as every leaf or blossom is the product and expression of all the powers and elements that enter into the tree . In short , talent is like a prism , to break and scatter the rays of truth into cold , elementary colors ; genius is like a lens , to gather and concentrate them all into a colorless , burning whole . Again : talent combines ; genius creates . The utmost that mere talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a given purpose . To arrange and modify the materials it already has , and adapt them to specific ends , is all it can do ; it can not add a single new element to what it has received . Its processes and results are altogether mechanical ; with vital powers it has nothing to do : and lifeless mechanism , more or less perfect , is the highest production in its power . The productions of genius , on the contrary , are organic . It works , not as a skillful mechanic , in the combination and arrangement of parts , but as nature works in the evolution and embodiment of vital , animating principles . Talent may bring matter , and color , and form together into an artificial flower , or thoughts , images , and numbers together into verse ; but with genius , the germ sprouts forth , and buds , and blossoms out into a breathing flower , or thoughts , images and numbers grow up together into poetry . Talent may arrange the form , compact the joints , and adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifeless automaton ; the living principle is wanting-an element which the mere combining power can never supply ; it is , indeed , a mere machine , incapable of life or motion , except by the application of external force . Genius proceeds by a natural growth , from a living germ ; it begins with a vital principle which , by virtue of its innate assimilative power , shapes itself a body from surrounding materials , and clothes it with beauty and life . The human body , for example , is obviously but a combination of materials that have always existed ; it is but old matter organized into a new form : but the invisible builder and inhabitant of this form is an absolute creation  --  a perfectly // original existence , from whose individuality the very idea of combination is necessarily excluded , it is in this sense that genius creates . Its productions are to those of talent , what a genuine living tree is to the manufactured appearance of a tree . In the visible form both may , indeed , be alike ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and therefore can do , can produce nothing ; in short , it is nothing , but only seems : the other contains a living , creative power , which produces leaves , and blossoms , and fruits , and finally reproduces itself in the seeds which it drops ; for every seed is a perfect tree mysteriously slumbering in the rudiments , and , if it find a fit soil , will spring up , and produce like its parent tree . It is in this sense , too , that genius is truly said not only to be creative , but to give forth creative ideas ; for its ideas are perfect germs , containing in miniature all the elements of the mind from which they sprung ; and , if they fall in a genial soil , will vegetate , and grow up into the beauty and fruitfulness of the parent mind . Nor is it , on this ground , at all difficult to account for the variety of forms in which genius manifests itself . For while genius is inexhaustible in vital powers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether , then , genius appears , as in Shakspeare , " passing , like a protean spirit , into all the forms of character and passion ; " or , as in Milton , " drawing all things into itself , and melting them down into the unity of its own ideal ; " or , as in Burns , " sighing over the rathe primrose that forsaken dies , " and " changing the vulgar wind , as it passes , into articulate melody ; " or , as in Wordsworth , diffusing through all things the breath of a sensitive moral existence , and penetratingthem with its own warmth and radiance : - it is still the same divinity of intellect , enshrined in various forms , for the instruction and up-building of our common humanity . But again ; with talent the ends are always apart from and beyond the means . it reaches its objects only by the indirect , roundabout process of logic and contrivance . But with genius , the ends and means , though distinct in idea , are not separate or separable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same process , so that the attainment of the end is always involved in the use of the means . Genius is to truth and beauty , what true piety is to religion . Those who only perform the visible and audible service of religion , to secure a certain reward , are not truly pious . They but employ religion as a means to compass the ends of sell-love . They are lovers of salvation , not lovers of the Saviour . They do not so much serve Religion , as serve themselves of her . But with the truly pious man , religion is both the means and the end of his service ; his object is , not the reward of religion , but simply the life of religion itself . It is not the prospective offers of religion , hut the being religious , that makes his heaven . True piety is not the road to happiness ; it is happiness . Going to heaven implies , not a change of place , but a change of mind and heart ; so that we get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven into us . With genius , in like manner , truth and beauty are at once the means and the end of its action ; at once the light that reveals and the object revealed . The process of genial production is , for the time , a continued adoration of the Beautiful and the True . Genius does not pursue truth and beauty , as external objects to be reached by intermediate means , hut lives , and moves , and has its being in them ; and its productions are but the expression , the very pulse and breath of that life . And finally ; genius works notlogically , but imaginatively ; not by calculation , but by inspiration . The man of genius does not govern his subject , but is governed by it ; he does not lay hold of it , to move and direct its development , but so thinks himself into it , or thinks it into himself , that it comes to move and direct him . So far , therefore , as genius acts in accordance with its nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward calls , but from a vital impulse within ; it acts simply because activity is the element of its existence , the very utterance of its life , it produces , simply because , when wedded to this goodly universe in love and holy passion , it is its nature to produce . The cup of its emotions runneth over of its own accord ; and the contents lose all their virtue the moment it attempts to pour them out for pudding , or for praise . Its music , springing up unbidden within itself , is not drawn forth as the price of gain or applause , but simply exhaled as the breath of its soul ; is not brought out , but warbles itself out , into expression , because it can not keep still . In short , genius is , so to speak , a mysteriously-constructed harp , whose strings are so instinct with // 493 life , and so redundant of melody , that they tremble into eloquence of their own accord , without waiting for the fingers of outward motives to play them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence without , that moves them to utterance . There are two living authors , both excellent , indeed , in their kind , but with scarce a single quality in common , who offer so apt an illustration of the difference between talent and genius , that we probably can not do better than refer to them . They are best known by several volumes of critical and biographical Essays . As might he expected , the greater ofthein is the least popular of the two . We allude to Thomas B. Macauley , and Thomas Carlyle ; the former a man of consummate talent , the latter a man of hi* h , though not the highest , genius . Both are elninently original ; Macauley in the dress and torin of his works , Carlyle in the soul and substance of them . Macauley 's Essays are like finished pieces of furniture , elegant hut lifeless ; Carlyle 's are like crooked , scraggy trees , ugly , but full of life . The former gives the reader his thoughts in the most polished style ; the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Macauley always means just what meets the ear . His pages are illuminated by a perfect blaze of light ; so much so , indeed , that they sometimes rather dazzle than assistthe vision , illustration after illustration comes pouring in upon us from the four corners of creation , all equally pertinent , all equally perspicuous . No one can possibly miss , or mistake , his meaning . Every sentence is understood and exhausted as soon as its words are uttered . Periods hurry on and hurry off in breathless succession . One of his Essays , in short , is like a fine Macadam turnpike , perfectly straight and perfectly smooth , so that the reader rushes through from beginning to end in a perfect intellectual gallop . Carlyle , on the other hand , always means much more than meets the ear . His pages are deep , sometimes mysterious , inexhaustible . Often , however , amid surrounding darkness , some winged word unseals a fountain of light in the reader 's mind , which kindles the page before him into more than noonday brightness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a labyrinth of meaning , and then leaves him to trace its windings , and explore its riches at his leisure . In short , one of his Essays is like a natural road , winding through vallies and among mountains ; sometimes passing in sight of magnificent groves and grottoes , where the traveler can not choose but turn aside , and linger , and forget both journey and guide in the wonderful beauty and strangeness of the scenery about him.  - -  - Macauley 's flowers are all culled , and picked , and tied into finished bunches with inimitable art ; their very sweetness is increased by the crushing of their innocent lives , and the coming on of untimely decay ; and the beholder 's thoughts stop at the perfectioa of their ordering , or the surprising skill that ordered them thus . Carlyle 's flowers appear scattered here and there , smiling out from the place of their birth , and enjoying  --  the air they breathe , as they nestle in their mother 's waim bosom ; and draw the beholder 's thoughts away from their forms down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loveliness , and happiness from the senseless soil at their feet. - Macauley takes the reader out into some precise , definite field of thought , and leads him round , and shows him its riches , one by one , and tells him their names , and unfolds their properties , that he may lay them up on some shelf in his memory , and keep them for use , as occasion may require . Carlyle , by some strange motion of his spirit , opens the door into a boundless prospect , stretching away through clouds and sunshine , into dimness and invisibility ,  --  a perfect wilderness of thought , ever widening upon the beholder 's view , and even where the horizon bounds his vision , inviting his imagination to traverse the infinite regions that lie beyond . With Macauley , therefore , we are benefitted only by what we receive ; with Carlyle , we are beiiefitted chiefly by what we give : and that it is more blessed to give than to receive , is quite as true in intellect as it is in morals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest intellectual recommendation that a book can bring . But there are other circumstances which may do much to guide us in the choice of hooks . As a general thing , age may he safely pronounced a decisive proof of excellence . The longer a hook has lived , the more evidence it brings of having been born for immortality . And besides , the world , we suspect , has known periods more favorable than the present to the growth of excellence . Men once wrote because they had something which they wanted to say ; men now seek for something to say , because // they want to write . We can not wait for our brains to grow , because of our haste to coin them into books . Moreover , men once wrote for immortality , and therefore wrote to the wise and good , knowing that they alone had immortality to bestow ; but , now-a-days , men write chiefly for money , and they know well enough , that knaves and dunces have money to give quite as often as any others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work , and people could afford time for no reading hut such as would tend to make them wiser and better ; and hence authors crowded as much matter into as little space as possible . But now , since human life has become but an idle jest or farce , and people read only*to have their brains tickled and time killed , or because they can not sleep , authors of course spread as little matter over as much space as possible . And finally , men were sometime content to cast their gifts silently into the ocean of time , hoping , perhaps , that they might return after many days to elevate and bless a future age . Writing for all coming time , they of course sought to dip their pens in the colors of eternal truth , and baptise their oiThpring in the spirit of eternal beauty . Their works , therefore , appeal to the universal mind and heart of man , and are , in a greater or less degree , transcripts of universal humanity . But now it is rare for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puddle of popular favor , that they may quickly return to flatter or feed himself . Writing only for the pudding or puffery of the time , he of course adopts the language of the time , and shapes his wares to suit the dullness of those whose custom he seeks . His writings , therefore , are but a transcript of the fashions and follies of the age ; they are truly nothing , like their originals , and speedily sink , along with those originals , into their essential nonentity while the vapor-hag , upon which he sits at noon , perched aloft in conspicuous littleness , collapses , perchance , into a winding sheet for him , as soon as the cool of evening visits it . But does any one say , he dare trust his own judgment , and follow his own taste ? Most assuredly , then , neither his taste nor his judgment is worth a straw ; for if it were , it would tell him at once that time is a far better test of excellence , than any faculties lie can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what is on a level with ourselves , that immediately takes our ap proval , and marches off with our purse . A shallow , pretentious man , touching but the surface of the mind , acts quickly and noisily , but effects nothing ; a genuine thinker , striking at the depths of the mind , acts slowly and silently , but does up the work . He , who would raise us , must first get above us , himself ; and before he can exalt us to a just appreciation and remuneration of his gifts , he will have gone to a richer and purer reward than we can bestow . The visits of the gods , we read , were never known till after their departure . While they are with us , our " eyes are holden , " that we can not see them ; and when they have opened our eyes their mission to us is discharged . He who has any true culture at all , can not but know there is a height which he hath not reached ; a glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hath not felt ; and he will choose rather to visit the light , even though his ignorance should be put to shame , than to skulk in the dark , and fatten his pride by " sucking the paws of his own self-importance . " But there are other weighty reasons for cultivating an acquaintance with the literature of the past . if the present be the element in which we must live , and the material with which we must work , it would seem quite indispensable that we should know the present . But we can truly know the present only by studying the past ; for " the present was born of the past . " It was there that its infancy was nursed ; that the foundations of its being were laid ; and it is there , and there alone , that we can trace its pedigree and test its legitimacy-that we can study its actual developments in their rudiments and first principles . Now , the literature of an age unquestionably reveals its highest law , and affords the truest exponent of its manifold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very abstract and epitome of its manycolored , thousand-souled being . Every great author is , to some extent , a synoptical expression of his age ; his mind is the concentrated essence of the innumerable minds that make up its character . He is , therefore , its true spiritual plenipotentiary-the heaven-selected organ , through whom it gets its fullest and faithfulest representation . Most people seem to think it the business of history to teach us all that can or need be known of the past ; but the truth is , history could not do it , if she would ; for what is history , // 495 what can she be , hut one age speaking about another age ? But the literature of an age is the age itself , speaking for itself , and telling the tale of its own life ; it is therefore a genuine autobiography of the age-au autobiography , too , that is always authentic , even when it lies ; for it thereby discloses at least the fact of its own mendacity . If , then , we would truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past ; and if we would truly know the past , we must study it in its literature . Edmund Spenser and rare old Ben Johnson will undoubtedly give us more real insight into the Elizabethan age , than all the flumes that ever have written , or ever will write . Of the manifold attractions , too , that cluster around old authors , we can not choose hut say a few words . It is constantly manifest that they wrote , not from mere memory or hearsay , hut from inspection and actual vision . It is from the very mines they have themselves labored in , that they bring their contributions ; and their intensity of thought has penetrated their gifts with the effluence of their own souls . It is this ineffable charm of sincerity , this spirit-stirring earnestness of mind  --  a quality so rare , and yet so priceless-that forms their crowning beauty and worth . This quality is especially characteristic of the old English poets , imparting a manly vigor and truthfulness to their pages . They seem always trying how much truth they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write ; and therefore give us something better than mere lip-blossoms and ruffle-bosoms . From most of modern poems , we should naturally infer poetry to be but a sort of unspoken and unspeakable language done into verse ; it would hardly occur to us that anything deeper than a finished euphonious tongue could be concerned in its production . Finding but the tritest meaning , or the vapidest no-meaning , disguised in the most far-fetched words and figures , and thus embroidered out into seeming dignity , we get to think that profound and original thought has no fellowship with poetry . But in the elder poets we everywhere meet with the most original , sometimes even farfetched thoughts , clothed in the simplest and commonest language ; and we find , to our surprise perhaps , that poetry may be most deeply and beautifully true , without ceasing to be most truly and beautifully poetical . They had not learned to drive verse-making as a trade - those old poets-heaven bless them ! With them poetry was the noblest utterance of humanity , and for the noblest ends ; not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simp*ici*y , and sincerity , they seem to have written from the irrepressible strugglings of thought and feeling within them . No windy mouthings , no counterfeits of emotion , no apings of passion , no maudlin sentimentalities , no starched and crimped frivolities , no vapid truisms wrapped up in bombastic novelty , are here ; they had thought deeply and felt strongly , and their poetry is the simple and natural expression of what had sprung up within them ; nay , they seem to have written poetry because they could not help it , and because that is the form into which deep feeling and deep thought spontaneously shape themselves . They had communed deeply and silently with the divine beauty and soul of things ; and their poetry seems to have risen up ininsensibly , like the fragrance of dewsprinkled flowers , or like " new-born music from the fields of sleep . " They had studied the great permanent features of the human heart ; they had conversed with nature in her loveliest and sublimest forms , and their minds mirrored forth , with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transpirations . If they were wild and irregular , it was because nature is so ; if they were regardless of the forms and etiquette of art , it was because they saw and felt the deeper worth and power of truth ; and they understood too well the harmony between the enduring features of nature and the universal laws of mind , to trick out and embellish the former to suit the accidental phases of the latter . Hence the simplicity and truthfulness of their poetry , as if it flowed spontaneous from the heart of nature ; it is redolent as with the breath of morning ; " a virtue , as of green fields and mountain breezes , dwells in it . " Their delineations of character are not mere combinations of fragments , gleaned here and there by observation , and dovetailed together in the workshop of fancy , but living urnties , with qualities of their own , expanded into life by their innate vitality , and traced in all their characteristic features to their full development . In a word , they are not aggregations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor are their poemsunere collections of pickedup // accidents and far-sought particulars , bundled into some definite shape , and tied together with a string of art , but enduring principles and truths , embodied in expressive forms , and speaking an appropriate language . Instead of hollow abstractions , animated costumes , walking clothes-screens , and personifications of popular passion , they introduce us to real flesh and blood-living and breathing specimens of humanity , with its tears and smiles , its hopes and fears , its gros and aspirings : and we sympathize with their emotions , as the offspring of real individual bosoms . One more paragraph , and we have done . Good people often seem laboring under a great mistake in regard to works of fiction . They appear to think of truth as synonimous with matters of fact , and of fiction as synonimous with falsehood . Now , there is probably nothingthat lies so frequently or so abominably as narratives of facts . Why , if a man wants to make any falsehood go down , he always sweetens it with some " fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , we know to be the readiest vehicle of lies in the world ; and whenever one undertakes to inflict them on us , we take for granted that there is no truth in him ; or that , if there be , it is not coming out this time . On the other hand , as some one has said , the purest fictions often contain more of truth than many histories and scientific theories . In a Spenser or Cervantes , for example , perhaps you shall not find a single falsehood , or a single fact ; in a Gibbon or a Paley , you shall scarcely find a single fiction or a single truth . In the former all shall be true but the names ; in the latter all but the names shall be false . Take , for example , Addison 's Cato and Sancho Panza . Now , Cato is unquestionably a real name ; nobody doubts the existence of such a man ; or that he was a genuine old , eating , breathing , thinking and speaking Roman , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the sheerest falsehoods that ever was perpetrated ; such a being never did exist , and never could exist ; all the principles of human nature must be changed before his existence were possible . Sancho Panza , on the contrary , is doubtless a fictitious name ; nobody pretends that a real man ever bore that name ; but the character is a perfect form of truth ; is as real as the old Roman Cato himself was , whom Addison meant to give us , but could not ; wants , in short , all that Addison 's Cato has , and has all that Addison 's Cato wants . And thus it is , that , in the hands of an artist , a fiction becomes the truest of realities , while , in the hands of a bungler , a fact becomes the emptiest of falsehoods . Again ; take Spenser 's Una and Johnson 's Milton . Now , Una is a mere personification of truth - one of the purest abstractions which the mind can frame , and with which , as such , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an octagon . And yet , in Spenser 's hands , it has turned out a fair humanity , breathing and blushing before us , like life itself . Uniting all the purity of an abstraction , with the fleshand-blood reality of an actual person , we at once revere her as truth , and feel for her as the real subject of sympathies and affections answering to our own . Here , then , is a genuine character ; a pure abstraction has come out a living person ; a perfect fiction has become a perfect truth . This is the miracle that genius performs . Milton , on the contrary , is an actual person ; nay , he has stamped his individuality , as a full length portrait , on every page of his works , so that he who runs may read , provided he have eyes . In Johnson 's hands , however , he becomes a mere abstraction ; no longer lie , but it ; or rather , a bundle of the most inconsistent and irreconcilable abstractions . You could no more mould @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could mix fire and water , without destroying either . Here is a genuine fact turned into a perfect falsehood . This is the miracle that genius does not perform . We could multiply instances beyond either our time or the reader 's patience . It is truth , in this sense , that forms the substance and the soul of all true books ; and we care not what form you give it , or into what name you christen it , it is as genuine and as indestructible as the eye of God . But we must close this article , already longer than we intended , and longer , we fear , than our readers have wished . The subject , indeed , is a long one ; and should we ever finish it , it will probably be at some future time.
