txt call the attention of our readers to an article in the work cited at the foot of this page-which article is itself a review of the volume referred to in the accompanying citation-because the New York Reviev*r may be regarded as the representative of the opinions of a large part of the Whig party at the North on constitutional questions , and as such makes statements , and utters sentiments , that ought not to be kept unknown to the body of the People , nor be allowed to go unanswered . The mass ought to know what views are rife on certain questions , and those who are just forming their opinions on the true construction of the Constitution of the Union , ought to hear what may be advanced in opposition to the heretical notions of the political dilettanti who push themselves upon us at every turn . It would be worth while , too , for that most estimable class of men whose maxim is to walk in the old footsteps  --  to let well enough alone - who see fearful revolutions in all change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloud which exhibits but the size of a man" * New York Review , No . IV. - Peters ' Supreme Court Reports , 11th vol . GG 2 // hand-who abhor all change or shadow of change in Church or State - who may be still seen at sunny noon in white cravat , broad-tailed coat , and strapless pantaloon , bidding defiance to the progress of time and fashion-it would be well worth the while of this class of respectable old gentlemen , to consider how much real veneration and respect the Whig writers have for the most august tribunal in the nation , when , as in the article before us , they see , that a mere change of the incumbents , happening in the due course of the law , and according to the full form and spirit of the Constitution , draws upon the Court itself the most furious denunciation that party exasperation could suggest . The most " ultra-radical " in this country never wrote a severer article against the Supreme Court , than that here referred to ; and yet a few years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be said to belong exalted it to the skies as the palladium of our liberties , and the bulwark behind which all that . is sacred in private and public right might rest in tranquil safety . Whence this change ? How is it that a court so extravagantly landed yesterday has fallen into such unmeasured odium to-day ? Where is that moral , we will not call it political , integrity , that shakes off the trammels of party , and looks with a clear and single eye to the general good , and , as a means of promoting it , aims to gain for our institutions the respect of all classes of men ? The anxious inquirer after political truth sees at every turn some new attempt to bend the Constitution to the views of one or the other of the numerous sects into which the Whig party is divided ; and it is not strange , that in such attempts we often hear the most shallow nonsense or unconsidered notions proclaimed and pressed as the most solemn political orthodoxy . In the early part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. charged with nullifying its own power , and refusing to perform the duties assigned to it by the law , for fear of interfering with State Rights . This disrobing one 's self of authority is , to say the least of it , a vice not very common to men in power ; and if history 9. tells the truth , no former instance can be shown of a court having abridged the rightful authority given to it by the law . We have heard courts complained of for acting upon the old maxim , t.hat it is the duty of a good judge to enlarge his jurisdiction ; and the general cry has been , that , with this maxim in their mouths , they absorbed all the power of every kind upon which , under whatever pretence , they could lay their hands . It has been reserved , then , according to t*me New York Review , for the Supreme Court of the U. S. , under the direction of Chief Justice Taney , to narrow its own legitimate jurisdiction ; and we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that though they hold their power by a life tenure , and are practically irresponsible , they yet use their talents but to limit their own sphere of action , and bring their court and themselves into an odious and contemptible imbecility. // The general tenor and spirit of the article we are examining may b*udged of from the following claim of jurisdiction made for the Supreme Court : " May the Judges throughout the Bench dismiss the narrow , false , and mischievous notion , that in all cases of any doubt they are to turn the construction against the Constitution of the nation ; for the interest of the whole ought to be regarded as greater and more precious than the interest of a part , and the will of the whole more commanding than the will of any detached member of the Union. * , When we consider that this claim of jurisdiction is made for the supreme judicial tribunal of a limited government , as all admit ours to be , we can not shut our eyes to the disposition , practically to repeal the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rights of the States , and finally of the whole Union . If Judges are to decide questions of public or private concern with reference to the interest of the greatest number , no limit can be fixed to their jurisdiction , except what every member of a court may think expedient and proper . It would be useless for a State , or for the people of the Union , to contend , that certain rights and powers were reserved to them by their several Constitutions ; for the answer would be ready , that the interest of the greatest number is the rule to be consulted , and to that rule particular rights and interests must be made to yield . We hazard the opinion , too , that this " narrow , false , and mischievous notion , " as the New York Review styles it - namely , that in cases of doubt it is proper to refrain from the exercise of power-lies at the very foundation of civil liberty , in all limited and constitutional governments . It confines all public servants to the duties actually prescribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority may be deemed necessary or desirable for the public interest , to apply to the people as the fountain of power ; and it preserves the harmony of the whole system of government by retaining within their proper orbits the agents to whom the different departments may be assigned . And in this opinion we find ourselves supported by the venerable Marshall , before whose authority the Reviewer will surely not fail to bow with unreserved deference . in the famous Dartmouth College case , after alluding to the delicacy of a question which obliged the Court , not merely to decide upon the validity of the law , but to reverse also the judgment of the highest tribunal in the State , he uses the following language : " On more than one occasion this Court has expressed the cautious circumspection with which it approaches the consideration of such questions , and has declared that in no doubtful case would it pronounce a legislative act contrary to the Constitution . " This distinguished jurist , then , did not think he was undermining the Constitution , or surrendering any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he judged it wrong in a doubtful case to // nullify the deliberate act of a State Government . Indeed , the contrary doctrine , we have seen , would be fraught with the most series consequences , and we vcnture to say , was never advanced for a truth before the year 1838 . For if it be admitted , and established as a principle of our government , that in cases of doubt the grant of power is to be presumed-that where a State stands behind the Constitution as a barrier , its defence must be taken away on the plea that the good of the whole requires it-we need no longer criticize the acts either of President or of Congress , but turn our undivided attention to the Judiciary as the concentration of the whole power of the government , with the means of enlarging it to any dimensions they may from time to time think necessary for the public weal . This unexpected pretension , which would establish , through the aid of courts , a secure despotism , has been most faithfully seconded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounder doctrines would prevail . A controversy arose in Maryland between the Regents of the University and the Trustees , to which latter the privileges and property of the former had been transferred , in 1825 , by an act of the Legislature . We have nothing now to *ay about the judgment of that case ; but we hasten to make our solemn protest against the doctrine contained in the following quotation from the opinion of the Maryland Court . Set it side by side with the New York Review , and it takes away any remnant of authority which the latter may have left to the co-ordinate branches of the government . After a course of reasoning intended to prove the act of the Legislature of Maryland unconstitutional , the Court say : " Independent of that instrument ( the Constitution of the United States ) , and of any express restriction in the Constitution of the State , there is a fundamental principle of right and justice , inherent in the nature and spirit of the social compact ( in this country at least ) , the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they spring and the purposes for which they were established , that rises above and restrains and sets bounds to the power of legislation , which the legislature can not pass without exceeding its rightful authority . " Did it not occur to this most learned court , that men , in the same country and the same age , differ as to what is the fundamental principle of right and justice-that what one man considers morally right another rejects as wrong  --  and that the difference between right and wrong in a moral point of view , and right and wrong in policy , has not been settled to this day , by any authority claiming the unanimous submission of all conflicting opinions . If there be this admitted difference among men , who then is to perform the responsible office of censor morum ? The Legislature can not do it , because the fundamental principle rises above , and restrains and sets bounds to its power . The Executive can not do it , because it has nothing to do with legis*ation generally ; and if the Veto power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other must have been made before the interposition of the courts . The judges or the people must be the arbiters . The people can not act in that capacity except through their constitutional representatives , and individually are bound to obey . We are then driven to the conclusion ; that if the office exists , it belongs to and its duties devolve , in the estimation of the Maryland Court , upon the Judges . The Legislature may deliberately pass a law which does not in anywise infringe upon the State or the Federal Constitution-which the people may think right-which may in fact be absolutely necessary to their welfare  --  and the Court itself , the creature and instrument of the Constitution , may declare it a nullity , thus setting at defiance the people , the Legislature , and the Constitution . We have been taught to believe , that according to the theory of our government the people are sovereign , the ballot box one public servant and elevating and advancing another . But a new light has burst upon us , and we find that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribunal of the last resort , no matter how clear may be the voice of the nation . It is hard to believe , either The New York Review or the Maryland Court , serious , when such extravagaut not ions are promulgated . But to say the least , this loose way of stating opinions is to be deprecated . Men ought to learn , that whether on the bench or in private life , they should approach such questions with all the power of their minds free from a petty ambition to dazzle by well-rounded periods , or startling dicta . We are always willing to maintain the proper authority of the bench , but we are not tender enough to refrain from speaking our mind for fear of the cry so common now-a-days against all free and fearless criticism . We will not be silent when schoolboy essays are ushered forth as the oracular responses of wisdom , and the foundation is laid for principles subversive of our beautiful Constitution . Although we are far from thinking it a perfect creation , we reverence the Constitution as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unamended by the only power competent to that funetion , we would not , by construction , add to or subtract . from it . All we ask is , that others who pretend to so much veneration , should be governed by the spirit they profess to act under , and not interpolate and distort for the sake of some new theory caught up in a hurry , and dashed off in flowing language for the admiration of a side bar clique . We had a right to expect , that the Judges in the States and in the General Government would lend no ear to such attempts ; and we may well be appalled , when we find them originating , where it was most expected they would be the first and sternest to rebuke . We advocate constitutional limitations not merely in name , but substantially and practically , and see danger and evil in all usurpations , whether of the Legislature , the Executive , or the Bench . // After what we have seen of the spirit of the times , in the New York Review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be surprised to hear the alarm cry , that the Constitution is in dangerthat the Supreme Court has virtually repealed those clauses by which States are prohibited from impairing the obligation of contracts , or emitting bills of credit , as well as that by which Congress is empowered to regulate commerce . Upon what evidence such sweeping assertions are made , we are unable to discover in the article before us , or in any of the cases brought under its examination ; and the manifest temper of the writer teaches us to look for a small display of calm and sober judgment . When we find a course of invective finished by the following wholesale condemnation , we need not be at a loss for the true cause of all the tears so pathetically shed : " In short , when we consider the revolution in opinion , in policy , and in numbers , that has recently changed the character of the Supreme Court , we can scarcely avoid being reduced nearly to a state of despair of the commonwealth . " We were aware that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court as soon as Chief Justice TANEY was placed at its head , but we confess some surprise at the boldness of the above extracts . Most politicians , however much they may be influenced by party feeling while judging of the conduct of public men , endeavor to conceal their bias under moderate language ; but the Reviewer here reviewed boldly denounces the whole Supreme Court of the nation , because , forsooth , his political friends are no longer in the ascendant ; and seems to expect and look round for applause , while he bids his countrymen prepare for ruin and desolation . We could have anticipated such sentiments from superannuated politicians , neglected votaries of the muses , or worn out hack writers of the day ; but not in a treatise professedly philosophical , and pretending to reveal the truth , not to excite popular feeling-appearing , too , in the pages of a work of the deservedly high claims to respect possessed by the New York Review . At the time the above article made its appearance , however , it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we ought perhaps to make some allowance for the influence of such a state of feeling upon the ordinary writers of the day . The most distinguished do not always escape this baneful influence , and common charity obliges us to pass lightly over such blunders as we have noticed , in the hope that calmer moments and an increase of years will cause them to be considered by the author in the same light with which every dispassionate man must now regard them . The article in question finds fault with three cases decided since the death of Judge Marshall , and reported in the eleventh volume of Mr. Peters ' Supreme Court Reports . The first is the case of the Charlestown Bridge against the Warren Bridge ; the second , that of the City // of New York against Miln ; and the third , that of Biscoe against the Bank of Kentucky . The Record of the first case shows the following facts : In the year 1650 the Legislature of Massachusetts granted to Harvard University the right to dispose of the ferry between Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sundry citizens , authority was granted to build a bridge at the same place ; from which the proprietors were to receive tolls for forty years , paying two hundred pounds per annum to Harvard University . At the end of the forty years the bridge was to become the property of the State , saving to the College or University " a reasonable annual compensation for the annual income of the ferry . " Afterwards , upon granting authority to another company to build a bridge across Charles River in another direction , the charter was extended to seventy years . In 1828 the Warren Bridge Company was incorporated for the purpose of building another bridge between Boston and Charlestown , from which the proprietors were to receive tolls only until their expenses should be repaid ; after which it was to belong to the Commonwealth . Before the decision of the case it had in fact become a free bridge ; and being located at only a short distance from the old one , had taken away all the toll . The qucstion in the case was , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or in other words , whether in the first grant the corporators had , received a monopoly which precluded the Legislature , by contract , from authorizing the erection of any other bridge between Boston and Charlestown . The old bridge company did not contend for any express grant or contract ; and the main question for the decision of the Supreme Court was , whether such a grant could be made out against the public by implication . It is to be remarked that the question did not come before the Court , how far the old bridge company was entitled to compensation . It was for them to decide only , whether a contract had been impaired , under the Constitution of the United States . The question of compensation was on all hands admitted to rest with the State courts , in construing the State Constitution , and with the Legislature . The Supreme Court decided that the act incorporating the Warren Bridge Company was constitutional . The opinion was delivered by Chief Justice Taney , and we only regret that our limits forbid its insertion at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its face those features for which all the intellectual productions of that distinguished statesman and jurist are remarkable . He clears the very intricate subject before the Court of all irrelevant matter , with the unerring instinct of genius ; and as he pursues his unbroken chain of clear , logical reasoning , spreads light all around , leaving no cloud to confound or mislead those who may come after him . Indeed the present Chief Justice escapes from irrelevant matter with as much ease as Judge Marshall or the most distinguished of the English Judges . // Like them he seizes the true question in the case , and never loses sight of it for a single instant . He strips off , gently but firmly , all the disguises with which forensic eloquence so often veils the truth , and without fear or hesitation follows wherever she may lead . When in connexion with talents peculiarly fitting him for the high post he now occupies , we consider that a long life of blameless purity has left his character without reproach in the midst of all the temptations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while we admire ; and feel , while listening to him , that we are receiving lessons of wisdom from one , the directness and simplicity of whose mind disdain the foppery and tinsel of the rhetorician , and who uses words not as baubles to gain the admiration of a moment , but as the vehicle of useful and instructive thought . We have , too , in him a Judge of unwavering firmness , fitting him for the most difficult duties which in his position he can ever be called upon to perform ; for neither clamor , nor false delicacy , nor fear of responsibility , will ever deter him from the course which his reason may approve . He took his place at the head of the Supreme Court in the midst of great bitterness of party feeling , which we are happy to observe has nearly died away , except in a small circle of which the New York Review may be considered the repre*entative ; and all attempts to underrate his mental powers have most signally failed . In the case we are now considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the Court , if not with the Judges , at least with the country ; and , with the advantage of answering the opinion of the Court , put forth all his powers . The Chief Justice , it is well known , has nevertheless been triumphantly sustained by the country , and the Associate by no means now ranks relatively as high on the bench , even in the estimation of those most disposed to view his character and talents in a favorable light , as he did in the days of Judge Marshall . 1 , A , T* should perhaps apologize for the di ression we have made from the subject properly before us , were it not that the personalities of the Review , aimed principally against Judge Taney , warrant this tribute to his virtues and his greatness . The character of such a man needs no defence , but as it belongs to his countrymen , they may be pardoned some out-pouring of indignant affection when it is aspersed . We have already stated that the point upon which the Bridge case was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopoly could he established by implication . The Court in their opinion treated this part of the subject at great length ; and the Reviewer , after taunting the Judges with receiving instruction from him in the ethics of the law , says " that Chief Justice Taney in his opinion relied upon a recent case in the English King 's Bench , it which it was held , that under a grant by act of Parliament , giving tolls for articles passing through the locks on a canal , the grantees could not claim tolls from persons using one of the levels of the canal , and not passing through // any of the locks , " to show that public grants must be strictly construed . Now , most readers would suppose from the above sentence , that the Chief Justice relied upon this single case to overrule the former decisions of the Supreme Court ; and that even in England it was the solitary decision of an inferior judge , unacknowledged and unsupported . What must be his surprise to learn , after this sneering allusion to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our own Supreme Court itself were those mainly relied upon , and that they fully sustain the public policy and sound law of the doctrine , namely , of strict construction of public grants , so that nothing may be held to pass except what was plainly intended and expressed ; while foreign cases were cited to show that the same law has always been maintained in England . The case of the United States against Arredondo , reported in Mr. Peters ' eighth volume , was referred to for the collection of cases on that subject . In the case of Jackson against Lamphire where the attempt was made to set up a covenant against a State by implication , the Supreme Court held this language : " The patentcontains no covenant to do or not to do any farther act in relation to the land , and we do not feel ourselves at liberty in this case to create one by implication . " So in the case of Beatty against Knowles ' lessee , t the same Court says : " That a corporation is strictly limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it will not be denied . " " The exercise of the corporate franchise being restrictive of individual rights , can not be extended beyond the letter and spirit of the act of incorporation . " And yet Mr. Story , for whom the Reviewer expresses the highest admiration , says , in his dissenting opinion , that he could not see , " how any grant of a franchise is a derogation fro in the rights of the people of the State , any more than the grant of public land . " The next case relied upon by the Court was that of the Providence Bank against Billings arid Pittman4 In that case the Bank maintairied , that as no reservation of a right to tax its stock was made in its charter by tire State , an attempt to impose a tax was an infringement of the contract , because the State might thus render it of no value , and indirectly do what the Constitution of the Union prevented being done directly . But the Court said , that the relinquishment of the taxing power was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifested ; for , " as the whole community is interested in niaintaining it undiminished , that comrnuiiity has a right to insist , that its abandonment ought not to be presunied , in a ease in which the deliberate purpose of the State to abandon it does not appear . " Such was the language of Judge Marshall When it is recollected that an argument much relied upon in the Bridge case was , that , by erecting another bridge and making it free , the indirect effect was $ 4 Pctcrs. * 3 Peters ' S. C. Reports . 1 4 Peters . // to destroy the first franchise , the case just cited will be found completely apposite . Indeed we conceive , that if any doubt could remain in the mind of any sound lawyer or statesman , it would be entirely dispelled by the following luminous exposition of the rule , and the reason upon which it is founded , taken from the opinion of Judge Taney : " The continued existence of a government would be of no great value , if by implications and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish the ends of its creation , and the functions it was designed to perform transferred to the hands of privileged corporations . The rule of construction announced by the Court- ( in the Bank of Providence case ) - was not confined to the taxing power ; nor is it so limited in the opinion delivered . On the contrary , it was distinctly placed on the ground , that the interests of the community were concerned in preserving undiminished the power then in question ; and whenever any power of the State is said to be surrendered or diminished , whether it be the taxing power or any other affecting the public interest , the same principle applies , and the rule of construction must be the same . No one will question that the interest of the great body of the people of the State would , in this instance , be affected by the surrender of this great line of travel to a single corporation , with theright to exact toll and exclude competition for seventy years . While the rights of private property are sacredly guarded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights , and that the happiness and well being of every citizen depends on their faithful preservation . " The pretensions of the Charles River Bridge Company , as advanced before the Massachusetts Legislature at the time its charter was prolonged , would , if acceded to , have cut off Boston from all approach to the main land , except by Roxbury Neck at one end , and a narrow , crowded , and dangerous bridge at the other . It is unnecessary to say that the claim met no favor at that day . If they had succeeded in their recent attempt , they would have established one of the most oppressive rights , as far as the community of Boston was concerned , ever attempted to be enforced in the worst days of public monopolies in the middle ages . Who would wish any implications made in favor of such a claim ? And yet the decision of the Court is pronounced by the Reviewer " a desolating doctrine " - " meriting the severest animadversion which indignant patriotism can bestow ! " It is no valid objection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion of Judge Taney , that the Legislature of a State is thus permitted to do indirectly what it could not do directly . Judge Marshall held it to be no objection to his judgment in the case of the Bank of Providence . The clause of the Constitution of the United States , which prevents States from passing laws impairing the obligation of contracts , had in view one species of injustice on the part of the State Legislatures , from which the country had suffered great inconvenience // at the time of its adoption . It could not go so far as to prevent every species of injustice , which State Legislatures might inflict ; for the minuteness and complexity of such provisions would inevitably , in the jarring interests and opinions of the Convention , have destroyed it ,  --  and for ever . If injustice is done , which the Federal Constitution does not authorize the Federal Courts to reach , the people of the States must look to it , for with them rests the remedy . We do not mean to intimate , that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Massachusetts ; for it appears from the history of the old company , and of the legislation respecting Charles River , that they had full warning , when their charter was prolonged , of the views of the public respecting their rights ; since which time an immense sum of money has been received in tolls  --  a sum far more than sufficient to reimburse the total loss of the stock . Lord Stowell , in the case of the Elsebe reported in the fifth volume of Robinson 's Admirality Reports- ( and by the way he is quoted by Judge Story , in his dissenting opinion ) - lays down the true principle of interpretation of public grants in the following concise language , so as to make it receive the assent of all men as the rightful rule from which there can be no safe departure . He says : " Against an individual it is presumed he meant to convey a benefit with the utmost liberality that the words will bear . It is indifferent to the public in which person an interest remains , whether in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sovereign it is far otherwise . It is not held by the Sovereign himself as private property ; and no alienation shall be presumed , except what is clearly and indubitably expressed . " Can anything be clearer or more convincing ? And yet to combat what seems so plain , the dissenting Judge has waded through all the black letter of the English law ; and has only succeeded in proving what nobody ever doubted , that a public grant shall not be construed to mean a nullity . We were much surprised at the sneering tone of a part of the dissenting opinion , because it is so unusual among judges sitting on the same bench , and familiarly addressing each other by the appellation of " Brother . " The reference made in the opinion of the Court to the construction of royal grants is thus treated . Judge Story says : " An attempt , however , has been made to put the case of legislative grants upon the same footing as royal grants as to their construction ; upon some supposed analogy between royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such a claim in favor of republican prerogative is new , &amp;c . " And again " The policy of the Common Law which gave the crown so many exclusive privileges and extraordinary claims , differing from those of the subject , was founded in a good measure , if not altogether , upon the divine right of kings . " And then the sentiment of Judge Parsons is quoted- " that in England prerogative is the cause of one against the // whole . Here it is the cause of all against one . " We deny that the Common Law ever tolerated the idea of a divine right in kings ; and we affirm that there was no difference between those who maintained and those who denied this right , as to the duties and obligations of the Sovereign . He was on all hands admitted to be a trustee , whether supposed to reign by a divine right , or , in the language of Blackstone , " by the general consent of ths people . " His powers and prerogatives , therefore , no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public good , not for his individual gratification or private purposes . It is just so with the parliament of England , and with the legislatures in our country ; and when they make a grant , they pass what does not belong to them , but is the property of their constituents . The supposed analogy , then , is perfect ; and accoidingly the courts in the monarchy of England and in the republic of America have , for the purpose of guarding the rights of the people from the uncertainty that would surround them if liable to be swept away by implications and constructions , established as a fundamental rule , that nothing shall be held to pass from the public , but what is plainly intended and expressed . And yet , while combating these truths , the simplicity of which appears almost self-evident , Judge Story ventures confidently to say , " I stand upon the old law-upon law established three centuries ago . " It was argued in the Warren Bridge case , that all the ferry rights possessed by the College had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this score it was attempted to secure an exclusive right of toll . But the facts of the case cut up this argument by the roots . There never was a transfer . The bridge was authorized to be built in the place where the old ferry had been , and the franchise of course could have no existence after it ceased to be used , and its place was supplied by another . It was then attempted to show that bridges were entitled to the same monopoly that had been claimed for ancient ferries ; but no authority of an older date could be found , than Chancellor Kent , in the case of the Newburg Turnpike Company against Miln . In that case the defendant had evidently interfered with the franchise of the Company , by enabling passengers to commit a fraud of which he reaped the profit . The decision , we are willing to admit , was right ; but the dicta that accompanied it , not only went beyond the limit to ferry rights fixed by Lord Kenyon in the case of Trippe against Frank in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broad principle of total exclusion of competition to bridges and turnpikes . Hear him : " No rival road , bridge , ferry , or other establishment of a similar kind , can be tolerated so near the other as materially to effect or take away its custom . " If Chancellor Kent meant , that this could not be done without the assent of the legislature , we have nothing to say ; but if he intended to establish the principle that the legislature could not authorize it , we // assert that the dictum has no foundation in reason , and is unsupported by any respectable authority . Indeed Judge Story , in his argument , felt the force of the case of Trippe against Frank so strongly , that he was obliged to confine the monopoly he wished to establish to two points , and thus endeavored to escape the practical absurdity involved in the positions of the Chancellor . We have a great respect for the talents of Chancellor Kent and Judge Story , though we do not regard them as the highest judicial authority in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench too much ; and seem so anxious to follow wherever dazzling argument may lead , that they often pass the shrine of truth unheedingly , and without a votive offering . It is certain that each has made blunders materially lessening his judicial authority . Vanity is a most subtle enemy , and peculiarly dangerous to men of acute mental vision ; for to such it whispers , that they may maintain paradoxes by dazzling sophisms . Contemporaries may be carried away by ingenious reasoning ; but posterity looks coldly and rigidly for truth , without caring for men ; and passes a fatal decree against those whose high intellectual powers have been used merely for display . " I believe , " says Polybius , " that nature herself has constituted truth as the supreme deity , which is to be adored by mankind , and that she has given it greater force than any of the rest ; for being opposed as she is on all sides , and appearances of truth so often passing for the thing itself in behalf of plausible falsehoods , yet by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ; sometimes exerting her strength immediately , and sometimes lying hid in darkness for a length of time ; but at last she struggles through it and appears triumphant over falsehood . " The next case that excites the ire of the New York Review is that of the city of New York against Mila , reported in the same volume . In 1824 the increase of pauper immigration became a subject of anxious attention in New York , and a law was passed requiring captains of vessels to give in a list of their passengers , and in certain cases to give security that they would not within a given time become a burthen upon the city . It was contended that this was a mere police regulation fully within the competence of State legislation ; and it was so decided by the court . Against the law the cases of Gibbons and Ogden , and Brown and the State of Maryland , were cited and mainly relied upon . In the first , the Supreme Court had decided that the grant by the State of New York of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a violation of the Constitution of the United States , because it interfered with the right of Congress to regulate commerce ; and as all steamboats were licensed as other vessels , that authority could not be controlled by any other power . In the other case , the State of Maryland had taxed goods in bales in the hands of the importer ; which was also adjudged to be unconstitutional , as an interference with the right of Congress to regulate // commerce , and because no state is allowed to lay an impost without their consent . We can not see anything in this case , of the city of New York against Miln , to alarm the most ultra consolidationist , nor discover any feature in which the law sustained by it differs fromAhe internal police and inspection regulations which had already received the approval of the courts . It certainly was not a commercial regulation ; for passengers are in no point of view subjects of commerce , and the laws of the United States relating to passenger ships are designed merely for the comfort of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the masters and owners of such vessels . The law , too , only acts upon the captain and passengers in port , and when within the jurisdiction of the State . If this be contrary to the Constitution , it is hard to perceive how States could protect themselves from an increasing and most oppressive pauper immigration . Judge Barbour , who delivered the opinion of the court , says : " There can be no mode in which the power to regulate internal police could be more appropriately exercised . New York from her particular situation is perhaps more than any other city in the Union exposed to the evil of thousands of foreign emigrants arriving there , and the consequent danger of the citizens being subjected to a heavy charge in the maintainance of those who are poor . It is the duty of the State to protect her citizens from this evil . " Mere technical lawyers may complain of this mode of looking at the consequences to the people likely to result from the establishment of any particular doctrine . But every school-boy soon learns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experience is the only sure test of the correctness of opinions and the soundness of reasoning . What the lawyers call the argument ab inconvenienti has more force than is generally conceded to it on the bench . It will not do for a Judge of the Supreme Court to follow out a chain of technical conclusions wheresoever they may lead ; for no matter how exactly his deductions may follow his premises , he must go back if they lead to a practical absurdity . A mere lawyer will never make a sound judge of that court . For as in our social compact , intended not for the day only , but for ages , it was the part of wisdom to avoid minute and compact details , so the judge , who may be called upon to define its meaning , as applicable to particular cases , must be a statesman capable of bringing to his aid a broad view of our whole civil polity , and of construing the language of the Constitution with due regard to the circumstances of the country at its adoption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power which the patriots of Revolution established between the States and the General Government . The legal acumen , logical perspicuity , and sound sense , displayed by Judge Barbour in his opinion , have sustained it against all attacks ; and have caused the case to be considered , // in connexiori with that of Gibbons and Ogden , as settling the law relating to police regulations of the States upon a broad and solid foundation . Such , we may safely venture to say , is now the settled judgment of the bar and the country . The last case in the volume , and made the subject of severe strictures by the New York Review , is the case of Briscoe against the Bank of Kentucky . The Reviewer would have us conclude from the judgment in this case , that the Supreme Court has construed away that provision of the Constitution which forbids the States to issue any bills of credit . The State of Kentucky incoporated a bank , for the relief of the necessitous of its citizens-according to the modern understanding of the word " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officers , but in every other respect leaving the corporation to carry on its affairs like other banks . the faith of the State was in no way pledged , and by the terms of the charter provision was made for the application of the assets-thus teaching creditors to look no farther for their security than the available funds of the corporation . It was contended by the plaintiff iii error , that the bank was unconstitutional , because an indirect mode , on the part of the State , of issuing bills of credit ; and the case of Craig against the State of Missouri was relied upon to sustain the argument . In the Missouri case the certificates were issued by the officers of the State , its faith was pledged for their payment , and they were at the same time in a form to circulate as money . In Kentucky the*'aith of the State was in no way pledged for the payment of the notes , or any of the liabilities of the bank , and the corporation was put upon precisely the same footing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could the notes of such an institution be considered bills of credit issued by Kentucky ? " Bills of credit " is a term , taken in its largest sense , more general than any other in use . It comprehends every written evidence of debt , and in this sense the provision of the Constitution might be construed to prevent a State from granting to its creditor anywritten promise to pay its debt , no matter how incurred . All the bonds issued by the States for the purposes of internal improvement would be void , and no exigency , however imperative , would authorize the anticipation of their revenue . Such a construction would not be contended for ; and the necessity of limiting the signification of the term , to something narrower than its general use , is obvious . What better standard can we find than the use of the term at the period of the framing of the Constitution , to illustrate the sense in which the term was intended in that instrument ? The obligations meant at that day were , no doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolution , for which they could not be sued , and whose rapid depreciation had brought distress upon the whole country . Let us see whether notes of the Bank of Kentucky had any feature in common with bills of credit in this sense . // The argument that the notes of the Bank of Kentucky were indirectly issued by the State , is met at once by a current of decisions of the Supreme Court . Judge Marshall said , " that when a Government becomes a partner in a trading company it divests itself , so far as concerns the transactions of that company , of its sovereign character , and takes that of a private citizen . " See the case of the U. S. against Planter 's Bank , in the ninth volume of Wheaton 's Reports . If so , she is not bound as a State , and in no sense can the notes of a bank in which she is a part stockholder be said to be her notes . And how is the case altered when she owns the whole of the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can not be transferred . rrhe corporation is on the same footing with any other , and may be sued as if the State did not own a dollar of stock in it . Of course the State is nowise bound for the notes ; and not binding , they are not bills of credit . It may indeed be contended , that the charters of all banks chartered with the privilege of issuing paper money are void , as devices to evade the Constitution  --  and so they all are , if the Court were wrong in their judgment . We presume that those , at least , who are now attacking the Supreme Court , are not prepared for that conclusion , though it is evidently the only legitimate one to which they can come from their own premises . Would , indeed , that such a construction were sound , and as such could prevail in practice ! Would , rather , that the framers of the Constitution had foreseen the present state of the currency and banking system of the country , that the preventive remedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sagacious patriots of that age would not have omitted ! Or would that such an amendment of the Constitution could be adopted at the present day , as should work the effect of a thorough cure of this fatal national disease ! We consider , however , that the whole question , involved in the case here considered , was fully settled some years ago by the same Court in the case of the Bank of Kentucky against Wister , reported in Mr. Peters ' third volume . There it was actually contended , that the Bank could not be sued because the State was the only stockholder ; but the Court said , in allusion to the cases already referred to , that it was no longer an open question , and that the State was not a party . Judge Story , in his dissenting opinion-for here too he was the only dissenter-seemed to feel the pressure of this case , and attempted to show that the constitutional point was not raised . But we ask , how could it be overlooked by the Court . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State , she must have been a party , in the estimation of the Court , and the decision must have gone the other way . We delight , while examining judgments so harshly reviewed , from : such a quarter , to cite in their support the former decisions of the Supromo Court when Judge i'larshall was at its head ; for it thence becomes // transparent , that the real complaint is , not that the present Judges have receded from the ground formerly occupied , but that they will not go any further . Thus far they have stood by the old decisions ( some of which we , for our part , would have been very little disposed to complain if they had reversed ) , and steadily refused to receive dicta as judgments , or to make old cases the stepping-stones to new aggressions upon State rights . We should not have been surprised , indeed , if , when a change took place in so many seats , some even more decided change in opinion had also been exhibited ; for such has frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished head of the court , who had sat in it for many years . Courts fall into a current of decisions , where the same members act together for a number of years , and particular cases are sometimes made to conform to general principles not properly applicable , for the want of due consideration . This inconvenience has been felt in England , and we see no reason why , under the same circumstances , we should be exempt from the evil . It is folly to assert a claim to infallibility for the opinions of any man or set of men . The greatest have admitted their errors and changed their minds , and posterity has had to reverse the decisions , and suffer for the mistakes , of renowned judges and statesmen , whose judgment it would have been deemed a daring rashness to question in their own day . We revere the name of the late lamented Chief Justice , although politically opposed to him , and differing from him in some his constitutional notions ; and far be it from us to wish to pluck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he won so nobly , and wore so gracefully . But we are sickened by the attempt to connect his name with a particular party of the present day , and make it the representative of all the ultra notions of those who , for a splendid government , would reason away the Constitution and all its checks and balances ; who would , with one breath , make corporations override nil individual and public interests , hold in check the power of the States , and defy that of the General Government  --  and at an9ther moment would prostrate them all to gratify some new whim , or in advocating some new extreme of policy . What injury is not done to a great name by such a course ! All men , however great , leave behind them evidence enough of their weakness , without having sentiments attributed to them which they either did not choose , or were not called upon , to record . We are led into these remarks by ebserving that Judge Story and the Reviewer here referred to lose no opportunity of calling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenets , although in neither of the cases in which he is said to have agreed with them , have we any recorded opinion from him . There are few of our readers who can not make a proper estimate of the public injury that would have followed a different judgment in either of the cases we have mentioned . If it had been settled in the HH2 // Bridge case , that the claim to the exclusive use of Charles River was sanctioned by the proper construction of the original grant , wha t power would have been left to the States to act for the public convenience by providing new and increased facilities for commercial and social intercourse ? If the Kentucky Bank case had been decided differently , what ruin would not have fallen upon the States , their creditors , the Banks , and society at large , by such a sudden and sweeping revolution in the settled opinions and practice of the country , as must have resulted from it . A scene of confusion and alarm would have ensued which the imagination can hardly picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States have no right to protect themselves from being overwhelmed by any influx of pauperism with which foreign poor-houses might have seen fit to deluge their cities , what would have been the condition of our police along the whole sea board* and who can measure the burthen upon the community that might have resulted from the annual importation of European lazzaroni ? The Reviewer asks , if it is " not possible to bring intelligent and enlightened public opinion to bear upon the Supreme Court , and to endeavor to inspire it with a larger infusion of the spirit of moderation and forbearance . " Yes , enlightened public opinion has already acted , and is now acting ; and that man must be blind indeed to the signs of the times , who does not see that the Court has been fully sustained in those very respects about which so much complaint has been made in a certain quarter . The forbearance and moderation of the Court , as lately manifested , not merely in most of their own judgments , but in the dignified manner in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanction of all well wishers of their country . A few partisans , and those who can not be made to believe that men of the present day are as good as those of the last generation , will find fault ; but to such no sensible man need address himself . Those whose most ardent desire is to see a proper equilibrium kept up according to the theory of the Federal Constitution between the States and the General Government , are satisfied . In every popular government , and more particularly in ours , there is a very large class of intelligent , well-informed men , who can not properly be said to belong to any party , but who read all that is written , and watch all that is done , and always sustain the government and all its public officers so long as they believe that the true principles of the Constitution are carried out by them . Hence this class , the steady , plain , and solid character of whose minds seems to fit them more for judging of the actions of others , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense interest the scale of power as it may vibrate between the States and the General Government , and have ever looked to the decisions of the Supreme Court , as indicating the progress of good or bad principles of government . This class has susiaiaed , and will continue to sustain , the Court in their present course7 // against all attempts by the interested or prejudiced to break down its authority , or tarnish the lustre of its public estimation . We hold the Supreme Court in high esteem , and regard its powers as likely to produce much mischief when in the hands of rash uliraists of any school ; but when the Reviewer tells us , that it is the sentinel over the constitutional powers and liberties of the United States , we feel that we are carried into the regions of romance and exaggeration . The people are the sentinels . They must watch warily and incessantly , and wo betide them , and all civil liberty , whenever they entrust the guardianship of their dearest rights to any court , however distinguished , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition of all parties by turns , to attribute too much , for weal or wo , to the Supreme Court . The Reviewer thinks , " that if the Constitution be destined prematurely to perish , and the last refuge of justice , and the last hopes of temperate and civilized freedom , to be destroyed , the expiring struggle will be witnessed in the decisions of that Court . " Mr. Jefferson , on the other hand , said in one of his letters : " I fear , dear sir , we are in such another crisis , " - alludincr to the Alien and Sedition laws ,  --  " with this difference only , that the judiciary is alone and single-handed in the present assaults on the Constitution . But its assaults are more sure and deadly , as from an agent seemingly passive and unassuming . " The hopes of the Reviewer and the fears of Mr. Jefferson we take to be equally unfounded . Courts are composed of men , liable to the same impulses as the rest of their countrymen . And whenever it shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our idols , and vice and corruption shall be the characteristics of the nation , judges will not have escaped the contagion ; or if they should , they would present but a feeble barrier to the progress of vice and the passions of a degraded people . Their functions may , we think , in the language of Professor Tucker , " be compared to those of some bridge which crosses and stems the mountain stream , seemly to the eye , and entirely convenient , so long as the current beneath keeps the even tenor of its way ; but when the rains fall , and the waters are swollen to a torrent , this frail structure* so far from proving a barrier to its fury , is one of the first goodly fabrics that is swept away . " Let the people keep the watch then ; let them encourage education and good moral and religious principles , and carefully select for all public duties men whose characters afford a guarantee of fidelity . Let them watch the bad , that they do no mischief , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all power and the masters they serve . Let the people but do this , and be faithful to themselves , and all will be well.
