txt IT would be difficult to find a more provident and thrifty people than those who have rather oddly come to be distinguished , some would say stigmatized , among their fellowrepublicans by the title of Yankees . The union of shrewdness , industry , invention , and economy , which forms the Yankee character , is the more remarkable as it is not the offspring of necessity . That pinching poverty , whose stern laws of frugality hardly suffice to keep starvation at bay , is here unknown and almost inconceivable . If sometimes dis@@184059544.txt THE idea of popular education may be said to lie at the basis of the free institutions of New England . Amidst all the changes in public and private affairs , through the calm of neace and the storms of war , this idea has never been lost sight of , as one , to carry out which into complete practical results constant efforts must be made . We have , however , fallen far short of the perfect attainment of this end , - nay , of what a people so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonably have been expected to reach . Of late years , however , public attention has been thoroughly roused to the importance of doing more to forward the magnificent conception of educating the people . The labors of Mr. Horace Mann , who left the profession of the law , the highest honors of which his abilities and the estimation they were held in by the public justified him in aspiring to , in order that he might consecrate his energies and his time to the holy cause of popular education , have so set the machinery of progress in // motion , that there seems but little danger of pause or hesitation in carrying on the work . His untiring services since he assumed the office of Secretary to the Board of Education will immortalize his name as one of the great benefactors of the present age . With an industry to which a parallel can scarcely be found , he has collected facts from every quarter ; travelled from town to town , county to county , State to State ; organized institutes , delivered lectures , examined school-houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accomplishment of his mighty work . Everywhere , his zeal , his ardor , his eloquence , have encourged the hopeful , roused the indifferent , strengthened the friends and borne down the enemies of education . At times , the feeble voice of the bigot , horn out of time in this age of light , and blinking like an owl suddenly roused from his darkling corner by the hreaking in of the mid-day beam , has been heard to make a shrill outcry , and to call for a return of his congenial darkness . in vain The reign of bigotry is over . Science , letters , arts , inventions , the schemes of philanthropy , the practical application of the great truths of Christianity to the conditions and duties of daily life , - these august and absorhing interests of the present day make men slow to listen to the voice of the medi√¶val croaker , who fancies that by reviving the old , wornout theological odium , he can scare the human mind hack into its ancient courses . In Boston , the stanch rd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy city , animated by a liberal and patriotic spirit , this was no more than satisfying a just expectation . Many schools , however , in the larger towns of the Commonwealth , have disputed the palm of excellence with the public schools of Boston . A generous rivalry in this respect may lead to infinite good , and ought to be encouraged by every lawful means . City and country will be alike improved by the noble strife . In some respects the city schools have advantages over those of the country . The city is the centre of intelligence , as well as of wealth . Ideas , no less than money , circulate with greater rapidity there . Books are more abundant and accessible , and the mental powers are more speedily brought into activity . Talent of all kinds naturally concentrates in the city . Professional , literary , commercial eminence gravitates towards the city , as its centre of attraction . But on the other hand , the activity of // city intellect is apt to be superficial and showy , just as a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary capacities and shallow acquirements , outshine in conversation and on all common occasions the studious youth of loftier abilities , to whom these external advantages have been denied . This tendency of city life , which runs from the highest down to the lowest classes , must be resisted by the instructor with uncompromising sternness . There is another disadvantage under which the cause of education labors in the city , that does not exist , to the same extent at least , in the country . This is to be found in the comparative social position of the teacher . In the society of a respectable country town , the able teacher is known and " honored of all men . " In point of income , he stands on a level , or nearly so , with the leading men of the place , and is able to live with at least the average elegance of his neighbours . With a few favored exceptions , this is not so in a city . We are speaking now , be it remembered , of the teachers in the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our large cities , private instructors who have incomes equal to those of the first class of professional men ; - some even who have accumulated fortunes . And surely no men in any community better deserve success , if desert is to be measured by services rendered to the community . But let us take the salaries paid to the masters of the Boston public schools , and compare them with the incomes of men in business or in the so-called professions . The salaries of ushers and sub-masters may be put aside from the present question , because we presume those places are not generally regarded as permanent . It is a reasonable view to take , that men , who are intrusted with an interest so vitally important as the education of the young , should be placed at ease in their pecuniary circumstances , so that the whole energies of their minds may be devoted to their work . Their salaries should be sufficiently ample to enable them to live with a modest elegance and hospitality , not very far below the average style of the society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to lay up something against the hour of sickness , to which all may , and the infirmities of age , to which all must , come . To do this , it is not necessary that the situations of teachers should be rendered highly lucrative . It may be presumed that the object of the teacher never is mere money-making , // and therein his career differs materially from that of the business man . Then , too , the regularity and certainty of his income are , to a limited extent , compensating circumstances for its smallness ; but it will not do to press this consideration too far . The question with the school authorities should not be , for how small a sum the instruction of youth can be procured ; hut how large a sum will place the instructors on a respectable footing in their worldly circumstances , and enable them to meet the exigencies above enumerated . The tendency in all business communities is to economize in the salaries of public teachers , while it is thought necessary to compensate with liberality the services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees are paid to a distinguished lawyer , for a few moments ' consultation , without a murmur . A confidential clerk receives a salary twice or three times as large as a professor of letters in the University , and at least as large as the most eminent professor of law . The actuary of a life insurance company is paid , for a few hours ' work a day , fobr or five times the salary of a master who has six hundred future hopes of the republic under his charge all the xveary hours from morning to evening . The cashier of a bank enjoys an income as large as is received by all the teachers in the most numerous public school . Noxv is the advice of a lawyer , or the service of a clerk , or the calculation of the actuary , or the money-changing of the cashier , so high a function as the training up of the rising generation of a great city to virtue and knowledge ? Jud0ed by any rational standard , there can be but one answer to this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civic fathers who have it practically to decide . Boston lays claim to the credit of great liberality in the matter of education ; to that credit she is , as compared with other cities , fully entitled . But boxy stands the case , if we apply to her conduct the principles indicated by the foregoing remarks ? Are the instructors in her public schools placed on such a footing , in respect to income , as the importance of their labors deserves ? We believe the answer to this question , which every right-minded man must give , will be an unhesitating No . With the exception of the head-masters of the Latin School and the English High School , whose salaries are barely respectable , the incomes of the public teachers are miserably inadequate . Are the public teachers able to take their // place in society , on a level of respectability with the average of what are called the liberal professiobs ? We pretend to honor the work of the teacher , and to regard it as highly as that of the clergyman , the lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all earnestness , whether our actions correspond with our pretences . How stands the fact ? Can a gentleman , placed at the head of a public school , which occupies his time and thoughts , to the exclusion of all other business , meet the expenses of a family , share in the intercourse of refined society , and put by something against a rainy day , on a salary of fifteen hundred dollars a year , in the city of Boston ? The question answers itself . A bachelor can doubtless do well enou6h upon that income anywhere . It is more even than he deserves . But teachers are not apt to remain bachelors , nor is it desirable that they should . A severe and painful economist , doubtless , by living in a miserable street , where rents are cheap , by denying himself and his family all amusement , by making his wife and daughters do all the servile work of the cook and the chambermaid , by abstainii*g from the purchase of books , by never entertaining friends at his house , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refining influences of life , - may thus . contrive to keep soul and body together , though there can he very little in the partnership to make it mutually desirable ; but it is perfectly plain that the condition of such a man , so far as his salary is concerned , is far below that of the master mechanic or the wholesale grocer . The house-builder and the tenant of a stall in Quincy Market increase in wealth from year to year , and at length buy houses in Beacon street , furnish them with sumptuous Parisian luxury , open their doors to the fashionable world , and place within their children 's reach every refinement of letters and art . This is all right . But where is the head of a public school all this time ? Toiling on from year to year in an employment which , according even to Boston notions , is obscure , while common sense declares it to be most important . When Boston society is spoken of , no person dreams of including in the collective idea the masters and sub-masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from other cities or foreign countries visit Boston , and its elegant hospitalities are extended to them , no one dreams of asking the masters and sub-masters of the public school to share in the social rites by which the stranger is welcomed . // The traveller , who wishes to see the institutions for which Boston is famed , may he taken to the public school , and asked to admire the regularity , order , intelligence , and able management there displayed ; but he to whose talent , accomplishment , industry , skill , and tact these honorable boasts of the city are due , is scarcely thought of in the general claim for the credit which the public makes , and is allowed to assert . In the circle of the saloon , where the stranger is received in the evening , to the delights of cultivated conversation , and where the effect of the scene is heightened by the elegant arts , by the elaborate toilette , by entrancing music , and it may be by the science of the cuisine and the exhilaration of Champagne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sub-masters of the Boston schools ? He will find there the lawyer , all forensic cases laid aside ; the clergyman , in black coat and white cravat ; the banker , forgetful of interest and discounts ; the merchant , respited from the anxieties of the cotton-market and the exchange ; the speculator , fresh from the purchase of stocks which support the i'Jexican war ; the clerk , dismounted from his three-legged stool , his ledger closed and locked up in the iron safe ; the spendthrift even , known to be a useless cumberer of the ground . But in this throng of varied characters who make up what is called preeminently the society of Boston , the master of the public school , who has spent the day in benefiting the moral and intellectual natures of six hundred Boston youth , is not to be found . It does not occur to society that such a man has a claim to their respect , sympathy , and hospitality , so far as these are shown by acting towards him as if he were one of themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of their immediate family and most intimate friends . But the indulgence of this indifference is good neither for body nor mind in any case ; and the teacher needs the relaxation and exhilaration of society in a more especial manner than any other professional man . We say , then , that a community , which truly values the education of the mass of its children , ought to value the services of its public teachers enough to place them , in social estimation , and in the means of a modest elegance of life , not much below the average position of the liberal profcssions . As things are now , the condition of a public teacher is a depressing , exhausting , discouraging // one . There is little in it to make him feel the stimulus of hope for himself and for those who are nearest and dearest to him . The young , the able , and the ambitious see nodiing attractive in the profession . They see the most faithful and zealous condemned to a life of pinching economy and obscurity . The spur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupations , rarely touches the spirit of the teacher in a public school . The prospect of wealth he would be insane to take into the account . As a general rule , the young , the able , and the ambitious will therefore turn their thoughts to other and more brilliant careers . See what a vastly disproportionate share of the talent of this country is drawn into the profession of the law . Now it can not be that the mass of details in legal practice is a whit more liberal or liberalizing than the details of a teacher 's daily routine . But the legal profession stands high in the public estimation . It opens the path which leads to wealth , to honor , to the possibility of the highest honor which the country has to bestow . The reputation of a good lawyer opens the doors of the best society for his admission , and , what he will prize infinitely more than any advantage personal to himself , places his children within the reach of the most desirable associations that any community can furnish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place of public teacher in our city , even under all the discouragernents of the profession . If we venture upon any such rash assertion , the admirable reports named at the head of this article would contradict us point-blank . The talent , skill , and accomplishments now employed in the public schools of Boston , and the success of the teachers ' efforts under the discouragements of their situation and of some fundamental defects in the organization of the schools , are very surprising . But would not the glow of honor and prosperity which the able instructor merits make even these gentlemen feel a greater ardor in the pursuit of the objects of their profession , and devote themselves with even more enthusiasm to the duties of their noble calling ? In making the foregoing observations , we have had in our eye only the schools embraced in the reports . The Boston Latin School is an institution with which the higher education of the city is intimately connected . It has always been the brightest jewel in the crown of the city 's honor . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very Uite of Boston , go forth from its friendly portals , to enter upon the studies of the neighbouring University . The exactness and thoroughness with which the classics have always been taught there , and especially under the present distinguished head and his able corps of associates , have been the chief reliance of the University and the other schools in their efforts to keep the standard of classical learning high . The salaries in this institution , though on a more liberal scale , bear no fair proportion to the talent and labor which the maintenance of the school at its present height of fame imperiously demands . And yet it is not many years since the city , in violation of an implied contract , and in a fit of niggardly and absurd economy , cut down the salaries of the heads of this and the English High School ; and though a return to common sense has put a stop to the injustice , yet the sum honestly due these gentlemen for arrears during the period of repudiating curtailment has not to this day been paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction to a slight notice of the School Reports of 1847 . Topics of this nature scarcely come within the range of a school committee , and it is not therefore surprising that they have received no attention . They force themselves , however , irresistibly upon the notice of one who looks upon the Boston schools from abroad , and who sees reason to sympathize with the peculiar hardships which a city schoolmaster is compelled to bear . To exhaust the subject , which we feel to be one of immense importance to the welfare of every American city , would far transcend our limits ; we must therefore content ourselves with these brief hints of a general nature , and now confine what we have further to say to the pamphlet before us . At the head of the sub-committee that made the report on the Grammar Schools stands the name of George B. Emerson , - a gentleman identified with the intellectual progress of the city for nearly a quarter of a century . To speak of his merits as they deserve will belong , at some very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But without trenching on the reserve proper on the present occasion , we may say , that his long experience , his profound acquaintance with the subject , and his searching intellect give an authoritative weight to his opinions on education . This report is distin // guisbed for clearness of arrangement , and the intelligible manner in which the condition of the schools is described , the scrupulous and discriminating justice with which the labors of the several instructors are set forth , the care with which all the circumstances in the situation of the schools and the character of the scholars which ought to influence the judgment formed upon the teachers ' course are explained , and , what is of more importance beyond the limits of the city , for the general reflections incidentally thrown in . The pamphlet consists of a general view of the appearance of the schools , which occupies the first eighteen pages ; then a particular account of each of twenty schools , as ascertained by oral examination , conducted for the most part by the mcmiihers of the committee . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the System of two independent Heads in the Grammar Schools , Text-Books , Vagrant Children , and Intermediate Schools . The remainder of the document , from the sixty-fifth page to the end , is occupied by " tables of the questions proposed at the examination of the Grammar Schools , together with the character of the answers given to each question in the several schools . " To the friend of education , all these details are of the highest interest . It is due to the teachers of the Grammar Schools to say , that the general results , stated by the committee with perfect impartiality , are most honorable to their fidelity and talents . On the mode of examination , the committee make these impartial remarks " In their first visits , the Committee endeavoured to ascertain , by personal questioning and inspection , the condition of the schools in respect to the instruction given and the progress made in reading , grammar , geography , and history ; the examination being , in all cases , and , with few exceptions , throughout , conducted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination gives but a partial view of the condition of a school . The oral examination , to be completely just and satisfactory , ought to be in part conducted by the Committee and in part by the teacher . The point reached , the attainments made in each study , may be ascertained by a Committee , by means of questions put by themselves , while the teachers are looking on as spectators . But other points not less important , - the language , the manner , and the spirit of the teacher , the intelligence , vivacity , and thoroughness of his teaching , and the mental habits // formed in the learner by the process , can only be learnt by seeing and hearing the teacher conduct the examination of his own classes , uninterrupted and uninfluenced by the Committee . Both these modes , the Committee , in the four , or , at most , five hours spent in any one school , had not always an opportunity to adopt . It was only in certain schools that the readiness and rapidity of the answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode of instruction employed by the teacher . " - p. 7 . The remarks that follow , on reading , are judicious and excellent . To the truth of the plain and weighty considerations embraced in the passage we now quote every reflecting person must give his assent . " If history is to be taught at all , it is to be taught well and understandingly . But it certainly is not an indispensable study . If the question were , whether a child should be taught to read fluently and intelligently , and with such ease that reading should be a delightful recreation , for the rest of his life ; should learn so much of grammar and language as to be able always to express himself , in speech and writing , correctly and with facility ; so much of geography as to know what is most essential in the physical features and products , and the character and present condition of the inhabitants , of all important parts of the globe ; and so much of his own structure and economy as to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; - or , omitting any one of these , or learning it very ill , should substitute therefor so much of history as is contained in any one small volume ; we suppose there are few , who , regarding the future comfort , usefulness , and welfare of the learner , would not say , without much hesitation , that the first four of these are of indispensable importance ; that the latter is very desirable , - but , if either is to be left out , it must be the study of history . Wisely , therefore , have School Committees here and elsewhere acted , in requiring the first three studies to be introduced into the schools in the order in which they are here set down ; and wisely , we think , will they act hereafter , if they require the study of physiology to take precedence of all others except these indispensable three . " The early periods of instruction should be employed in cultivating the powers of the mind as extensively as possible , and , while so doing , in getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those facts should be learnt first which are most essential to the physical , mental , and moral well-being of the individual . A woman might be an excellent mother of a family , and yet know nothing at all about the causes of the // French or the American Revolution . She could not , except by accident , bring up her children with healthy minds and bodies , unless she were acquainted with the importance of pure air and a wholesome diet , and the indispensable necessity of good physical and moral habits . The mother of the Davidsons might have been fully acquainted with all the histories ever written , and yet her children mi , *rht have perished as they did . But those daughters might have been now alive to be ornaments and blessings to society , if the mother had been acquainted with that simple law of physiology which forbids premature and excessive exercise of the mental faculties . " - pp. 15 , 16 . There is much practical sense in these few sentences - " Every thing connected with the school-house has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its beauty elevates and improves their taste . Its convenient arrangement fosters in them the principle and the love of order . Its ample space , well ventilated , gives a healthful play to their lungs . Its costliness naturally tends to make them value the opportunities they enjoy , and to look with greater respect upon the man who has the control of so noble an establishment , and with a warmer feeling of patriotism towards the city and State by which such liberal accommodations are made for their convenience and improvement . These circumstances tend to form an honest pride ; they contribute towards the building up of a high character and a lofty standard of action . " - pp. 35 , 36 . From the essay on Moral Instruction we copy a most pregnant passage . " In the schools for citizens , the duties of citizens should be taught . There are certain points which ought to be presented to the minds of children , and that forcibly and frequently , not only by the life and example , but in the language of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not he neglected . The infinite value of a love of truth , of justice , of integrity , of fidelity in contracts , of industry , of personal purity , of charitableness in judgment , should be pointed out , and earnestly inculcated . The reciprocal relations and duties of parents and children , of employers and employed , of masters and servants , of buyers and sellers , should be explained and enforced . The duty of self.control , of self-education , of improving all one 's faculties , of economy in the use of time ; the beauty of generosity , of kindness and courtesy , and of an honorable and manly character ; the value of diligence and of knowledge ; the excellence of good habits and the danger of bad // ones ; the shamefulness of foul , indecent , and profane language ; the cowardliness of deception , and the baseness of imposing upon the weak and the simple , - all these things should be taught in every good school . But in public schools , like ours , which bring together children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction , even of the lowest kind , the consequences and the punishments of pilfering , of false witness , of false swearing , and of the other violations of the laws of God and of the land , ought to be pointed out with terrible distinctness . " - pp. 39 , 40 . We close our extracts with the following paragraphs from the same portion of the document . " In looking over the studies now pursued , with reference to the question , Are they the best which we could devise as preparatory for the business of life ? - it must be admitted that there are some important exceptions . The study of physiology ought to be introduced , especially into the girls ' schools , and the practice of drawing and the study of geometry , into those for boys . " Education , such as that of our common schools , the education of the whole community , should do what can be done to qualify children , first and particularly , for those labors and duties which are most important and universal . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of the nurture and rearing of the coming generation . To them will be committed the care of the bodies , the minds , and the character , at the most impressible period of life , when the body is formed to vigor and health , the mind to action , and the character to energy and virtue , or to effeminacy and vice . They are destined to be , to the race , guardians in health , and nurses in sickness . In the schools , therefore , something should be done to qualify them for these offices . There are laws of the structure of their own bodies , which the Maker of those bodies has established ; laws of nature , laws of life and health , which the Author of nature has made . These laws are not numerous , nor difficult to be understood . They have that admirable simplicity which marks their authorship ; hut they are unspeakably important . These laws children , especially girls , should learn . They should learn the properties of the air they breathe , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold and of heat , of light and of darkness ; the vital importance of well-ventilated rooms , of cleanliness , of warm clothing , of wholesome food and a healthy digestion , of temperance both in food and drink , of moderation in labor and in study , and of regular physical habits , and the 39* // dan ers of all excess . They should learn enough of the structure of their own body , and the influences of external nature which act upon it , to he led to perceive , in after years , when they come to reflect , the infinite consonance between the commandments which have been revealed to them , and the laws of the world which has been made for them ; that they may not he left to doubt whether either the one or the other are fortuitous or fantastical , the offspring of a blind chance or of an unfeeling necessity .
