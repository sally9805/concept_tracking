txt Tun great men of a country form the most valuable part of its possessions . They are the sources of its truest pride , and from them are drawn its best claims to honor and remembrance . Without them , material prosperity has no dignity , and commands no respect . Without them , the history of a nation has nothing that quickens , elevates or inspires ; nothing that kindles the mind with an emulating glow . It is a dead level of monotonous mediocrity , with no land-mark minds to arrest the eye , and stamp their own character upon the region around them . And in proportion to the value of great men should be our sense of their presence when living , and our memory of their services when dead . We should honor them by respect , by observance , by imitation , and by regret . We should gather up the fragments of their lives and conversation , that nothing may be lost .

It is good for us to dwell upon the life , the services , of such a man . lie deserves well of his country x ho diffuses among its people a knowledge of what he was and what he did . Joseph Story was born in Marblehead , in the State of Massachusetts , on the 18th day of September , 1779 , and was the eldest child of a second marriage .

JUSTICE STORY . grateful for the gift of such a son , and mourn over that decree of Providence which has called upon her to perform those last sad services for him , which , in the course of nature , he should have performed for her . His childhood and early youth passed by without any noticeable events . He was prepared for college in his native town , and entered Harvard University in 1795 , half a year in advance . His collegiate life was , in all respects , highly honorable to him . He was a diligent and faithful student of the lirescribed course , and found time , in addition , to range over a wide field of English literature . He fell into none of the moral dangers incident to the place , and to his period of life . His cordial , simple and affectionate nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom were Dr. Channing and Dr. Tuckerman-names so widely known and so highly honored-both of whom have gone before him " from sunshine to the sunless land . " He was graduated , with distinguished honors , in 1798 . The profession of the law had been his early and only choice , and immediately after leaving college he entered upon its study , first at Marblehead , in the office of the late Chief Justice Sewall , and afterwards at Salem , in the office of Mr. Justice Putnam . He studied the law with vigorous assiduity , and that ardor of purpose which was so conspicuous a trait in his character through life . Having completed his probationary studies , he was admitted to the bar in 1801 , and commenced the practice of the law in the town of Salem . The stormy politics of that period are fresh in the memory of many persons now living . The democratic party had triumphed in the national election , and seated its chief , Mr. Jefferson , in the Presidential chair , though many of the States , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in these States the struggles for political supremacy were particularly vehement and impassioned . Mr. Story took his place in the ranks of the democratic party . The explanation of this step is to be found in his ardent temperament , // his want of experience , his consequent over-estimate of the virtue of man , and ignorance of the disturbing influences of passion and selfishness . His democracy was the dream of a young and pure mind , glowing with visions of an ideal Commonwealth , which were to be realized by the removal of all restraints , and by leaving men free to indulge their natural impulses . He formed his judgment of these impulses by the generous promptings of his own breast ; and were all men what he at that time imagined them to be , and wbat he himself was , democracy is the creed which the old would approve and the wise would embrace . The Federalists were at that time , as we have before said , the predominant party in Massachusetts , and nearly all the men of wealth and influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the unpopular politics of Mr. Story exposed him to mortifications and neglects which were sufficiently wounding to his sensitive and sympathetic nature . Such , however , was the force of his industry , his capacity , his attention to business , and his cordial and attractive manners-so general was the conviction of the sincere conscientiousness of his Views , that the rigor of political prejudice hegan gradually to be relaxed in his favor . He gathered around him good clients , and , what was better , good friends . In 1805 , he was elected one of the Representatives of the town of Salem , in the Legislature of Massachusetts , to which office he was annually re&amp;ected till his appointment to the bench . His professional reputation , his industry , his tact in the management of business , and his powers as a public speaker , soon made him the acknowledged leader of his party in the House of Representatives ; and , in this capacity , he was called upon to defend the embarno policy of Mr. Jefferson , in 1808 , against the resolutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of talent and influence , and especially by the distinguished ahilities and honorable name of Christopher Gore , then in the fullness of his powers and at the height of his reputation . The gallant manner in which Mr. Story dischar0 ed this difficult trust extorted the admiration of his political opponents , and is still well remembered by many who witnessed his effbrts . He was not , however , the slave of party , and the manly independence he showed , on more than one occasion , is a proof that the democracy of a former age was not , in all respects , like the democrack of our times . In 1806 , a vacancy occurred in the office of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts . The unrivaled legal eminence of Theophilus Parsons , at that time in extensive practice in Boston , made it highly desirable , on public grounds , that he should receive the appointment , and it was accordingly tendered to him . He consented to take it , hut only upon condition that the salary should be made honorable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been neither the one nor the other . The democratic party were then in power in Massachusetts , and it was well understood that the proposed change would encounter strong opposition from them , both hecause they were no friends to the judiciary , and because Mr. Parsons was peculiarly obnoxious to them , as an uncompromising Federalist , whose powerful talents were always at the service of his party , in the hour of need . But the proposition met the cordial approbation of Mr. Story . As a lawyer , he was able to appreciate the eminent legal abilities of Mr. Parsons and the important services which he would render to the State , in a judicial capacity .. He generously waived all his political prepossessions , took charge of the proposed measure in the House of Representatives , and carried it successfully through , mainly by the force of his personal influence , and in spite of the opposition of his own party . The honorable spectricle of a leader of one political party exerting his talents and influence to elevate a leader of the opposite party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often witnessed , and should be esteemed in proportion to its rare occurrence . Nor did Mr. Story 's magnanimous disdain of mere party considerations stop here . Mr. Parsons accepted the appointment of Chief Justice , and the manner in which he discharged the duties of his office was such as to satisfy the highest expectations of the bar and the liubhic . But be found the salary insufficient for the support of his family , and in 1809 he came to the determination of resigning his seat upon the bench and resuming his lucrative practice , at the bar , unles his salary were considerably increased . At this time , the democratic party had a majority in both branches of the Legislature of Massachusetts , and , like their loco-foco successors in the same State , // would rather lower the salaries of ten judges , than increase that of one . The patriotism of Mr. Story was again appealed to , and not in vain . He accordingly reported a bill to enlarge the salaries of all the judges , and was the chief speaker in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an unusual degree of excitement , and in which he was not spared by his political friends . His honorable course , however , was again crowned wtth success , and by his means , chiefly , the valuable judicial services of Chief Justice Parsons were secured for the remainder of his life , a benefit not only to the State of Massachusetts , but to the whole Union , so large an influence have the judgments of that eminent man had upon the jurisprudence of America . These events in his life , though their scene and immediate influence were local and not national , deserve to be commemorated , as they do so much credit to his independence of character . The conduct of the party to which he belonged may also be honorably contrasted with that of the democratic legislature of Massachusetts in 1843 , which reduced the salaries of all the judges-an act not more in violation of the Constitution of Massachusetts , than a departure from sound republican principles . While in the legislature , Mr. Story drew up an able report in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforced the passage of a law in accordance with it . But the jealousy which the legislature of Massachusetts has always felt on the subject of chancery powers , defeated this , as it has many similar measures since . In 1809 , Mr. Story was elected a Representative in Congress to supply the vacancy in Essex , south district , occasioned by the death of Mr. Crowninshield . He served only for the remainder of the term for which he was chosen , and declined a reelection , deeming the agitations of political life incompatible with that devotion to professional pursuits , without which high success can never be obtained . While in Congress he associated his name with two measures , both of which were distasteful to the great leader of the Democratic party . One of these was a motion made by himself for a committee to consider the expediency of a gradual increase of the navy , which he enforced in an eloquent and elaborate speech . This proposition was defeated by a strict party vote , the rank and file of the democracy following the lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of national defence his admirers do not now pretend to conceal or defend . He also gave his animated support to the proposition for the repeal of the embargo . He had defended this measure , in the legislature of Massachusetts , tos a temporary expedient , preparatory to further acts which should , in some way or other , settle the questions at issue between the two countries ; but he was wholly opposed to it as a scheme of permanent policy , and contemplated with lively alarm the ruin and misery which must of necessity spring from it . Mr. Jefferson was much displeased with this opposition to his favorite scheme , and he ascribed the repeal of the embargo mainly to Mr. Story 's influence . The injury was not forgotten or forgiven , and Mr. Story is accordingly complimented with the epithet of " pseudo-republican , " in a letter addressed by Mr. Jefferson to General Dearborn , contained in the fourth volume of his printed works . Mr. Story never was a " republicans ' in Mr. Jefferson 's sense of th4t word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the House of Representatives of Massachusetts , and he held that office , till his appointment to the bench . For this place he was extremely well qualified by his knowledge of forms , his quickness of mind , his excellent temper and his courteous manner , and be discharged its duties in a way which met the unqualified approbation of all parties . Though Mr. Story , at the time of his appointment to the bench , had become a conspicuous public man , politics had by no means formed the object of most engrossing interest to him . His profession had been a subject of paramount importance , and to this his time and thoughts had been chiefly devoted . He loved the law , and studied it with the ardor and perseverance which a relish for the pursuit alone could inspire . The business which was intrusted to him was always promptly , ably and conscientiously discharged . He threw himself into the cause of his clients with his characteristic zeal and energy , was sagacious in the management of causes , self-possessed at critical moments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury , and in his arguments to the court thorough , learned and profound . Such a man was not left to languish in obscurity , nor // could his unpopular politics cover with a cloud his shining merits . The sagacious merchants and farmers of Essex found that their most important interests might safely be intrusted to his zealous and able hands , and soon after his admission business began to flow in upon him in a copious stream . In a very few years he was retained in causes of the first magnitude , and measured his powers with such antagonists as no lawyer , living or dead , could venture to disdain ; as Mr. Dane , Judge Prescott , Judge Putnam , Judge Jackson , and Mr. Mason of NewHampshire . At the time of his elevation to the bench , his professional inc6me was not less than five tho*usand dollars a-year ; a very large sum , considering the place and the period . Notwithstanding his laborious and extensive practice , he had not forgotten to pay a part of that debt which every lawyer owes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selection of Pleadings in civil actions , with valuable annotations of his own , a work carefully and accurately compiled , and after the lapse of forty years still resorted to as a safe and trusty guide . In 1809 he edited Chitty 's treatise on Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes , with a large body of original notes . which was well received by the legal profession . In the following year , he also prepared for the press an edition of Abbott 's excellent work on Shipping , with copious notes and references toAmerican Statutes and decisions . Of this work , he also published an enlarged and improved edition after his elevation to the bench . During the early period of his life , his walks were not wholly confined to the thorny paths of jurisprudence . He had that fine organization and lively sense of beauty which mark the poetical temperament , which would not have failed to give him the same eminence in literature as he attained in law , had the former been his ultimate choice . While in college he wrote verse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise his poetical talents . A year or two after leaving college he published a po* etical work , of some considerable extent , called the " Power of Solitude , * ' showing a good deal of skill in versification , and a genuine warmth of poetic feeling . His sterner studies and avocations soon called him away from the haunts of the muses though he never lost his facility of versification , as some exquisite verses , written late in life upon a painful domestic bereavement , amply testify . To the close of his life , the reading of the best of the English poets formed the favorite relaxation of his leisure hours , and he ever retained the liveliest sense of their peculiar beauties . In November , 1811 , the place of associate justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of the United States , became vacant by the death of Judge Cushing of Scituate . The post was tendered to Mr. John Quincy Adams , then in Russia , and by him declined ; whereupon Mr. Story was appointed to the place . Thus , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a judicial function of the highest dignity and importance , called upon to decide causes of great magnitude and interest , and to administer all the branches of the common law-in addition to admiralty and equity law , both of which in England are under the charge of separate tribunals-besides constitutional law , a department almost indigenous to the soil of our country , and taking precedence of all other in interest , grandeur and extent of influence . We are not aware that the annals of the common law afford any parallel instance of an advantement to so high a tribunal at so early an age . The professional reputation of Mr. Story entitled him fairly , as among the lawyers of his own party , to this high honor , notwithstanding his youth ; but it is not to be disguised that the appointment occasioned some uneasiness and alarm , throughout the first circuit , especially among the graver and elder members of the Federal party . It was quite unprecedented to see so young a man in a seat so long and so indissolubly associated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered , too , as the able and fearless advocate of political opinions , often warmly embraced by the young and the ardent , but not in favor , as a general rule , with the men who held the property of New England , who , of course , were the most interested in the pure and impartial administration of justice . The commencement of his judicial career was therefore carefully and anxiously watched by those whose rights and property were most likely to be influenced by hi* official judgment . But whatever of apprehension or uneasiness there may have been in the minds of any portion of the community , was dissipated by the first observation of his conduct upo.n the bench . It was seen // qwq employed in navigation , gave rise also to a variety of perplexing questions in admiralty law , involving the rights of shipowners , ship-masters and seamen , and the claims of salvors , which were to be adjudicated by a system of law then comparatively in its infancy , ill-defined and imperfectly understood . This was always with Mr. Justice Story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicial career , he investigated the origin , and expounded the leading principles , of admiralty law , in his celebrated judgment in De Lovio vs . Boit , 2 Gallison , 398 , in which , his reasoning has never been answered , though his conclusions have often been assailed . In a variety of subsequent judgments , these principles were applied with singular sagacity , clearness and consistency , and with inexhaustible affluence of learning , to the numerous and intricate cases which came before him . Thus mainly by his labors and those of his illustrious contemporary , Lord Stowell , in England , has been formed a department , of law , alike beautiful from the symmetry of its structure and the harmony of its proportions , and useful from the facility with which its principles may be applied to the actual exigencies of life . We believe that no unprejudiced lawyer ever passed from the barbarous jargon , the frivolous distinctions , the scholastic subtlety , the solemn nonsense and the impudent fictions which disfigure such considerable portions of the common law , into the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without experiencing a relief similar to that telt by the early navigators when they bad passed the dark and stormy bourne of Cape Horn and reached into the smooth seas and gentle gales of the Pacific . His duties as presiding Judge of the New England Circuit also required him to administer , and indeed almost to create , another important branch of law . A phrenological peculiarity of the Yankee skull is the great size of the organ of constructiveness . They are a toolmaking , machine-contriving and laborsaving race . A Yankee without mechanical ingenuity is as rare a bird as a thriftless Scotchinan or a canny Irishman . So curious and magical are the machines which we have witnessed  --  the growth of that soil-that we should hardly be surprised to hear of an inventive genius emerging from an obscure New England village , and carrying up to Boston a model of that long-sought and visionary mill , which , at the turning of a crank , shall convert a live sheep into felt hats , a skin of morocco and four quarters of mutton . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a v*ery large proportion of the patent causes of the whole country were tried before the tribunal of the first circuit . The patent law , at the commencement of his judicial career , was in a most imperfect state , and perplexeiwith the contradictory decisions of English judges , struggling between their sense of justice and the fair principles of interpretation on the one hand , and the influence of the common law doctrines of monopoly on the other . The constructive and creative power of Mr. Justice Story 's mind was largely employed in the gradual building up of that admirable fabric of patent law by which the rights of inventors and patentees are now secured and defined , and which is becoming more and more important with the rapid growth of the country , and especially with the extension of its manufacturing interests . The enlightened principles of equity jurisprudence were always congenial to his mind , and he was soon called upon to apply and expound them judicially . With how much of learning and ability this was done , is well known to the legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masterly treatises on this subject , subsequently published , which he was not called upon to examine and explain in a judicial capacity . , His judgments in equitable cases are of especial value to the student and the practitioner for their ( lepth of learning , their variety of illustration , and their comprehensive treatment of the points under discussion . He always encouraged the , study of equity jurisprudence among the members of the legal profession , and saw with pleasure its growing importance and the more frequent recourse which was had to it , in the settlement of litigated questions . He delighted in its generous and liberal principles , in the flexibility of the instruments which it used to accomplish the ends ' of justice , and in its superiority to narrow technicalities . He also devoted himself to the study of constitutional law with the assidurty which its paramount importance required . To this department his attention had not been particularly called while at the bar , and some curiosity , not to say anxiety , was felt as to how far he would sustain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as is well known , were not approved by the great body of the democratic party . That he cordially embraced them , and enforced them with the earnestness and power of genuine conviction , is now matter of history ; and this departure from the creed of the party with whom he had been associated while at the bar , is most honorable to his candor and independence , and may we not further add that it furnishes a strong ar*iment in favor of the soundness of the principles of constitutional interpretation of the Marshall school ? His constitutional judgments were always most elaborately and carefully prepared , and are worthy of assiduous study , not only from their intrinsic excellence , but as showing so different an intellectual structure from that of the Chief Justice . To watch the processes by which two differing minds arrive at the same results is always interesting . It will be time well employed on the part of the student to read , with this view , the judgments of these two eminent men in the Dartmouth College case , 4 Wheaton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . His power as a constitutional lawyer may be felt with peculiar force in those cases in which he dilThred from the majority of his brethren upon the bench , as in the case of the Warren bridge , 11 Peters , 420 . Without presuming to give an op ? nion as to the soundness of the principles laid down by the majority of the court , no one can help admitting the infinite superiority of the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Story in learning , grasp of principle and vigorous reasoning . Besides the various departments of jurisprudence which we have enumerated , there remains the great body of the common law , which in all its branches he was required to administer and interpret . Every region and province of the common law was to him familiar ground . He was not , like many judges , strong in some of its departments and weak in others ; but he had mastered all its various learning , and was everywhere at home . The various modifications of commercial law , including the law of insurance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , partnership and bailments , were the branches most congenial to his taste ; but his judgments upon questions of real law , criminal law and special pleading , were distinguished by the same fullness of learning and untiring patience in research as those upon questions of commercial law . From a study of his reported judgments , alone , it would be impossible to infer that he had any preference for one kind of law over another . A luminous and profound discussion upon a point of insurance law will be followed by one equally luminous and profound upon some technical question of real law , and this latter by a learned examination of some knotty rule in special pleading . We certainly know of no instance of any judge who attained so high an eminence in so many departments of the law ; who was entitled to be ranked with Lord Stowell as an expounder of admiralty and prize law , with Sir William Grant and Lord Cottenham as an equity lawyer , and with Lord Denman and Baron Parke as a con*mon law judge . In regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compare him with . Herein he stands alone , with no rival near the throne . His judgments , as presiding judge of the first circuit , are contained in two volumes of Gallison 's Reports , five of Mason 's , three of Sumner 's , and two of Story 's ; and all the judgments in these volumes were delivered by him . Besides these , he contributed rather more than his natural proportion to the reports of the Supreme Court , contained in Cranch , Wheaton , Peters and Howard . These volumes , taken together , form no inconsiderable law lihrary , and he who would thoroughly master their contents would make himself an excellent lawyer . Of his judgments , taken as a whole , it is certainly not too much . to say that they have no superior in the English language ; and were the writer to express his own individual opinion , it would be couched in even stronger terms of commendation than these . He was equally conspicuous for his excellence as a nisi prius jndg* . His quickness of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statement had been fairly made by the counsel , and he was as correct in the conclusions to which he came as he was rapid in reaching them . His vast stores of learning were always at command , and he had never occasion to hesitate a moment in the decision of the points which arose in the course of a trial . His manner was courteous , assuring and bland , especially to the young , the timid and the sensitive . There was always a genial atmosphere in his court . No one who came before him had to fear any of // those judicial coups de patte which are so lacerating to a thin skin , and add so much to the annoyance of a had cause and an unreasonable client . They who knew him well could sometimes read in his face signs of weariness at the thrice-told repetitions of some prosing advocate , but no expression of impatience ever escaped his lips . Like all men of powerful abilities upon the bench , he sometimes incurred the charge of arguing a case to the jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe there was much that was unreasonable and exaggerated . In his charges to the jury he was always full and minute , and disposed of all the questions of law that had arisen in the course of the trial unreservedly and fearlessly ; and in doing this it was hardly possible for him not to hold up to the jury , from his own point of view , those facts to which the principles of law were applied . There is also another consideration to be adverted to on this point . The advocate who closes for the plaintiff is very apt to introduce some new point , or some new modification of a point previously made ; and when this was done , he felt himself at liherly to reply to it in his charge to the jury , and generally did so . In regard to his own relations to the causes that were tried before him , he was certainly not of the opinion of John 1-lorne Tooke , who , when on trial for treason , said that the whole matter was between him and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescribed duties , neither of which were to affect his rights . The life of Mr. Justice Story , from the time of his appointment to the bench till that of his removal to Cambridge and the commencement of a new sphere of activity , flowed on in a tranquil and uneventful course . It was a busy , an honorable and a happy life . His judicial duties afforded constant occupation to the highest faculties of his mind , and yet left him considerable time for study , for social satisfactions , and for the discharge of those various claims of society from which the highest are not exempt in our community . He was constantly adding to the stores of his legal learning , and his industrious habits and orderly disposition of time enabled him to keep pace with the current literature of the day . He was eminently happy in his domestic relations , though his affectionate nature was severely tried by the loss of many children  --  a hereavement which he bore as a Christian , though he felt as a man . The simple and pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his taste than all the gratifications which the world could minister to him . When he crossed his own threshold , all the care and weariness of life vanished from his heart and his brow ; and the animation of his smile , and the cheerful vivacity of his tone and manner , showed that he always found there the air of peace . He was so much attached to his home that the only element in his lot which he could have wished to change , was the necessity of an annual separation from his family , required by his attendance upon the Supreme Court at Washington . He was happy , too , in a wide circle of loving and honoring friends , and in the respect and confidence which followed his steps wherever he ' moved . He always took a lively interest in the progress of the society in which he lived , and never stood coldly aloof when big talents and influence were required in a cause which he approved . His miscellaneous labors in this period of life would alone have redeemed a man from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a eulogy upon Capt . Lawrence , of the frigate Chesapeake . The elaborate memorial of the merchants of Salem against the Tariff ; in 1820 , was drawn up by him . In 1821 , he delivered an address before the members of the Suffolk Bar , which was published in the American Jurist , in 1829. and has been republished in England in Clark 's Cabinet Library of Scarce and Celebrated Tracts . In 1835 , he pronounced the annual disconrse before the Phi Beta Kappa Society of Harvard University ; a performance marked by a flowing and persuasive eloquence , and showing a familiar acquaintance with the best literature of the age . In 1828 , he delivered the centennial address upon the two hundredth Anniversary of the town of Salem , a beautiful discourse , happy in the choice of topics and in the manner of tre1ating them . The paragraph upon the fate of the Indians , in particular , we would specify as adorned by the best graces of poetry and eloquence . He wrote biographical sketches of Samuel Dexter , Mr. Justice Trimble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Pinckney , and Thomas A. Emmet . He contrihuted to the North American Review several elaborate papers on legal subjects . In the " Encyclopiedia Americana , " the titles Congress , Contract , Courts of the United // States , Criminal Law , Capital Punishment , Domicil , Equity , Jury , Lien , Law , Legislation and Codes , Natural Law , National Law , Prize , Usury , were furnished by him . To the above may be added his impressive charge to the Grand Jury at Portland , in 1821 , on the horrors of the slave-trade . No inconsiderable portion of his time and thoughts was given to the interests of his alma mater , the University in Cambridge , to which he was ever attached by the strong ties of filial love and reverence . In 1818 , he was elected an overseer of the College , and in 1825 , was chosen a Fellow of the Corporation . ta January , 1825 , whileyet an overseer , he delivered , and afterwards published , an argument against the memorial of the professors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Corporation , full of curious and recondite learning , upon a subject which , we believe , was never before discussed in America . In 1829 , an important change took place in his life , materially adding to his duties and widening the sphere of his usefulness . In that year , the Hon. Nathan Dane , of Beverly , a name never to be mentioned without a sentiment of respect for his services and labors as a legislator and a jurist , proposed to give a new impulse to that study of sound law which he felt to be so important an element in the permanence of free states , by the foundation of a professorship of law in Harvard University . He made it a condition of the endowment , willingly acceded to by the authorities of the University , that be should nominate the first incumbent of the Chair , and Mr. Justice Story accordingly became the first Dane Professor of Law , and the head of the Law Department of the University . Mr. Dane had previously obtained his consent to the proposed arrangement ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been carried into effect . Mr. Justice Story accordingly , in that year , removed with his family to Cambridge , where he resided during the remainder of his life , actively engaged in the duties of the Professor 's chair . For this new trust he had singular qualifications , giving distinct assurance of the splendid success which soon followed the school , and amply justifying the prophetic sagacity of Mr. Dane . His reputation was widely diffused over the whole United States , and his name was a source of interest and attraction in its most re Biographical Notice of *r . Justice Story . Jan. , mote borders . His unrivaled stores of learning extorted the admiration of all who were capable of measuring them . But neither his fame nor his learning , nor yet both combined , would have fitted him for a teacher of law . Without other qualifications , his wealth of learning might have been as useless to his pupils as the hoarded gold of the miser to the beg*ar at his gate . But so remarkable were his powers of teaching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his learnin0 was the least of the gifts which he brought to that office . It is related of Dugald Stewart , that when very young he taught a mathematical class with singular success , which he explained , by saying that he was only one lesson in advance of his pupils . in like manner , had Mr. Justice Story 's legal attainments borne the same relation to those of his pupils , we have no doubt that he would have taught them faithfully and well . Every one who has had occasion to observe the relation between the teacher and the taught , knows that the most important requisite in a teacher-that which is absolutely indispensable-is an element not easily defined but instantly recognized , a mysterious power over the mind , depending , in a very considerable rlegree , upon natural organization , the want of which can never be supplied , though the faculty itself , like all others , is capable of improvement and cultivation . This quality he had in a preiiminent degree . There was a magnetism in his manner which secured the fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperament was active , cheerful and buoyant . He threw off the weight of official toil as a strong swimmer flings aside the invading wave . No amount of labor depressed his spirit , or hung heavy upon the natural beatings of his heart . His mind was ever salient , animated and vivacious . Like alt men of simple character and habits , he preserved to the last the freshness of his tastes and his relish for the common pleasures of life . In his unoccupied moments , his spirits were ever those of a school-boy on a holiday . When to these gifts are added the purely physical recommendations of a countenance regular , flexible and expressive , beaming with intelligence and benevolence , an animated movement of person , the most cordial and winning of smiles , and a ready joyous and contagious laugh , his power and persuasiveness as a teacher of law may well be imagined . // In his oral instructions he did not confine himself to the written page of the text-book . He made that a point of departure , and explained its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his great learning and singular power of illustration were seen to the happiest advanta0e . As he loved the law himself , so he inspired in others that love of law which is as much more to be desired than any amount of legal learning , as a fountain is more inexhaustible than a cistern . It was a hopeless case for the student who did not catch from his instructions the enthusiasm with which they were so pervaded . Many lawyers , now in successful practice , can trace hack to his influence , his example and his teachings , their taste for the law , their mastery of its difficulties , and the cheerful confidence that sustained them in those trying years , when their only service was " to stand and wait . " And as lie was a faithful and fervent teacher of law , so he also was a teacher of better things even than law . By his eloquent precepts and his spotless example , he impressed upon his pupils a deep sense of the beauty of a virtuous life ; that all professional triumphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to be a great lawyer , it was requisite first to be a good man . lie had an intolerant scorn for the low and dirty tricks which convert the science which should he a shelter and a defence , into a pitfall and a snare . How would his countenance glow with generous indignation , if he had occasion to speak of the lawyer who ventured to minister at the altar of justice with unclean hands . lie delighted , too , to inculcate a respect for law itself , for its ministers and constituted authorities , for all ranks of the magistracy , and even for the forms and symbols which serve as the ligatures of society . He reverenced nil institutions which wore the venerable aspect of time . He knew the " strength of backward-looking thoughts . " He felt how ephemeral a creature man would he , without the ties which link him to the past and the future . He was fond of speaking of the great men who had lived before him , into whose immortal fellowship he is now received-of Ames , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dexter , and Piuckney , and Marshall-of their virtues , their intellectual features , their services , their peculiar traits of character , the elements of which their being was moulded ; and his glowing praise inspired a love of those excellences which had hallowed their images in his memory . He had a particular respect for those qualities in men which have a tendency to preserve the good order of states , to strengthen the foundations of government , and to give permanence to institutions . He sometimes feared that there were not conservative elements among us , sufficiently strong to counteract the disorganizing influence of the ignorance of the many and the selfishness of the few ; and with the whole force of his energetic nature , he denounced the men of talents and education , who lent themselves to destroy what they ought to have upheld . The relations between him and his pupils were always of the most friendly and familiar character . Retaining so much of youthful freshness himself , he delighted in the conversation and society of the young . It was easy for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his personal friend , to claim his sympathy and advice , and have the claim allowed . When they left the school , he still followed their fortunes with affectionate interest , and their success in life was ever a source of happiness and self-congratulation . The rapid increase of the law school surpassed the highest expectations of its friends . Commencing with less than twenty pupils , its numbers gradually swelled till they amounted to more than one hundred and sixty . Its graduates , now engaged in active life throughout the country , are several hundreds in number , all of whom recall with affectionate interest the image of their revered and beloved instructor , and most of whom have had their minds and characters sensibly moulded by his teachings and his precelits . How important his relation thus was to the whole country , will he understood by those who will represent to themselves the influence of such a body of instructed , intelligent and able young men , upon the society in which they move . Among the duties assigned to the Dane professor was the delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the law of nations , marine and commercial law , equity law , and the constitutional law of the United States . The discharge of this duty led naturally to the preparation of that admirable series of judicial works which have done so much for the diffusion of his own fame , and the honor of American jurisprudence . The first fruit // of his labors in the chair was the publication of his " Commentaries on the Law of Bailments , " which contains not only all the common law learning upon this subject , but all that is valuable and important in the writings of the civilians whose works he had studied with the unabated ardor of his earlier years . This work was followed , in 1833 , by his " Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States , " in three volumes , comprising a sketch of the charters , constitutional history and jurisprudence of the British American Colonies , a historyand synopsis of the confederation of the States , a history of the adoption of the present Constitution , and a minute exposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning , full of the results of sound political wisdom and careful observation of the history of the country . in 1834 , appeared the " Commentaries upon the Conflict of Laws , " which we may venture to pronounce the most able , original and profound of his legal writings . It is a work of the highest order , and would alone entitle the author to a place in the first class of jurists . There was no similar work before it in the English language , and consequently no guiding landmarks to aid the writer in his extensive researches . His materials were to be gathered from a mass of conflicting decisions , and especially from a frowning array of foreign writers , whose learned treatises were not even known by name to nine-tenths of the English orAmerican bar . The various , deep and rare learning of this work is not more admirable than its h*minous arrangement , the natural succession of its topics , and the fullness of its illustrations From the character of the subject , this work has been more widely circulated than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unqualified praise of the l ) rincipal jurists of Europe , and was commended by a late eminent European judge , as a work that " no jurist can peruse without admiration of the industry , candor and learning with which it has been composed . " His next contribution to the literature of his profession , was a work on Equity Jurisprudence , in two volumes . It is not enough to say of this that it is the best work upon the subject in the language , as the previous treatises had not been of conspicuous excellence . It is one of the very best books that have ever been written in English , upon any legal subject . It pours new floods of light upon the ongin and essential character of equity jurisprudence , and shows the harmonious relation which exists between its leading doctrines and the principles of natural law and the rules of sound morality . It is alike satisfactory to the philosophical inquirer and to the practicing lawyer . The same substantial merit may be assigned to his subsequent work on Equity Pleading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singular clearness and comprehensiveness . These works on Equity have succeeded , in a remarkable degree , in breaking down those barriers of exclusion which our Transatlantic brethren are too apt to rear against foreign juridical works . Their popularity in England is as great as in America , and none of the works of their own great lights of the law are more confidently resorted to for aid , or more frequently cited . Four other treatises on legal subjects were also prepared and published by him in the last six years of his life , on the Law of Agency , the Law of Partnership , the Law of Bills of Exchange , and the Law of Promissory Notes , all marked by the fullness of learning and the flowing style which had characterized his previous publications . Thus , within the space of fourteen years , twelve large octavo volumes were added to the permanent literature of jurisprudence , by a man engaged in arduous judicial duties , and constantly occupied , except when at Washington , in the labors of the professor 's chair . What more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these ? What encouragements , and what rebukes , may be drawn from such a life ! Nor were these toils sufficient to exhaust his unbounded capacity for labor . Within this period belong his inaugural discourse , as professor-an admirable exposition of the spirit and principles of law ; his feeling and appropriate eulogy upon his lamented asso* ciate , Professor Ashmun , who was cut off in the bloom of his early promise . young in years , but ripe in legal attainmeats ; his beautiful address at the consecration of the cemetery of Mt . Auburn ; his lectures before the Boston Mechanics ' Institute , the American Institute of Instruction , and a Lyceum in the tcwn of Cambridge ; and his discourse before the Alumni of Harvard University . In 1835 , at the request of the members of the Suffolk bar , he pronounced a discourse commemorative of the life and services of Chief Justice Marshall  --  a feeling and // 79 beautiful tribute to the memory of an intimate and dear friend , whose person he loved , whose genius he admired , and whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketch of the same illustrious magistrate to the pages of the National Portrait Gallery . With all these accumulated toils , he never seemed hurried or oppressed , so perfect was his command over his powers , and so orderly was his disposition of time . No one who had the slightest claims upon him was ever turned away from his presence ; and the stranger who casually saw him in his leisure moments might have supposed him some retired gentleman , who had nothing to do but to stroll from his drawing-room to his library , so free were his conversation and deportment from that nervous anxiety and restless impatience into which very busy men are apt to fall . He still continued a member of the corporation of the University , was a punctual attendant upon their frequent meetings , and was ever ready to assume his fair proportion of their labors . He also took a lively interest in the cemetery of Mt . Auburn , whose hallowed precincts are now made more sacred as the resting-place of his own remains . He was for many years the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharge of the duties of the trust , and prepared many elaborate reports . He also found time foi the claims of society , and for the gratification of his own kindly and social nature . He was frequently found , an honored guest , in the cultivated and intelligent circles of Boston and Cambridge , instructing his hearers by his genial wisdom and the stores of his capacious memory , and charming them by his good humor , his simplicity and his ready sympathy , rivaling the young in light-hearted gayety , and proving to the old that the lapse of time need have no power over the heart and the mind . 1/* , Te are now approaching the close of the life of this eminent jurist and excellent man . His health had generally been good , as the vast amount of his labors sufficiently proves , though his constitution was never robust , and occasional fits of illness , especially of late years , had warned him that even his amazing capacity for intellectual toil might be overtasked . The latter years of his judicial Jife were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially , and the ruin and bankruptcy consequent upon the bursting of that portentous bubble , led to some of the most arduous an ( l exhausting trials ever witnessed in a court of justice , and imposed upon him the necessity of examining the most difficult questions in law and equity , and applying them to a long series of transactions of the most complicated and intricate character , perplexed with monstrous contradictions in testimony utterly inconsistent with the veracity of all the witnesses . Warned at length by the lengthening shadows of life , and the occasional admonitions of illness , he had determined to resign his seat upon the bench , to pass the remainder of hi*d ays in the home he so much loved , occupied with the duties of the professor 's chair and the preparation of new works in jurisprudence . Though his relations with his brethren upon the bench were of the most harmonious kind , it is not improbable that another element which led to this determination was a consciousness of the change which had come over the spirit of the court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filial reverence at the feet of Marshall , and now a new generation had arisen , which saw with other eyes and understood with other understanding than his . He had before him the forlorn alternative of perpetual dissent from the majority of the bench , or of giving the negative countenance of his silence to the removal of the old landmarks ; and in the sadness of his heart he lent a more ready ear to the warnings of age and the counsels of friendship . To the interval of repose between the bench and the grave , he looked forward with*singular satisfaction . Few men ever entered the vale of declining years , attended by more good angels than he . He had the " honor , love , obedience , troops of friends , " which should accompany old age . His fame was extended to every country in which justice is administered by established laws . He formed one of the most prominent attractions of the community in which he lived , and no stranger of any distinction ever visited Boston , who did not look forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief pleasures in anticipation , and no one ever left his presence without a new sense of his greatness and his goodness . The beautiful language of the patriarch might , without the least alloy of extravagance , be applied to him : " When the // ear heard him , then it blessed him ; and when the eye saw him , it gave witness to him . " Time had not severed those domestic ties from which so large a part of his satisfactions were drawn . The wife of his early manhood still sat by his heamth , the constant sharer of his happiness and his cares . He had the pleasure of reeing his two surviving children-a son and a daughter-dwelling in happy homes of their own , so near to him that the pang of separation was hardly felt . He had , too , the great gratification of reading an excellent treatise on the law of Contracts , by his son , W. W. Story , Esq. , and of witnessing its flattering reception by the legal professisn . The law school was to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward with keen desire to the time when he might devote to it the entire measure of his time and thoughts . To impart to the ingenuous young men who , year after year , should come up to attend upon his teachings , the principles of that science which he comprehended so thoroughly and loved so well ; to hold up to their imitation his own standard of public and l ) professional morality ; to animate them with his own high-toned patriotism ; and thus , to diffuse through an ever-widening circle the influence of his own mind and character , and make their unworn energies the perpetual guardians and protectors of the institutions which he so much valued , gladdening the winter of his own life with the vernal promise of the virtues and capacities which he had helped to rear and train-this was an object of interest to him sufficient to arouse all his powers , and fill the measure of his life with satisfaction and content . Of honor and distinction he had had enough-far more than he had ventured to hope in the wildest dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the call of ambition ; but the sea is not more swayed by the attraction of the moon than was his spirit moved and stirred , in all its depths , by the great idea of duty . But the Supreme Disposer of human events , to whose decrees he always bowed with filial submission , did not permit these fond anticipations to be realized . He was desirous , before leaving the bench , to dispose of every case which had been argued before him ; and for this purpose , he labored with self-forgetting assiduity during the exhausting heats of the last summer . ln this enfeebled state of his system , a slight cold was the precursor of an acute attack of chronic disorder , which soon baffled the skill of his physicians ; and after a few days of great suffering , the powers of nature gradually gave way ; and after some hours of apparent unconsciousness , he tranquilly breathed his last on the evening of the tenth of September last . The intelligence of his death threw a deep gloom over the community of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His funeral , though strictly private , was attended by a large number of the most distinguished men in Boston , and its vicinity . An impressive eulogy was pronounced at Cambridge , on the Wednesday after his death , by Professor Greenleaf , at the request of the college faculty and the law students , which was listened to with deep interest by a nurr*erous and most intelligent audience . At a meeting of the members of the Boston bar , appropriate resolutions were offered by Mr. Webster , who accompanied them with some observations , remarkable even among the productions of his mind for their weight of sentiment and serene beauty of style ; and it is understood that this distinguished gentleman has in preparation an elaborate discourse upon the life and services of the deceased , which he was requested to pronounce by a vote of the same meeting . Judge Davis , the late district judge of the district of Massachusetts , and Judge Sprague , the present incumbent , also spoke on this occasion . The feeling and tremulous tones in which the former gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services , bore his tribute to the virtues and attainments of one who had so long been associated with him in judicial labors , will never be forgotten by those who x*ere present . Similar testimonials of respect were ofii*red by the members of the legal profession in Portland , Providence , New York , Philadelphia and Washington . Such is an imperfect sketch of the life and services of this great man . We have dwelt upon his conspicuous excellence in three several mlepartments : as a judge , a writeT of legal treatises , and a teacher of law . He who , in any one of these , had reached his eminence , would have been deemed a fortunate man ; how enviable is the lot of him who was so admirable in them all . To dwell further upon his claims and merits as a jurist ; to compare him with the other great names in this // 81 qwq // 82 California . imagined . His religion was an active principle in his life . He not only knew but felt , that his destiny was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and benevolence . He was grateful to Him for the influence and consideration which he enjoyed-for the various blessings with which his life bad been crowned . He submitted without a murmur to the parental discipline of his Heavenly Father . The loss of his children had deeply tried his fortitude , and filled his bosom with anguish , but this could only be inferred by the warm sympathy which gushed from his heart , when any of his friends was called to drink the same bitter cup . Our task is thus brought to a close . In reviewing what we have written , we are painfully struck with its inadequacy to give to those who knew him not a proper estimate of what he was . The writer was , for many years , honored by his friendship and his confidence , and , in laying this humble offering upon his grave , he feels how unworthy it is of him whose dust reposes beneath . He traces these lines with suffused eyes and a trembling hand , for a part of the daily light of his life has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he recalls that countenance which for so many years was never turned towards him but with an expression of interest and affection . That well-remembered voice is again borne to the ear by the breeze from the land of spirits . The present fades from the eye and the thoughts , and the past returns ; and the beautiful words of Shenstone seem the only adequate expression of the feeling with which he takes leave of the subject : " Eheut quanto minus est cum reliquis versari , quam tui meminisse. "
