txt Passing between Rome and Florence , we crossed the Tiber one morning , and wound for some distance up as beautiful a valley as the sun ever smiled upon . It is apparently not over a mile wide , and lies deep down among the hills that rise in parallel ridges on either side . It was a bright May morning in which we trotted through it , and as we rose one of the ridges to pass down on the other side , and away from the Tiber , we stopped to survey the enchanting prospect . The gicen meadows went gently up to the sparkling Tiber that here was dwindled to a mere brook , and kept winding and turning as if it loved and strove to linger in the lovely landscape , while over all bent the blue sky of Italy , and swept the sweet breeze that seemed born amid vineyards and gardens . To this delicious spot , the artists of Rome flock in midsummer to escape the heat and malaria of the Eternal City , and dream away the hours amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidebook , as we sat on the hill side and looked down on this charming valley , we saw it stated that up its narrow enclosures , Macdonald , with an army of twenty thousand men , cut his way through the enemy though they outnumbered him two to one , in his retreat from Naples to Tuscany , whither he had been ordered to form a junction with Moreau . We confess that we had no definite idea of this Macdonald , except that he was a general in the French army . Being linked by association in our memory with that sweet valley , we afterwards took pains to trace out his history through the progress of the French revolution , and the French empire , to Bonaparte 's overthrow , and we found him one of the most remarkable men that lived in that remarkable time . He did two things , at least , which , of their kind , we believe were never surpassed . We refer to his awful charge at Wagram , and his desperate passage of the Splugen in midwinter . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him . Every thing that came near him seemed to run in his mould , or rather , perhaps he would confide in no one who did not partake more or less of his character . Some ' as much unlike him as men could well be , and worthy of no regard , he had around him because he could use them , but to none such did he trust his armies or commit the fate of a battle . Those whom he trusted with his fate and fortunes , he knew by stern experience to be men that never flinched in the hour of peril , and were earth-fast rocks amid the tumult of a battle-field , He tried every man before he committed the success of his great plans to him . Rank and fortune bought no places of trust from him . He promoted his officers on the field of the slain , and made his marshals amid the dead that cumbered the ground on which they had proved themselves heroes by great deeds . When Bonaparte rode over one of his bloody , yet victorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the conflict , he saw from the spots on which the dead lay piled in largest heaps , where the heat and crisis of the battle had been . From his observatory he had watched the whole progress of the strife , and when next morning he rode over the plain , it was not difficult to tell what column had fought bravest , or what leader had proved himself worthiest of confidence , and on the spot where they earned their reward he gave it , and made the place where they struggled bravest and suffered most , the birth-place of their renown . This custom of his furnished the greatest of all incitements to desperate valor in battle . Every officer knew that the glass of his emperor swept the field where he fought , and the quick eye that glanced like lightning over every object was constantly on him , and as his deeds were , so would his honors be . This strung the energies of every ambitious man  --  and Bonaparte would have none others to lead his battalions-to their utmost tension . What wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Europe stood awe-struck before enemies that seemed never to dream of defeat ? Macdonald was one of those stern men Bonaparte loved to have in his army . He knew what Macdonald attempted to do he would never relinquish till he himself fell , or his men fled . There was as much iron and steel in this bold Scotchman , as in Bonaparte himself . He had all his tenacity and invincibility without having his genius . Mm*cdonald was the son of a Scotch-15 // man , of the family of Clanronald , who fought under the standard of Prince Charles Edward , on the fatal field of Culloden , and after its disastrous issue , fled to France , and settled in Sancerre . There the subject of our sketch was born , in November , 1765 , and received the name of Etienne Jacques Joseph Alexandre Macdonald . He belonged to the army before the revolution , and during its progress took the republican side . He was an aide-camp in the first Republican army that advanced on the Rhine at the declaration of war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the battle of Jemappd , he fought with such bravery that he was promoted to the rank of colonel . Engaged in almost every battle in the low countries , he was appointed to lead the van of the army at the North , and in the winter campaign of 1794 , performed one of those deeds of daring for which he was afterwards so distinguished . The batteries of Nimeguea swept the river Waal , so that it was deemed impossible to cross it with any considerable force , yet Macdonald led his column over the smooth ice and through the storm of lead that devoured his ranks , and routed the enemy . For this gallant deed he was made general of brigade . In 1796 , at Cologne and Dusseldorf , he commanded the army , and soon after was sent by the Convention into Italy . After the conquest of the Papal states in 1798 , he was made governor of Rome . In his new capacity , he exhibited other talents than those of a military leader . He could scarcely have been placed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor of the Eternal City . - The two factions , one of which acted with the revolution , and the other against it , kept the population in a perpetual ferment . Insurrections and popular outbreaks occurred almost every day , while the indignity that had been offered the Pope , and the indiscriminate pillage of the Vatican , palaces , and churches , exasperated the upper classes beyond control , and it required a strong arm to maintain French authority in the city . Macdonald did as well , perhaps , as any one could have done in his circumstances . An insurrection having broken out at Frosinone , which he found himself unable to quell , except with the destruction of a large number of his own men , he ordered the houses to be fired and the insurgents massacred . Mack , at length drove him from the city , but being in turn compelled to evacuate it , Macdonald re-entered , and finally left it to conquer Naples . The entrance of the French into that city was over mountains of corpses , for the inhabitants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperation of madmen for their homes . And even after the army had entered within the walls , it could advance only by blowing up the houses , and finally conquered by obtaining , through the treachery of a Neapolitan , the castle of St. Elmo , from whence they could bring their artillery to bear on the town below . The famous Parthenopeian republic was immediately established , and Macdonald entrusted with the supreme command . Mack , who had charge of the army opposed to the French , was an inefficient man . His forces outnumbered those of the French three to one , but he lacked the nerve to contend with Bonaparte 's generals . When Nelson heard of his appointment as Commander-in-chief of the forces in the south of Italy , he remarked , " Mack can not travel without live carriages . I have formed my opinion of him . " That was the great difficulty with many of the Continental generals-they could not submit to the hardships and exposures and constant toil that such men as Ney and Macdonald and Napoleon cheerfully encountered . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate winter campaigns ;  --  and by his forced marches and rapid locomotion showed for the first time how much the human frame could endure , and the human will execute . But another man soon led his armies into southern Italy . The invincible Suwarrow who had never yet turned his back on a human foe began to sweep down through the peninsula . Macdonald could not contend with the superior force now brought against him , and commenced that masterly retreat toward Tuscany , to which we have referred , and which tested his skill as a general more than any other act of his life . To a watchfulness that never slept , and a spirit that never tired , he added exertion that overcame the most insurmountable difficulties , and baffled the plans of all his enemies . All of Bonaparte 's generals were distinguished for their wonderful tenacity , and Macdonald , with the exception perhaps of Ney , more than all the rest . He seemed to be unconscious of fatigue , and never for a mo // ment indulged in that lassitude which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its destruction . We can not put our finger on the spot in the man 's life where he acted as if he felt discouraged or ready to abandon every thing in despair . He seemed to lack enthusiasm , but had in its place a dogged resolution that was still more resistless . He quietly saw what was to be done , and then commenced doing it in the best possible manner , without the thought of failing in his designs . He was conscious of the mighty force of will , and knew by expePence how difficulties vanished by pushing against them . In the revolution of the 18th Brumaire , which overthrew the Directory and made Bonaparte First Consul , Macdonald was by his side , and with Murat , Lefebre , Marmont , Lannes and others , passed the power of France over into his hands . For the service he rendered on this occasion Napoleon appointed him to the command of the army in the Grisons . A letter from him to General Regnier , then with the army in Egypt , shows his exalted views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since you left , we have been compelled to lament over the capriciousness of fortune , and have been defeated every where owing to the impotence of the old tyrannical Directory . At last Bonaparte appeared-upset the audacious government , and seizing the reins , now directs with a steady hand the car of the revolution to that goal all good men have long waited to see it reach . Undismayed by the burden laid upon him this wonderful man reforms the armies-calls back the proscribed citizens - flings open the prison in which innocence has pined-abolishes the old revolutionary laws-restores public confidence-protects industry-revives commerce , and making the Republic triumphant by his arms , places it in that high rank assigned it by Heaven . " In 1802 he was sent as ambassador to Copenhagen , where he remained a year . On his return he was appointed Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor . But soon after he incurred the displeasure of Bonaparte by his severe condemnation of the trial and sentence of Moreau . Macdonald had fought beside the hero of Hohenlinden . They had planned and counseled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflicted on his old companion in arms . Fearless in court as he was in battle , he never condescended to flatter , nor refrained from expressing his indignation against meanness and injustice . His words which were uttered without disguise , and couched in the plain , blunt terms of a soldier , were rePeated to Napoleon , who afterwards treated him with marked coldness . Too proud to go where he was not received as became his rank , and equally disdaining to make any efforts to produce a reconciliation when he had told the simple truth , he kept away from court altogether . Bonaparte seemed to have forgotten him and let him remain inactive while Europe was resounding with the heroic deeds of the Generals that were leading his victorious armies over the Continent . Macdonald felt this keenly . He who had fought so manfully the bloody battle of the Trebbia , performed such prodigies of valor in Italy , and finally , to the astonishment of the world , led his army in mid-winter over the awful pass of the Splugen amid hurricanes of snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one whom be had served so faithfully , and in whose hands he had helped place the supreme power of France . Bonaparte in his towering and unjust pride : allowed a single expression , strictly true , and springing from the very excellences of that character which made him the prop of his throne , to outweigh the years of service he had rendered and the glorious victories he had brought to his standard . Shame on his injustice to this old soldier who had never deserted him . Bonaparte 's conduct in this matter is convincing proof to us that he was conscious of having acted the part of a villain in the trial and condemnation of Moreau . The campaign of Austerlitz with its " Sun " of glory-Jena and its victories - Eylau and its awful carnage and doubtful issue-Friedland with its deeds of renown and richly bestowed honors , passed by and left Macdonald unnoticed and uncalled for . Thus years of glory rolled away . But in 1807 , Bonaparte , who either thought that he had sufficientl* punished him , or felt that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command of a corps under Eugene Beauharnois . He advanced into Styria , fought and captured the Austrian General , Meerfeldt-helped to gain the victory of Raab , and soon afterwards saved Napoleon and the Empire at Wagram by one of the most desperate charges recorded in the annals of man . Created 1845 1 *1 // Marshal OII the field of battle he was next appointed to the government of Gratz , where he exhibited the nobler qualities of justice and mercy . The bold denouncer of injustice in his Emperor was not likely to commit it himself . By the severe discipline he maintained among the troops , preventing them from violating the homes and property of the inhabitants ; and by the equity and moderation with which he administe*ed the government entrusted to him , he so gained the love and respect of the people that on his departure they made him a present of 100,000 francs , or nearly $20,000 , and a costly box of je els , as a wedding gift for one of his daughters . But he refused them both , replying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , repay it by taking care of the three hundred sick soldiers I am compelled to leave with you . " Macdonald was a noble man in every feature of his character . No ferocity marked his battles-no indiscriminate slaughter made in moments of excitement stained any part of his career . Not long after he was made Duke of Tarentum , and in 1810 was appointed to command the army of Augereau in Catalonia , who had been recalled in disgrace . In 1812 he commanded the tenth corps of the Grand Army in its victorious march into Russia , and was one of the surviving few who , after performing prodigies of valor , and patiently enduring unheard of sufferings , in that disastrous and awful retreat ; struggled so nobly at Bautzen , and Lutxen and Leipsic to sustain the tottering throne of Napoleon . He never faltered in his attachment or refused his aid till Bonaparte 's abdication and exile to Elba . Re was strongly opposed to his mad attempts to relieve Paris , which ended in his immediate overthrow . He declared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall back on Augereau , and choosing out a field where he could make the best stand , give the enemy battle . " Then , " he said " if Providence has decreed our final hour , *e shall at least die with honor . " Unwavering in his attachment to the last , when the allies had determined on the Emperor 's abdication , he used every effort to obtain the most favorable terms for him and his family . This generous conduct , so unlike what Bonaparte might have expected from one whom he had treated so unjustly and meanly , affected him deeply . He saw him alone at Fontainbleau , and in their private interview previous to his departure for Elba , acknowledged his indebtedness to Macdonald , expressed his high regard for his character , and regretted that he had not appreciated his great worth sooner . At parting he wished to give him some memorial of his esteem , and handing him a beautiful Turkish sabre , presented him by Ibrahim Bey when in Egypt , said , " It is only the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bourbons re-ascended the throne Macdonald was made a Peer of France , and never after broke his oath of allegiance . Unlike Murat , and Ney , and Soult , and others of Napoleon 's generals , he considered his solemn oath sacred , and though when sent to repelthe invader his soldiers deserted him at the first cry of " Vive 1 ' Empereur , " he did not like Ney follow their example , but making his escape hastened to Paris to defend Louis . After the final overthrow of Napoleon at Waterloo he was promoted from one post of honor to another till he was made governor of the 21st Military Division and Major General of the Royal Guard . He visited soon after Scotland , and hunting up his poor relatives , bestowed presents upon them , and finally , on the overthrow and abdication of Charles X. gave his allegiance to Louis Phillippe . We have given this brief outline of his history at the commencement in order to speak more fully of the three great acts of his life . When commmanding the army in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Splugen with his forces in order to form the left wing of his army in Italy . This was in the Campaign of Italy , after Bonaparte 's return from Egypt . Though no braver or bolder man than JVlacdonald ever lived , he felt that the execution of the First Consul 's commands was well nigh impossible , and sent General Dumas to represent to him the hopelessness of such an undertaking . Bonaparte heard him through , and then with his usual recklessness of difficulties replied , " I will make no change in my dispositions . Return quickly and tell Macdonald that an army can always pass in every season where two men can place their feet . " Like an obedient officer he immediately set about preparations for the herculean task before him . The present pass over this mountain is a very different thing from the one whjcli Is rjuly , // Macdonald and his fifteen thousand men traversed . There is now a carriage way across , cut in sixteen zig-zags along the breast of the mountain . But the road he was compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gorge of the Cardinel . To understand some of the difficulties that beset him and his army , imagine an awful defile leading up to the height of six thousand five hundred feet above the level of the sea , while the raging of an Alpine storm and the mighty sweep of avalanches across it add tenfold horror to the wintry scene . First comes the deep dark defile called the Via Mala , made hy the Rhine , here a mere rivulet , and overhung by mountains often three thousand feet high . Along the precipices that stoop over this mad torrent the path is cut in the solid rock , now hugging the mountain wall like a mere thread , and now shooting in a single arch over the gorge that sinks three hundred feet below . Strangely silent snow peaks pierce the heavens in every direction , while from the slender bridges that spring from precipice to precipice over the turbulent stream , the roar of the vexed waters can scarcely be heard . After leaving this defile the road passes through the valley of Schams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes on to the hare face of the mountain , going sometimes at an angle of forty-five degrees , and finally reaches the naked summit , standing bleak and cold in the wintry heavens . This was the Splugen-pass Macdonald was comcommanded to lend his army of lfi , 000 men over in mid-winter . It was on the 20th of November he commenced his preparations . A constant succession of snow storms had filled up the entire path so that a sifigle man on foot would not have thought of making the attempt . But when Macdonald had made up his mind to do a thing , that was the end of all impossibilities . The cannon were dismounted and placed on sleds , to which oxen were attached  --  the ammunition divided ahout on the backs of mules , while every soldier had to carry , besides his usual arms , five packets of cartridges and five days provisions . The guides went in advance , and stuck down long black poles to indicate the corirseof the path beneath , while behind them came the workmen clearing away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the most powerful horses of the army to beat down the way . The first company had advanced in this manner nearly half way to the summit , and were approaching the hospice , when a low moaning was heard among the hills like the voice of the sea before a storm . The guides understood too well its meaning , and gazed on each other in alarm . The ominous sound grew louder every moment till suddenly the fierce Alpine blast swept in a cloud of snow over the breast ot the mountain , arid howled like an unchained demon through the gorge below . In an instant all was confusion , and blindness , and uncertainty . The very heavens were blotted out , and the frightened column stood and listened to the raving tempest that threatened to lift the rockrooted pines that shrieked above them from their places , and bring down the very Alps themselves . But suddenly another still more alarming sound was heard amid the storm- " an avalanche , an avalanche , " shrieked the guides , and the next moment an awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the column that was struggling along the path , passed straight through it into the gulf below , carrying thirty dragoons and their horses along with it in its wild plunge . The black form of a steed and its rider was seen for one moment suspended in mid-heavens , and the next disappeared among the ice and crags below . The head of the column immediately pushed on and reached the hospice in safety , while the rear , separated from it by the avalanche , and struck dumb by this sudden apparition crossing their path with such lightning like velocity , and bearing to such an awful death their brave comrades , refused to proceed , and turned back to the village of Splugen . For three days the storm raged amid the mountains , filling the heavens with snow and hurling avalanches into the path , till it became so filled up that the guides declared it would take fifteen days to open it again as to make it at all passable . But fifteen days Macdonald could not spare . Independent of the urgency of his commands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage solitodes , and he must proceed . He ordered four of the strongest oxen that could be found to be led in advance by the best guides . Forty peasants followed behind , clearing away and beating down the snow , and two companies of sappers came after to give still greater consistency to the track , while on their heels // marched the remnant of the company of the dragoons , part of which had been borne away by the avalanche three days before . The post of danger was given them at their own request . They presented a strange sight amid those Alpine solitudes . Those oxen with their horns just peering above the snow , toiled slowly on , pushing their unwieldy bodies through the drifts , while the soldiers up to their arm-pits struggled behind . Not a drum or bugle note cheered the solitude or awoke the echoes of those snow covered peaks . The footfal gave back no sound in the soft snow , and the words of command seemed smothered in the very atmosphere . Silently , noiselessly the mighty but disordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stillness of the wintry noon , save the fierce pantings of the horses and animals as with reeking sides they strained up the ascent . This day and the next being clear frosty days the separate columns passed in safety with the exception of those who sunk in their footsteps overcome by the cold and the frost . The successful passage of the columns these two days induced Macdonald to march the whole remaining army over the next day , and so ordering the whole army to advance , commenced on the 5th of December the perilous ascent . But fresh snow had fallen the night previous , filling up the entire track , so that it had all to be made over again . The guides expecting a wind and avalanches after this fresh fall of snow , refused to go , till they were compelled to by Macdonald . Breast deep the army waded up the wild and desolate path , making in six hours but six miles , or one mile an hour . They had not advanced far , however , when they came upon a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled up the way . The guides halted before these new obstacles and refused to proceed , and the head of the column wheeled about and began its march down the mountain . Macdonald immediately hastened forward , and placing himself at the head of his men walked on foot with a long pole in his band to sound the treacherous mass he was treading upon , while he revived the drooping spirits of the soldiers with words of encouragemnt . Soldiers , " said he , " your destinies call you into Italy ; advance and conquer first the mountain and the snow-then the plains and the armies . " Ashamed to see their General hazarding his life at every step where they had refused to go , they returned cheerfully to their toil . But before they could effect the passage the voice of the hurricane was again heard on its march , and the next moment a cloud of driving snow obliterated every thing from view . The path was filled up and all traces of it swept utterly away . Amid the screams of the guides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - ling of the storm , came the rapid thunder-crash of avalanches . Then commenced again the awful struggle of the army for life . The foe they had to contend with was not one of flesh and blood . To sword-cut , bayonetthrust , and the blaze of artillery , the strong Alpine storm was alike invulnerable . On the serried column and straggling line , it thundered with the same reckless power , while over all the sifted snow lay like one vast winding sheet . No one who has not seen an Alpine storm , can imagine the fearful energy with which it rages through the mountains . The light snow borne aloft on its bosom is whirled and scattered like an ocean of mist over all things . Such a storm now piled around them the drifts which seemed to form instantaneously , as by the touch of a magician 's wand . All was mystery and darkness , gloom and terror . The storm had sounded its trumpet for the charge but no note of defiance replied . The heroes of so many battle fields stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together as though proximity added to their safety , the disordered column crouched and shivered to the blast that seemed to pierce their very bones with its chilling cold . But the piercing cold , and drifting snow , and raging storm , and concealed pitfalls , were not enough to complete this scene of terror . Avalanches fell in rapid succession from the top of the Splugen . Scaling the breast of the mountain with a single leap , they came with a crash on the shivering column , bearing it away to the destruction that waited beneath . The extreme density of the atmosphere , filled as it was with snow , imparted infinite terror to these mysterious messengers of death , as they came down the mountain declivity . A low rumbling sound would be heard amid the pauses of the storm , and as the next shriek of the blast swept by , a rushing as of a counterblast smote the ear , and before the thought had time to change , a rolling , leaping , broken mass of snow // burst through the thick atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunder , far , far below , bearing away a whole company of soldiers to its deep dark resting place . On the evening of the 6th of December , the greater part of the army had passed the mountains , and the van had pushed on as far as Lake Como . From the 26th of November to the 6th of December , or nearly two weeks , had Macdonald been engaged in this perilous pass . Nearly two hundred men had perished in the undertaking , and as many more mules and horses . We do not believe there was another general except Ney , that could have succeeded in the face of such obstacles as Macdonald was compelled to struggle against . And we never in imagination see that long straggling line , winding itself like a huge anaconda over the lofty snow-peak of the Splugen , with the indomitable Macdonald feeling his xvay in front covered with snow , while ever and anon huge avalanches sweep by him , and the blinding storm covers his men and the path from his sight , and hear his stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without feelings of supreme wonder . There is nothing like it in modern history , unless it be Suwarrow 's passage of the Glarus in the midst of a superior enemy . Bonaparte 's passage over the St. Bernard-so world-renowned-was mere child 's play compared to it . That pass was made in pleasant weather , with nothing but the ruggedness of the ascent to obstruct the pro , , ress . Suwarrow , on the contrary , led his mighty army over the SchachenthaI , breast-deep in snow , with the enemy on every side of bim , mowing down his ranks without resistance . Macdonald had no enemy to contend with but nature  --  but it was nature alive and wild . The path by which he led his army over the Splugen was nearly as bad in summer , as the San Bernard the time Napoleon crossed it . But in midwinter to make a path , and lead an army of fifteen thousand men through hurricanes and avalanches , where the foot of the Chamois scarce dared to tread , was an undertaking from which even Bonaparte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater falsehood , or one more unworthy of him , than when he said , " The passage of the Splugen presented without doubt , some difficulties , but winter is by no means the season of the year in which such operations are conducted with most difficulty ; the snow is then firm , the weather settled , and there is nothing to fear from the avalanches , which constitute the true and only danger to be apprehended in the Alps . " Bonaparte would have us suppose that no avalanches fall in December , and that the passage of the Splugen in the midst of hurricanes of snow , was executed in " settled weather . " What then must we think of his passage of the San Bernard , in summer time , without a foe to molest him , or an avalanche to frighten him . But Macdonald 's difficulties did not end with the passage of the Splugen . To fulfil the orders of Napoleon , to penetrate into the valley of the Adige , he had no sooner arrived at lake Como , than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no sooner achieved , than the bleak peak of Mount Tonal arose before him . A mere sheeppath led over this steep mountain , and the army was compelled to toil up it in single file through the deep snow . And when he arrived at the summit , which was a 4small flat , about fifty rods across , he found the Austrians there , prepared to dispute the passage with him . This narrow flat lay between two enormous glaciers , that no human foot could scale , and across it the enemy had built three entrenchments forming a triple line , and composed chiefly of huge blocks of ice , cut into regular shapes , and fitted to each other . Behind these walls of ice , the Austrians lay waiting the approach of the exhausted French . The grenadiers clambering up the slippery path , formed in column and advanced with firm step on the strong entrenchments . A sheet of fire ran along their sides , strewing the rocks with the dead . Pressing on , however , they carried the external palisades , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat , and brought word to Macdonald that the entrenchments could not be forced . Eight days after , however , he ordered a fresh column under Vandamme , to attempt to carry them by assault . Under a terrible discharge the intrepid column moved up to the icy wall , and though a devouring fire mowed down the men , so fierce was the onset , that the two external forts were carried . But the fire from the inner entrenchment , and from a blockhouse that commanded the position of the French , was too terrific to withstand , and after bravely struggling against such desperate odds they were compelled to etreat . On the snowy sum*nit of the Tonal among the glaciers , and scattered // July , around on the huge blocks of ice , lay the brave dead , while the wintry sun flashed mournfully down on the bayonets of the retreating and wounded column . Nothing daunted , Macdonald by a circuitous route over two other mountain xidges , at length reached the Adige , and fulfilled the extraordinary commands of Napoleon . This wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did , that it rivaled the most brilliant achievement he ever performed . But the world can now see clearly , and that passage of the brave Scotchman stands alone in modern warfare . A hired press and interested flatterers could echo the false statements of Napoleon , while he wielded the destinies of Europe , but Time , which " Sets all things even , " has reversed that falsehood . The passage of Napoleon over the San Bernard was a magnificent feat , but the passage of the Splugen , by Macdonald , was a desperate one . One was attended wtih dfficulties alone , the other with dangerone was executed in safety , the other with the loss of whole companies . This latter fact alone , is sufficient to prove which was the most difficult and dangerous feat . Suwarrow was driven up his pass by the cannon of the French , and led his bleeding thousands over the snow , while the enemy 's muskets were continually thinning his defenceless ranks . Macdonald led his column through an awful gorge , and up a naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snow flying , and the avalanches falling in all the terror of a wintry hurricane . Bonaparte led his army over the San Bernard , in the delightful month of summer , when the genial sun subdues the asperity of the Alps , and without an enemy to molest him . Which achievement of these three stands lowest in the scale , it is not difficult to determine . But it is at Wagram that we are to look for Macdonald 's greatest deed . We never think of that terrific battle without feelings of the profoundest wonder at his desperate charge , that then and there saved Napoleon and the empire . The battle of Aspern had proved disastrous to the French . The utmost efforts of Napoleon could not wring victory from the hands of the Austrians . Massena had stood under a tree while the houghs were crashing with cannon balls over head , and fought as never even he fought before . The brave Lannes had been mangled by a cannon shot , and died while the victorious guns of the enemy were still playing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the magnificent army , that had in the morning moved from the banks of the Danube in all the confidence of victory , at nightfal were crowded and packed in the little island of Lobau . Rejecting the counsel of his officers , Bonaparte resolved to make a stand here , and wait for reinforcements to come up . No where does his exhaustless genius show itself , as in this critical period of his life . He revived the drooping spirits of his soldiers by presents from his own hands ,  --  he visited in person the sick in the hospitals , while the most gigantic plans at the same time , strung his vast energies to their utmost tension . From the latter part of May to the first of July , he had remained cooped up in this little island , but not inactive . lie had done every thing that could be done on the spot , while orders had been sent to the dilThrent armies to hasten to his relief . At two o'clock in the afternoon of the 2nd of July , the reinforcements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exhibition of the skill and promptitude with which orders had been issued and carried out . At two o'clock in the afternoon , the different armies from all quarters first began to come in , and before the next night they had all arrived . First with music and streaming banners appeared the columns of Ilernadotte hastening from the ban*ks of the Elbe , carrying joy to the desponding hearts of Napoleon 's army . They had hardly reached the field before the stirring notes of the bugle , and the roll of drums in another quarter , announced the approach of Vandamme from the provinces on the Rhine . Wrede came next from the banks of the Lech , with his strong Bavarians , while the morning sun shone on Macdonald 's victorious troops , rushing down from Illyria and the Alpine summits , to save Bonaparte and the Empire . As the hold Scotchman reined his steed up beside Napoleon , and pointed back to his advancing columns , he little thought that two days after the fate of Europe was to turn on his single will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the brave Marmont appeared with glistening bayonets and waving plumes , from the borders of Dalmatia . Like an exhaustless stream , the magnificent columns kept pouring into that little isle , while to crown the whole , Eugene came up with his veterans from the plains // of Hungary . In two days they had all assembled , and on the evening of the 4th of July , Napoleon glanced with exultant eye over a hundred and eighty thousand warriors , crowded and packed into the small space of two miles and a half in breadth , and a mile and a half in length Congratulations were exchanged by soldiers who last saw each other on some glorious battle field , and universal joy and hope spread through the dense columns that almost touched each other . Bridges had been constructed to fling across the channel , and during the evening of the 5th , were brought out from their places of concealment , and dragged to the bank . In ten minutes one was across and fastened at both ends . In a little longer time two others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore . Bonaparte was there , walking backwards and forwards in the mud , cheering on the men , and accelerating the work which was driven with such wonderful rapidity , that by three o'clock in the morning , six bridges were finished and filled with the marching columns . Bonaparte had constructed two bridges lower down the river , as if he intended to cross there in order to distract the enemy from the real point of dan0 er . On these the Austrians kept up an incessant fire of artillery , which was answered by the French from the island with a hundred cannon , lighting up the darkness of the night with their incessant blaze . The village of Enzerdorf was set on fire , and burned with terrific fierceness , for a tempest arose as if in harmony with the scene , and blew the flames into ten-fold fury . Dark clouds swept the midnight heavens , as if gathering for a contest among themselves  --  the artillery of heaven was heard above the roar of cannon , and the bright lightning that ever and anon rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while blazing bombs traversing the sky in every direction , wove their fiery net work over the heavens , making the night wild and awful as the last day of time . In the midst of this scene of terror , Napoleon remained unmoved , heedless alike of the storm of fne elements and the storm of the artillery ; and though the wind shrieked around him , and the dark Danube rolled its turbulent flood at his feet , his eye watched only the movements of his rapid columns over the bridges , while his sharp quick voice gave redoubled energy to every effort . The time  --  the scene  --  the mighty result at stake-all harmonized with his stern and tempestuous nature . His perceptions became quicker-his will firmer , and his confidence of success stronger . By six o'clock in the morning , a hundred and fifty thousand infantry and thirty thousand cavalry stood in battle array on the shores of the Danube , from whence a month before the Austrians bad driven the army in afiright . The clouds had vanished with the night , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beams glanced over a countless array of helmets , and nearly three hundred thousand bayonets glittered in his light , it was a glorious spectacle : those two mighty armies standing in the early sunlight amid the green fields , while the air fairly sparkled with the hashing steel that rose like a forest over their heads . Nothing could exceed the surprise of the Austrians , when they saw the French legions across the river , and ready for battle . That bright scene was to see the fate of Europe settled for the next four years , and that glorious summer 's sun , as it rolled over the heavens , was to look down on one of the most terrific battles the world ever saw . We do not design to describe the movements of the two armies , nor the varied success during the day . Bonaparte at the outset had his columns-converged to a point-resting at one end on the Danube , and radiating off into the field , like the spokes of a wheel . The Austrians , on the contrary , stood in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their enemy . Macdonald 's division was among the first brought into the engagement , and bravely held its ground during the day . When night closed the scene of strife , the Austrians had gained on the French . They nevertheless sounded a retreat , while the exhausted army of Napoleon lay down on the field of blood , to sleep . Early in the morning , the Austrians taking advantage of their success the day before , commenced the attack , and the thunder of their guns at day light brought Napoleon into his saddle . The field was again alive with charging squadrons , and covered with the smoke of battle . From daylight till nearly noon had the conflict raged without a moment 's cessation . Every where except against the Austrians ' left the French were defeated . From the steeples of Vienna , the multitude gazed on the progress of the doubtful fight , till they heard the cheers of their countrymen above the roar of battle driving the flying enemy before // them , when they shouted in joy , and believed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order in the disordered lines , ordered Davoust to make a circuit , and ascending the plateau of Wagram , carry Neusiedel . While waiting the result of this movement , on the success of which depended all his future operations , the French lines under Napo* leon 's immediate charge were exposed to a most terrific fire from the enemy 's artillery , which tore them into fragments . Unable to advance , and too distant to return the fire , they were compelled to stand as idle spectators and see the cannon shot plough through them . Whole battalions , driven frantic by this inaction in the midst of such a deadly fire , broke and fled . But every thing depended on the infantry holding firmly their position till the effect of Davoust 's assault was seen . Yet nothing but Napoleon 's heroic bravery kept them steady . Mounted on his milk-white charger , Euphrates , given him by the king of Persia , he slowly rode backward and forward before the lines , while the cannon balls whistled and rattled like hail-stones about him-casting ever and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to appear with his fifty thousand brave followers . For a whole hour he thus rode in front of his men , and though they expected every moment to see him shattered by a cannon ball , he moved unscathed amid the storm . At length Davoust was seen charging like fire over the plateau of Wagram , and finally appear with his cannon on the farther side of Neusiedel . In a momeat the plateau was covered with smoke as he opened his cannon on the exposed ranks of the enemy . A smile lighted up Napoleon 's countenance , and the brow that had been knit like iron during the terrific strife of the two hours before , as word was constantly brought him of his successive losses , and the steady progress of the Austrians-cleared up , and he ordered Macdonald , with eight battalions , to march straight on the enemy 's centre , and pierce it . This formed the crisis of the battle , and no sooner did the Archduke see the movement of this terrible column of eight battalions , composed of sixteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the hour of Europe 's destiny and his own army had come . He immediately doubled the lines at the threatened point , and brought up the reserve cavalry , while two hundred cannon were wheeled around the spot on which such destinies hung ; and opened a terrific fire on the approaching column . Macdonald immediately ordered a hundred cannon to precede him , and answer the Austrian batteries , that swept every inch of ground like a storm of sleet . The cannoniers mounted their horses , and starting on a rapid trot with their hundred pieces , approached to within a half cannon shot , and opened a destructive fire on the enemy 's ranks . lATith this battery at its head , belching forth flmie like some huge monster , the mighty column steadily advanced . The Austrians fell back , and closed in on each other , knowing that the final struggle had come . At this crisis of the ba ttle , nothing could exceed the sublimity and terror of the scene . The whole interest of the armies was concentrated here , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the conflict . Still Macdonald slowly advanced , though his numbers were diminishing , and the fierce battery at his head was gradually becoming silent . Enveloped in the awful fire of its antagonist , the guns had one by one been dismounted , and at the distance of a mile and a half from the spot where he started on his awful mission , Macdonald found himself without a protecting battery , and the centre still unbroken . Marching over the wreck of his cannon , and pushing the naked head of his column into the open field , and into the devouring cross fire of the Austrian artillery , he began to advance . The destruction then became awful . A.t every discharge , the head of that column disappeared , as if it sank into the earth , while the outer ranks , on either side , melted away like snow wreaths on the river 's brink . No pen can describe the intense anxiety with which Napoleon watched its progress . On just such a charge rested his empire at Waterloo , and in its failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macdonald 's nature was roused , and he had fully resolved to execute the awful task given him or fall on the field . Still he towered unhurt amid his falling guard , and with his eye fixed steadily on the enemy 's centre , continued to advance . At the close and fierce discharges of these cross batteries on its mangled head , that column would sometimes stop and stagger back , like a strong ship when smitten by a wave . The next moment the drums would beat their hurried charge , and the calm , steady voice of Macdonald ring back through his exhausted ranks , nerving them to the desperate valor that filled his own spirit . Never before was such a charge made , // and it seemed at every moment that the torn and mangled column must break and fly . The Austrian cannon are gradually wheeled around till they stretch away in parallel lines on each side of this hand of heroes , and hurl an incessant tempest of lead against their bosoms . But the stern warriors close in and fill up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Macdonald has communicated his own settled purpose to conquer or die to his devoted followers . There is no excitement-no enthusiasm such as Murat was wont to infuse into his men when making one of his desperate charges of cavalry . No cries of " Vive l'Empereur , " are heard along the lines ; but in their place is an unalterable resolution that nothing hut annihilation can shake . The eyes of the army and the world are on them , and they carry Napoleon 's fate as they go . But human strength has its limits , and human effort the spot where it ceases forever . No living man could have carried that column to where it stands but the iron-hearted hero at its head . But now he halts and casts his eye over his little surviving band that stands all alone in the midst of the enemy . He looks back on his path , and as far as the eye can reach , he sees the course of his column by the hlack swath of dead men that stretches like a huge serpent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which he started but fifteen hundred are left beside him . Ten out of every eleven have fallen , and here at length the tired hero pauses , and surveys with a stern and anxious eye his few remaining followers . The heart of Bonaparte stops heating at the sight , and well it may , for his throne is where Macdonald stands . He bears the Empire on his single brave heart-he is the EMPIRE . Shall he turn at last , and sound the retreat ? The Empire totters on the ensanguined field , for , like a speck in the distance , Macdonald is seen still to pause , while the cannon are piling the dead in heaps around him . " Will he turn at last ? " is the secret and agonizing question Napoleon puts to himself ,  --  " must my throne go down ? " No ! he is worthy of the mighty trust committed to him . The Empire stands or falls with him , but shall stand while he stands . Looking away to where his Emperor sits , h*&gt;sees a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " breaks from his iron lips . The roll of drums and the pealing of trumpets answer the volley that smites that exhausted column , and the next moment it is seen piercing the Austrian centre . The day is won-the Empire saved  --  and the whole Austrian army is in full retreat . Such was the awful battle of Wagrams and such the charge of Macdonald . We know of nothing equal to it except Ney 's charge at Waterloo , and that was not equal , because it failed . On riding over the ensanguined field Bonaparte came where Macdonald stood amid his troops . As his eye fell on the calm and collected hero , he stopped , and holding out his hand said , " Shake hands , Macdonald-no more hatred between us-we must henceforth be friends , and as a pledge of my sincerity , I will send your marshal 's staff , which you have so gloriously earned . " The frankness and kindness of Napoleon effected what all his neglect and coldness had failed to do-subdued him . Grasping his hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uproar of battle could never agitate , replied , " Ah ! sire , with us it is henceforth forlife and death . " Noble man ! kindness could overcome him in a moment . It is no wonder that Bonaparte felt at last that he had not known Macdonald 's true worth . The last great conflict in which he was engaged was the disastrous battle of Leipsic . For two days he fought like a lion , and when all hope was abandoned , he was appointed by Napoleon to form , with Lannistau and Poniatowski , the rear guard of the army while it passed over the only remaining bridge of Lindenau acros the Elster . Here he stood and kept the allies at bay , though they swarmed in countless multitudes into the city , making it fairly reel under their wild hurrahs , as they drove before them the scattered remnants of the rear of the French army . Carriages and baggage-waggons , and chariots and artillery came thundering by , and Macdonald hurried them over the bridge , still maintaining hi* post against the headlong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleeding mass streamed over the crowded bridge , protected from the pursuing enemy hy the steady resistance of Macdonald . The allies were struck with astonishment at this firm opposition in the midst of defeat . Half the disasters of that battle , so fatal to Napoleon , would have been saved but for the rashness of a single corporal . Bonaparte had ordered a mine // to be constructed under this bridge , which was to be fired the moment the French army had passed . The corporal to whom this duty had been entrusted hearing the shouts of the allies as they rolled like the sea into Leipsic , and seeing the tiralleurs amid the gardens on the side near the river , thought the army had all passed , and fired the train . The hridge was lifted into the air with a sound of thunder , and fell in fragments into the river . It is said , the shriek of the French soldiers forming the rear guard , when they saw their only communication with the army cut off , was most appalling . They broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stretching out their arms towards the opposite shore , where were the retreating columns of their comrades . Thousands , in desperation , plunged into the stream , most of which perished , while the whole remaining 1* , OOO were made prisoners . But amid the mel6e that succeeded the blowing up of the bridge , were seen two officers spurring their horses through the dense multitude that obstructed their way . At length , after most desperate efforts , they reached the banks . As they galloped up the shore on their panting and blood-covered steeds , one was seen to be Macdonald , and the other the brave Poniatoxvski . Casting one look on the chaos of an army that struggled towards the chasm , they plunged in . Their strong chargers stemmed the torrent manfully , and struck the opposite shore . With one bold spring , Macdonald cleared the bank , and galloped away . But the brave and noble Pole reached the shore only to die . His exhausted steed struggled nobly to ascend the hank , but failing , fell back on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of Macdonald 's after-career we have already spoken . He remained firm to Napoleon till his ahdication , and then , like all his Generals and Marshals , gave in his allegiance to the Bourbon throne . His firmness of character which rendered him in all emergencies so decided and invincible prevented him also from joining Bonaparte 's standard when he landed from Elba . The contagious enthusiasm which bore away so many of the old companions in arms of Bonaparte , did not shake his constancy . He gave his adhesion to the Bourbons because it was in the compact with Napoleon , and because under the circumstances he considered it his duty to do so , and no after excitement could shake his*fidelity . He July , was a thorough Scotchm an in his fixedness of will . He possessed none of the flexibility of the French character , and but little of its enthusiasm . Bold , unwavering , and determined , he naturally held great sway over the French soldiers . Versatile themselves , they have greater confidence in a character the reverse of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessing nothing hut enthusiasm . In a sudden chain e you want the headlong excitement , hut in the steady march into the very face of destruction , and the cool resistance in the midst of carnage , you need the cool , rock-fast man . This trait in Macdonald 's character was evinced in his conduct when sent to repel the invasion of Napoleon , who was drawing all hearts after him in his return from exile . He repaired to Lyons with his army , but finding that his troops had caught the wild-fire enthusiasm , that was carrying everything before it , he addressed them on their duty . It was to no purpose , however , for no sooner did they see the advanced guard of Bonaparte 's small company , and hear the shout of " Vive l'Empereter , " with which they rent the air , than they rushed forward , shouting " Vive l'Empereur " in return , and clasped their old comrades to their bosoms . Ney , under similar circumstances , was also borne away by the enthusiasm of the moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wild cry that shook Eu rope like an earthquake , and summoned a continent to arms again , and made kings tremble for their thrones . But Macdonald was not a being of such rapid impulses . His actions were the result of reflection rather than of feeling . True to his recent oath he turned from his treacherous troops and fled , and narrowly escaped being taken prisoner by them . I-Ic was a conscientious soldier-kind in peace-sparing of his men in battle , unless sacrifice was imperiously demanded , and then spilling blood like water . Generous and open hearted , he spoke his sentiments freely , and abhorred injustice and meanness . Dazzled as all the world was by the splendid talents and brilliant achievements of Bonaparte , he never seemed to have discovered his cold selfishness and towering ambition which lay at the bottom of all his actions . The Duke of Tarentum , as Macdonald was called in France , had no sons . He had three daughters , two of whom married nobles , and the third a rich banker.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
