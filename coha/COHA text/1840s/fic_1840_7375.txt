STEREOTYPED AT THE BOSTON TYPE AND STEREOTYPE FOUNDRY . Main text THE HAUNTED QUACK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excursion to Niagara . At Schenectady , finding the roads nearly impassable , I took passage in a canal-boat for Utica . The weather was dull and lowering . There were but few passengers on board ; and of those few , none were sufficiently inviting in appearance to induce me to make any overtures to a travelling acquaintance . A stupid answer , or a surly monosyllable , were all that I got in return for the few simple questions I hazarded . An occasional drizzling rain , and the wet and slippery condition of the tow-path , along which the lazy beasts that dragged the vessel travelled , rendered it impossible to vary the monotony of the scene by walking . I had neglected to provide myself with books , and as we crept along at the dull rate of four miles per hour , I soon felt the foul fiend Ennui coming upon me with all her horrors . " Time and the hour , " however , " runs through the roughest day , " and night at length approached . By degrees the passengers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creep slowly away to their berths ; most of them fortifying themselves with a potation , before resigning themselves to the embrace of Morpheus . One called for a glass of hot whisky punch , because he felt cold ; another took some brandy toddy to prevent his taking cold ; some took mint juleps ; some gin slings , and some rum and water . One took his dram because he felt sick ; another , to make him sleep well ; and a third , because he had nothing else to do . The last who retired from the cabin was an old gentleman who had been deeply engaged in a well-thumbed volume all day , and whose mental abstraction I had more than once envied . He now laid down his book , and , pulling out a red nightcap , called for a pint of beer , to take the vapors out of his head . As soon as he had left the cabin , I took up the volume , and found it to be Glanville 's marvellous book , entitled , " The History of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I began to peruse it , and soon got so deeply interested in some of his wonderful narrations , that the hours slipped unconsciously away , and midnight found me poring half asleep over the pages . From this dreary state , I was suddenly aroused by a muttering , as of a suppressed voice , broken by groans and sounds of distress . Upon looking round , I saw that they proceeded from the figure of a man enveloped in a cloak , who was lying asleep upon one of the benches of the cabin , whom I had not previously noticed . I recognized him to be a young man , with whose singular appearance and behavior , during the day , I had been struck . He was tall and thin in person , rather shabbily dressed , with long , lank , black hair , and large gray eyes , which gave a visionary character to one of the most pallid and cadaverous countenances I had ever beheld . Since he had come on board , he had appeared restless and unquiet , keeping away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering into conversation with the passengers . Once or twice , on catching my eye , he had slunk away as if , conscience-smitten by the remembrance of some crime , he dreaded to meet the gaze of a fellow-mortal . From this behavior I suspected that he was either a fugitive from justice , or else a little disordered in mind ; and had resolved to keep my eye on him , and observe what course he should take when we reached Utica . Supposing that the poor fellow was now under the influence of nightmare , I got up with the intention of giving him a shake , to rouse him , when the words " murder , poison , " and others of extraordinary import , dropping unconnectedly from his lips , induced me to stay my hand . " Go away , go away , " exclaimed he , as if conscious of my approach , but mistaking me for another . " Why do you continue to torment me ? If I did poison you , I did n't mean to do it , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what 's the use of haunting me now ? A n't I going to give myself up , and tell all ? Begone ! I say , you bloody old hag , begone ! " Here the bands of slumber were broken by the intensity of his feelings , and with a wild expression of countenance , and a frame shaking with emotion , he started from the bench , and stood trembling before me . Though convinced that he was a criminal , I could not help pitying him , from the forlorn appearance he now exhibited . As soon as he had collected his wandering ideas , it seemed as if he read in my countenance the mingled sentiments of pity and abhorrence with which I regarded him . Looking anxiously around , and seeing that we were alone , he drew the corner of the bench towards me , and sitting down , with an apparent effort to command his feelings , thus addressed me . His tone of voice was calm and distinct ; and his countenance , though deadly pale , was composed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious of having uttered in my disturbed sleep , you suspect me of some horrid crime . You are right . My conscience convicts me , and an awful nightly visitation , worse than the waking pangs of remorse , compels me to confess it . Yes , I am a murderer . I have been the unhappy cause of blotting out the life of a fellow-being from the page of human existence . In these pallid features , you may read enstamped , in the same characters which the first murderer bore upon his brow , Guilt  --  guilt  --  guilt ! " Here the poor young man paused , evidently agitated by strong internal emotion . Collecting himself , however , in a few moments , he thus continued :  --  " Yet still , when you have heard my sad story , I think you will bestow upon me your pity . I feel that there is no peace for me , until I have disburdened my mind . Your countenance promises sympathy . Will you listen to my unhappy narrative ? " My curiosity being strongly excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to hear whatever he had to communicate . Upon this , he proceeded as follows :  --  " My name is Hippocrates Jenkins . I was born in Nantucket , but my father emigrated to these parts when I was young . I grew up in one of the most flourishing villages on the borders of the canal . My father and mother both dying of the lake fever , I was bound apprentice to an eminent operative in the boot and shoe making line , who had lately come from New York . Would that I had remained content with this simple and useful profession . Would that I had stuck to my waxed-ends and awl , and never undertaken to cobble up people 's bodies . But my legs grew tired of being trussed beneath my haunches ; my elbows wearied with their monotonous motion ; my eyes became dim with gazing forever upon the dull brick wall which faced our shop window ; and my whole heart was sick of my sedentary , and , as I foolishly deemed it , particularly mean occupation . My time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should any opportunity offer of getting into any other employment , I would speedily embrace it . " I had always entertained a predilection for the study of medicine . What had given my mind this bias I know not . Perhaps it was the perusal of an old volume of Dr. Buchan , over whose pages it was the delight of my youthful fancy to pore . Perhaps it was the oddness of my Christian cognomen , which surely was given me by my parents in a prophetic hour . Be this as it may , the summit of my earthly happiness was to be a doctor . Conceive , then , my delight and surprise , one Saturday evening , after having carried home a pair of new white-topped boots for Doctor Ephraim Ramshorne , who made the cure of bodies his care , in the village , to hear him ask me how I should like to be a doctor . He then very generously offered to take me as a student . From my earliest recollections , the person and character of Doctor Ramshorne had been regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time out of mind the successful practitioner for many miles around , I had looked upon him as the beau idal of a doctor  --  a very Apollo in the healing art . When I speak of him , however , as the successful practitioner , I mean it not to be inferred that death was less busy in his doings , or funerals scarcer during his dynasty ; but only that he had , by some means or other , contrived to force all those who had ventured to contest the palm with him , to quit the field . He was large and robust in person , and his ruby visage showed that if he grew fat upon drugs , it was not by swallowing them himself . It was never exactly ascertained from what college the doctor had received his diploma ; nor was he very forward to exhibit his credentials . When hard pressed , however , he would produce a musty old roll of parchment , with a red seal as broad as the palm of his hand , which looked as if it might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some cramp manuscript of a dozen pages , in an unknown tongue , said by the doctor to be his Greek thesis . These documents were enough to satisfy the doubts of the most skeptical . By the simple country people , far and near , the doctor was regarded , in point of occult knowledge and skill , as a second Faustus . It is true the village lawyer , a rival in popularity , used to whisper , that the doctor 's Greek thesis was nothing but a bundle of prescriptions for the bots , wind-galls , spavins , and other veterinary complaints , written in High Dutch by a Hessian horse-doctor ; that the diploma was all a sham , and that Ephraim was no more a doctor than his jackass . But these assertions were all put down to the score of envy on the part of the lawyer . Be this as it may , on the strength of one or two remarkable cures , which he was said to have performed , and by dint of wheedling some and bullying others , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The doctor united in his own person the attributes of apothecary and physician ; and as he vended as well as prescribed his own drugs , it was not his interest to stint his patients in their enormous boluses , or nauseous draughts . His former medical student had been worried into a consumption over the mortar and pestle ; in consequence of which , he had pitched upon me for his successor . " By the kindness of a few friends , I was fitted out with the necessary requisitions for my metamorphosis . The doctor required no fee , and , in consideration of certain little services to be rendered him , such as taking care of his horse , cleaning his boots , running errands , and doing little jobs about the house , had promised to board and lodge me , besides giving me my professional education . So , with a rusty suit of black , and an old plaid cloak , behold equipped the disciple of Esculapius . " I can not describe my elation of mind , when I found myself fairly installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes . I fancied my fortune already made , and blessed my happy star , that I had fallen under the benign influence of so munificent a patron . " The doctor 's office , as it was called par excellence , was a little nook of a room , communicating with a larger apartment denominated the shop . The paraphernalia of this latter place had gotten somewhat into disorder since the last student had gone away , and I soon learnt that it was to be my task to arrange the heterogeneous mass of bottles , boxes , and gallipots , that were strowed about in promiscuous confusion . In the office , there was a greater appearance of order . A small regiment of musty-looking books were drawn up in line upon a couple of shelves , where , to judge from the superincumbent strata of dust , they appeared to have peacefully reposed for many years . A rickety wooden clock , which the doctor had taken in part payment from a pedler , and the vital functions of which , to use his own expression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner . A mouldy plaster bust of some unknown worthy , a few bottles of pickled , and one or two dried specimens of morbid anatomy , a small chest of drawers , a table , and a couple of chairs , completed the furniture of this sanctum . The single window commanded a view of the churchyard , in which , it was said , many of the doctor 's former patients were quietly slumbering . With a feeling of reverence I ventured to dislodge one of the dusty tomes , and began to try to puzzle out the hard words with which it abounded ; when suddenly , as if he had been conjured back , like the evil one by Cornelius Agrippa 's book , the doctor made his appearance . With a gruff air , he snatched the volume from my hands , and telling me not to meddle with what I could not understand , bade me go and take care of his horse , and make haste back , as he wanted me to spread a pitch-plaster , and carry the same , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had the rheumatism . On my return , I was ordered by Mrs. Ramshorne to split some wood , and kindle a fire in the parlor , as she expected company ; after which Miss Euphemia Ramshorne , a sentimental young lady , who was as crooked in person and crabbed in temper as her own name , despatched me to the village circulating library , in quest of the Mysteries of Udolpho . I soon found out that my place was no sinecure . The greater part of my time was occupied in compounding certain quack medicines of Ramshorne 's own invention , from which he derived great celebrity , and no inconsiderable profit . Besides his patent catholicon , and universal panacea , there was his anti-pertusso-balsamico drops , his patent calorific refrigerating anodyne , and his golden restorative of nature . Into the business of compounding these , and other articles with similar high-sounding titles , I was gradually initiated , and soon acquired so much skill in their manipulation , that my services became indispensable to my master ; so much so , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his horse , and clean his boots . What chiefly reconciled me to the drudgery of the shop , was the seeing how well the doctor got paid for his villanous compounds . A mixture of a little brick-dust , rosin , and treacle , dignified with the title of the anthelminthic amalgam , he sold for half a dollar ; and a bottle of vinegar and alum , with a little rose-water to give it a flavor , yclept the anti-scrofulous abstergent lotion , brought twice that sum . I longed for the day when I should dispense my own medicines , and in my hours of castle-building , looked forward to fortunes far beyond those of the renowed Dr. Solomon . Alas ! my fond hopes have been blighted in their bud . I have drunk deeply of the nauseous draught of adversity , and been forced to swallow many bitter pills of disappointment . But I find I am beginning to smell of the shop . I must return to my sad tale . The same accident , which not unfrqeuently before had put a sudden stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nostrums , at length prevented him from reaping any longer their golden harvest . One afternoon , after having dined with his friend Squire Gobbledown , he came home , and complained of not feeling very well . By his directions , I prepared for him some of his elixir sanitatis , composed of brandy and bitters , of which he took an inordinate dose . Shortly after , he was seized with a fit of apoplexy , and before bedtime , in spite of all the drugs in the shop , which I poured down with unsparing hand , he had breathed his last . In three days , Ramshorne was quietly deposited in the churchyard , in the midst of those he had sent there before him . " Having resided with the doctor for several years , I had become pretty well known throughout the neighborhood , particularly among the old ladies , whose good graces I had always sedulously cultivated . I accordingly resolved to commence quacking  --  I mean practising  --  on my own account . Having obtained my late master 's stock of drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own name in golden letters as his successor , to work I went , with the internal resolve that where Ramshorne had given one dose , I would give six . " For a time , Fortune seemed to smile upon me , and every thing went on well . All the old women were loud in sounding my praises , far and near . The medicaments of my master continued to be in demand , and treacle , brick-dust , and alum , came to a good market . Some drawbacks , however , I occasionally met with . Having purchased the patent right of one of Thompson 's steam-baths , in my first experiment I came near flaying alive a rheumatic tanner , who had submitted himself to the operation . By an unfortunate mistake in regulating the steam , he was nearly parboiled ; and it was supposed that the thickness of his hide alone preserved his vitals uninjured . I was myself threatened with the fate of Marsyas , by the enraged sufferer ; which he was happily prevented from attempting to inflict , by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I , however , after this , gave up steaming , and confined myself to regular practice . At length , either the charm of novelty wearing off , or people beginning to discover the inefficacy of the old nostrums , I was obliged to exert my wit to invent new ones . These I generally took the precaution to try upon cats or dogs , before using them upon the human system . They were , however , mostly of an innocent nature , and I satisfied my conscience with the reflection , that if they did no good , they could at least do no harm . Happy would it have been for me , could I always have done thus . Meeting with success in my first efforts , I by degrees ventured upon more active ingredients . At length , in an evil hour , I invented a curious mixture , composed of forty-nine different articles . This I dubbed , in high flowing terms , The Antidote to Death , or the Eternal Elixir of Longevity ; ' knowing full well , that though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' yet would not my drugs find as good a sale under a more humble title . This cursed compound proved the antidote to all my hopes of success . Besides forcing me to quit the village in a confounded hurry , it has imbittered my life ever since , and reduced me to the ragged and miserable plight in which you see me . " I dare say you have met with that species of old women , so frequent in all country towns , who , seeming to have outlived the common enjoyments of life , and outworn the ordinary sources of excitement , seek fresh stimulus in scenes of distress , and appear to take a morbid pleasure in beholding the varieties of human suffering and misery . One of the most noted characters in the village was an old beldame of this description . Granny Gordon  --  so she was familiarly denominated  --  was the rib of the village Vulcan , and the din of her eternal tongue was only equalled by the ringing of her husband 's anvil . Thin and withered away in person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemblance to a newly exhumed mummy , and to all appearance promised to last as long as one of those ancient dames of Egypt . Not a death , a burial , a fit of sickness , a casualty , nor any of the common calamities of life ever occurred in the vicinity , but Granny Gordon made it her especial business to be present . Wrapped in an old scarlet cloak  --  that hideous cloak ! the thought of it makes me shudder  --  she might be seen hovering about the dwelling of the sick . Watching her opportunity , she would make her way into the patient 's chamber , and disturb his repose with long , dismal stories and ill-boding predictions ; and if turned from the house , which was not unfrequently the case , she would depart muttering threats and abuse . " As the Indians propitiate the favor of the devil , so had I , in my eagerness to acquire popularity , made a firm friend and ally , though rather a troublesome one , of this old woman . She was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , and had a high-sounding name to recommend it , would take my most nauseous compounds with the greatest relish . Indeed the more disgusting was the dose , the greater , in her opinion , was its virtue . " I had just corked the last bottle of my antidote , when a message came to tell me , that Granny Gordon had one of her old fits , and wanted some new doctor-stuff , as the old physic did n't do her any more good . Not having yet given my new pharmaceutic preparation a trial , I felt a little doubtful about its effects ; but trusting to the toughness of the old woman 's system , I ventured to send a potion , with directions to take it cautiously . Not many minutes had elapsed , before the messenger returned , in breathless haste , to say that Mrs. Gordon was much worse , and that though she had taken all the stuff , they believed she was dying . With a vague foreboding of evil , I seized my hat , and hastened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were greeted with a sad spectacle . Granny Gordon , bolstered up in the bed , holding in her hand the bottle I had sent her , drained of its contents , sate gasping for breath , and occasionally agitated by strong convulsions . A cold sweat rested on her forehead ; her eyes seemed dim and glazed ; her nose , which was usually of a ruby hue , was purple and peaked ; and her whole appearance evidently betokened approaching dissolution . " Around the bed were collected some half dozen withered beldames , who scowled upon me , as I entered , with ill-omened visages . Her husband , a drunken brute , who used to beat his better half six times a week , immediately began to load me with abuse , accusing me of having poisoned his dear , dear wife , and threatening to be the death of me , if she died . " My conscience smote me . I felt stupified and bewildered , and knew not which way to turn . At this moment , the patient , perceiving me , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall carry to my dying hour , and a voice between a scream and a groan , held up the empty bottle , and exclaimed , This is your doing , you villanous quack you ; ' ( here she was seized with hickup ; )  --  you have poisoned me , you have ; ' ( here fearful spasms shook her whole frame ; )  --  but I 'll be revenged ; day and night my ghost shall haunt  --  ' Here her voice became inarticulate , and shaking her withered arm at me , she fell back , and to my extreme horror , gave up the ghost . This was too much for my nerves . I rushed from the house , and ran home with the dying curse ringing in my ears , fancying that I saw her hideous physiognomy , grinning from every bush and tree that I passed . Knowing that as soon as the noise of this affair should get abroad , the village would be too hot to hold me , I resolved to decamp as silently as possible . First throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should not rise in judgment against me , I made up a little bundle of clothes , and taking my seat in the mail-stage , which was passing at the time , and fortunately empty , in a couple of days I found myself in the great city of New York . Having a little money with me , I hired a mean apartment in an obscure part of the city , in the hope that I might remain concealed till all search after me should be over , when I might find some opportunity of getting employment , or of resuming my old profession , under happier auspices . By degrees the few dollars I brought with me were expended ; and after pawning my watch and some of my clothes , I found myself reduced to the last shilling . But not the fear of impending starvation , nor the dread of a jail , are to be compared to the horrors I nightly suffer . Granny Gordon has been as good as her word . Every night , at the solemn hour of twelve , " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to me , wrapped in a red cloak , with her gray hairs streaming from beneath an old nightcap of the same color , brandishing the vial , and accusing me of having poisoned her . These visitations have at length become so insupportable , that I have resolved to return and give myself up to justice ; for I feel that hanging itself is better than this state of torment . " Here the young man ceased . I plainly saw that he was a little disordered in his intellect . To comfort him , however , I told him , that if he had killed fifty old women , they could do nothing to him , if he had done it professionally . And as for the ghost , we would take means to have that put at rest , when we reached Utica . About the gray of the morning , we arrived at the place of our destination . My protg , having unburdened his mind , seemed more at his ease , and taking a mint-julep , prepared to accompany me on shore . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon drove down to the wharf . As soon as my companion observed them , he exclaimed with a start of surprise , " Hang me ! if there is n't old Graham the sheriff , with lawyer Dickson and Bill Gordon , come to take me . " As he spoke , his foot slipping , he lost his balance , and fell backwards into the canal . We drew him from the water , and as soon as the persons in the wagon perceived him , they one and all sprang out , and ran up with the greatest expressions of joyful surprise . " Why , Hippy , my lad , " exclaimed the sheriff , " where have you been ? All our town has been in a snarl about you . We all supposed you had been forcibly abducted . Judge Bates offered a reward of twenty dollars for your corpse . We have dragged the canal for more than a mile , and found a mess of bottles , which made us think you had been spirited away . Betsy Wilkins made her affidavit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life , and here you see we have brought him down to have his trial . But come , come , jump in the wagon ; we 'll take you up to the tavern , to get your duds dried , and tell you all about it . " Here a brawny fellow , with a smutty face , who I found was Gordon the blacksmith , came up , and shaking Hippocrates by the hand , said , " By goles , doctor , I am glad to see you . If you had n't come back , I believe it would have gone hard with me . Come , man , you must forgive the hard words I gave you . My old woman soon got well of her fit , after you went away , and says she thinks the stuff did her a mortal sight o ' good . " It is impossible to describe the singular expression the countenance of the young man now exhibited . For some time he stood in mute amazement , shaking with cold , and gazing alternately at each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their reiterated assurances to convince him , that Granny Gordon was still in the land of the living , and that he had not been haunted by a veritable ghost . Wishing to obtain a further explanation of this strange scene , I accompanied them to the tavern . A plain-looking man , in a farmer 's dress , who was of the party , confirmed what the blacksmith had said , as to the supposed death of his wife , and her subsequent recovery . " She was only in a swoond , " said he , " but came to , soon after the doctor had left her . " He added that it was his private opinion , that she would now last forever . He spoke of Hippocrates as a " nation smart doctor , who had a power of larning , but gave severe doses . " After discussing a good breakfast , my young friend thanked me for the sympathy and interest I had taken in his behalf . He told me he intended returning to the practice of his profession . I admonished him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicines , telling him that all old women had not nine lives . He shook hands with me , and , gayly jumping into the wagon , rode off with his friends .
