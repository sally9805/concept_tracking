NIGHTS IN AN INDIAN LODGE . I. " Neshin Wikiewun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted shantee of some roving hunter which we found in one of these deep ravines , through which the brooks of the north-west discharge themselves into the Wiskonsan . " A good house , " said he , rubbing his hands , and looking around with an air of satisfaction . " Aneendee , " growled Che-che-gwa , ( the Rattlesnake , ) with Indian sententiousness , while his less dignified friend sliced off a couple of steaks from the moose he had just killed , and left the Canadian to prepare the supper , which was soon despatched by all four of us . It was still early in the evening ; and , though somewhat fatigued , as I was not at all sleepy , I should have had a pretty tedious time of it , after the Rattlesnake had coiled himself to rest , if left alone with so laconic a companion . But the White-plume , who had been a great traveller in his day , and was noted for his talkativeness and story-telling , seemed seized with a more than usual fit of loquacity . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his disposition to sleep was gradually dispelled by the vivacity of his comrade . He soon raised himself on his elbow , and yielded attention to the waggish sallies of the other . Finally , sitting erect , he carefully filled his pipe with kinnekinic , and , placing his back against the rough timbers of the lodge , seemed prepared for a long siege , as his friend entered upon one of those rambling legends of which the Indians are so fond . The story-teller also , clearing his throat , asked for " some milk from the Mokomuan 's ' black cow ! " and , emptying the whiskey-bottle which the Canadian handed him , at a draught , he pursued his tale without farther interruption , except from the guttural expression of satisfaction which now and then escaped from the deep chest of his companion , or the loud snoring of my guide , whose slumbers were as noisy as if he were sleeping against time . My knowledge of the language used by the story-teller was so slight , that the meaning of his words often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent repetition of the same ideas , enforced by the most animated and expressive gestures , and , perhaps , from my having before heard of the wild tradition upon which it was founded , that I was at all able to follow him in the narration . It would be affectation in me to attempt to give the style and mode of expression in which the tale I am about to relate was conveyed to me ; but the main tissue of it was as follows : THE GHOST-RIDERS . A Legend of the Great American Desert . " Away !  --  Away ! My breath was gone , I saw not where he hurried on ! ' T was scarcely yet the break of day And on he foam 'd  --  Away !  --  Away !  --  And my cold sweatdrops fell like rain Upon the coursers bristling mane ; But snorting still with rage and fear , He flew upon his far career . " Mazeppa . The hunters of the far-west , who trap for beaver among the defiles of the Oregon Mountains , regard no part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage hunting grounds , where the fur-bearing animals are still found in the greatest profusion , with more aversion than that which leads over the great desert , where the tributaries of the Padouca , the Konzas , and the Arkansaw Rivers are half absorbed by the arid sand . Lewis and Clarke , Major Long , and other scientific explorers of this desolate region , suffered much from the want of water while passing through it on their way to the Rocky Mountains ; and they often mention the disheartening effect it had upon their followers , when , after traversing the scorching plain for weeks , it still lay stretched in unbroken and monotonous vastness before them . This portion of country , which extends along the base of the Rocky Mountains as far as we have any acquaintance with their range , is said to have an average width of six hundred miles . In the north the surface is occasionally characterized by water-worn pebbles and hard gravel ; but the predominant characteristic is sand , which , in many instances , prevails to the entire exclusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profusely covered with loose fragments of volcanic rocks , amid whose barren bosom no genial plant has birth ; and , indeed , throughout the whole region , large tracts are often to be met with which exhibit scarcely a trace of vegetation . In some few instances sandy hillocks and ridges make their appearance , thickly covered with red cedar of a dwarfish growth ; but in general nothing of vegetation appears upon the uplands , but rigid grass of spare and stunted growth , prickly pears profusely covering extensive tracts , and weeds of a few varieties , which , like the prickly pears , seem to thrive the best in the most arid and steril soils . The Indians who inhabit this extensive region , are composed of several roving tribes , who , unlike the nations to the east and west of them , have no permanent villages nor hunting-grounds which they claim as peculiarly their own . They hunt the buffalo and antelope , and , dwelling only in tents of leather , migrate from place to place in pursuit of the herds of those animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they exchange their skins for blankets and strouding , with the British traders on the Cheyenne River of the north , they also trade their mules and horses for vermilion and silver ornaments , with the Spaniards of Mexico on the Colorado of the south . The Arapahoes , Kaskaias , Kiaways , and Ietans , which are the chief of the desert hordes , are ferocious and predatory in their habits , and con- tinually at war with various tribes of the M Indians , who inhabit the fertile countries which between them and our western frontier . The grizzly bear , the king of the American wilds , shares these dreary domains with the savages , hardly less ferocious than himself , and roams the west in quest of living prey . Here , too , the illusive mirage of the desert cheats the parched traveller with its refreshing promise ; and the wanderers in these solitudes often tell of those monstrous shapes and unnatural forms which , like the spectre of the Brocken , reflected on the heated and tremulous vapour , are magnified and distorted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , are said to shoot along the baked and cracking earth ; and the herds of wild horses that can be seen trooping along the horizon , seem at times to be goaded on by gigantic and unearthly riders , whose paths are enveloped in wreaths of flame. The scientific explorer readily calls philosophy to in examining these strange appearances : explains the phenomena of which he is himself a witness , and reason rejects the preternatural images , which he only knows from the representations of others . But the nomadic tribes , who make their dwelling upon the desert , or the uneducated adventurer , who wanders thither from some more smiling region , are differently affected . The monstrous shapes and unearthly appearances that present themselves to his excited vision , are regarded through the medium of superstitious awe . The wild imagination of the Indian and the credulous fancy of the Creole and Canadian hunter people these mysterious solitudes with actual beings ; while the grotesque figures , drawn upon the mocking mirage , after presenting themselves frequently to the eye , assume at length an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian and Canadian wanderers become at last so familiar with the images represented , as even to pretend to recognise the features and swear to the identity of shapes which are continually changing , and which probably never present themselves more than once to the same person . Among those most often mentioned , there are none whose identity has been more completely established , and whose names are whispered with deeper awe , than those of the Ghost-riders . The Canadian Engag always crosses himself when he utters the name , and the Otto , or Omaw-whaw warrior , who may have skirted the desert in a war party against the Cheyennes , or the Pawnee-Loup , who has crossed it in his battles with the Crow and Kiawa Indians , invariably places his hand upon his Metawaann , or repository of his personal manitto , when he speaks of these fearful apparitions . Those who affect to have seen these strange dwellers of the desert , describe them as two gigantic figures , representing a man and woman locked in each other 's arms , and both mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make as themselves . Some pretend to have been near enough to discover their features ; and these assert that the countenance of the man , though emaciated and ghastly , and writhed with the most fearful contortions , by an expression of shrinking horror , can plainly be identified as the face of a white man ; while the features of the woman , though collapsed and corpse-like , are evidently those of an Indian female . Others insist that no one can ever have been near enough to the phantoms to remark these peculiarities ; for the Ghost-riders , say they , are for ever in motion , and they scour the desert with such preternatural velocity as to mock the scrutiny of human eyes . They appear to be goaded on for ever by some invisible hand , while the phantom charger that bears them , over-leaps every obstacle as he flies on his mysterious and apparently aimless career . There is a tradition among the Indians accounting for the origin of these fearful apparitions , to which universal credence is given . It is a story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeds , and Eden-like happiness blasted by unholy passion ; of black-hearted treachery and ruthless violence , that met with a punishment more horrible even than itself . And thus the story runs : Upon the western borders of the great desert already described , and somewhere about the head-waters of the Padouca and Arkansaw Rivers  --  where they approach each other among those broken sandstone ledges which lift their gray parapets and isolated columnar rocks of snowy whiteness from copses of hazel and shrubby oaks  --  there stood , many years since , the lodge of Ta-in-ga-ro , " **28;610;TOOLONG . " The hunter , though no one knew whence he came , appeared to be upon friendly terms with all the allied tribes of the desert ; and he was said to have recommended himself to them on his appearance in those wilds , by bringing a dozen scalps of different tribes of the Missouri Indians at his saddle-bow , when he first presented himself in the skin tents of the roving Kaskaias . So rich an offering would have placed the chief at the head of an independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " partisan , " or leader of warriors ; but the habits of Ta-in-ga-ro were unsocial and secluded ; and the only object that claimed the solicitude , or shared the sympathies of the bold stranger , was a beautiful female  --  the sole companion of his exile . The name of the hunter was evidently of Omaw-whaw origin , but there was nothing about his person to mark him as belonging to that distant nation ; and it was equally difficult to identify the partner of his wandering with any neighbouring tribe . Some , from the fairness of her complexion , insisted that she must belong to the Rice-eaters , ( Menomons , ) or White Indians of the north , who dwell near the country of the Long-knives ; others , that she must be a Boisbrul , or daughter of a Sioux mother by some Sakindasha ( British ) trader ; but no one , after a while , troubled themselves about the origin of Zecana , or The Bird , as she was called in the Yanckton language . Indeed the lonely couple lived so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they were soon forgotten among a people so scattered as the dwellers of the desert . The only object of Ta-in-ga-ro appeared to have been to find a home where he could place his wife in safety ; and the broken mounds , and hillocks , and angular tables of sandstone now heaped upon the soil , like the plates of ice often piled upon each other in the eddies and along the banks of rivers , and now raising themselves in solitary pyramids and obelisks , along the grassy vales in which he sought an asylum , made this the country , of all others , wherein the outlaw might find a secure fastness  --  especially when the whole breadth of the desert lay between him and his people . Secure amid these wild and picturesque retreats , the sole care of the exile was to keep a few wild horses in training near his lodge , and to hunt the game that was necessary for the subsistence of his small household . The soul of Ta-in-ga-ro appeared to be completely wrapped up in the being who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out of his sight ; and when the disappearance of the buffalo and antelope from his immediate neighbourhood extended the range of the chase , Zecana always accompanied him on his more distant expeditions . Indeed , the love which the hunter bore to his wife was not like the ordinary affection of an Indian to his squaw : it resembled more the devotion which distinguishes those who , in some tribes , are coupled out as friends , to be nearer to each other than children of the same father , in all the concerns that mark the pathway of life . It was like the mystic tie which unites together the fated brothers of " The Band of the Brave . " The genial months of summer had passed away , and the first moon of autumn still found the exile and his bride dwelling in their sequestered valley . His success in the chase had enabled Ta-in-ga-ro to exchange a pack of skins for a few simple comforts , with a Spanish trader on the Mexican border ; and , by merely shifting his lodge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more sheltered situation , he was easily enabled to strike the wild goats of the Oregon highlands , and , by trapping for beaver among the adjacent glens , supply all the wants of himself and Zecana . It was necessary , however , in disposing of the latter , to be frequently brought in contact with the Spaniard ; and his unwillingness to leave his wife unprotected , induced Ta-in-ga-ro often to take her with him on his visits to the trading-post . The consequences were such as are continually occurring on our own frontier , in the intercourse between the licentious whites , who are bound by no ties except those of interest and passion , and the confiding and simple-hearted In-dians . The Spaniard , whose cabin was already shared with two wives , taken from the adjacent tribes with whom he traded , soon conceived a partiality for the fairer features of the northern girl ; and , with that disregard of moral obligations which is but too characteristic of his order when the welfare of one of the aborigines is concerned , he determined that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His advances were received by Zecana with indignation and scorn ; but , notwithstanding the disgust which his persevering in them awakened , she feared to tell her husband of the insults she received , lest his impetuous disposition should embroil him with all the renegado whites , villanous half-bloods , and degraded Indians that usually hang round a trading-post , and become the pliant creatures of its master . The return of spring , too , was near , and Zecana thought that its earliest blossoms would find her once more alone with her lover , enjoying the sequestered privacy of their summer retreat together ; and , confident in her own purity and strength , she contented herself with repelling the advances of the trader in silence . But the wily and profligate Spaniard was not to be cheated so easily of his victim ; and , after meditating a variety of designs , he at last brought both cunning and force to the accomplishment of his purpose . He succeeded in luring the unsuspecting Indian into an agreement , by which a pack of skins was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be completely unshackled in his efforts to procure them , and rove as far as possible in his dangerous quest , the trader prevailed upon him to leave his wife in his guardianship , while her husband went upon an expedition into the inmost recesses of the Rocky Mountains . The hunter , according to the custom of the Indians , departed upon his errand without giving Zecana the slighest intimation of his distant mission , or of the arrangements which he had made for her care during his absence . In one of the most romantic valleys on the eastern side of the mountains , at the foot of that snow-capped peak which is called after the first white man that ever planted his foot on the summit , there is a large and beautiful fountain , whose transparent water , highly aerated with exhilarating gas , has procured it the name of " The Boiling Spring , " from the white hunters , who trap for beaver in this lonely region . This fountain is one of the first you meet with after crossing the Great Desert ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation , causes it to be regarded with deep veneration by the roving natives of the mountain and the plain . The Indian hunter , when he drinks from the rocky basin , invariably leaves an offering in the refreshing bowl ; and the clean bottom is paved with the beads and other ornaments which the aborigines have left there as sacrifices or presents to the spring . By the side of this fountain , one sultry April noontide , reposed an Indian hunter . His mantle of blue and scarlet cloth , beaded with white wampum , was evidently of Spanish manufacture , and indicated , perhaps , the gay and predatory rover of the south-west ; but the long-plaited and riband-twined locks of the Ietan , or Kaskaia , were wanting : and the knotted tuft on his crown , with the war-eagle 's feather as its only ornament , characterized more truly the stern and less volatile native of the north ; while the towering form and prominent aquiline nose were combined with those features and proportions which more particularly distinguish the Pawnees from other tribes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say to what nation the hunter belonged . The best blood of the noblest band might channel , unmingled with any baser current , in his veins ; but , whatever might be the totem of his tribe , it was evident that he now held himself identified with no particular clan  --  and was , perhaps , indeed , an outlaw from his people . The expression of dauntless resolution that dwelt around his firmly-cut mouth , and the air of high command discoverable in his piercing eye , revealed , however , that the hunter was no common man ; that , in fact , whatever might now be his pursuits , he was once a warrior and a chieftain . Weary with the chase , and exhausted by the noontide heat , Ta-in-ga-ro was reposing upon the rich greensward which carpeted the spot . He had thrown off the gay Mexican blanket , or cloth mantle , as it might rather be called , and was occupied in stripping the beads from the woven garters of his metasses , for an offering to the divinity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped by him into the bubbling well over which he leaned . But each as it struck the bottom was thrown again to the surface by some boiling eddy , and , after dancing for a moment on the brim , it toppled over the lips of the fountain , and disappeared in the stream which swept down the valley . The heart of an Indian is the abode of a thousand superstitions ; and Ta-in-ga-ro , though more enlightened than most of his race , was still , so far as fancy was concerned , a genuine child of the wilderness . The sudden onset of a score of Blackfeet he had met without dismay , and their charging yell would have been flung back with his own whoop of defiance ; but the soul of the intrepid savage sank within him as he beheld the strange reception of his reverential rite . Danger and death he feared not for himself ; but there was another whose existence was bound up in his own , and misgiving thoughts of her condition floated wildly through his brain at this moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw , or deemed that he saw , the reproachful countenance of Zecana reflected in the mysterious pool . The appalled lover sprang like lightning to his feet , and riveted his piercing gaze intently upon the fountain . But the apparition was gone . The wampum-strewed bottom was all that met his eye within the sacred bowl , and he knew not whether the mocking semblance just presented on its surface was distorted by pain , or whether the motion of the unstable mirror changed those lineaments from their wonted sweetness . A startling train had been given to his ideas , however , which fancy rudely followed up without the aid of new images to quicken her power . A sudden resolve and instant execution was the result . The call of the chief brought his horse in a moment to his side ; another served to readjust his few equipments , and , leaping into his seat , he at once bade adieu to the scenes where he had hardly yet commenced his new employment , leaving his fur-traps , and all they might contain , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Ta-in-ga-ro had a journey of some length before him along the base of the mountains ; but at last the " Spanish Peaks " hove near , and the impatient voyager soon after appeared before the trading-post of the Spaniard . He found it occupied by a small force of provincial soldiers , who had been ordered thither on account of some hostile movements of the neighbouring Cumanches ; and a good-natured Mexican , who was one of the sentinels on duty , apprized him that Zecana was there no longer , and warned him that imprisonment and death would be the certain consequence , should he present himself before the commandant . The anxious husband waited not to learn whether the trader was still at the station ; but , thinking that Zecana might have sought a refuge in his own home during the existing difficulties upon the border , he struck the spurs into his jaded horse , and , wheeling from the inhospitable gate , his lessening form soon disappeared over the rolling prairie . Never had the road seemed so long to the retreat where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in spite of some misgivings at his heart , he still hoped to realize many more . After winding his way for some time among the singular pieces of table-land which rise in such formal mounds from those plains , he descended at last into the little vale where his lodge was situated . All looked as still and sheltered as when last he left it ; and his heart rose to his lips when , reclining beneath the dwarf willows which bent over the stream near his door , he saw the loved form of Zecana . There was something unpleasant to him , however , in the singular listlessness of her appearance . The tramp of his horse appeared not to startle her ; and when at last his figure met her eye , she looked at him as carelessly as if wholly unconscious of his presence . She appeared to be busied in watching the ingenious labours of a group of prairie dogs , one of whose neat villages was clustered around a small mound near the spot where she sat ; and as the little animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport in the warm sunshine , she sung to them snatches of strange airs , such as had either originated among her own people , or been caught in other days from some wandering Mexican or Canadian trader . The chieftain threw himself from his horse , and stood over the insane female in agonized horror . The wild words that she murmured appeared to have no allusion to him ; and , though in her fallen and emaciated features he could still recognise the face of her whom he had loved , yet the being before him could hardly be identified with his own Zecana . But the strange superstition of his race in relation to those afflicted with the loss of reason , began soon to influence his mind , and , dropping on one knee before the maniac , he listened as solemnly to her ravings as if he had the art of a ouabineau , or wizard , to interpret them . They were incoherent and wandering , but they seemed ever and anon to hover near some revelation too horrible even to pass the lips of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bullet had pierced his heart when the conviction of their import first flashed upon his brain , while the soul-piercing cry he uttered summoned back for a moment the reason of the desolated woman before him . But the gleam of mind was instantly lost in a darker eclipse than that from which the voice of her lover had evoked it . She gave him a look of anguish , more piteous even than the ravings of her previous distraction ; and then  --  while her lips seemed convulsed with the effort  --  she shrieked forth the name of the Spaniard in the same instant that a knife , which she clutched from her husband 's belt , laid her a gory corpse at his feet . It would be impossible to describe the emotions of Ta-in-ga-ro at the spectacle which had just passed , like some dreadful vision , before his eyes . The very soul within him seemed blasted with horror and dismay at the frightful desolation that had overtaken his happy home . The casket in which he had garnered up his hopes  --  the being in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin , a desecrated corpse , before him ! And he that had wrought this stupendous injury  --  he , the author of this fiendish destruction  --  was the trusted friend of his bosom , the appointed guardian and protector of all it prized on earth or in heaven ! The lapse of hours found the wretched husband still standing in mute stupefaction where the knowledge of his calamity had first burst upon his agonized senses . But some new feeling seemed now to be at work within him ; a wild and sudden impulse gleamed fearfully over his fixed and haggard countenance . He became an altered being  --  changed on the instant  --  changed in heart , soul , and character , as if the spell of an enchanter had passed through his brain . Till now he had been either more or less than an Indian . The plastic hand of love had moulded him into a different creature from the stern and immoveable children of his race . The outlawed warrior had loved Zecana ; he had loved her , not as the sons of pleasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the luxuries , and fettered by the interests , the prejudices , the soul-shackling bonds of civilization  --  not as the artificial creature of society can only love . He loved with a soul that knew no dividing cares  --  that was filled with no hollow dreams of pomp and power . He loved with a heart that was tenanted by one only passion . He worshipped her with a mind that bowed to no image beneath the sun , save that which was graven on his own bosom . Nor was Zecana unworthy such a passion . Gentle as the antelope that skimmed the green savannas near , she was still a being , fond , warm , and doting ; and the deepest passions of her woman 's nature had been called into action by the wild devotion of her lover . The flower of her young affections had budded and matured to life , like the quickly-blowing blossoms of an arctic spring , while the fruits it bore were rich , and full , and glowing , as those which a tropic summer warms into existence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fulness of their love , think not that the ties of association were wanting to knit the memory of every look and word of hers to the heart-strings of Ta-in-ga-ro . The radiant face of Nature speaks ever to the Indian of the being that on earth he most adores . Her sigh will whisper from the leafy forest ; her smile will brighten on the blossom-tufted prairie ; the voice that murmurs in the running stream syllables her name in tuneful eloquence for ever . And they were happy . The brook that sang beneath the willows near their lodge  --  the flowers that kissed its current  --  the bird that warbled on the spray above them , were all the world to them  --  those lonely lovers . And now this bower of bliss was blasted  --  this home of peace and simple joys was desolated  --  ruined and desecrated , as if the malice-breathing fiat of some unhallowed and fabled monster had gone forth against the happiness of its owner . The pulse of no living being beat with sympathy for the master of that lonely wreck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The indomitable pride of an Indian chief filled its inmost recesses with new resources for battling with his fate . Love and sorrow  --  like the snow-drift which smooths the rocky casing of a volcano  --  melted in a moment before the fires that glowed within his flinty bosom , and his original nature asserted itself in every fibre of his frame . His mien and his heart alike were altered . His features petrified into the immobility of a savage , while his brain burned with a thirst for vengeance , which only gave no outward token because its fiendish cravings were unutterable through any human organ . Calmly now , as if nothing had occurred to ruffle the wonted placidity of his disposition , Ta-in-ga-ro proceeded to occupy himself , for the rest of the day , in the few concerns that required his attention . The still warm body of Zecana , after being carefully wrapped in a buffalo-skin , was disposed of for the time in the sunjiwun , or cach , wherein his few valuables were usually kept : then , carefully adjusting everything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his favourite horse , which , after the late arduous journey , required both attention and refreshment . When these necessary duties were fulfilled , the solitary , at the approach of evening , tranquilly lighted his pipe , and , passing several hours under its soothing influence with as much equanimity as if nothing had occurred to interrupt his customary enjoyment , he at last wrapped himself in his wolf-skin robe , and was soon sleeping as soundly as if a dream of human ill had never thrown a shadow over his slumbers . It was two nights after this that the Spanish trader lay securely asleep within the guarded walls of his station . His repose was apparently as unmolested as that which has just been ascribed to Ta-in-ga-ro ; and at the foot of his bed sat the dusky form of the Indian warrior , watching the sleep of his enemy with as mild an eye as if he were hanging upon the downy slumbers of an infant . All was as quiet as the tenantless lodge of the lonely watcher . The chamber , or cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blockhouse . It was guarded by sentries , both within and without the station ; and how this strange visitant had penetrated within the walls , no human being has ever known ; but there , by the flickering light of a low fire , could be seen the wily and daring savage , sitting as calm , cool , and collected as if patience were all that was required to effect the purpose that had brought him thither . The tramp of armed men was now audible near the gate of the fort , while the customary relief of sentinels was taking place . The slight commotion incident to the occasion soon ceased , and all around the post became again perfectly silent . A considerable space of time now elapsed , and the Indian still maintained his statue-like position . At last he sank noiselessly from the couch to the floor , and , placing his ear to the ground , listened for a while  --  as if assuring himself that all was as he wished . His measures were then instantly taken : he first loosed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long cord , or lariat , which he had either brought with him or found in the chamber of the Spaniard ; placing now his scalping-knife in his teeth , he glided like a shadow to the head of the bed , and at the same moment that the noose of the lariat was adroitly thrown over the neck of the sleeping trader with one hand , the belt of beaded woollen was forced into his mouth with the other , and his waking cries effectually stifled . The ill-starred Spaniard made but a short struggle for release ; for the arms of the sinewy savage pinioned him so closely , that the saw in a moment his efforts were in vain ; and the threatening motion of his determined foe , in tightening the noose when his struggles were more vigorous , intimidated him into deferring the attempt to escape to some more promising opportunity . He submitted to be bound in silence ; and the Indian swathed his limbs together till he lay utterly helpless , an inanimate log upon the couch whereon he had been reposing . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same imperturbability to place it beyond the danger of recapture . He first displaced a portion of the bark roof of the rude chamber , and , lifting his unresisting captive through the aperture , carefully placed his burden beside the wooden chimney of the primitive structure , where it projected above the timber-built walls of the station , and threw its shadows far over the area of the fort . Returning then to the room from which he had just emerged , he took an arrow thickly feathered from the combustible pods of the wild cotton tree , which grows profusely along the river-bottoms of this region , and , lighting it by the dying embers before him , he swung himself once more above the rafters , and , standing in the shadow of the chimney , launched the flaming shaft far within the window of a cabin which opened upon the central square of the station , immediately opposite to the shantee of the trader . The fiery missile performed its errand with speed and fidelity  --  the sleeping apartment of the commandant was instantly in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for their want of vigilence by present officiousness , rushed from their posts to shield their officer from the danger which had so suddenly beset him . The exulting savage availed himself of the commotion , and the fettered trader was lowered instantaneously on the outside of the fort . One dozing sentry only , who had hitherto been unobserved in the deep shadow of the wall , witnessed the daring act , and he started aghast at the inanimate form which was placed so abruptly at his feet ; but the Indian dropped like a falcon on his prey beside it , and a half-uttered cry of astonishment died away in a death-groan as the knife of the descending savage buried itself in the chest of the unfortunate soldier . The disappearance of the trader was not observed amid the pressing concern of the moment . The fire spread rapidly among the inflammable buildings , and the incendiary , who had a couple of horses waiting for him in a slight ravine which traversed the prairie , mounted by the light of the blazing cabins , and was far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his captive 's chamber were extinguished . Arriving at his own lodge by several short turns through the broken country , known only to himself , Ta-in-ga-ro unbound the trader from his horse , and , keeping his hands still tied behind him , attentively ministered to his wants , while refusing to reply to a single question , or to heed the pleadings of the anxious Spaniard for liberty . At length , being fully refreshed , the Indian left him for a few moments to his reflections , while he went to select a large and powerful charger from a herd of half-domesticated horses that were grazing near . The animal was soon caught and tethered by the door of the cabin . Ta-in-ga-ro then proceeded to strip his captive , and , compelling him to mount the horse , he secured him to the wooden saddle by thongs of elf-skin , attached to the surcingle , which girt it in its place . The wretched man trembled with apprehension , and , with a choking voice , offered all he was worth in the world to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be devoted . But the doomed profligate had not yet begun to conceive the nature of the punishment to which he was destined , or his pleadings for immediate death would have been as earnest as his prayers for life were now energetic . " Slave of a Pale-face ! " thundered the Indian  --  while the only words that had yet passed his lips betrayed a momentary impatience to the craven cries of the other  --  " think not that I am about to commit thee alone to the desert ! " A murmur of thanks escaped the faltering tongue of the Spaniard , but died away in a cry of horror as the Indian placed a gory and disfigured corpse astride the horse before him . When he recovered from the swoon into which the recognition of Zecana 's features had thrown him , the unhappy trader found himself bound to the stark and grim effigy of her that was once so soft and beautiful . So closely , too , was he bound , that the very effort to free himself only rendered nearer the hideous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he lashed to his horrible companion . His inveterate foeman stood ready mounted beside him , and waited only to feast his eyes with the first expression of shrinking horror evinced by the trader when he should regain his consciousness . A blow from his tomahawk then severed the halter by which the horse of the Spaniard was tethered ; and the enfranchised animal , tossing his mane in fury as he snuffed the tainted burden , bounded off in full career , followed by the fleet courser of the vindictive savage . Instinct taught him to make at once for the Great Desert , on whose borders lay the little prairie from which he started ; and on he went with the speed of an antelope . The dreary waste of sand was soon gained , and the limbs of the steed seemed to gather new vigour as they touched once more his native plains . But not so with his hapless rider . The fierce sunbeams , unmitigated by shade or vapour , beat down upon the naked person of the Spaniard , while the moisture that rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the embraces of the corpse to which he was bound . Night , with its blistering dews , brought no relief , and seemed only to hasten the corruption to which he was linked in such frightful compact . The cessation of motion at this time , when the horse , now accustomed to his burden , was recruiting upon the rough grasses which form the subsistence of his hardy breed , seemed even more horrible than the flight by day . The gore that oozed from the limbs of the trader stiffened around the cords which bound him , while his struggles to release himself , when the Indian was no longer by his side , served only , by farther excoriating his skin , to pollute the surface beneath it with the festering limbs which were twining around him . Sleep was allowed to bring no intermission to his sufferings . His head would indeed droop with languor and exhaustion , and his eyes would close for a moment in grateful forgetfulness of his situation . But the next moment his untiring and ever-vigilant enemy was before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit , pealed in his dreaming ears ; the startled charger bounded off in affright : and the break of dawn still found the remorseless pursuer howling on his track . And day succeeded to day , and still those illmatched riders speeded on their goadless journey . At length the pangs of hunger , which were soon added to the other tortures of the fated Spaniard , became too excruciating for endurance . His thirst being always , with ingenious cruelty , quenched by the proffered cup of the savage when their horses stopped to drink , the vitality of his system was still as exacting as ever . The gnawing torments to which his body was now subjected , surpassed even those with which its more delicate senses were agonized . In vain did he try to stifle the cruel longing that consumed him  --  in vain did he he turn with loathing and abhorrence from the only subsistence within his reach . An impulse stronger than that of mere preservation wrought within his phrensied bosom . An agony more unendurable than that which affected his revolting senses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perception , that might have stayed the vulture-like eagerness , with which he came at last to gloat upon the hideous banquet before him . A demoniac craving , like that of the fabled ghouls of eastern story , impelled him to  --  But why protract these harrowing details of super-human suffering ? The awful vengeance exacted from the foul-hearted and treacherous trader , like all things mortal , had its end . But the implacable Indian still hovered near , and feasted his eyes with the maddening anguish of his victim , until his last idiotic cry told that reason and nature were alike subdued , that brain and body were alike consumed by the fearful , ceaseless , and lingering tortures which ate them away by inches . The subsequent fate of Ta-in-ga-ro has never been known . Some say that he still dwells , a harmless old man , in the wandering tents of the Cheyennes ; others that he leads a predatory band of the ferocious and untameable Blackfeet : but there are those who insist that he has long since gone to the land of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are abroad , the grim phantom of the savage warrior may be seen chasing them over the interminable waste of the Great American Desert .

The effect of the mirage , with our indefinite idea of the distance , magnified those animals to the most prodigious size .

By this time the minds of the itinerant preachers were so much confounded , that they were no longer capable of observation , and could , therefore , give no farther account of what happened .

Edwin James 's U. S. A. NIGHTS IN AN INDIAN LODGE . II . A February thaw had set in , and , as the rising of the brooks compelled us to move our camp from the ravine in which we had slept for the last week , the chase was abandoned earlier than usual , in order that , after choosing a new location , we might have time to make ourselves comfortable for the night . A clump of trees on the upland offered the most suitable spot , as a few evergreens were scattered among them , and the loose heaps of stone which lay upon the edge of the prairie , might be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain long in the same place , and be at any pains in constructing our lodge . An accidental pile of these , against which the Canadian at once commenced building the fire , furnished the leeward side of our new cabin ; and a couple of upright crotches being planted in the ground opposite , two saplings were laid transversely from them to this rude wall ; the other sides were then enclosed with dried brush ; and , when a few cedar boughs had been laid across the top , we found ourselves in possession of very comfortable quarters . The Crapeau then commenced picking a wild turkey and some prairie chickens , which were the only spoils of our day 's hunt , while one of the Indians went off to bring some parched corn from the cach near our old camp . He had not been gone more than ten minutes before I heard the crack of a rifle , and the Plume , who was already engaged before the fire mending his moccasins , sprang to his feet , and , seizing his tomahawk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hi-ah-wah-nah bah-twa-we-tahng-gah ? Mukwaw ewah bah-twa-we-tahng-gah . " And true enough , I had not followed him a hundred rods before we saw needji Mukwaw desperately wounded beneath a tree , while Che-che-gwa was coolly loading his rifle within thirty paces of his sable enemy . The moon was shining as bright as day , and , there being still a little snow upon the ground where the bear was lying , his huge black limbs were drawn in full relief upon its white surface . The poor animal seemed unable to move ; but , though the groans he sent forth were really piteous , yet he ground his teeth with such rage , that it seemed undesirable to venture too near him ; especially as , though his hinderparts were paralyzed from the shot having taken effect in his spine , his forepaws were still almost as dangerous as ever . The claws of these were now continually thrust in and out with a convulsive motion as he writhed about and tore the ground with wrath and agony . Formidable as he appeared , however , the Plume did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him , but , rushing up with his uplifted tomahawk , he paused within a few paces of his mark , and , poising the weapon for a moment , hurled it with unerring aim at the head of the ferocious brute . The whize zing hatchet cleft his skull as if it had been a ripe melon , and buried itself in the bark of the tree behind him . " Ah c'est bon , Needje-naubi ; vere good , sauvage , " shouted the Canadian , coming up with a half-picked grouse in his hands , and his mouth full of feathers ; " the bourgeois will tell his people what a great hunter is La Plume Blanche . " But the Indian only answered by running up to his dead enemy , and , taking him by the paw and shaking it with a ludicrous and reverential gravity , he asked his pardon for having killed his uncle . Che-che-gwa at the same time unsheathed his scalping-knife , and , drawing it across the throat of the animal , he filled his hand with blood , exclaiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four cardinal points : " Ma-mo-yah-na miskwee , mamoyahna . Hi-a-gwo **28;640;TOOLONG ! Whe-a-ya ? " 5 The fat steaks that were soon broiling before our fire made no mean addition to our supper ; the birds , indeed , were not touched by my companions , who , I thought , would never tire of cutting piece after piece from the huge carcass that hung in the door- way . At last they seemed filled to repletion , and in capital humour from the brilliant winding up of the day 's sport . Even Che-che-gwa became quite talkative and facetious , and broke out into a half dozen songs , all laudatory of himself as a great hunter . As for White-plume , he dubbed his tomahawk , incontinently , " A Medicine ; " while together they made up a sort of duet , which , if hammered into English verse , might rhyme to this effect : They fly on  --  you know the clouds That fling their frowns o'er rock and river : They fly on  --  you know the clouds That flee before the wind for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushes ; Or though like them he scowls in wrath , Am one whose charmed weapon crushes Whoever dares to cross his path . " Yes , " continued Che-che-gwa , still maintaining a kind of chant when the song was ended , " though it were a bear concealed under the ground , I could find him . " " Yes , " pursued his comrade , in the same sort of recitative , " aided by the Manitoag , and armed with the weapons of Nannabozho , what animal shall be able to escape from the hunter ? " Nannabozho , as the reader must know , is the chief of the Manitoag or genii of fairy lore , among the Indians of the lakes . The more learned in these matters pretend to identify him ( under the name of " The Nannabush of the Algonkins " ) with the Iswara of India and the Saturn of ancient Italy .

NANNABOZHO : HOW HE CAME TO MAKE THIS EARTH . An Ojibbeway Legend . Once upon a time , a great many years ago , when Nannabozho was at war with the Mibanaba , or Manitoag of the water , it happened , on one very warm day , that several of these spirits came out of a lake to bask upon the beach . They were followed by a train of animals of various kinds , each the largest of its species , waiting upon them . When they had all lifted themselves from the water , and gained the shore , the two chiefs of the band appointed sentinels to keep watch while the rest should sleep . " Nannabozho , their great enemy , " said they , " was always vigilant , and this would be a good time for him to steal upon them and injure them . " The otters were , therefore , ordered to act as watchers , while the others gave themselves up to repose ; and soon the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that shore . Now , the weather , which was at first excessively warm , became gradually hotter and hotter , and the otters , after keeping awake for a while , were at last overcome with languor ; and when they saw all around them basking so comfortably on the sand , these sentinels , too , nodded on their posts , and were soon dreaming with the rest . The chiefs , finding the otters could not be depended upon , next commanded the loons to keep watch ; they were permitted to swim about in order to keep themselves awake , but they were ordered not to go far from the group of sleepers . Now , it chanced that at this time Nannabozho was travelling about in search of these very Manitoag ; nor was it long before he found out where they were . He knew at once what precautions they had adopted for their safety , but he was determined to destroy some of them before they could leave the place where he found them . Having carefully examined the position in which they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sprang toward them . But the loons were on the watch , and the moment Nannabozho came in sight , they gave a scream that awakened the whole band of sleepers . The chiefs were , of course , first upon their feet , while the rest of the Manitoag , and all the animals , rose in equal alarm . But when they looked around , there was no enemy to be seen , for Nannabozho had fled instantly , and hid himself in the long grass through which he had stolen toward the shore . The chiefs said it was a false alarm , and after a while all again betook themselves to repose . When Nannabozho saw that all around was quiet once more , he raised himself slowly from the ground , and was again about to rush upon them , when again did the loons give warning of his approach the moment he appeared in sight . It seems that the loon , who , some say , is a manitou , has the power of sleeping with but one eye at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can always keep one eye open , to watch for an enemy , while the other takes its necessary repose . But now , when they awakened a second time , and saw no enemy near , the chiefs were angry with the loons for giving a false alarm ; and the otters , who were jealous of them for pretending to be more sharp-sighted than themselves , said that it was not Nannabozho who hovered around , for if it had been , they would have seen him as well as the loons . After much disputing , at last the otters were believed , and all , excepting the loons , once more closed their eyes in sleep . Nannabozho was pleased with this . The weather was very warm , and he wished it might become yet warmer . It was so . Then Nannabozho crept forward , and took his station close by the group of sleepers ; and the very moment the loons gave their warning cry , he wished he might be turned into an old stump , and straightway the wish was granted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body , which stiffened into the hard fibres of a tree ; his toes separated , and , twisting among the loose soil , spread into roots on every side , while his hair became matted into ancient moss , that clung to the brown stump as if , moist and green as now , it had always mantled its decayed top . The enemies of Nannabozho were completely at a loss when , having again shaken off their drowsiness at the signal of the loons , they cast their eyes about the place . They looked in every direction , but there was nothing to be seen near , save the stump of a shattered tree , which apparently had once flourished upon the edge of the water . The loons told the chiefs that there was no stump there when they first came to the shore , but that it was Nannabozho himself who had taken this semblance . Some believed them and others did not ; and , to settle the question , the chiefs ordered the great water serpents to go and entwine themselves around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , it were Nannabozho . These serpents then straightway glided out of a slimy pool in which they had coiled themselves to rest , and , twisting their folds around the stump , they knotted their bodies together so as to press with all their might against every part of it . But it was all to no purpose . Nannabozho kept a strong heart , and did not betray the pain he suffered by the least sign or sound . The fire serpents were next ordered to try if they could not destroy him . They had been basking upon the hottest part of the beach until each scale had become like a coal of fire ; and as their scorching folds , coil after coil , were twisting around him , Nannabozho suffered the greatest tortures . The stump became black from the heat that was applied to it ; but , though the wood smoked as if about to burst into a blaze , yet the slime which the water serpents left upon it prevented it from actually taking fire . No one but Nannabozho could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stump had a little the shape of a man , and the serpents had a good place to twist around the part which represented the neck . Several times Nannabozho , finding himself choking , was upon the point of crying out , when the snakes would loosen themselves to apply their efforts in some other place . After repeated attempts in this way , the serpents at last desisted from their endeavours , and told the chiefs that it was not Nannabozho , for it was impossible that he could endure so much pain . The hostile spirits , however , were not yet satisfied , and the chiefs commanded the great red-nailed bearsto go and scratch the stump with their long claws . Nannabozho was all but torn to pieces by these ferocious creatures , but was still able to support the agony he endured . The bears at last gave up , as the serpents had done , and went back and told that it was not Nannabozho ; for he , they said , was a coward , and could not quietly endure so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nannabozho , and all went quietly to sleep as before . Nannabozho wished they might sleep very sound , and it was so : then he assumed his natural shape , and began cautiously to approach the sleepers . He stepped lightly over the bodies of the animals , and , passing by all the lesser Manitoag , he placed himself near the heads of the two chiefs . Planting his foot then upon the throat of the one nearest to him , he dealt a blow with his war-club , which crushed the head of the other . Another blow , and his companion was likewise dead . But now that the deed was done , Nannabozho found himself surrounded by dangers , and nothing but his swiftness of foot gave him any chance of escape from his revengeful foes , who were immediately in full cry after him . But soon the spirits , finding they could not overtake him by running , adopted a new device for getting Nannabozho in their power . They commanded the water to rise and flow after him ; and straightway the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so rapidly that it seemed impossible to escape them . Nannabozho did not know what to do in this emergency ; but at last , just as the water was about overwhelming him , he saw a crane , and determined to claim his assistance . " My brother , " said Nannabozho , " will you not drink up this water for me ? " The crane replied , " What will you give me in return ? " " I will give you the skin of one of the chiefs that I have killed , " answered Nannabozho . The crane was satisfied with the promise , and he commenced drinking up the water . He drank , and he drank until he had nearly drank it all , when he was unable longer to stand up . His body had swollen to an immense size , and as he went toddling along on his thin shanks , with his long neck bobbing about , he presented such a ludicrous appearance that Nannabozho burst out a laughing to see brother crane make such a figure . Nannabozho , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw the crane 's body become bigger and bigger , while his skin was stretched so that he could not bend his legs as it tightened around his joints  --  he could not withstand the temptation of pricking the bloated mass . He drew his bow , and the arrow went through the crane 's body . But quickly was he punished for his wanton sport . At once the waters began to rise again , and so fast did the big waves increase , that Nannabozho was compelled to name=f154-254Page image - Page 051. ascend the highest mountain he could find , and still the waters followed him there . He then climbed the highest tree on the mountain . But the flood kept rising and rising : the branches on which he stood were soon dipping in the waves , which at last rolled completely over his head . Just as they swept finally over him , Nannabozho chanced to look up , and saw the shadow of an object floating near him ; he stretched out his arm and seized it . It proved to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he placed himself upon it . Nannabozho now floated about for some time . The water encompassed him on every side . It had covered up everything . The rocks , hills , and trees had all disappeared . The flood seemed to ripple against the sides of the sky all around , and whichever way he looked , there was nothing to be seen but a never-ending succession of waves , that had nothing but the wind to play against . At last he saw a musquash swimming about alone , and he asked him to go down to the earth and bring him a little of it . The animal obeyed , and plunged toward the bottom , but it was soon seen on the surface of the water perfectly dead . Nannabozho , however , did not yet despair . He immediately after saw a beaver paddling toward him , and as soon as the beaver got near enough to hear , he said to him  --  " My brother , will you not dive and get me some earth ? " The beaver dived , but did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems , when he dives , can carry down so much air entangled in his coat , that , when compelled to stay long under water , he can thrust his nose into his fur and breathe for some time . At last he appeared again upon the surface , nearly dead with exhaustion ; he brought up a very little piece of mud on the flat end of his tail , which he gave to Nannabozho . Nannabozho scraped every particle of it carefully together , and placed it in the palm of his hand to dry . When it had become perfectly dried , he blew it out into the water , and straightway a portion of the earth upon which we now live was created . The dust , too , in the hand of Nannabozho kept increasing the longer he blew , until more and more of the earth was made ; and at last the whole world was finished just as large as it now is . When Che-che-gwa had finished his legend , I could not help asking him whence came the plants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Chippewa Deucalion . These , he answered , had been subsequently created in various ways . Many of the larger trees had been produced from the piece of wood upon which Nannabozho had floated in the deluge ; and several shrubs , brought up by the loons in diving , had taken root again upon the shores to which they drifted . A shell lying upon the strand was transformed into the racoon , and many of the other animals had come into existence in a similarly miraculous manner ; while different kinds of birds had their origin in some metamorphosis like that of the pious , but faint-hearted , youth who , when his ambitious father wished him to go on the war-path , pined away and was changed into a robin ; 8 his guardian spirit permitting him to cheer his parent with songs to console him for the glory that had thus departed from his family . The habits of the whippoor-will , who , like the robin , delights to linger near the lodge of the hunter , were accounted for in the following simple manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in woods and rocky places , and , according to Dr. James , is more dreaded by the Indians than even the Manitou-mukwaw , or great grizzly bear of the prairies . See " Life on the Lakes , " by the Author of " Legends of a Log Cabin . " New York . 1836 . WAW-O-NAISA ; OR , THE ORIGIN OF THE WHIP-POOR-WILL . The father of Ranche-wai-me , the Flying Pigeon of the Wiskonsan , would not hear of her wedding Waw-o-naisa , the young chief who had long sought her in marriage ; yet , true to her plighted faith , she still continued to meet him every evening upon one of the tufted islets which stud the river in great profusion . Nightly through the long months of summer did the lovers keep their tryste , parting only after each meeting more and more endeared to each other . At length Waw-o-naisa was ordered off upon a secret expedition against the Sioux : he departed so suddenly that there was no opportunity of bidding farewell to his betrothed ; and his tribesmen , the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the youth was no more , having perished in a fray with the Menomones , at the Winnebago portage . Ranche-wai-me was inconsolable , but she dared not show her grief before her family ; and the only relief she knew for her sorrow was , to swim over to the island by starlight , and , calling upon the name of her lover , bewail the features she could behold no more . One night the sound of her voice attracted some of her father 's people to the spot ; and , startled at their approach , she tried to climb a sapling in order to hide herself among its branches ; but her frame was bowed with sorrow , and her weak limbs refused to aid her . " Waw-o-naisa , " she cried , " Waw-o-naisa ! " and at each repetition of his name her voice became shriller ; while in the endeavour to screen herself in the underwood a soft plumage began to clothe her delicate limbs , which were wounded by the briers , and lifting pinions shot from under her arms , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when just about to seize the maid , saw nothing but the bird , which has ever since borne the name of her lover , flitting from bush to bush before them , and still repeating , " Waw-o-naisa "  --  " Waw  --  o-naisa . " NIGHTS IN AN INDIAN LODGE . III . Returning from an unsuccessful hunt about dusk on the succeeding day , we found , upon entering the lodge , that the wolves had paid it a visit during our absence on the previous night . The pukwi , or mats , which had formed quite a comfortable carpeting for name=f154-258Page image - Page 055. the humble chamber , were torn to pieces ; and the voracious animals had devoured whatever articles of skin or leather they could lay their teeth upon . A pair of moccasins belonging to the Rattlesnake , the carrying-straps of the Canadian , and a shot-pouch of my own , had all been spirited off in this audacious burglary . " Wah ! " ejaculated Che-che-gwa , with a ludicrous intonation of dismay , as he followed me into the shantee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " echoed White-plume , thrusting his head over the shoulder of the other as his companion paused on the threshold to observe the extent of the mischief . " Kitchi-que-naitch "  --  " It is very well , " added he , drily , upon observing that a large piece of moose meat , suspended from the rafters , had escaped the long-haired pilferers . I could not but sympathize with him in the self-gratulation , for I remembered once , while spending a day or two with a settler in Michigan , having gone supperless to bed when equally sharp set , after a severe day 's hunt , owing to a similar neighbourly visit . The prairie wolf , though a much less ferocious and powerful animal than the wood 's wolf , makes up in sagacious impudence for his want of size and strength . On the occasion alluded to , one of these fellows had climbed into the window of a shantee , and actually carried off a whole saddle of venison which had been prepared for cooking , before the settler and myself had started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . White-plume now deposited his rifle in a corner of the lodge , and , leaving the Canadian to put our disarranged household to rights , he proceeded to the sunjiwun , or cach , which was made in the bank of a rivulet near the door , and soon returned with a gourd of bear 's fat and a sack of hard corn . The latter , when pounded and duly mixed with the snowy lard , made a crisp and inviting dressing for the moose meat , and enabled the Frenchman , who acted as cook , to turn out some ctelettes panes , that , for flavour and relish , would not have discredited the cuisine of Delmonico . I confess , however , that my appreciation of the luxurious fare was not enhanced by the dexterity with which White-plume would ever and anon thrust the ramrod of his short north-west rifle into the dish , and flirt the dripping slices into his expectant mouth ; nor was the marksman-like precision with which Che-che-gwa launched his scalping-knife into the kettle , that served us for both frying-pan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fault , however , that we had no silver forks at table ; and they certainly committed no greater breach of decorum in their eating than certain travellers affect to have seen on board some of our Atlantic steamers . " Caw ke-we-ah m ' woi-gui-nah-needji "  --  " Will you not eat , my friend ? " observed White-plume more than once , offering me a moreau from the point of his chopstick . In spite of the example of Lord Byron and Sir John Malcolm  --  accepting the reeking pilau from the greasy knuckles of Turk and Persian  --  I thought myself at liberty to decline the proffered civility , inasmuch as I was not partaking of the particular hospitality of the Indian , but felt myself as much at home in the entertainment as he was himself . The customary pipe succeeded ; and , there being no more " fire water "  --  skuta-warbo  --  in the flask of the Canadian , we added an additional quantity of tobacco to the willow-scrapings from the kinnekinic bag , in order to make the smoking mixture more potent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act upon the excitable system of White-plume , and he regaled us with a number of songs , which were anything but musical . There was but one of them that appeared to me to have anything poetical , either in sentiment or imagery , to recommend it . It was a Mezi-nee-neence , or " Medicine Song , " of a lover , in which he is supposed to have some magical power of knowing the secret thoughts of his mistress , and being able to charm her to him from any distance . In English it might run as follows : I. Who , maiden , makes this river flow ? The Spirit  --  he makes its ripples glow  --  But I have a charm that can make thee , dear , Steal o'er the wave to thy lover here . II . Who , maiden , makes this river flow ? The Spirit  --  he makes its ripples glow  --  Yet every blush that my love would hide , Is mirror 'd for me in the tell-tale tide . III . And though thou shouldst sleep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Yet I have a charm that can make thee , dear , Steal over the wave to thy lover here . In the fragments of rude , and often insipid , poetry with which the singer followed up this specimen of his art , there were occasional allusions which interested me , and for which I attempted to get an explanation . But it was almost impossible to obtain a direct answer ; for White-plume , though a great talker for an Indian , had no faculty for conversation  --  that is , there was no such thing as exchanging ideas with him ; and even when I asked him the names of particular things , in order to increase my slight vocabulary of his language , his replies were equally rambling . Among other objects , the Evening Star , which glows with remarkable effulgence in the clear frosty atmosphere of these regions , attracted my eye , as its silver rays , pouring through an opening of our lodge , exhibited even more than their wonted virgin purity when contrasted with the red glare of our fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of it , which was wholly lost upon my ear . But the question gave a new and more steady turn to his wandering ideas ; and , with the occasional assistance of my Canadian interpreter , I was able to follow him out in a very pleasing story , founded upon an Indian superstition connected with the planet . The tale will , of course , lose much on second-hand repetition , for no writer has as yet succeeded in his attempt to infuse the true Indian character into his narrative , when he speaks in the person of a red man . The figurative phrascology of the luxurious Asiatic , and the terse conciseness of expression that survives in some relics of the poetry of the ancient Northmen , are sometimes so curiously reconciled and blended in the language of our aborigines , as to defy even the most ingenious and gifted pen to imitate it . I can not , perhaps , better begin the narrative than by recalling Major Long 's account of the barbarous Indian ceremony , which gave rise to the historical incident which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manito o-ba-me-je-waunga Me-nee-sing , a-be-gwain neen-ge-wun-naitch Che-ha-ga-toga Me-ne-sing a-be-gwain Whe-he-yah ! 2 .

" So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung , So light to the saddle before her he sprung ! She is won ! we are gone , over bank , bush , and scaur ; They 'll have fleet steeds that follow , ' quoth young Lochinvar . " Scott . The Pawnee-Loups , or Ske-re , as they call themselves , not many years since , and within the memory of persons now living , exhibited the singular anomaly , among the North American aborigines , of a people addicted to the revolting superstition of making propitiatory offerings of human victims upon the altars of idolatry . Mekakatungah , " The Great Star , " was the divinity to whom the sanguinary worship had been , from time immemorial , ascribed . The barbarous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preside over the fruits of the earth ; and , on each return of the season of planting , the life-blood of a human being was poured out in libation upon the soil . A breach of this duty , the performance of which they believed was required by the Great Star , it was supposed would be succeeded by the total failure of their crops of maize , beans , and pumpkins , and the consequent privation of the supply of vegetable food , which formed half the subsistence of the tribe . To obviate a calamity so formidable , any person was at liberty to offer up a prisoner , of either sex , of whom , by his prowess in war , he had become possessed ; and the horrid rite was accompanied by all the solemn ceremonies which characterize the superstitious idolatry of an ignorant and barbarous people . The devoted individual was placed under the care of the Ouabi-neaux , or magi of the tribe , who anticipated all his wants , while they cautiously concealed from him the real object of their sedulous attentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cheerfulness , with the view of promoting obesity , and thereby render the sacrifice more acceptable to their Ceres . When the victim was pronounced sufficiently fattened for immolation , a suitable time was appointed for the performance of the rite , that the whole nation might attend . When the appointed day of his fate arrived , he was clothed in the gayest and most costly attire , and led out to the spot where he was to suffer . Here he was bound to a cross , in presence of the assembled multitude , and a solemn dance was performed around him . A number of other ceremonies followed , and then the warrior whose prisoner he had been , stepped forth into the open space , and assumed the inglorious task of his execution . Generally a single blow with the tomahawk despatched the victim ; but if the first throw failed to cleave his head , the speedy death of the person immolated was insured by a shower of arrows from a band of archers , who were always in attendance . The abolition of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 The season of planting was at hand : the Pawnee-Loups , in order to call down a blessing upon their labours in the field , prepared for their wonted sacrifice to the cruel divinity , who they believed presided over the genial fruits of the earth . There was more than the usual bustle in the principal village of the tribe . The faces of some of the seniors wore a look of anxiety ; and the young people , for several days preceding the ceremony , could be seen grouped together before the scattered lodges , with an air of curiosity and impatience seldom observable in their little community . The fact was , that there chanced to be at this moment not a single captive in the band to offer up in sacrifice . The last that had been taken  --  a pretty Ietan girl , of the name of Lataka  --  had escaped the horrible fate which awaited her , by perishing , as was thought , in a fray which had occurred at nightfall , soon after her arrival in the village . The young partisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latelesha , had interfered at the moment that the maid was about to be consigned to the hands of the magi , to be by them prepared for their annual rite ; and in the confused broil which ensued the prisoner disappeared , and was represented by the principal magician to have perished by falling , while her hands were yet bound , into a stream near the village , during the commotion which took place upon its immediate banks . The old crones , in gossiping from lodge to lodge , had circulated a story that the officious interference of Petalashroo was caused by his being suddenly enamoured of the captive damsel ; and they were very much incensed at the idea that the stripling might be the instrument , possibly , of cheating them out of their yearly festival , in which , unless tradition has belied them , they took no passive part . But it was more generally believed that the act was prompted by less exceptionable motives on the part of the young chief ; that it was , in short , nothing more nor less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end to a custom which he had already attempted , by argument , to do away with , and which , it was known , that his less daring father was but too solicitous to root out from among his people . As the time now approached when the Great Star would expect his victim , and not a single captive was to be had , the incident of the previous autumn was called up afresh to memory . There was a great deal of murmuring and discontent among the tribesmen ; and nothing but the personal popularity of the warrior who had taken so prominent a part in the occurrence , would have prevented some violent outbreak of popular feeling : day after day elapsed , and no captive appeared to supply the place of the victim that Petaleshroo had snatched from the sacrifice . Several warriors , who had been out on war parties , returned one after another to the village . They almost all claimed to have struck the dead body of an enemy , and some could show more than one scalp at their belt ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was yet one more to come back ; and , though " The Running Fox " had no great repute as a brave , yet the whole hopes of the tribe were now fixed upon his address alone . He had not left the village until after almost all the other warriors that were out had returned from the war-path ; but there was strong confidence in the success of his expedition , because he had been seen in close consultation with the magi before be departed , and a favourable result was said to have been propitiated , by their having a Mezi-nee-nence , or medicine hunt , together . Indeed , the chief magician had given out that the Fox would certainly return with the wished-for prey . The Great Star , he said , had promised him that a victim should be forth-coming ; and he had invited Petaleshroo to meet him at a lonely place , remote from the village , where he said that the young man might witness how the God he served would keep his promise . Let us be present at that memorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nothing but the swarms of moschetoes , which were continually rising from the wet prairie , could have induced one to tolerate the fire that was blazing on an isolated table-rock , in the midst of a lonely savanna . The singularly exposed situation , however , of this fire , which shone like a beacon over the waste , would seem to imply that it could hardly have been kindled for mere purposes of comfort or convenience , for cooking the rude meal of a hunter , or for driving off the insects that might molest his slumber ; and the two swarthy figures that were crouched beside it , though evidently belonging to that wild race who find their chief subsistence in the chase , were characterized by some marks which indicated that they were not exclusively devoted to the pursuits of common savages . The eldest of the two , whose attenuated features , projecting forehead , and screwed , sinister-looking mouth imparted a mingled expression of fanaticism and knavery to his countenance , was perfectly naked , with the exception of an azeeaun , or apron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the middle of his person ; but his limbs and body were so completely covered with various devices tattooed in strong black lines upon his copper-coloured skin , that , to a slight observer , he would appear to be dressed out in some elaborate and closely-fitting apparel . The prominent device in the tattooing was an enormous doulbe-tailed serpent whose flat head appeared to repose upon the chest of the Indian , while his scaly folds were made to twine themselves around his extremities with a fidelity to nature that was equally ingenious , grotesque , and hideous . The high , uncouth shoulders , long skinny arms , and squat figure of his person as he sat stooping over the fire , with his legs folded under him , were strikingly contrasted with the fine proportions , the rounded and agile limbs , and lion-like port of a young warrior who was reclining along the rock on the opposite side of the fire . The features of the youth were naturally of an open and generous , almost a careless , cast ; but they now wore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anxiety and awe . At times , as the subsiding of an ember would make the fire flash up and fling its fitful light far over the plain , the young man would spring eagerly to his feet , and throw a restless glance upon the shifting gloom around him , as if he expected some one to emerge from its shadow . His companion , however , calmly maintained his sitting posture , and seemed only to busy himself in occasionally turning over a collection of roots , seeds , pap-pous , and powders which were deposited upon a piece of wolf-skin before him , and which he never touched without mumbling over some of those strange phrases which are only found in the mouths of necromancers and magicians , and which are said to be unpronounceable by any but a true medicine-man . " I tell thee , Wahobeni , " said the youth at last , flinging himself upon his bison-skin , as if his patience was at length wholly exhausted  --  " I tell thee the Fox will never more return . The Master of Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed by his red children . " " The words of the young chief are less than his years , " replied his senior . " The Great Star must have his offering . The season of planting is at hand ; and , unless the Spirit of fruits be propitiated , there will be no maize in the lodges of the She-re . " " Think'st thou , Magician , that , should even the crafty Fox produce his victim , my father will allow the ceremony to proceed ? I tell thee no ! Latelesha sheds no blood , save that which is poured out in battle . " " The sire of Petaleshroo is a great chief ; but he has no power over his people , to step between them and the god of their worship . The heart of the Knife-chief is no more with his tribe , and his son hath learned to speak with the tongue of the Pale-face . " The eyes of the young man flashed fire , while , clutching his tomahawk , he made a sudden movement as if about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked , and he resumed his former position , with only a slight ejaculation of contempt at the reproach of an old man whom he despised . " The Spirit will keep Wahobeni from bad things , " said the medicine-man , observing the movement . " Wahobeni is a great magician ; the **26;670;TOOLONG is his friend , and he walks with serpents along the ground . Myself  --  know me , my son , the servant of the Great Star . Believe my words when I interpret the will of my master . Behold the parched and cracking earth ! Behold the crowded thunders in yon blackening sky , which even now refuse to break the clouds and let the showers through ! Behold  --  " A sudden flash lit up the waste , and gave an unearthly glare to the forbidding features of the magician as the bolt went rattling by . " Manito Sah-iah  --  There is a God ! " exclaimed the youth , as he reverently took a handful of tobacco from his pouch and threw the offering upon the fire . " The Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The God that answered thee but now , is the only one that can send blossoms and fruits to the gardens of our tribe . " The medicine-man was silent ; and the young chief , folding his arms thoughtfully , contented himself with this brief rebuke . But the stolidity of a bigot and the cunning of a hypocrite were to subtly and actively blended in the composition of the other , to allow him to feel more than a moment 's confusion , or to rob him of the resources with which a life of successful imposture had stored his mind . The few broad drops which succeeded the single thunder-clap , were not followed by the shower that seemed impending ; and the magician cast a malignant glance of triumph at the youth , when , after adjusting the machinery of his trade in some new form upon the skin before him , and passing his hands repeatedly over his bat-skin skull-cap , the clouds suddenly parted , and the evening star shone forth redly above the horizon . " The Great Star blushes for my son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the planet . " The God of planting scowls in wrath upon his minister who listens to the ravings of a boy . The Running Fox will keep his promise , and the Ske-re will make their annual offering . " " Not so  --  not so , old man , " replied the youth , firmly ; and then , while a sudden change came over his features , " Not unless a Jebi steps from its grave , and the shadows of men 's souls ( ojee-chaugomen ) are sent on earth to mock your bloody ceremony . " And the young man placed his hand convulsively upon his sacred metawaun , while his eyes , dilating with horror , became fixed upon a well-known face which , even as he spoke , peered above the ledge of the rock opposite to where he sat . " And what , " rejoined the medicine-man , calmly , as if unobservant of the agitation of the speaker  --  " what if the Great Star , in kindness to his red children , should call back one of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , ) to enable Wahobeni to fulfil the sacrifice for which , till now , a victim has never been wanting . I tell thee , son of Latelesha , that a shaft of maize has never yet hung forth a tassel above the ground , that was not watered with the blood of an enemy . But now the warriors of the Ske-re are squaws ; there are no captives in their lodges ; and the Great Star , who wills that there must be a victim , will send one of his own choosing from among those who have already passed the swinging tree , and attained the gardens of the happy . " With these words the magician rose , and , stamping upon the ashes , the shook some combustible powder from the congar-skin that enveloped his loins . A dozen forks of yellow smoke curled up in shreds from the fire , and seemed to wreath themselves with the coils of the serpent that was twined round his body  --  each bursting into flame before it reached his head . There was a sudden flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its bewildering glare subsided , the form of the Ietan maiden was fully disclosed to the awe-struck gaze of her lover , as she stood with her hand locked in that of the terrible being before him . A thousand conflicting feelings tugged at the heart-strings of the noble youth ; a thousand changing images of love and fear , hope and horror , shot in maddening confusion across his brain . His senses reeled in the effort to rally their flying powers ; and Petaleshroo , the dauntless partisan of the Pawnee-Loups  --  he whose heart had never quailed , whose nerves had never shrunk in the wildest horrors of savage warfare  --  swooned at the feet of the sinking damsel . The day of the sacrifice to the Great Star had arrived . It was a beautiful morning in April when the misguided children of the wilderness were assembled at the call of the magi , to celebrate the anniversary of their cruel deity . The scene of their infernal orgies was a tall grove upon the edge of the prairie , an islet of timber which , viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to spring from , the broad green surface . It was a grand festival day with the Pawnee-Loups , and the wonted military watchfulness of this warlike tribe was dispensed with upon the occasion of general relaxation , the usual sentinels of the camp were scattered round in groups among the rest of the people ; and their horses , which generally were tethered , ready saddled , near the lodges of the guard , were now scattered over the prairie with the other cattle of the tribe . There were two chargers only that did not seem to share the general liberty ; and these stood fully equipped , pawing the ground as if impatient of confinement , behind a small copse not far from the scene of the sacrifice . One of them , a light and graceful palfrey , was tied to a sapling which grew upon the spot , while the reins of the other were held by as gallant a cavalier as ever crossed a saddle . He was a young man , of not more than three-and-twenty , of the finest form , tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His head-dress of war-eagle 's feathers descended in a double series over his back , like wings , to his saddle-croup : his shield was highly decorated , and his long lance was ornamented with a plaited casing of red and blue cloth . The steed he backed was every way worthy of such a rider . It was the partisan , Petaleshroo and his charger , Leksho , the Arrow . The large dark eye of the young warrior wore an expression of seriousness and concern but little in unison with the festivities of the day . And ever and anon he turned to look along the edge of the thicket , and grasped the handle of his tomahawk , as if as restive as the champing courser beneath him . But his lips were compressed in resolution rather than anger , and the nervous bracing of his feet in the stirrups gave an air of high determination to his whole figure . At length the different groups of Indians were collected around one central spot , where a cross was erected upon a slight elevation in the prairie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be offered up as a sacrifice to the Great Star . Her youth and beauty were lost upon the sterner part of the assemblage ; but her gorgeous apparel , rich with wrought ornaments of the precious metals , and gay with the woven texture of beads and feathers of the most elaborate and costly workmanship , drew a murmur of admiration from those of her own sex who mingled with the crowd.The multitude were generally overawed by the solemnity of the occasion , and preserved a decorous silence as the principal Meta , with his train of Ouabineaux , led on the captive . A few , however , would thrust their heads over the shoulders of their neighbours , and fix their savage eyes as eagerly upon the victim as if , by reading her feelings in her face , they could enjoy in anticipation the horrid festival . But Lataka was an Indian maiden , and her soul was too proud to let the enemies of her tribe guess the feelings which swelled in her bosom as she moved with the step of an empress to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ouabineaux now , under the direction of the Meta , entered at once upon their barbarous office ; and , rudely seizing the fragile girl , her limbs were bound to the stake almost before she discovered the full extent of the fate that awaited her . Still not a murmur was made by the Indian maiden ; not a sob nor a sigh escaped the lips that quivered in the effort to repress the thrilling emotions of the moment . Her eye wandered mildly around the dusky circle of faces , as if seeking rather for sympathy than rescue  --  as if she wished only for some one being to appreciate the fortitude with which she could offer up her life . The grim gaze of a motionless multitude was all that met her view . There was no one there who could have an emotion kindred to her own . There was no one there who could care for Lataka ; and , raising her eyes to heaven , she commended her spirit to the Wacodnah , who cares for all . And now the solemn dance commenced around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually increasing in rapidity , as , with savage yells , they encouraged each other , until the fiendish faces of her executioners whirled around her in one continuous chain of glaring and demoniac glances . The motion ceased , and the chief of the magi stepped into the open space to make his sacrificial prayer to the Great Star . Myself  --  myself . Behold me , and see that I look like myself . I sit down in the lodge of the Meta  --  the lodge of the spirit . I am a magician ; the roots of shrubs and weeds make me a magician . Snakes are my friends . I am able to call water from above , from beneath , and from around . I come to change the appearance of this ground . I make it look different in each season . Notwithstanding you speak evil of me , from above are my friends , my friends . I can kill any animal , because the loud-speaking thunder helps me  --  I can kill any animal . Thus have I sat down , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The eye of Lataka had been cast heavenward during the utterance of this prayer ; and , when it was concluded , she merely murmured the plaintive , Dadainsh-ta-a , " Oh ! alas ! for me , " and resigned herself once more to her cruel fate . The master of the infernal rite then turned round to give the signal for her tortures to begin , and the deep roll of the Indian drum commanded silence while he spoke again for the last time . The murmur of the multitude was hushed , and the melancholy dirge died away in the distant prairie . The Meta had raised his arm to give the fatal signal , when forth from the thicket , like an arrow from the bow of the thunder-god , shot the war-like form of Petaleshroo . With one hand he couched his quivering lance , and waved his gleaming tomahawk high above his head with the other . His bridle floated loose on the neck of his charger . On  --  on he came like a bolt from heaven , while his charging cry speedily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courser bounded into the midst of it . A blow from his tomahawk severed the thong which bound Lataka , in an instant , and , before his startled and astounded tribesmen could recover from their surprise , he had gained anew his greenwood covert with the sinking form of the rescued damsel . A moment sufficed to place her on the fleet palfrey that bowed his neck to the beautiful rider ; in another they were speeding like the wind over the smooth prairie ; while , before his disappointed and baffled countrymen could mount in pursuit , Petaleshroo had placed a broad strip of forest between them ; and the infuriated yells of the baffled multitude died upon the breeze which whispered naught but hope and confidence to the flying lovers . The Pawnee and his bride enjoyed the blessings of summer in another land . But before the snows of the next season had come again , his tribesmen had invited him back to the lodges of the Ske-re . Nor since that day have they ever offered up a human victim to the Great Star. 13 Footnotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the interesting historical incident which follows it , and the description of the dress and personal appearance of the heroic Indian who abolished the barbarous rite , will be found in " Major Long 's Expedition to the Rocky Mountains , " with but little variation from the text . The portrait of the youthful and handsome Petaleshroo is preserved in the Indian Gallery at Washington . Gitche-a-nah-mi-e-be-zew  --  " The Devil yard-long-tailed . " The gala dresses of the Indians in some tribes are very costly . The minute embroidery of wampum and porcupine quills , and the profusion of silver ornaments , with the high value placed upon the war-eagle 's feathers and other favourite materials make a full festival suit command a price of several hundred dollars . This story was written several years since , and I grieve to say that since the first edition of this work the Ske-re have again compromised their character in the matter of human sacrifices to the Great Star ; and that so lately as April , 1839 . SCENES AMONG THE ALLEGHANIES . A NIGHT ON THE ENCHANTED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of first fond love ; Like the ice that floats on a summer stream From some frozen fount above : Through my river of years ' twill drifting gleam , Where'er their waves may rove ! It flashes athwart each sunny hour With a strangely bright but chilling power , Ever and ever to mock their tide With its illusive glow ; A fragment of hopes that were petrified Long , long ago ! There are few parts of the United States which , for beauty of scenery , amenity of climate , and , I might add , the primitive character of the inhabitants , possess more peculiar attraction than the mountainous region of Eastern Tennessee . It is a wild and romantic district , composed of rocks and broken hills , where the primeval forests overhang valleys watered by limpid streams , whose meadowy banks are grazed by innumerable herds of cattle . The various mountain-ridges , which at one point traverse the country almost in parallel lines , while at another they sweep off in vast curves , and describe a majestic amphitheatre , are all more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarities which elsewhere characterize those mountains . In some places the transition from valley to highland is so gradual , that you are hardly aware of the undulations of surface when passing over it . In others , the frowning heights rise in precipitous walls from the plains , while again their wooded and dome-like summits will heave upward from the broad meadows like enormous tumuli heaped upon their bosom . The hills also are frequently seamed with deep and dark ravines , whose sheer sides and dimly-descried bottom will make the eye swim as it tries to fathom them ; while they are often pierced with cavernous galleries , which lead miles under ground , and branch off into grottos so spacious that an army might be marshalled within their yawning chambers. 14 Here , too , those remarkable conical cavities which are generally known by the name of " sink-holes " in the western country , are thickly scattered over the surface ; and so perfect in shape are many of them , that it is difficult to persuade the ruder residents that they are not the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinct monsters whose fossil remains are so abundant in this region . Indeed the singular formation of the earth 's surface , with the entire seclusion in which they live amid their pastoral valleys , must account for , and excuse , many a less reasonable belief and superstition prevailing among those hospitable mountaineers . " The Enchanted Mountains , " as one of the ranges I have been attempting to describe is called , are especially distinguished by the number of incredible traditions and wild superstitions connected with them . Those uncouth paintings along their cliffs , and the footprints of men and horses stamped in the solid rock upon the highest summits , as mentioned by Mr. Flint in his Geography of the Western Country , constitute but a small part of the material which they offer to an uneducated and imaginative people for the creation of strange fantasies . The singular echoes which tremble through these lonely glens , and the shifting forms which , as the morning mist rises from the upland , may be seen stealing over the tops of the crags and hiding themselves within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having always been imbued with a certain love of the marvellous , and being one of the pious few who , in this enlightened age of reality , nurse up a lingering superstition or two , I found myself , while loitering through this romantic district , and associating upon the most easy terms with its rural population , irresistibly imbibing a portion of the feeling and spirit which prevailed around me . The cavernous ravines and sounding aisles of the tall forests had " airy tongues " for me as well as for those who are more familiar with their whisperings . But as for the freakish beings who were supposed to give them utterance as they pranked it away in the dim retreats around , I somehow or other could never obtain a fair sight of one of them . The forms that sometimes rose between my eyes and the mist-breathing cascade , or flitted across the shadowy glade at some sudden turn of my forest-path , always managed to disappear behind some jutting rock , or make good their escape into some convenient thicket , before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their existence at all . My repeated disappointments in this way had begun to put me quite out of conceit with my quickness and accuracy of vision , when a new opportunity was given me of testing them , in the manner I am about to relate . I happened one day to dine at a little inn situated at the mouth of a wooded gorge , where it lay tucked away so closely beneath the ponderous limbs of a huge tulip tree , that the blue smoke from the kitchen fire alone betrayed its locality . Mine host proved to be one of those talkative worthies who , being supplied with but little information whereon to exercise his tongue , make amends for the defects of education and circumstance by dwelling with exaggeration upon every trivial incident around him . Such people in polished society become the scandal-mongers of the circle in which they move , while in more simple communities they are only the chroniclers of every thing marvellous that has occurred in the neighbourhood " within the memory of the oldest inhabitant . " I had hardly placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to display his retentive faculties by giving me the exact year and day upon which every chicken with two heads or calf with five legs had been born throughout the whole country round . Then followed the most minute particulars of a murder or two which had been perpetrated within the last twenty years ; and after this I was drilled into the exact situation and bearings of a haunted house which I should probably see the next day by pursuing the road I was then travelling ; finally , I was inducted into all the arcana of a remarkable cavern in the vicinity , where an " ouphe , gnome , moon-elf , or water-sprite " had taken up its residence , to the great annoyance of every one except my landlord 's buxom daughter , who was said to be upon the most enviable terms with the freakish spirit of the grotto . The animated , and almost eloquent , description which mine host gave of this cavern , made me readily overlook the puerile credulity with which he wound up his account of its puculiarities . It interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable my horse for the night , and proceed at once to explore the place . A fresh and blooming girl , with the laughing eye and free step of a mountaineer , volunteered to be my guide on the occasion , hinting , at the same time , while she gave a mischievous look at her father , that I should find it difficult to procure a cicerone other than herself in the neighbourhood . She then directed me how to find the principal entrance to the cave , where she promised to join me soon after . A rough scramble in the hills soon brought me to the place of meeting , and , entering the first chamber of the cavern , which was large , and well lighted from without , I stretched myself upon a rocky ledge which leaned over a brook that meandered through the place , and , lulled by the dash of a distant waterfall , surrendered myself to a thousand musing fancies . Fatigue from an early and long morning ride , or possibly too liberal a devotion to the good things which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon to be overtaken by sleep . My slumbers , however , were broken and uneasy ; and , after repeatedly opening my eyes to look with some impatience at my watch as I tossed upon my stony couch , I abandoned the idea of a nap entirely , momentarily expecting that my guide would make her appearance , and contented myself with gazing listlessly upon the streamlet which rippled over its pebbled bed beneath me . I must have remained for some time in this vacant mood , when my idle musings were interrupted by a new source of interest presenting itself . A slight rustling near at hand disturbed me , and , turning round as I opened my eyes , a female figure , in a drapery of snowy whiteness , appeared to flit before them , and retire behind a tall cascade immediately in front of me . The uncertain light of the place , with the spray of the waterfall , which partially impeded my view of the farther part of the cavern , made me at first doubt the evidence of my senses ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently moving slowly from me , and beckoning the while to follow . The height of the figure struck me immediately as being about the same as that of the buxom daughter of my landlord ; and , though the proportions seemed more slender , I had no doubt , upon recalling her arch expression of countenance while her father was relating to me the wild superstitions of the cavern , that a ready solution of one of its mysteries at least was at hand . Some woman 's whim , I had no doubt , prompted the girl to get up a little diversion at my expense , and sent her thither to put the freak in execution . I had been told that there were a dozen outlets to the cavern , and presumed that I was now to be involved in its labyrinths for the purpose of seeing in what part of the mountain I might subsequently make my exit . He is no true lover of a pair of bright eyes who will mar the jest of a pretty woman . The maiden beckoned , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over which tumbled the waterfall ; but , after slipping once or twice upon wet the ledges of rock , which supplied a treacherous foothold , I at last gained the summit , and stood within a few yards of my whimsical conductor . She had paused upon the farthest side of the chamber into which the cavern here expanded . It was a vast and noble apartment . The lofty ceiling swelled almost into a perfect dome , save where a ragged aperture at the top admitted the noonday sun , whose rays , as they fell through the vines and wild flowers that embowered the orifice , were glinted back from a thousand sparry points and pillars around . The walls , indeed , were completely fretted with stalactites . In some places small , and apparently freshly formed , they hung in fringed rows from the ceiling ; in others they drooped so heavily as to knit the glistening roof to the marble floor beneath it , or rose in slender pyramids from the floor itself until they appeared to sustain the vault above . The motion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this apartment , while the murmur of the falling water was echoed back from the vibrating columns with tones as rich and melodious as those which sweep from an olian harp . Never , methought , had I seen a spot so alluring . And yet , when I surveyed each charm of the grotto , I knew not whether I could be contented in any one part of it . Nothing , indeed , could be more inviting to tranquil enjoyment than the place where I then stood ; but the clustering columns , with their interlacing screen-work of woven spar , allured my eye into a hundred romantic aisles which I longed to explore ; while the pendant wild flowers which luxuriated in the sunshine around the opening above , prompted me to scale the dangerous height , and try what pinnacle of the mountain I might gain by emerging from the cavern through the lofty aperture . These reflections were abruptly terminated by an impatient gesture from my guide , and for the first time I caught a glimpse of her countenance as she glided by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a singular , almost a preternatural , effect upon me ; the features were different from those I had expected to behold . They were not those of the new acquaintance whom I thought I was following ; but the expression they wore was one so familiar to me in bygone years , that I started as if I had seen an apparition . It was the look of one who had been long since dead  --  of one around whose name , when life was new , the whole tissue of my hopes and fears was woven  --  for whom all my aspirations after worldly honours had been breathed  --  in whom all my dreams of earthly happiness had been wound up . She had mingled in purer hours with all the fond and homeloving fancies of boyhood ; she had been the queen of each romantic vision of my youth ; and , amid the worldly cares and selfish struggles of maturer life , the thought of her had lived separate and apart in my bosom , with no companion in its hallowed chamber , save the religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of better things which , once implanted by a mother 's love , survives amid the storms and conflicts of the world  --  a beacon to warn us more often , alas ! how far we have wandered from her teachings , than to guide us to the haven whither they were meant to lead . I had loved her , and I had lost her : how , it matters not . Perchance disease had reft her from me by some sudden blow at the moment when possession made her dearest . Perchance I saw her fade in the arms of another , while I was banned and barred from ministering to a spirit that stole away to the grave with all I prized on earth . It boots not how I lost her ; but he who has centred every thought and feeling in one only object , whose morning hopes have for years gone forth to the same gaol , whose evening reflections have for years come back to the same bourne , whose waking visions and whose midnight dreams have for years been haunted by the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tended to the same end  --  he knows what it is to have the pivot upon which every wheel of his heart hath turned , wrenched from its centre  --  to have the sun , round which revolved every joy that lighted his bosom , plucked from its system . Well , it was her face ; as I live , it was the soulbreathing features of Linda that now beamed before me , fresh as when in dawning womanhood they first caught my youthful fancy  --  resistless as when in their noontide blaze of beauty I poured out my whole adoring soul before them . There was that same appealing look of the large lustrous eyes , the same sunny and soul-melting smile which , playing over a countenance thoughtful even to sadness , touched it with a beauty so radiant that the charm seemed borrowed from heaven itself . I could not but think it strange that such an image should be presented to my view in such a place ; and yet , if I now rightly recollect my emotions , surprise was the least active among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I thought not whether it were reality or mocking semblance , the fantasy of my own brain , or the shadowy creation of some supernatural Power around me . I knew only that it was there ; I knew only that the eyes in whose perilous light my soul had bathed herself to madness , beamed anew before me ; that the lips whose lightest smile had often wrapped me in elysium ; that the brow whose holy light  --  But why should I thus attempt to paint what pencil never yet hath reached ? why essay a portrait whose colours I have nowhere found , save in the heart where they are laid so deeply that death alone can dim them ? Enough that the only human being to whom my spirit ever bowed in inferiority  --  enough that the idol to which it had knelt in adoration , now stood palpably before it . An hour agone , and I would have crossed the threshold of the grave itself to stand one moment in that presence  --  to gaze , if but for an instant , upon those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whence they were conjured up ? Had the Fiend himself stood nigh , I would have pressed nearer , and gazed and followed as I did . The figure beckoned , and I went on . The vaulted pathway was at first smooth and easily followed ; but , after passing through several of the cavernous chambers into which it ever and anon expanded , the route became more and more difficult ; loose masses of rock encumbering the floor , or drooping in pendant crags from the roof , rendered the defiles between them both toilsome and hazardous . The light which fell through the opening behind us soon disappeared entirely , and it gave me a singular sinking of the spirits , as we passed into deeper and deeper gloom , to hear the musical sounds , which I have already noted in the grotto from which we first passed , dying away in the distance , and leaving the place at last in total silence . Long , indeed , after they had ceased to reach my ear with any distinctness , they would seem at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon me at some turn in our devious route . So strangely , too , do the innumerable subtle echoes metamorphose each noise in these caverns , that I continually found myself mistaking the muttered reverberations for the sounds of a human voice . At one moment it seemed in gay tones to be calling me back to the sparry grotto and bright sunshine behind , while the very next it appeared , with sudden and harsh intonation , to warn me against proceeding farther . Anon it would die away with a mournful cadence , a melancholy wailing , like the requiem of one who was beyond the reach of all earthly counsel or assistance . Again and again did I pause in my career , to listen to this wild chanting , while my feelings would for the moment take their hue and complexion from the sources which thus bewildered my senses . I thought of my early dreams of fame and honour , of the singing hopes that lured me on my path , when one fatal image stepped between my soul and all its high endeavour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrepressible in its elasticity , that it seemed proof alike against time and sorrow , now sapped , wasted , and destroyed by the phrensied pursuit of one object . I thought of the home which had so much to embellish and endear it , and which yet , with all its heartcheering joys , had been neglected and left , like the sunlit grotto , to follow a shifting phantom through a heartless world . I thought of the reproachful voices around me , and the ceaseless upbraider in my bosom , which told of time and talents wasted , of opportunities thrown away , of mental energies squandered , of heart , brain , and soul consumed in a devotion deeper and more absorbing than Heaven itself exacts from its votaries . I thought  --  and I looked at the object for which I had lavished them all  --  I thought that my life must have been some hideous dream , some damned vision in which my fated soul was bound by imaginary ties to a being doomed to be its bane upon earth , and shut it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glee as I twisted my bodily frame in the hope that at length I might wake from that long-enduring sleep . I caught a smile from the lips ; I saw a beckon from the hand of the phantom , and I wished still to dream , and to follow for ever . I plunged into the abyss of darkness to which it pointed ; and , reckless of everything I might leave behind , followed wheresoever it might marshal me . A damp and chilling atmosphere now pervaded the place , and the clammy moisture stood thick upon my brow as I groped my way through a labyrinth of winding galleries , which intersected each other so often both obliquely and transversely , that the whole mountain seemed honeycombed . At one moment the steep and broken pathway led up acclivities almost impossible to scale ; at another the black edge of a precipice indicated our hazardous route along the brink of some unfathomed gulf ; while again a savage torrent , roaring through the sinuous vault , left scarcely room enough for a foothold between the base of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept on , and still I followed . Returning , indeed , had the thought occurred to me , was now impossible ; for the pale light which seemed to hang around her person , emanating , as it were , from her white raiment , was all that guided me through these shadowy realms . But not for a moment did I now think of retracing my steps or pausing in that wild pursuit . Onward , and still onward it led , while my spirit , once set upon its purpose , seemed to gather sterner determination from every difficulty it encountered , and to kindle again with that indomitable buoyancy which was once the chief attribute of my nature . At length the chase seemed ended , as we approached one of those abrupt and startling turns common in these caverns , where the passage , suddenly veering to the right or left , leads you , as if by design , to the sheer edge of some gulf that is impassable . My strange companion seemed pausing for a moment upon the brink of the abyss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingled with more than mortal agony ; the object of my wild pursuit seemed at length within my grasp . A single bound , and my outstretched arms would have encircled her person ; a single bound  --  nay , the least movement toward her  --  might only have precipitated the destruction upon whose brink she hovered . Her form seemed to flutter upon the very edge of that horrid precipice , as , gazing like one fascinated over it , she stretched her hand backward toward me . It was like inviting me to perdition . And yet , forgive me , Heaven ! to perish with her was my proudest hope , as I sprang to grasp it . But , oh God ! what held I in that withering clasp ? The ice of death seemed curdling in my veins as I touched those clammy and pulseless fingers . A strange and unhallowed light shot upward from the black abyss ; and the features from which I could not take my eyes away , were changed to those of a DEMON in that hideous glare . And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed with remorseless pressure round my own , and drew me toward the yawning gulf ; it tightened in its grasp , and I hovered still nearer to my horrid doom ; it clenched yet more closely , and the phrensied shriek I gave  --  AWOKE ME . A soft palm was gently pressed against my own ; a pair of laughing blue eyes were bent archly upon me ; and the fair locks which floated over her blooming cheeks revealed the joyous and romping damsel who had promised to act as my guide through the cavern . She had been prevented by some household cares from keeping her appointment until the approach of evening made it too late , and had taken it for granted that I had then returned to my lodgings at the inn . My absence from the breakfast-table in the morning , however , had awakened some concern in the family , and induced her to seek me where we then met . The pressure of her hand in trying to awaken me will partially account for the latter part of my hideous dream ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made upon my mind by the prevalent superstition connected with the cavern ; but no metaphysical ingenuity of which I am master , can explain how one whose daily thoughts flow in so careless , if not gay , a current as mine , could , even in a dream , have conjured up such a train of wild and bitter fancies ; much less how the fearful tissue should have been so interwoven with memories of the dream-love of boyhood as to give new shape and reality to a phantom long  --  long since faded . And I could not but think that , had a vision so strange and vivid swept athwart my brain at an earlier period of life , I should have regarded it as something more than an unmeaning fantasy . That mystical romance , which is the religion of life 's spring-time , would have interpreted my dream as a dark foreboding of the future , prophetic of hopes misplaced , of opportunities misapplied , of a joyless and barren youth , and a manhood whose best endeavour would be only a restless effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If half be true , however , that is told concerning them , still more extravagant sallies of the imagination overtake persons of quite as easy and indolent a disposition as my own , when venturing to pass a night upon the Enchanted Mountains .

Travelling on horseback is generally the most agreeable mode of seeing a country . But it is only in a broken mountain region that one fully enjoys it .

" Still wandering among these mountains , I had passed from the beautiful pastoral region described in the opening of the previous story , to a gloomier district of Eastern Tennessee . After a harsh and lowering day , the evening closed in dull and thick with that stagnant heaviness of the atmosphere which often precedes a storm . There was a moon , but its face was veiled by the leaden clouds ; and its light , dissipated through the murky air , created that kind of " darkness visible " which gives a drearier aspect to the landscape than when it is wholly obscured . The only cabin in sight lay in the midst of a desolate " clearing , " which , though completely walled round by the forest of firs from whose depths I had just issued , bore not a trace of shrubbery to relieve the waste of blackened stumps . A well of primitive construction , with the bucket dangling at the end of a grapevine attached to a long lever pole , crowned a naked knoll where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the bark had never been stripped , was nearly covered with that pale green moss which will often collect upon the dry rails of a fence which have not for years been disturbed ; and this , with the night wind whistling through the parted staves of the decrepit bucket , proved sufficiently that the well , if not dried up entirely , was still no longer used . A low shed , built of logs and roofed with bark , was the only other outward appurtenance of the cabin . The whole picture , it will be acknowledged , was a dreary one . Comfortless , monotonous  --  almost heart-depressing ! A scene of wildness without beauty , of solitude without dignity , a woodland home without one attribute of rural cheerfulness . An abode in the wilderness utterly destitute of forest shelter and security . The spirits of evil , which in some lands are believed to take up their abode in every deserted palace or ruinous castle , methought would straightway migrate hitherward , did they dream of a spot so utterly lonely , and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " for , though the traces of what are called improvements were about me , I could scarcely realize that the hands which had once wrought there might still be busy near . The man who had made such an opening in the forest must , I thought , have been frighted at his own work the moment he ceased from his toil , and became aware how uncouthly he had given shape and form to the spirit of solitude which still sighed among the tall trees around him . I dismounted near the cabin , and scarcely touched the door with the butt of my riding-whip , when it was flung open from within by some one who instantly retired from the threshold . The abruptness of the act did , I confess , startle me . Though not easily alarmed , my mood of mind at the moment was such as to prompt some mystic association with the scenes and circumstances already detailed . I am a perfect barometer of the weather , and the approach of a thunder-gust always weighs down my spirits with undefinable oppression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The low mutterings of the oncoming tempest , which were now beginning to be audible , would , then , be sufficient to account for my present sensibility to gloomy influences ; but I might also mention other things which , perhaps , added to the present anxiety of feeling , if the phrase be not too strong a one . It will suffice , however , to state merely that I had not heard the sound of human speech in the last two days , and that which now met my ears was harsh and discordant . It was the croaking tone which you may sometimes catch from a sour-tempered virago as she strolls from the conventicle . " I thought you 'd a been here afore , " said this ungracious voice ; which , upon entering the apartment , I recognised as belonging to its only occupant . She was a heavy-built woman , of coarse , square features and saturnine complexion . She wore her straight black hair plainly parted over her eyebrows , which were bushy and meeting in the middle . One elvish lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearth , holding a tallow-candle to the ashes , which she was trying to blow into a flame , when my summons interrupted the process . " You thought I would have been hear before ? " I exclaimed at last , in reply to her singular salutation ; " why , my good woman , I have lost my way , and only stumbled upon your house by accident  --  you must take me for somebody else . " " I 'm no good woman . Do n't good woman me , " she replied , with a scrutinizing glance , which had something , I thought , of almost fierceness in it , as , shading the now lighted candle with one hand , she turned scornfully round and fixed her regards upon me . " Yes ! yes , strannger , you are the man , the very man that was to come at this hour . I dreamed ye  --  I dreamed yer hoss  --  yer brown leggins and all , I dreamed ' em  --  and now go look after yer critter while I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as to follow me in my story , will , perhaps , be vexed and impatient when I tell them here that the whole of this singular scene has no immediate bearing upon its denoument . " Why , then , " it may be asked , " do you delay and embarrass the relation with the detail of matters that have no connexion with the incident for which you would claim our interest ? " I did not say they had no connexion with it ! They have an intimate  --  a close connexion . It was these very circumstances which still farther fashioned the mood of mind under which I became an observer , and partially an actor , in the startling , though grotesque , events which followed , and I wish to place the reader in exactly the same position that I was in . I wish to win him , if possible , to perfect sympathy of feeling with me for the hour , and let him exercise his judgment , if he care to , from precisely the same point of mental observation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ( the reader ) or I are again alone in the midst of the wilderness ; in that dreary room ; alone with that weirdlooking woman . The storm is now howling without , but it does not chafe savagely enough to excite the dispirited temper of our feelings , or offer a contrast of any dignity to the gloomy influences within . Supper was already prepared for me when I returned from looking after my horse . The coarse bacon and hoe cakes were placed before me without another word being spoken between my hostess and myself . I drew a rude stool to the table , and was in the act of helping myself from the wooden platter  --  " Stop ! I hear them coming ! " cried the woman . " Hear them ! who ? " said I , turning round sharply as some new , though undefinable , suspicion flashed upon me . " Them as will have to share that supper with ye , strannger  --  if hows ' be ' t they let ye eat any of it . " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for at this instant there was a sharp flash of lightning , the door was dashed suddenly open , and three armed men strode into the apartment , the storm pelting in behind them as they entered , and a terrific thunder-burst following instantly the lightning amid whose glare they crossed the threshold . The palor of their countenances , set off by their long black , dripping locks , seemed measurably to pass away when that livid light was withdrawn ; but from the moment that the door was flung open there was an earthy smell in the room , which , whether coming from the reeking soil without or from the garments of these wild foresters , was most perceptible . Those less familiar than myself with the raw-savoured odours which sometimes travel out with the rich perfume of the woods , would , I am persuaded , have identified it with the grave-damps which our senses will sometimes take cognizance of in old churchyards . The aspect of two of these men was sufficiently formidable , though in point of stature and an appearance of burly strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blackbearded fellows , armed both with hatchet and bowie knife in addition to the short rifles , which they still retained laid across their knees as they settled themselves side by side upon a bench and looked coldly around them . The third was a full-cheeked , heavyfeatured man , of about eight-and-twenty , bearing a strong resemblance to my hostess , both in complexion and countenance , save that his eyebrows , instead of being square and coal-black , like hers , were irregularly arched and of a faded brown . His mouth also lacked the firmness of expression which dwelt around her thin and shrewish lips . This man bore with him no weapon save a huge old German piece , a Tyrolean rifle as it seemed to me from the enormous length of the barrel and the great size of the bore , as well as the outlandish and cumbersome ornaments about the stock and breeching . It was evidently a weapon intended for the great distances at which the chamois hunter claims his quarry , and , though serviceable for a long shot on our western prairies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apalachian Mountains . Inconvenient , however , as the length and size of the piece might make it in some hands , it seemed to be nothing in the grip of the sturdy mountaineer , ( who had probably bought it from some passing emigrant from the old world , ) for I observed even as he entered that he held the gun vertically at arm 's length before him . Still he seemed glad of relieving himself of the weight as soon as possible , for he instantly advanced to the farthest corner of the room , where he placed the piece with some care in an upright position against the wall . " Well ! what for now ? " said the virago ; " why do you stand looking at the gun after you 've sot it down ? you think she 'll walk off of herself , do ye ? " The youth looked gloomily at her  --  took a stool on the opposite side of the hearth to his companions  --  leaned his head doggedly upon his hand , but said nothing . I thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . " What ! Hank Stumpers , haint ye a word to fling to a dog ? " cried the woman , advancing toward him ; " is that the way you treat yer dead father 's wife ? " The young man looked up stupidly at her , gave a glance with something more of intelligence at the gun , but still said nothing . " Yes , yer nateral-born mother , ye chucklehead ye  --  and she a widder . Ca n't ye speak up to her  --  where 's the deer ? the turkeys ? the squirrels ? haint ye got even a squirrel to show for your day 's work ? speak you , John Dawson ; what 's the matter with the boy ? He be n't drunk , be he ? " Page 099 " It 's a matter of five hours , Mother Stumpers , since either of us touched a drop , " replied one of the men briefly , and he , too , gave a furtive glance at the old firelock . " Well  --  well , why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye all distraught ? Jackson Phillips , you  --  you 've felt the back of my hand across yer chaps , afore now , for yer imperance  --  I know ye , man , and that sober possum-look means something ! Do ye think to gum it over me afore this strannger  --  speak up , and that at onst , or it 'll be the worst for some of ye , or my name 's not Melinda Washington Stumpers ! " ( I did not smile , reader , as you do , at Mrs. S. 's sponsorial dignity ; I did not dare to smile . ) " You know we would n't offend you , no how , Mother Stumpers , " deprecatingly replied the man whom she addressed as Phillips . " Hank 's misfor tun , you see , has made us dull-like , as it were , and  --  " " And what in the name of Satan is his misfortun ? " interrupted the mother , now for the first time moved with concern as well as anger . " That 's it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with something of alertness ; " she 's druv the very nail on the head  --  Satan is at the bottom of all of it . " " At the bottom of all of what ? " screamed the virago , and even as she spoke the ancient piece in the corner , untouched by any one  --  without the slightest movement of the lock  --  discharged itself toward the cealing . " At the bottom of the bar'l of my gun  --  he speaks for himself , " replied Hank , moodily , while his mother started back and I sprang to my feet at the sudden report so near me . " Your gun must be foul , " I said , resuming my seat , " very foul , to hang fire so long . I suppose she made a flash in the pan when attempting to discharge her just before entering . " Stumpers looked vacantly at me , shook his head , muttered something about he and his mother being " ruinated , " and then more audibly said , " Strannger , you may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , onst for all , that Satan 's got into that gun ! " And bang ! at that moment again went the gun , as if to prove that his words were sooth . " This is certainly most extraordinary , " I exclaimed , as I rose to examine the gun for myself . " You 'd better not touch her strannger , " cried Phillips . " I tell you she 's got Satan in her , " repeated Hank . I looked at Dawson inquiringly . " Fact ! strannger , every word of it . Hank 's not been able to get that gun off since noon ; but about a hundred rod afore we struck the clearing , she begun firing of her own accord , just as you see  --  " Bang !  --  Bang ! went the gun . " I told you that Satan was in her ! " ejaculated Hank . " That 's the way with her , " said Phillips , in a tone of solemn sadness ; " sometimes she 'll not speak for a matter of ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barks like those ; and sometimes she gives a regular rip-snorter  --  ( Bang ! thundered the gun. ) like that ! " " I told you she 'd got Satan in her ! " still repeated Hank . I confess that it was now only the calmness of those around me which prevented some feeling of superstitious terror being disagreeably awakened in me . The men , however , appeared sad and awe-struck , rather than alarmed ; while the woman  --  a thing not uncommon with resolute minds disposed to believe readily in the supernatural  --  seemed at once to accept the fearful solution of the mystery which had been proffered to her , and ready to meet it with an unflinching spirit . Still , puzzled and bewildered as I was , I could not but smile at the manner in which her emotions now manifested themselves . " Well ! " she cried , impatiently , " and what a poor skimp of a man you must be to let Satan get into the piece when you had her all day in yer own keeping . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her son , with spirit ; " there is n't another fellow in these diggins who 'd ' a brought that gun home as I did , after he diskivered that sich goings on were inside of her , And if she 'd tell her own story  --  " Bang !  --  bang !  --  bang ! pealed the gun , " That 's Satan who speaks now  --  " Bang  --  phizz  --  bang ! " It 's Satan , I say , and no mistake . But if she 'd tell her own story , she 'd own I never let her go out of my hands this blessed day , save when Jackson Phillips tuk Dawson 's piece and mine to watch for deer on the runway while we went down the branch to see if we could n't get a big sucker or two for supper out of the deep hole where I cotched so many fish last fall . No ! if she 'd speak for herself  --  " BANG ! thundered the gun , with a report so tremendous that I involuntarily put my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gim me them ' ere tongs , " shouted Mrs. Stumpers in great wrath ; while Dawson turned pale , and even Phillips seemed a little disturbed as he muttered , " if the old thing should bust , it might be a bad business for us . " Hank , however , doggedly handed his mother the tongs ; and before I could interpose , or , indeed , before I was aware what the courageous woman was about to do , she had grasped the gun with the tongs , near the lock , and , bearing it before her with a strong arm , she moved toward the door . " Why do n't ye open  --  " Bang !  --  phizz !  --  bang !  --  bang !  --  phizz !  --  phizz ! bang ! alternately pealed and sputtered the gun ; but still the intrepid virago went on . I sprang to the door and flung it wide before her . The light from within was reflected upon the hollow buttonwood trunk which formed the curb of the well opposite , and in another instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " said Mrs. Stumpers , clapping the tongs in true housewife fashion as she replaced them in the chimney-corner . " Now one can hear hisself talk without the bother of sich a clatter . " Bang ! moaned the gun at the bottom of the well . " Ca n't stop Satan that way , mammy , " said Hank , his stupid face sicklying over with an unhappy smile . The mystery had now deepened to the highest point of interest ; that last discharge was wholly unaccountable ; and for my own part , my curiosity was wound up to a pitch that was positively painful . I remembered , though , the shattered bucket , and be-thought myself of asking if there were any water in the well . " About enough to come up to a lizard 's ear , " answered Hank ; " but there 's a smart chance of mud under it , I tell ye , strannger . That old gun will keep sinking for a week yet . " " She 's stopped , " said Dawson . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish her out before she sinks beyond our reach . " " Do n't I tell ye Satan 's in the gun , " cried Hank , almost furiously ; " down  --  down  --  she 'll keep going down now till he has her in his own place all to himself . I lost an axe myself in that well onst ; and if half that father used to tell about it be true  --  " Spluch  --  uch  --  uch . Bubble  --  uble  --  bang ! ble  --  Bang !  --  Splu  --  ble  --  bang  --  bang  --  BANG ! ! ! We listened  --  we looked long at each other . With the last report , which was almost overpowering , I was convinced that the explosion must have been aided by inflammable gas at the bottom of the well , for the blue flame , as it rose from it , flashed through the only window of the cabin , and showed the features of its ignorant inmates , for the first time , distorted with real terror . At least Phillips and Dawson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked perfectly aghast with fright . Hank 's supposition of the ultimate destiny of his famous gun ( viz. , going to the sporting dominions of the Great Hunter below ) could hardly be true , however , inasmuch as a piece of the blackened muzzle was found next morning driven half through a fragment of the well-curb which lay shattered around , broken to splinters by the explosion of the fire-damp . The poor young man fairly wept outright when it was shown him by Phillips ; who , with a generosity I could not sufficiently admire at the time , insisted upon replacing the hoary weapon of Hank 's affections with his own light Easton rifle ; saying at the same time that he had a Kentucky tool at home which he much preferred to the Pennsylvania yger . This same Phillips , by the way , very civilly offered after breakfast to put me on my road , which , from the number of Indian trails along the borders of the Cherokee country , I had wholly lost .

But the fust well I fall in with I 'll draw up a bottle of that gas , as you call it , and have some raal fun with the fellers . But look here , " said he , stopping and tearing off some dry fungus from an old stump , " when you want to play a chap sich a trick as made music for us last night , you 've only to put twenty charges in a gun , with sich wad as this atween each of em  --  an ascotch now and then instead of dry-powder will be all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry his gun about for an hour or so , unbeknowing  --  jist as that simple Hank did  --  and choose your own time for dropping a piece of lighted touch-wood into the muzzle . " Upon my word I was not sorry that I was to part company before night with this practical joker ; who , for aught I knew , might seize some tempting opportunity to slip a snake or so into my boots , stuff my saddle with squibs , or play off some little piece of facetiousness like that with which the jocular Captain Goffe , in Scott 's novel of the Pirate , used now and then to indulge his humour ; the said captain having a funny way of discharging his pistol under the mess-table , merely to pepper some one 's shins with a half-ounce ball . THE INN OF WOLFSWALD . Tramp  --  tramp on the oaken floor ! Heard ye the spectre 's hollow tread ? He marches along the corridor , And the wainscot creaks beside thy bed As he tracks his way through the jarring door , Which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's ride between the limestone waters , whose limpid depths deceive one so when fording the frequent streams of Eastern Tennessee , many a changing landscape ' ere , following northwardly the same continuous vales , you reach the hoarser torrents of Western Pennsylvania ; yet the Apalachians , though changing their name to " the Alleghanies , " still preserve much the same features as you trace them through that picturesque region of Virginia whose romantic beauty I have elsewhere delighted to describe.But what cares the reader where next I unlace my saddle-bags for him , or how I get over the intervening ground ? My horse had cast a shoe ; and , stopping about sunset at a blacksmith 's cabin in one of the most savage passes of the Alleghanies , a smutty-faced , leather-aproned fellow was soon engaged in enabling me again to encounter the flinty roads of the mountains , when the operation was interrupted in the manner here related : " Pardon me , sir , " cried a middle-aged traveller , riding up to the smithy , and throwing himself from his horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my nag in his lap , was proceeding to pare off the hoof preparatory to fitting the shoe , which he had hammered into shape and thrown on the black soil beside him . " Pardon me , sir , " repeated the stranger , raising his broad-brimmed beaver from a head remarkable for what the phrenologist would call the uncommon developement of " ideality , " revealed by the short locks which parted over a pair of melancholy gray eyes  --  " matters of moment make it important for me to be a dozen miles hence before night-fall , and you will place me , sir , under singular obligations , by allowing this good fellow to attend to my lame beast instantly . " The confident , and not ungraceful , manner in which the stranger threw himself upon my courtesy , sufficiently marked him as a man of breeding , and I , of course , complied at once with his request by giving the necessary order to the blacksmith . His horse was soon put in travelling trim , and , leaping actively into the saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his course for a moment , he turned in his stirrups to thank me for the slight service I had rendered him , and , giving an address which I have now forgotten , he added that , if ever I should enter  --  ' s valley , I might be sure of a cordial welcome from the proprietor . An hour afterward I was pursuing the same road , and rapidly approaching the end of my day 's journey . The immediate district through which I was travelling had been settled by Germans in the early days of Pennsylvania  --  a scattered community , that had been thrown somewhat in advance of the more slowly-extended settlements . In populousness and fertility it could not be compared with the regions on the eastern side of the mountains ; but the immense stone barns , which , though few and far between , occasionally met the eye , not less than the language spoken around me , indicated that the inhabitants were of the same origin with the ignorant , but industrious , denizens of the lower country . One of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a hill immediately at the back of " The Wolfswald Hotel , " a miserable wooden hovel , where I expected to pass the night ; and , while descending the hill in the rear of the village , I had leisure to observe that it presented a somewhat different appearance from the other agricultural establishments of the kind which I had met with during the day . The massive walls were pierced here and there with narrow windows , which looked like loop-holes , and a clumsy chimney had been fitted up by some unskilful mechanic against one of the gables , with a prodigality of materials which made its jagged top show like some old turret in the growing twilight . The history of this grotesque mansion , as I subsequently learned it , was that of a hundred others scattered over our country , and known generally in the neighbourhood as " Smith 's , " or " Thompson 's Folly . " It had been commenced upon an ambitious scale by a person whose means were inadequate to its completion , and had been sacrificed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquidate the claims of the mechanics employed upon it . After that it had been used as a granary for a while , and subsequently , being rudely completed without any reference to the original plan , it had been occupied a sa hotel for a few years . The ruinous inn had , however , for a long period , been abandoned , and now enjoyed the general reputation in the neighbourhood of being haunted ; for ghosts and goblins are always sure to take a big house off a landlord 's hands when he can get no other tenant . " We have not room pfor mynheer , " said mine host , laying his hand on my bridle as I rode up to the door of a cabaret near this old building ; while three or four wagoners , smoking their pipes upon a bench in front of the house , gave a grunt of confirmation to the ungracious avowal of the boorish landlord . I was too old a stager , however , to be so summarily turned away from an inn at such an hour ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told the landlord to get me some supper , and we would talk about lodging afterward . It matters not how I got through the evening until the hour of bed-time arrived . I had soon ascertained that every bed in the hostelry was really taken up , and that , unless I chose to share his straw with one of the wagoners , who are accustomed to sleep in their lumbering vehicles , there was no resource for me except to occupy the lonely building which had first caught my eye on entering the hamlet . Upon inquiring as to the accommodation it afforded , I learned that , though long deserted by any permanent occupants , it was still occasionally , notwithstanding its evil reputation , resorted to by the passing traveller , and that one or two of the rooms were yet in good repair , and partially furnished . The good woman of the house , however , looked very portentous when I expressed my determination to take up my abode for the night in the haunted ruin , though she tried ineffectually to rouse her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been luxuriating too freely in some old whiskey brought by a return wagon from the Monongahela , to heed the jogging of his spouse , and I was obliged to act as my own gentleman-usher . The night was raw and gusty , as , with my saddle-bags in one hand and a stable-lantern in the other , I sallied from the door of the cabaret , and struggled up the broken hill in its rear , to gain my uninviting place of rest . A rude porch , which seemed to have been long unconscious of a door , admitted me into the building ; and , tracking my way with some difficulty through a long corridor , of which the floor appeared to have been ripped open here and there in order to apply the boards to some other purpose , I came to a steep and narrow stair-case without any balusters . Cautiously ascending , I found myself in a large hall which opened on the hill-side , against which the house was built . It appeared to be lighted by a couple of windows only , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in others by rough boards nailed across in lieu of shutters . It had evidently , however , judging from two or three ruinous pieces of furniture , been inhabited . A heavy door , whose oaken latch and hinges , being incapable of rust , were still in good repair , admitted me into an adjoining chamber . This had evidently been the dormitory of the establishment , where the guests , after the gregarious and most disagreeable fashion of our country , were wont to be huddled together in one large room . The waning moon , whose bright autumnal crescent was just beginning to rise above the hills , shone through a high circular window full into this apartment , and indicated a comfortable-looking truckle-bed at the farther end before the rays of my miserable lantern had shot beyond the threshold . Upon approaching the pallet I observed some indications of that end of the apartment being still occasionally occupied . The heavy beams which traversed the ceiling appeared to have been recently whitewashed . There was a small piece of carpet on the floor beside the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burly body was precariously supported upon three legs , were holding an innocent tte -- tte in the corner adjacent . " I 've had a rougher roosting-place than this , " thought I , as I placed my lantern upon the table , and , depositing my saddle-bags beneath it , began to prepare myself for rest . My light having now burned low , I was compelled to expedite the operation of undressing , which prevented me from examining the rest of the apartment ; and , indeed , although I had , when first welcoming with some pleasure the idea of sleeping in a haunted house , determined fully to explore it for my own satisfaction before retiring for the night , yet fatigue or caprice made me now readily abandon the intention just when my means for carrying it into execution were being withdrawn ; for the candle expired while I was opening the door of the lantern to throw its light more fully upon a mass of drapery which seemed to be suspended across the farther end of the chamber . The total darkness that momentarily ensued blinded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments the shadows became more distinct , and gradually , by the light of the moon , I was able to make out that the object opposite me was only a large , old-fashioned bedstead , prodigally hung with tattered curtains . I gave no farther thought to the subject , but , turning over , composed myself to rest . Sleep , however , whom Shakspeare alone has had the sense to personify as a woman , was coy in coming to my couch . The old mansion wheezed and groaned like a broken-winded buffalo hard pressed by the hunter . The wind , which had been high , became soon more boisterous than ever , and the clouds hurried so rapidly over the face of the moon that her beams were as broken as the crevices of the ruined building through which they fell . A sudden gust would every now and then sweep through the long corridor below , and make the rickety stair-case crack as if it yielded to the feet of some portly passenger . Again the blast would die away in a sullen moan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would swell in monotonous surges , which came booming upon the ear like the roar of a distant ocean . I am not easily discomposed ; and perhaps none of these uncouth sounds would have given annoyance , if the clanging of a window-shutter had not been added to the general chorus , and effectually kept me from sleeping . My nerves were at last becoming sensibly affected by its ceaseless din , and , wishing to cut short the fit of restlessness which I found growing upon me , I determined to rise , and descend the stairs at the risk of my neck , to try and secure the shutter so as to put an end to the nuisance . But now , as I rose from my bed for this purpose , I found myself subjected to a new source of annoyance . The mocking wind , which had appeared to me more than once to syllable human sounds , came at length upon my ear distinctly charged with tones which could not be mistaken . It was the hard-suppressed breathing of a man . I listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of one labouring under suffocation . I listened still , and it came anew , stronger and more fully upon my ear . It was like the thick suspirations of an apoplectic . Whence it proceeded I knew not ; but that it was near me I was certain . A suspicion of robbery  --  possibly assassination  --  flashed upon me ; but was instantly discarded as foreign to the character of the people among whom I was travelling . The moonlight now fell full upon the curtained bed opposite to me , and I saw the tattered drapery move , as if the frame upon which it was suspended were agitated . I watched , I confess , with some peculiar feelings of interest . I was not alarmed , but an unaccountable anxiety crept over me . At length the curtain parted , and a naked human leg was protruded through its folds ; the foot came with a numb , dead-like sound to the floor ; resting there , it seemed to me at least half a minute before the body to which it belonged was disclosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unearthly-looking figure emerged from the couch , and stood with its dark lineaments clearly drawn against the dingy curtain beside it . It appeared to be balancing itself for a moment , and then began to move along from the bed . But there was something horribly unnatural in its motions . Its feet came to the floor with a dull , heavy sound , as if there were no vitality in them . Its arms hung apparently paralyzed by its side , and the only nerve or rigidity in its frame appeared about its head : the hair , which was thin and scattered , stood out in rigid tufts from its brow , the eyes were dilated and fixed with expression of ghastly horror , and the petrified lips moved not as the hideous moaning which came from the bottom of its chest escaped them . It began to move across the floor in the direction of my bed , its knees at every step being drawn up with a sudden jerk nearly to its body , and its feet coming to the ground as if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the elasticity of living members . It approached my bed ; and mingled horror and curiosity kept me still . It came and stood beside it , and , child-like , I still clung to my couch , moving only to the farther side . Slowly , and with the same unnatural foot-falls , it pursued me thither , and again I changed my position . It placed itself then at the foot of my bedstead , and , moved by its piteous groans , I tried to look calmly at it ; I endeavoured to rally my thoughts , to reason with myself , and even to speculate upon the nature of the object before me . One idea that went through my brain was too extravagant not to remember . I thought , among other things , that the phantom was a corpse , animated for the moment by some galvanic process in order to terrify me . Then , as I recollected that there was no one in the village to carry such a trick into effect  --  supposing even the experiment possible  --  I rejected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be produced from an inanimate being ? And yet it seemed as if everything about it were dead , except the mere capability of moving its feet and uttering those unearthly expressions of suffering . The spectre , however , if so it may be called , gave me but little opportunity for reflection . Its ghastly limbs were raised anew with the same automaton movement ; and , placing one of its feet upon the bottom of my bed , while its glassy eyes were fixed steadfastly upon me , it began stalking toward my pillow . I confess that I was now in an agony of terror . I leaped from the couch and fled the apartment . The keen-sightedness of fear enabled me to discover an open closet upon the other side of the hall . Springing through the threshold , I closed the door quickly after me . It had neither lock nor bolt ; but the closet was so narrow that , by placing my feet upon the opposite wall , I could brace my back against the door so as to hold it against any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sweat of mortal fear started thick upon my forehead as I heard the supernatural tread of that strange visitant approaching the spot . It seemed an age before his measured steps brought him to the door . He struck ; the blow was sullen and hollow , as if dealt by the hand of a corpse ; it was like the dull sound of his own feet upon the floor . He struck the door again , and the blow was more feeble and the sound duller than before . Surely , I thought , the hand of no living man could produce such a sound . I know not whether it struck again , for now its thick breathing became so loud that even the moanings which were mingled with every suspiration , became inaudible . At last they subsided entirely , becoming at first gradually weaker , and then audible only in harsh , sudden sobs , whose duration I could not estimate , from their mingling with the blast which still swept the hill-side . The long , long night had at last an end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the sun was up , and that I might venture from my retreat . But if it were still with a slight feeling of trepidation that I opened the door of the closet , what was my horror when a human body fell inward upon me , even as I unclosed it . The weakness , however , left me the moment I had sprung from that hideous embrace . I stood for an instant in the fresh air and reviving light of the hall , and then proceeded to move the body to a place where I could examine its features more favourably . Great heaven ! what was my horror upon discovering that they were those of the interesting stranger whom I had met on the road the evening before . The rest of my story is soon told . The household of the inn were rapidly collected , and half the inhabitants of the hamlet identified the body as that of a gentleman well known in the county . But even after the coroner 's inquest was summoned , no light was thrown upon his fate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His own testimony would have gone for little ; but he produced a document which in a few words told the whole story . It was a note left with him the evening before by Mr.  --  , to be handed to me as soon as I should arrive at the inn . In it the stranger briefly thanked me for the slight courtesy rendered him at the blacksmith 's , and mentioning that , notwithstanding all percaution , his horse had fallen dead lame , and he should be obliged to pass the night at Wolfswald , he would still farther trespass on my kindness , by begging to occupy the same apartment with me . It stated that , owing to some organic affection of his system , he had long been subject to a species of somnambulism , resembling the most grievous fits of nightmare , during which , however , he still preserved sufficient powers of volition to move to the bed of his servant , who , being used to his attacks , would of course take the necessary means to alleviate them . The note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferring his request to be my room-mate , inasmuch as , owing to the crowded state of the house , I was sure of not having a chamber to myself in any event . The reason why the ill-fated gentleman had been so urgent to press homeward was now but too apparent ; and my indignation at the drunken innkeeper , in neglecting to hand me his note , knew no bounds . Alas ! in the years that have since gone by , there has been more than one moment when the reproaches which I then lavished upon him have come home to myself ; for the piteously appealing look of the dying man long haunted me , and I sometimes still hear his moan in the autumnal blast that wails around my casement . END OF SCENES AMONG THE ALLEGHANIES . Footnotes See " A Winter in the West , " vol. ii . QUEEN MEG . A sketch near home . An American , Washington Irving tells us , need not cross the Atlantic to see Nature in her beauty and grandeur ; and we Manhattanese ( by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our brick and mortar homes to behold her under her most wild and picturesque aspect . It was thus at least I thought as one summer 's morning , a year or two since , I surveyed a scene in one of the river counties a few hours ' sail from New York . It was an extensive morass , grown up with thickets of alder and other amphibious shrubs , and marked by some peculiarities equally desolate and singular . I viewed it , indeed , from a hill-side of fine pasture land , but on my left there was only an unreclaimed moor , and a tall , heavy forest bounded it upon the right ; while immediately before me a rocky knoll rose from the midst of the swamp , with a single pine tree crowning its summit . An Indian lodge , built of loose stones , and roofed with withered brush , was illy sheltered by its high branches ; and a tall Indian woman , a last surviver of the old tribes of the Hudson , stood beside the lonely tree , so emblematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture , which wanted but the hues of autumn to make it one of the most peculiar and characteristic that ever I beheld . My guide from the highway to this lonely spot was an English ditcher , a hardy , active little fellow , who had recently been set to work by the proprietor to reclaim the swamp , and beneath whose labours and those of a grizzly headed negro , who acts as his aid-de-camp in drawing lines of circumvallation around the Indian fastness , the morass before another season will probably be converted into a green meadow , and its present tenant be compelled to seek some new retreat . The little Englishman was very communicative as he piloted me through field and wood to the scene of his improvements , which he informed me the Indian woman regarded with a jealous eye . She belonged , he told me , to a tribe that had once owned all the region hereabouts , and , when they sold their land to the ancient Dutch family , who were the earliest white proprietors in this part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until their last descendant was no more . " Queen Meg , " as he called her , was the only full-blood remaining , but she had a brood of half-breeds around her , who had long lived from hand to mouth in this place ; and with all his profesional zeal for reclaiming an unprofitable waste , the worthy ditcher had some very grave doubts about the propriety of driving these poor wretches out of their last fastness . As I knew that some of the old families on the south side of Long Island hold their extensive possessions by some such tenure , and that , till within a very few years , there were some of the aborigines remaining , with whom they religiously observed it , I gave all credence at the time to the peasant 's account ; though I subsequently ascertained that there was not the least foundation for his story : the present incumbents having wandered hither from another part of the country , and squatted upon this tract , much to the annoyance of the neighbourhood , whose poultry-yards and corn-cribs they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession of the spot , however , several years before the English peasant had emigrated , and his story was probably made up , almost unconsciously , of his own game-law reminiscences and the idle talk of the country people around . In the meantime we had entered upon the morass , and , coming out from a thicket , found ourselves within two hundred yards of the cabin , for which I was about to make in a direct course . " Lord , sir , " exclaimed my guide , " you 'd be up to your neck in the moss in a moment , if you attempt to go that way ! You 've got a good distance to go yet before you reach that knoll , if you really wish to take a nearer look at the old woman . " He then added that there were two ways of approaching a bridge which communicated with a winding path leading ultimately to the retreat . One , the longest , led around through the pasture , from which I have already said there was such a picturesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shorter , " was only over a bit of bog , and gave you no stone walls to climb . " The bog he thought no obstacle , but the stone walls , which on my return I leaped with ease , he considered worthy of going through a mile of mud to avoid . I do n't think that I ever did a more simple thing than take the opinion of a ditcher as to the most feasible path with such a choice . But I did take it , and , jumping from one tuft of rushes to another , but missing my foothold half the time , I plunged now in mud up to my knees , and then slipped in swamp water that spattered me from head to foot ; while splash and tramp my amphibious conductor went on , as coolly and unconcernedly as if treading on a turnpike . I would as soon have followed a Jack-o ' - lantern . At last we came to the bridge he had spoken of . It was a single stick of timber laid over a brook which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path which led to the left , my conductor entered upon one which ran in an opposite direction , and , bidding me good-morning , disappeared in the forest . My route continued to wind through close thickets over the marsh . It was strewn here and there , however , with furze and dead branches , which prevent one from sinking into the oozy soil , and soon led to the knoll which formed the centre of the labyrinth . Before reaching it , I was overtaken by the gentleman to whom the property belonged , and with whom I had parted a half an hour before on the highway . The inmates of the hovel were all gathered around the door as we approached , and some of them , at sight of my friend , seemed to slink away like guilty things . Certain reminiscences of devastated timber and peeled saplings in the adjacent forest were probably at the moment operative with them . A more wretched-looking set of objects I never saw . Three generations were represented among them . The youngest , most numerous and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops of Indian blood in their veins . The second were negro and Indian half-bloods ; one of whom only wore a knife in his belt , and stepped so lightly over the sod that his forest descent was not to be mistaken . But the old crone , who was the progenitress of the gang , was as fine a looking specimen of her race as I have seen at her years . She was at least six inches taller than any of her degenerate descendants ; and her features had that haughty hawk-like cast which is recognisable in all the portraits of the extinct aborigines of New York , and which I have but seldom seen among the more mercurial tribes of the west . The forehead was lofty and massive , though somewhat retreating ; the nose strongly aquiline , but broad at its base , with the open nostril so characteristic of the Indian ; the mouth rather large , and the chin full , but neither of them giving that square and wolf-like expression to the lower features which characterizes the Winnebagos and other tribes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat in awe of my companion , received us very graciously ; but when we followed her into the cabin , she resumed her employment of basket-weaving , which our approach had interrupted , as assiduously as if it were her only means of support . Upon entering into conversation with her , I found that she knew nothing of the tribe to which she originally belonged , much less could she speak its language . She had been adopted into some white family in her infancy , when her father 's people moved off to the west . Upon the death of her protectress , she had married an Indian belonging to a band that had refused to join the emigrating tribes . He dwelt some twenty miles from this place , on the opposite side of the Hudson , in " the Forest of Deane , " ( a name which carried my memory away to the bright Ohio , and the graves of two hunters who once followed the chase in this district. 16 ) He , too , with all his associates of the same race , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the last of the full-bloods in this region of country , after maintaining herself for many years by making baskets , took another husband  --  a mulatto  --  to cheer her solitude . With him she had roved the country after a sort of gipsy fashion for many years , and when he too died and left her , she came with her grandchildren to this secluded spot , where , for some ten years past , the fences of the adjacent fields , and possibly the orchards and hen-roosts of the neighbouring farmers , had suffered not a little for their vicinage . My friend , who both felt it his duty to abate such a nuisance to the neighbourhood , and was , besides , unfeignedly desirous of bettering the condition of the poor wretches , made a proffer of immediate and permanent employment for her children . But , half-naked and poverty-stricken as was each member of the squalid crew , except the old crone herself , she replied with haughty impatience to the least suggestion of the lusty and lazy members of her family going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with true savage ferocity when it was hinted that their devastations among the young timber must be put a stop to . Her pride and prejudices of blood appeared to be as strong as if she still belonged to some wild tribe of the wilderness , and both were brought into play when her confused ideas of what she deemed her natural rights were trenched upon . I diverted her feelings , by telling her something of the condition of her people in more remote parts of the country , about which she seemed almost painfully curious ; and then , taking up a basket which she had just finished , I slipped a dollar into her hand , and , thridding the swamp once more , resumed the public road . The scene thus described was in Dutchess county , in the midst of a long-settled and highly-cultivated district ; and , neglected as the tract had been for years , the hand of improvement had at last seized it within its plastic gripe . The summer tourist who looks for it , in another season will probably find smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain amid the ploughman 's furrows for the Indian trail of this miserable remnant of the aboriginal race . The allusion to the Forest of Deane , a scene equally wild , and still nearer to our commercial metropolis , will be best understood from the details of the following story : Footnotes See " A Winter in the West , " vol. i. , letter . THE TWIN-DOOMED . " Twin-born they live , twin-born they die ; in grief and joy twin-hearted ; Like buds upon one parent bough , twin-doom 'd , in death not parted . " The superstition imbodied in the above distich is very common in those parts of New York and New Jersey which were originally settled by a Dutch population . It had its influence with Dominie Dewitt from the moment that his good woman presented him with the twin-brothers whose fortunes are the subject of our story . He regarded them from the first as children of fate  --  as boons that were but lent to their parents , to be reclaimed so soon that it was a waste of feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow parental affection to devolve in its full strength upon them . They were waifs , he thought , upon the waters of life , which it hardly concerned his heart to claim . The death of the mother , which soon followed the birth of the twins , confirmed this superstitious feeling , and their forms were henceforth ever associated with images of gloom in the breast of their only surviving parent . Old Dewitt , however , though a selfish and contracted man , was not wanting in the ideas of duty which became his station as a Christian pastor . He imparted all the slender advantages of education which were shared by his other children , to the two youngest ; and , though they had not an equal interest in his affections with the rest , he still left them unvisited by any harshness whatsoever . The indifference of their father was , in fact , all of which the twins had to complain . The consequence was natural ; the boys , being left so much to themselves , became all in all to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At school , or in any quarrel or scene of boyish faction , the two Dewitt 's were always named as one individual ; and as they shot up toward manhood , they were equally inseparable . If Ernest went out to drive a deer , Rupert always must accompany him to shoot partridges by the way ; and if Rupert borrowed his brother 's rifle for the larger game , Ernest in turn would shoulder the smooth-bore of the other , to bring home some birds at the same time . Together , though , they always went . The " Forest of Deane , " which has kept its name and dimensions almost until the moment when I write , was the scene of their early sports . The wild deer at that time still frequented the Highlands of the Hudson ; and the rocky passes which led down from this romantic forest to the river , were often scoured by these active youths in pursuit of a hunted buck which would here take the water . Many a time , then , have the cliffs of Dunderberg echoed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dyed the waves which wash its base . Their names as dead shots and keen hunters were well known in the country below ; and there are those yet living in the opposite village of Peekskill who have feasted upon bear 's meat which the twin-huntsmen carried thither from the Forest of Deane . Our story , however , has but little to do with the early career of the Rockland hunters , and I have merely glanced at the years of their life which were passed in that romantic region of a state whose scenic beauties are , perhaps , unmatched in variety by any district of the same size , in order to show how the dispositions of the twins were fused and moulded together in early life . It was on the banks of the Ohio ( Oh-ey-o , or Beautiful River , as it is called in the mellifluous dialect of the Senecas ) that the two foresters of Deane first began to play a part in the world 's drama . As the larger game became scarce on the Hudson , they had migrated to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their boldness and address in tracing the Indian marauder to his lair , as they were previously noted for their skill in striking a less dangerous quarry . The courage and enterprise of the two brothers made them great favourites in the community of hunters , of which they were now members . A frontier settler always depends more upon his rifle than on his farm for subsistence during the infancy of his " improvements ; " and this habit of taking so often to the woods , brings him continually into collision with the Indians . It has ever , indeed , been the main source of all our border difficulties . The two Dewitts had their full share of these wild adventures . They were both distinguished for their fears of daring ; but upon one occasion Rupert , in particular , gave such signal proofs of conduct and bravery , that upon the fall of the chief man in the settlement , in a skirmish wherein young Dewitt amply revenged his death , Rupert was unanimously elected captain of the station , and all the cabins within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnessed the preferment of his brother with emotions of pride as lively as if it had been conferred upon himself ; and so much did the twins seem actuated by one soul , that in all measures that were taken by the band of pioneers , they insensibly followed the lead of either brother . The superstition which had given a fated character to their lives at home , followed , in a certain degree , even here ; and their characters were supposed to be so thoroughly identified , their fortunes so completely bound up in each other , that , feeling no harm could overtake the one which was not shared by the other , their followers had equal confidence in both , and volunteered , with the same alacrity , upon any border expedition , when either of the brothers chanced to lead . It was about this time that General Wayne , who had been sent by Government to crush the allied forces of the north-western Indians , established his camp upon the Ohio , with the intention of passing the winter in disciplining his raw levies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was afterward so brilliantly decided near the Miami of the Lakes . The mail route from Pittsburg to Beaver now passes the field where these troops were marshalled , and the traveller may still see the rude fire-places of the soldiery blackening the rich pastures through which he rides . He may see , too  --  but I must not anticipate the character of my story , whose truth is indicated by more than one silent memento . The western militia , large bodies of which had been drafted into Wayne 's army , were never remarkable for miltary subordination ; of which , not to mention the Black Hawk war of 1832 , the more notable campaigns with the British afforded many an instance . They are a gallant set of men , but they have an invincible propensity each man to " fight on his own hook ; " and not merely that , but , when not employed upon immediate active service , it is almost impossible to keep them together . They become disgusted with the monotony of military duties ; revolt at their exacting precision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be had , are eager to disperse upon the least intermission of active service , and come and go as individual caprice may lead them . General Wayne 's camp , indeed , was for a while a complete caravanserai , where not merely one or two , but whole troops of volunteers could be seen arriving and departing at any hour . This , to the spirit of an old soldier , who had been bred in the armies of Washington , was unendurable . But as these flitting gentry constituted the sharp-shooters , upon whom he chiefly depended , the veteran officer bore with them as long as possible , in the hope that , by humouring the volunteers , he might best attach them to the service for which this species of force was all-important . At length , however , matters reached such a pass that the army was in danger of complete disorganization , and a new system must necessarily be adopted . " Mad Anthony , " as Wayne 's men called him , ( who , when he really took a thing in hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law in its most rigid form , and proclaimed that every man on his muster-roll , of whatsoever rank , who should pass beyond the lines without a special permit from himself , should be tried as a deserter , and suffer accordingly , The threatened severity seemed only to multiply the desertions ; but so keen were the backwoods militiamen in making their escape from what they now considered an outrageous tyranny , that , with all the vigilance of the regular officers , it was impossible to seize any , to make a military example of them . Fresh volunteers , however , occasionally supplied the place of those who thus absented themselves without leave ; and one morning in particular , a great sensation was created throughout the camp by the arrival of a new body of levies , which , though numerically small , struck every one as the finest company that had yet been mustered beneath the standard of Wayne . The troop consisted of mounted riflemen , thoroughly armed and equipped after the border fashion , and clad in the belted hunting-frock , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men seemed picked for special service , and their make and movement exhibited that union of strength and agility which , alike in man and beast , constitutes the perfection of that amphibious force  --  the dragoon ; whose original character , perhaps , is only represented in modern armies by the mounted rangers of our western prairies . The commandant of this corps seemed worthy to be the leader of so gallant a band . His martial figure , the horse he rode , and all his personal equipments , were in every respect complete , and suited to each other . The eagle feather in his wolf-skin cap told of a keen eye and a long shot ; the quilled pouch , torn with the wampum belt , which sustained his hatchet and pistols , from the body of some swarthy foeman , spoke of the daring spirit and iron arm ; while the panther-skin , which formed the housings of his sable roan , betrayed that the rider had vanquished a foe more terrible than the red savage himself . His horse , a cross of the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if proud of so gallant a master ; and as the fringed leggin pressed his flank , while the young officer faced the general in passing in salute before him , he executed his passages with all the graceful precision of a charger trained in the mange . A murmur of admiration ran along the ranks as this gallant cavalier paced slowly in front of the soldiery , and reined up his champing steed before the line of his tall followers as they were at length marshalled upon the parade . But the sensation which his air and figure excited was almost equally shared by another individual , who had hitherto ridden beside him in the van , but who now drew up his rough Indian pony apart from the rest , as if claiming no share in the lot of the new comers . It was a sunburnt youth , whose handsome features afforded so exact a counterpart of those of the leader of the band , that , were it not for the difference of their equipments , either of the two might at first be taken for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark locks and more thoughtful countenance of Ernest would alone have been distinguished from the brown curls and animated features of his sanguine and high-spirited brother . The former , as we have mentioned , had drawn off from the corps the moment it halted and formed for inspection . He now stood leaning upon his rifle , his plain leather hunting-shirt contrasting not less with the gay-coloured frocks of his companions than did the shaggy coat of his stunted pony with the sleek hides of their clean-limb coursers . His look , too , was widely different from the blithe and buoyant one which lighted their features ; and his eye and lip betrayed a mingled expression of sorrow and scorn as he glanced from the lithe and noble figure of his brother to the buckram regulars , whose platoons were marshalled near . The new levies were duly mustered ; and , after the rules and articles of war had been read aloud to them , several camp regulations were promulgated ; and among the rest the recent order of the commander-in-chief , whereby a breach of discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the penalty of desertion . " No , by heaven ! " shouted Ernest , when this was read ; " Rupert , Rupert , my brother , you shall never bear such slavery ! Away  --  away from this roofless prison , and if your life is what they want , let them have it in the woods  --  in your own way . But bind not yourself to these written laws , that bear chains and death in every letter . Away , Rupert , away from this accursed thraldom ! " And , leaping into his saddle before half these words were uttered , he seized the bridle rein of his brother and nearly urged him from the spot while pouring out his passionate appeal . " By the soul of Washington ! " roared old Wayne , " what mad youngster is this ? Nay , seize him not , " added he , good-humouredly , seeing that Rupert did not yield to his brother 's violence , and that the other checked himself and withdrew abashed from the parade , as a coarse laugh , excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul of Washington , " cried the general , repeating his favourite oath , " but ye 're a fine brace of fellows ; and Uncle Sam has so much need of both of you , that he has no idea of letting more than one go . " And , calling Rupert to his side , he spoke with a kindness to the young officer that was probably meant to secure a new recruit in his brother ; who had , however , disappeared from the scene . The parade was now dismissed , and , so soon as Rupert had taken possession of his quarters , and seen that his men and horses were all properly taken care of , he parted from his comrades to take a farewell of Ernest , who awaited him in a clump of trees upon the bank of the river , a short distance from the camp . Ernest seemed to have fully recovered his equanimity ; but though , youth-like , ashamed of the fit of heroics which had placed his brother in a somewhat ridiculous position a few hours before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertained from the first about Rupert 's taking service under General Wayne . " You will not start homeward to-night ? " cried Rupert , at length changing a subject it was useless to discuss . " Yes , to-night I must be off , and that soon , too , Rupert . Little Needji must pace his thirty miles before midnight . I do n't know that I have done wisely in coming so far with you ; but , in truth , I wanted to see how our hunters would look among the continentals Mad Anthony has brought with him . " " Wait till we come to the fighting , Ernest , and the old general will soon find out who 's who . His regulars may do in civilized war , but a man must live in the woods to know how to fight in them . " " Ay , ay , that 's it ; a hound may do for a deer that is n't worth a powder-horn stopper upon a panther track . But you must remember , " continued his brother , fixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to fight just in the way that the general tells you  --  which means , I take it , that real manhood must go for nothing . Why , there 's not a drummer in the ranks that will not know his duty better than you ; ay , and for aught I see , be able to do it , too , as well . " A flush of pride  --  perhaps of pain  --  crossed the countenance of the young officer as his brother thus spoke ; and , laying his hand upon his arm , added , with the indignant tone of a caged hunter , " Why , Rupert , you must not dare even , soldier that you now are , to take the bush , and keep your hand in by killing a buck occasionally . " " Believe it not , Ernest , My men will never stand that for all the Mad Anthonys or mad devils in the universe . " " You must , you must , my brother , " answered Ernest , shaking his head ; " and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this service . I am quieter than you , and , therefore , saw farther into matters than you did , when you chose to come hither rather than give up the command of your company . But where 's the use of looking back upon a cold trail ? You are now one of Uncle Sam 's men , and Heaven knows when he will let go his grip upon you . " Conversing thus , the brothers had walked some distance . The moon was shining brightly above them , and a silver coil of light trailing along the rippling Ohio seemed to lure them onward with the river 's course . At length , however , the more considerate Ernest deemed it prudent that they should part ; and , catching the pony , which had followed them like a dog , he mounted and prepared to move off . But Rupert would not yet leave his brother and retrace his steps to camp . It might be long before they should meet again  --  they who had never before thus parted  --  who had been always inseparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were now about , for the first time , to be severed when stout hearts and strong hands might best be mutually serviceable . " I do n't think I will leave you just yet , Ernest , I may as well walk with you as far as the branch ; and we are hardly without shot of the soldier who is standing sentry yonder . What a mark the fellow 's cap would be from that clump of pawpaws ! " " Yes , " said Ernest , lifting his rifle from his lap as the musket gleamed in the moonlight . " I am almost tempted to pick that shining smooth-bore out of his fingers , just to show how ridiculous it is to carry such shooting-irons as that in the woods . But come , the time has gone by for such jokes ; if you will go farther with me , let us push on . " They reached the " branch , " or brook , and crossed it ; and still they continued increasing the distance between themselves and the camp . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed Rupert at last , seizing the hand of his brother . " But here , Ernest ; I wish you would carry home my Indian belt and these other fixins ; they will remind you of old times if I 'm kept away long , and the sutler will give me something to wear more in camp fashion . " As he spoke thus he tied the wampum sash around the waist of his brother , and , while throwing the Indian pouch over his shoulder , their arms met in the fold of brotherhood , and the twins parted with that silent embrace . Rupert , rapidly retracing his steps toward the camp , soon reached the brook , and a half hour 's walk might yet have enabled him to regain his quarters in safety ; but the finger of Fate was upon him , and he , who had already been led away from duty by the strong lure of affection , was still farther induced to violate it by an instinct not less impulsive in the bosom of a borderer . Pausing to drink at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that he discovered a fresh moccasin-print , and , bending down the branches which embowered the spot , so as to bring the rays of the moon full upon it , a more thorough examination fully satisfied him that an Indian had lately passed that way . A regular soldier , upon thus discovering traces of a spy in the neighbourhood of the camp , would at once have reported it to the officer of the day , and allowed his superior to take measures accordingly . But such an idea never occurred to the backwood ranger . He had discovered an Indian trail , and there were but two things , in his opinion , to be done : first to find out its direction , and then to follow it to the death . A sleuth-hound upon the scent of blood could not be impelled by a more irresistible instinct than that which urged the fiery Rupert on that fatal chase . It boots not to tell the various chances of his hunt ; how here he missed the trail upon rocky ground , where the moccasin had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel for it in some tangled copse , where no betraying moonbeam fell ; and how at last , when the stars grew dim , and the gray dawn had warmed into ruddy day , he for the first time rested his wearied limbs upon the banks of a stream , where the trail disappeared entirely . Let us now follow the fortunes of the doomed Ernest , who , like the hero of classic story , bore about his person the fatal gifts that were to work his destruction . Not a half hour elapsed from the time that he parted from his brother , before he found himself the prisoner of a sergeant 's guard , which had been despatched to " take or slay the deserter , Rupert Dewitt . " Apprehending no ill , Ernest allowed himself to be seized ; the equipments he had just received from Rupert , not less than the similitude of likeness to his twin-brother , in the opinion of the party that captured him , fully established his identity ; and the horror which he felt at discovering how Rupert had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of joy , as it suggested itself to the high-souled Ernest that he might so far keep up the counterfeit as to become a sacrifice in place of the brother on whom he doted . The comrades of Rupert , who might have detected the imposition , chanced to be off on fatigue parties in different directions ; and this , together with the summary mode of proceeding that was adopted upon his reaching camp , favoured his design . A drum-head court martial was instantly called to decide upon the fate of a prisoner to whose guilt there seemed to be , alas ! too many witnesses . The road that he had taken , the distance from camp , the time of night he had chosen to wander so far from the lines  --  nay , the fact of his leaving his blood-horse at the stable , as if fearing detection through him , and stealing off upon an Indian pony  --  all seemed to make out a flagrant case of desertion . But why dwell upon these painful details of an affair which was so amply canvassed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward ? Let the reader be content with the bare historical fact , that the ill-starred militiaman was condemned to be shot to death as a deserter , under the circumstances as I have stated them . It seemed a terrible proceeding when these attending circumstances were afterward reviewed ; but , though at the time General Wayne was much censured for signing that young man 's death-warrant , yet both military men and civilians , who knew the condition of his army , have agreed that it was this one example alone which prevented that army from falling to pieces . The heart of Ernest was so thoroughly made up to meet the fate which was intended for his brother , that his pulses did not change in a single throb when he was told that he had but an hour to prepare himself for death . " The sooner that it be over , the better for Rupert , " exclaimed he , mentally . And then , man as he was , his eyes filled with tears when he thought of the anguish which that darling brother would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , God ! " he cried , aloud , clasping his hands above his head as he paced the narrow guard-room in which he was now immured  --  " God of Heaven ! that they would but place us together with our rifles in the forest , and send this whole army to hunt us down . " And the features of the wild bush-fighter lighted up with a grim smile as he thought of keeping a battalion at bay in the greenwood , and crippling it with his single arm . The proud thought seemed to bear with it a new train of views . " If Rupert knew , " said he , pausing in his walk  --  " if he but dreamed how matters were going , he would soon collect a score of rifles to strike with , and take me from beneath their very bayonets . But this is madness  --  " " Ay ! that it is , my fine fellow , " answered the sentinel who guarded his door , and who now , hearing the last words uttered while the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prisoner were heard upon the stair , thought it incumbent upon him to remind the youth where he was . Ernest compressed his lip , and , drawing himself to his full height as he wheeled and faced his escort , motioned to them to lead on . He was at once conducted to the esplanade in front of the camp , upon the river 's bluff . The morning was gusty and drizzling , as if nature shuddered in tears at the sacrifice of one who , from his infancy , had worshipped her so faithfully . The young hunter scarcely cast a glance at the military array as he stepped forward to take the fatal position from which he was never to move more . Pride alone seemed to prompt the haughty mien and averted , but unblenching , eye , that were , in fact , governed by a nobler impulse  --  the fear of a personal recognition by some of the soldiery before his substitution as a victim to martial law was completed ; but of the many in his brother 's band who had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or caught up his charging cheer in the Indian onslaught , there was now not one to look upon the dying youth . Considerations of feeling , or the fear , perhaps , of exciting a mutinous spirit among those hot-headed levies , had induced the general to keep the comrades of the twin-brothers at a distance from the fatal scene . As already stated , they had originally been detailed upon some fatigue duty , which took them to a distance from the camp , and measures had been since adopted to prolong their absence until the catastrophe was over . Once , and once only , did Ernest trust himself to run his eye along the formal files of stranger faces ; and then , while the scenes of his early days by the bright river of the North flashed athwart his memory , he felt a momentary sinking of the heart to think there was no home-loved friend who could witness the manner of his death ; and yet , when he remembered that one such witness might , by identifying him , prevent his sacrifice and endanger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be thus . A platoon of regulars was now drawn up in front of him , and waited but the word of their officer ; when suddenly a murmur ran along the column , which was displayed upon the ground in order to give solemnity to the scene . It was mistaken for a symptom of mutiny , and precipitated the fatal moment . " Fire ! " cried the officer ; and , even as he spoke , a haggard figure , in a torn hunting-shirt  --  with ghastly look , and tangled hair that floated on the breeze  --  leaped before the line of deadly muzzles ! He uttered one piercing shriek  --  whether of joy or agony it were impossible to tell  --  and then fell staggering with one arm across the bosom of Ernest , who breathed out his life while springing forward to meet the embrace of his brother !

It was the cholera season of 1834 , and such were my cogitations as I reclined upon the settee of a steamer , sipping the balmy corrective of the drastic Mississippi waters , whose yeasty current foamed around me . Methought , as I looked upon what many then considered the great fluid agent of the pestilence throughout the growing south-west  --  methought a man must be there , in that greasy-fumed , over-crowded boat , beneath that scorching sky  --  there , where the great gloomy river writhed its turbid way amid endless swamps of cypress  --  a man must be there , in that desolate wilderness , alone  --  ( for that heated , random crowd was not society , though it robbed one of the elevating sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  anxious and ailing , and but now almost completely disheartened by a long struggle amid jostling passengers to get his chance for a cooling draught at " the bar ; " he must , in short , be situated exactly as I was , to realize the full and perfect relishment of a julep ! I had yet to learn that I knew not the consummate condition of julep drinking . There was a buz among the passengers , as if some new event had turned up to vary the monotony of the day . " Are you sure that 's The Flame over by the shore ? " asked a man near me , of one of the deck-hands . " Certing , manny ! I could tell her pipes acrost the Mazoura.

Do n't folks sometimes go into bilers , manny ? " " I should think there 'd be other parts of the boat more comfortable . " " That 's right ; poking fun at me at once't ; but wait till we get through this brush with the old Flame , and I 'll tell ye of a regular fixin scrape that a man may get into .

" You have seen the Flame , then , afore , strannger ? Six year ago , when new upon the river , she was a raal out and outer , I tell ye . I was at that time a hand aboard of her .

There was no temperance society at Smasher 's Landing , and I went ashore upon a lark with some of the hands . " I omit the worthy Banjamin 's adventures upon land , and , despairing of fully conveying his language in its original Doric force , will not hesitate to give the rest of his singular narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few instances , I can recall his precise phraseology , which the reader will easily recognise . " The night was raw and sleety when I regained the deck of our boat . The officers , instead of leaving a watch above , had closed up everything , and shut themselves in the cabin . The fire-room only was open . The boards dashed from the outside by the explosion , had not yet been replaced . The floor of the room was wet , and there was scarcely a corner which afforded a shelter from the driving storm . I was about leaving the room . resigned to sleep in the open air , and now bent only upon getting under the lee of some bulkhead that would protect me against the wind . In passing out , I kept my arms stretched forward to feel my way in the dark , but my feet came in contact with a heavy iron lid ; I stumbled , and , as I fell , struck one of my hands into the manhole , ' ( I think this was the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boiler , ) through which the smith had entered to make his repairs . I fell with my arm thrust so far into the aperture that I received a pretty smart blow in the face as it came in contact with the head of the boiler , and I did not hesitate to drag my body after it the moment I recovered from this stunning effect and ascertained my whereabouts . In a word , I crept into the boiler , resolved to pass the rest of the night there . The place was dry and sheltered . Had my bed been softer , I would have had all that man could desire ; as it was , I slept , and slept soundly . " I should mention , though , that , before closing my eyes , I several times shifted my position . I had gone first to the farther end of the boiler , then again I had crawled back to the manhole , to put my hand out and feel that it was really still open . The warmest place was at the farther end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew from the first . It was foolish in me to think that the opening through which I had just entered could be closed without my hearing it , and that , too , when no one was astir but myself ; but the blow on the side of my face made me a little nervous perhaps ; besides , I never could bear to be shut up in any place  --  it always gives a wild-like feeling about the head . You may laugh , stranger , but I believe I should suffocate in an empty church , if I once felt that I was so shut up in it that I could not get out . I have met men afore now just like me , or worse rather  --  much worse . Men that it made sort of furious to be tied down to anything , yet so soft-like and contradictory in their natures that you might lead them anywhere , so long as they did n't feel the string . Stranger , it takes all sorts of people to make a world ! and we may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here out west . But I have seen folks upon this river  --  quiet looking chaps , too , as ever you see  --  who were so teetotally carankterankterous that they 'd shoot the doctor who 'd tell them they could n't live when ailing , and make a die of it , just out of spite , when told they must get well . Yes , fellows as fond of the good things of earth as you or I , yet who 'd rush like mad right over the gang-plank of life , if once brought to believe that they had to stay in this world whether they wanted to leave it or not . Thunder and bees ! if such a fellow as that had heard the cocks crow as I did  --  awakened to find darkness about him  --  darkness so thick you might cut it with a knife  --  heard other sounds , too , to tell that it was morning , and , scrambling to fumble for that manhole , found it , too , black  --  closed  --  black and even as the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rivet-hole to let God 's light and air in  --  why  --  why , he'd'a swounded right down on the spot , as I did , and I ai n't ashamed to own it to no white man . " The big drops actually stood upon the poor fellow 's brow as he now paused for a moment in the recital of his terrible story . He passed his hand over his rough features , and resumed it with less agitation of manner . " How long I may have remained there senseless , I do n't know . The doctors have since told me it must have been a sort of fit  --  more like an apoplexy than a swoon , for the attack finally passed off in sleep  --  Yes , I slept , I know that , for I dreamed  --  dreamed a heap o ' things afore I awoke ; there is but one dream , however , that I have ever been able to recall distinctly , and that must have come on shortly before I recovered my consciousness . My resting-place through the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the far end of the boiler . Well , I now dreamed that the manhole was still open  --  and , what seems curious , rather than laughable , if you take it in connexion with other things , I fancied that my legs had been so stretched in the long walk I had taken the evening before , that they now reached the whole length of the boiler , and extended through the opening . " At first ( in my dreaming reflections ) it was a comfortable thought that no one could now shut up the manhole without awakening me . But soon it seemed as if my feet , which were on the outside , were becoming drenched in the storm which had originally driven me to seek this shelter . I felt the chilling rain upon my extremities . They grew colder and colder , and their numbness gradually extended upward to other parts of my body . It seemed , however , that it was only the under side of my person that was thus strangely visited . I laid upon my back , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for I knew at last that I was dreaming , yet felt it impossible to rouse myself . A violent fit of coughing restored at last my powers of volition . The water , which had been slowly rising around me , had rushed into my mouth ; I awoke to hear the rapid strokes of the pump which was driving it into the boiler ! " My whole condition  --  no , not all of it  --  not yet  --  my present condition flashed with new horror upon me . But I did not again swoon . The choking sensation which had made me faint when I first discovered how I was entombed , gave way to a livelier , though less overpowering , emotion . I shrieked even as I started from my slumber . The previous discovery of the closed aperture , with the instant oblivion that followed , seemed only a part of my dream , and I threw my arms about and looked eagerly for the opening by which I had entered the horrid place  --  yes , looked for it and felt for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed  --  a second time brought home to me  --  which prompted my phrensied cry . Every sense seemed to have tenfold acuteness , yet not one to act in unison with another . I shrieked again and again  --  imploringly  --  desperately  --  savagely . I filled the hollow chamber with my cries till its iron walls seemed to tingle around me . The dull strokes of the accursed pump seemed only to mock at , while they deadened , my screams . " At last I gave myself up . It is the struggle against our fate which phrensies the mind . We cease to fear when we cease to hope . I gave myself up , and then I grew calm ! " I was resigned to die  --  resigned even to my mode of death . It was not , I thought , so very new , after all , as to awaken unwonted horror in a man . Thousands have been sunk to the bottom of the ocean shut up in the holds of vessels  --  beating themselves against the battened hatches  --  dragged down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for death , only beneath the eye and amid the breath of heaven . Thousands have endured that appalling kind of suffocation . I would die only as many a better man had died before me . I could meet such a death . I said so  --  I thought so  --  I felt so  --  felt so , I mean , for a minute  --  or more ; ten minutes it may have been  --  or but an instant of time . I know not  --  nor does it matter if I could compute it . There was a time , then , when I was resigned to my fate . But , good God ! was I resigned to it in the shape in which next it came to appal ? Stranger , I felt that water growing hot about my limbs , though it was yet mid-leg deep . I felt it , and in the same moment heard the roar of the furnace that was to turn it into steam before it could get deep enough to drown one ! " You shudder  --  It was hideous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down upon that iron floor , and lose my senses in that horrid agony of fear ? No ! though my brain swam , and the life-blood that curdled at my heart seemed about to stagnate there for ever , still I knew ! I was too hoarse  --  too hopeless , from my previous efforts , to cry out more . But I struck  --  feebly at first , and then strongly  --  frantically with my clenched fist , against the sides of the boiler . There were people moving near , who must hear my blows ! Could not I hear the grating of chains , the shuffling of feet , the very rustle of a rope , hear them all , within a few inches of me ? I did  --  but the gurgling water that was growing hotter and hotter around my extremities , made more noise within the steaming caldron than did my phrensied blows against its sides . " Latterly I had hardly changed my position , but now the growing heat of the water made me plash to and fro ; lifting myself wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain quiet . I stumbled upon something  --  it was a mallet !  --  a chance tool the smith had left their by accident . With what wild joy did I seize it  --  with what eager confidence did I now deal my first blows with it against the walls of my prison ! But scarce had I intermitted them for a moment , when I heard the clang of the iron door as the fireman flung it wide , to feed the flames that were to torture me . My knocking was unheard , though I could hear him toss the sticks into the furnace beneath me , and drive to the door when his infernal oven was fully crammed . " Had I yet a hope ? I had , but it rose in my mind side by side with the fear that I might now become the agent of preparing myself a more frightful death  --  Yes ! when I thought of that furnace with its fresh-fed flames curling beneath the iron upon which I stood  --  a more frightful death even than that of being boiled alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner  --  but no matter , I would by its aid resort to the only expedient now left . " It was this : I remembered having a marline-spike in my pocket , and in less time than I have taken in hinting at the consequences of thus using it , I had made an impression upon the sides of the boiler , and soon succeeded in driving it through . The water gushed through the aperture  --  would they see it ?  --  No , the jet could only play against a wooden partition , which must hide the stream from view  --  it must trickle down upon the deck before the leakage would be discovered . Should I drive another hole to make that leakage greater ? Why , the water within seemed already to be sensibly diminished  --  so hot had become that which remained  --  should more escape , would I not hear it bubble and hiss upon the fiery plates of iron that were already scorching the soles of my feet ? * * * * " Ah ! there is a movement  --  voices  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracks as they pry off the planking .

" I heard the cry of horror as they saw it without  --  the shout to drown the fire  --  the first stroke of the cold water pump . They say , too , that I was conscious when they took me out  --  but I  --  I remember nothing more till they brought a julep to my bed-side arterward , And that julep !  --  " " Cooling ! was it ?

OLD THINGS WITH NEW FACES . An Oriental Legend for Occidental Readers . The great Haroun Alraschid , than whom no worthier follower of the Prophet ever sat on the throne of the Caliphs , ( peace to his memory , ) was , as all the world knows , a very Miracle of Justice . With a power over the lives and fortunes of his subjects such as mortal man hath scarcely ever swayed before , his mind was never dizzied by the eminence to which he had attained ; and even the Prophet , who guided him to such a height of human glory , could hardly have exercised such absolute rule with a more steady and equal hand . But of the thousand instances which the Arabian annalists give of the discriminating justice of this great Caliph , there is no decision of his Divan which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten , case between Omri , the poor descendant of the poet of that name , and Mustapha , the rich vender of manuscripts at Bagdad . It chanced one day that , as Haroun was about breaking up his audience of Justice , the quick eye of the Vizier , the renowned Giafer al Barmeki , discovered among the retiring crowd a pale and poorly clad young man , who was slowly leading away a blind and aged women from the royal presence . The youth , as he withdrew , cast ever and anon a sad and appealing look at the judgment-seat of the Caliph , while at the same time attending and supporting his aged burthen with the most assiduous care . As filial tenderness and veneration for the aged are among the highest virtues of the Koran , so winning an instance of both could not but excite the interest of the good Giafer ; and he straightway pointed out this retiring pair to the Commander Divan . " Thy name , young man , " said the benignant monarch , looking kindly on the trembling youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpet , thus replied : " Oh , great King , live for ever . Thou seest before thee the meanest of thy slaves ; Allah be praised ! It is Omri , the son of Zadok , the son of Omri the poet , who now breathes the same air with the vicegerent of the Prophet upon Earth . " " And this aged woman ? " " She , oh light of the Earth  --  she who should be willing to die now that she has once heard the voice of the King , though his face she can not see  --  she is the mother of Zadok , the grandmother of Omri , who now stands before thee . " " The wife and grandson of Omri the poet reduced to such wretchedness ! Giafer ! "  --  the Caliph looked more sternly than was his wont at that favourite minister  --  " how can such things be in my dominions ? " The Vizier prostrated himself before the throne , and would have replied , but the Caliph , motioning him to rise before Giafer begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell his story . Premising his speech , then , with all those worshipful and dulcet terms which were alike becoming in a good Mussulman and the descendant of Omri , " the rose-breathed , " as he was called form the sweetness of his strains , the namesake of the poet thus pursued his tale : " Those poems , oh King , which , as none better than thou knowest , have filled all the world with fragrancy and delight , were the only dower and heritage which the blessed Omri left to Selika , his wife , and her son Zadok ! and yet not poor was their estate , as all men know who have smelt the incense that once burned nightly in the palace of Zadok here in Bagdad . People from all parts of the earth thronged to this great city to buy the poems of Omri from Zadok , his son , until the banks of the Tigris were black with the concourse of strangers . Zadok and his mother in the meantime kept scribes  --  a multitude as great in number as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which all good Mussulmen bought from him only , because the Cadi would not certify that any others were genuine save those written out under the immediate eye of the son of Omri . Now , it chanced that Zadok , who saw no end to such a source of exceeding riches , and who always spent all his income  --  one-half in contributing to the splendid hospitality of this great capital , and one-half in doing good to the poor  --  it chanced , I say , that Zadok died one day , and left me , his son , and this aged woman , his mother , this same estate of Omri 's poems . " But  --  Allah forgive me  --  what ashes had we eaten , that so much gold should turn to dust in our hands ? " It so happened , oh sire , in Bagdad there was a man , one Faustiz by name , a cunning worker in metals , who contrived a machine for copying manuscripts so correctly that not one word should be amiss , and at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common scribe was completing one ; and straightway this Faustiz commenced the making of books and selling them to the faithful . At first he used his machine only to make copies of such poems , tales , and histories as were composed by himself or his friends , who wrote them for his special use . But soon , oh ! just King , he began to lay hands upon the property of others . Men found that all the copies of each book he sold were so much alike and so true to each other , that they needed no longer the word of the writer or his representative , or the certificate of the Cadi , to prove each manuscript to be a genuine copy of the original ; and Faustiz , knowing this , began to deal with the works of Omri as if they were not the property of others . He could make the copies faster and more cheaply than we did , and he showered them over the land so profusely that there was no call for ours . The estate which Omri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years of preparatory study  --  so many of subsequent toil  --  the property so slowly amassed  --  with such honest and harmless industry  --  with such silent , yet indefatigable , pains  --  the property which he had bequeathed to his descendants to support his honoured name in respectability  --  this all melted from our possession , and passed into the hands of others without any fault of our own . We became stricken in poverty and a reproach among men . " Whose dog is that ? " said the faithful , as I passed them by . " Behold the beggared wife of poor Omri the poet ! ' said they , pointing to my grandmother . " Words are not things ; how could they expect to hold an exclusive property in mere words , which belong alike to all men ? ' " Faustiz is a great benefactor to the faithful ; he scattereth the good things abroad which these foolish people would ministrate for their own exclusive use . ' And with a thousand such like taunts , oh ! great King , did men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The descendant of the great poet paused , as if much affected . The Caliph stroked his beard and looked at Giafer , and Giafer shook his head with that solemn air which ( even before the time of Lord Burleigh ) meant so much among counsellors of state . The poor petitioner gathered fresh confidence from these important signs , and resumed with spirit  --  " The grandson of Omri would know of the Commander of the Faithful if Faustiz the worker in metals , and other men who now use his cunning machine , should have the right of using it to make copies of books which can not belong to them , seeing that they neither wrote these books themselves nor did they pay others to write them , nor were these books given or bequeathed to them in any way whatsoever . Their copying machine is doubtless of great use and benefit to the world in general , and its invention must contribute to the glories of the great King 's reign . But even if uncommon privileges should be accorded to Faustiz the inventor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewarded without trespassing in some way upon the conflicting rights of others , is there any reason why every common man who uses this machine , should enjoy equal privileges ? The writer who published his books by the old mode of copying , could always preserve some control over his property ; is this new machine , whose beneficial use to the world depends wholly upon the writers who supply it with original works  --  is it to take the life-blood from those to whom it owes its vitality ? If its very origin is thus coupled with injustice , what must its influence be in those ages when the great Haroun no longer lives to hold the people of the earth in his guiding hand . " The scholar whose early years are now spent in toilsome study , retreating often like some holy Dervish to his cell ; the man of genius who , already skilled in letters , passes his best hours in converse with our most learned Mufti ; the poet who traverses strange and wonderful lands , and closely studies man in all  --  those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works which must benefit humanity and last through all time  --  those who now , when once enrolled among our Arabian sages , have wealth and honours showered upon them , which lift their souls above the mean and petty struggles of the crowd  --  these , if they would still pursue their profession and live by it , must be vastly changed in character . " Many of them will be degraded to a class of intellectual mountebanks , who live upon the breath of public favour ; and he who practises the maddest antics , will soonest get his remuneration from the mob . The reward of their labours has hitherto been slow in coming , but it was permanent in proportion to the excellence of their works ; henceforth the season for reaping that reward will be so brief that they must minister instantly to some gust of popular passion , some passing taste or prejudice , in order to take advantage of it . Those who thus draw a temporary subsistence from the public , will of course be forgotten , though an association of meanness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men ; while those who will not thus grovel to get their bread , will be for the most part so poor that the very name of Poet ' will pass into a by-word , as belonging to a helpless , shiftless , poverty-stricken being . But why do I speak thus to the Commander of the Faithful , who knows all things that are just and wise in the sight of Allah , " said Omri , as he concluded his long-winded address with a deep salaam before retiring back a step or two from the Divan . " Let Faustiz , the cunning maker of this copying machine , be brought at once before me , " thundered the Caliph . Then Giafer , prostrating himself before the Sultan , spoke as follows : " Odour of the universe  --  trampler on the necks of a thousand monarchs , to whom justice is as a hand-maiden , and mercy ever a shadow , your highness is not pleased to remember that , by your own order , I presented this same Faustiz with a thousand sequins , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft among some remote nations of infidels . " " Bring before me , then , any of my subjects who has dared to use this machine to filch from them the property of others , " thundered the Caliph ; and straightway Mustapha , a rich dealer in books , who had made half his fortune out of the inheritance of poor Omri , was led up before the king . " Mustapha , the son of Serab , what dirt hast thou eaten , that the property and rights of Omri should thus be appropriated by thee without his consent ? " " Shadow of the Prophet on earth , " cried Mustapha , in unfeigned astonishment , " thy slave hath never meddled with the property of the meanest of thy subjects . " " The works of Omri the poet  --  hast thou not been one of those who have robbed this young man , his grandson and heir , of the property which he inherited in them ? " " Property ! oh , great King , and where in the wise laws of thy empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it written that man may have property in so unsubstantial a thing as a writing , which , to preserve , he must either lock up or carry about with him . " " Thou fool , if the nature of property depended upon the views of minds as narrow as thine , the Bedouin of the desert might define that wherein a man 's possessions consist as well as thou . Thou believest in houses and land , and things of such stability , as property . The Bedouin believes that no man can have an ownership save in the horses and camels , the tents , arms , and equipments he can carry about with him . Which , in natural law , hath the greater show of reason : that a man may call a part of the earth his  --  the earth which came from Allah , and was given alike for the use of all ; or that he may claim an exclusive property in the contrivances of his own mind  --  those workings of his intellect which are as much a part of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web which the spider weaves from his own bowels , belong to the pains-taking insect which wove it ? All men at first inherited the earth as common property , but GENIUS is a gift of God to individual men , and God will judge those who steal its fruits . " " Inshallah ! the interpreter of the will of the Prophet can scarce open his lips save to drop wisdom ; but oh ! Caliph ! the Arab of the desert still dealeth with things substantial , whose possession he might defend with the strength of his arm , even as thy slave might be compelled to defend his house and merchandise against these same wild Bedouins , if he were not so fortunate as to live under the shadowing wings of thy power . Allah grant that it may never diminish . " " Thou defend ! " echoed Haroun , with a smile of mingled merriment and contempt , as he glanced his eye over the feeble frame of Mustapha  --  " Thou defend ! why , thou paltry slave , knowest thou not that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which keeps the body and soul of such things as thou art together . It is the law alone which guards thee , and the thousands like thee , in their honest possessions ; and as for thy dishonest ones , if I mistake not , it is only the law which could keep this sturdy youngling from wresting them from thee , or visiting upon thy wretched carcass the injury he has received at thy hands . Answer me thou , Giafer , is it just that the mantle of the law , which so comfortably covers this merchant of books , should afford no corner for this orphan youth to creep under ? Should not those who minister to the mental wants of my people be as much fostered and protected as those who supply their physical necessities ? Shall we give them the lot of the Ishmaelite , and thus teach them to prey upon the society which will not protect them ? " " But this youth , oh King , " doubtingly interposed the trembling Mustapha , " he did not thus minister to the wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poems of the great Ormi , which he claims as his exclusive property ! " " Hearken , son of Serab , " said the Caliph ; " how gottest thou the means by which thou wast enabled to purchase one of these machines from Faustiz , and furnish thy warehouses , which men say are richly filled with merchandise ? " " The grandsire of your slave , oh King , " answered Mustapha , brightening up with an air of confidence at this question  --  " My grandsire was butler in the household of the Vizier of one of your royal predecessors . His faithful services after many years were rewarded with a sum of money , and a house and garden in the neighbourhood of the city , in which he spent his declining years , enjoying all the luxuries that are permitted to a good Mussulman . This wealth my father inherited , and in turn the greater portion of it descended to me ; and this honestly acquired heritage I have employed in trade . " " Your grandsire was doubtless a good man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a just one which transmitted his property safely to you . But , Mashallah ! Giafer , call we this justice ? Look ye once at those two men  --  that tawdry tradesman and that half-naked youth . His grandsire was a butler  --  a faithful , as it seems , and , therefore , justly rewarded one ; but a man whose services to his employer , to his fellow-men , ceased and terminated for ever with his own existence . Of the other the grandsire was a Poet  --  a man whose services to society in the time when he flourished were at least equal to those of the butler  --  but , unlike him , a man whose services to mankind did not cease and terminate with his mortal existence ; for , while the fire of his thoughts can animate , the music of his verses sooth  --  while he supplies aliment to the soul , and actually mingles his intellectual being with the mental texture of his reader , mankind are still the poet 's debtors . Now , if a difference is to be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them is it that should have the privilege of bequeathing the fruit of his labours to his children ? " " I give it against the butler , " said Giafer . " Ever wise and noble Al Barmeki , " cried Haroun , looking affectionately at his Vizier ; and straightway on the spot , they say , the Caliph embraced him for the righteousness of his decision . The story goes to tell that Mustapha , who was slow in comprehending the full force of the Caliph 's illustration , trembled in his shoes , lest every son-of-a-butler was about to be outlawed and his own heritage exposed , to be dealt with as freely as he had invaded that of Omri . But the magnanimous Haroun , while restoring a then esteemed class to their ( anciently ) legal rights , had no idea of accompanying this act by one of cruelty and oppression to others . His object was only to give his subjects of all classes and pursuits equal protection from the laws of the land . The legend concludes by mentioning  --  and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know  --  that the young Omri , restored to the possession ( or what in modern times might be translated THE COPYRIGHT ) of his father 's poems , lived long in great affluence at Bagdad ; and , shining forth under happier auspices , with some of his ancestral fire , wrote some of the best of those charming stories which , under the name of the Arabian Nights Entertainments , have made all the world familiar with the name and fame of the great Caliph Haroun Alraschid . SCENES ON THE HUDSON . * * * My dog had flushed a bevy of quail , and , though still too early in the season for that game , I could not resist the temptation to follow the half-grown birds into the cover , and see how they promised for October . My well-trained nag did not require to be tethered as I left him standing for a few moments in the road . The path which I took led through a hollow or slight ravine , grown over with brushwood , which delayed me somewhat in gaining a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow Blucher to worry the young birds , I lost them entirely before reaching the spot ; but the view it commanded repaid my trouble , and prevented me for some time from resuming the highway . I found myself upon the bluff that rises so beautifully from the meadow behind Constitution Island . The gray rocks of West Point , with their mouldering fortresses frowning over the modern barracks , were immediately in front ; while the narrow island appeared to be united to the opposite shore , dividing the river into two of the loveliest lakes that I ever beheld . The lower one was small , belted with the mountains , which lapped each other as far as the eye could reach , and broken by crags and promontories that pushed into it on every side as if they were jostling together to see which could reflect the largest portion of their nodding forests in the glassy water . The landscape to the north , though different in character , was hardly less picturesque . Immediately below , the river shot like a narrow frith among the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its dark , though placid , surface . But miles away , where the sudden opening in the mountains opposite Pollipel 's Island let in the fair fields and orchards of Orange County , with the spires and chimneys of Newburgh rising along the water , the broad expanse glistened like silver beneath the breeze that rippled it ; while the white canvass and light spars of the river craft glowing in the sunshine , kept the scene continually animated . The blue outline of the Katzbergs bounded the prospect in the distance . I know not how long I lingered gazing upon these superb landscapes , doubtful to which of the two to give the preference ; but certainly it did not seem twenty minutes from the moment of my first dismounting to that in which I regained the highway , and , resuming my horse , returned to my lodgings near the Foundery . I had hardly entered the unique bachelor establishment of the hospitable friend with whom I was quartered , when he began to rally me about an abrupt desertion of a lady , and observed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , to ask why I left them so singularly . Having neither seen any lady nor met any party , the jest , as I thought it , was unintelligible to me , and I let it pass ; as wise people do all matters which they can not understand and deem unworthy the trouble of explanation . The next morning I rode out to join a party from the neighbourhood , bent upon an excursion to a little lake which lies in a picturesque situation back of Break-neck Hill , whose modest beauties the pencil of Wier ought to transfer to the canvass . Upon meeting my friends , they commenced a simultaneous attack upon me for having , as they averred , left them in a most eccentric manner the day before . At first I presumed it was a repetition of the jest of yesterday as I then thought it , for I had not actually seen one of those present since the excursion to Break-neck had been planned , a week before ; and as for being on horseback with a party at the hour mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cadets on the opposite shore , that at the very time mentioned I was standing alone upon the bluff above Constitution Island , about three hundred yards from the large white dwelling house , formerly known as the " Highland School , " looking upon the landscape I have already attempted to describe . It was insisted upon , however , that I was mistaken . A gentleman present swore to the identity of my horse , described the very dress I wore , and , appealing to a lady whom I was said to have accosted  --  riding by her side in earnest conversation for a mile or more  --  mentioned the very terms in which I had saluted her party upon first joining them . The lady in reply only glanced at me with a kind of bewildered look as she waited for my answer ; and something of confusion , if not of anger , seemed mingled in her expression when I flatly denied having seen her before for a week . " Why , surely , " cried one , " you left your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " " I could not have left you , " I answered , somewhat provoked at last at what I regarded as a most absurd attempt to hoax  --  " I could not have left you , as I never joined you ; and as for the visit at Mr.  --  ' s , it is full as apocryphal as the rest you have been telling me . " " Well , d  --  n it , ahem , boys , " interrupted my uncle Ben , good-naturedly , " this is all , ahem , d  --  n it , nonsense ; you 'll never at this rate , d  --  n it , ahem , get to the lake to-day . Why , Corney , you dog you , " added the bluff old gentleman , slapping me on the shoulder , for I was a favourite with him  --  " Corney , d  --  n it , ahem , it 's only the Spook-visiter that 's been playing this trick upon all of us , ahem , d  --  n it . " Few of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed almost the only subject of conversation during our day 's ride , as story after story was told of his various freaks among these hills . I did not attempt , however , to write the following true history until I had looked in at Mother Longfield 's Inn and talked the whole matter over with her ; and the curious reader who will make a voyage to Cold Spring , and hold an hour 's gossip over a tankard of her best ale , may test the fidelity of the following account of THE SPOOK-VISITER . A Legend of the Highlands . Among my favourite places of resort along the Hudson , there is none which , in years past , I have frequented more than the romantic neighbourhood around Spookinsel , as the bold promontory opposite West Point was called in the good old days of our Dutch ancestors . Although an anciently settled part of the country , it has , until very recently , been one of those by-corners of the world where the intrusive spirit of modern innevation seemed as if it could never find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucked away in the adjacent dells , allowing their white-washed chimneys only now and then to peer above the upland , were a perversely contented set , who seemed to have been indigenous , as it were , to the few arable spots found among their broken hills ; springing up and flourishing with the same kind of knotty and stiff-rooted obstinacy as the stunted cedars that are everywhere rifted among their mossy rocks . The adjacent hamlet of Cold Spring , which is the metropolis of these parts , was always a gay and galliard sort of a place ; the worthy burghers thereof being marvellously given to the consumption of Newburgh ale and Goshen cheese , which , in former times , was supplied to them by a little vessel that plied weekly from their long wharf to the former place . These dissipated habits , however , did in nowise extend to the adjacent glens , whose steady and sober tenants looked down upon the wassailing Cold Springers with all the dignity of substantial house-keepers ; of people who had countless hoards of dried apples and treasures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on foreign importers for the wherewithall to cheer their fire-sides . And seldom , unless when wishing to purchase a yard of flannel or replenish their supply of tobacco for the long winter evenings , did they resort to the stone store , which still stands immediately opposite the ferry-stairs upon the main street of the village . The truth is , if it were all told , that these worthy people were governed by some other motives than a mere disrelish to the mixed society of their commercial metropolis , to prevent them from gallivanting about the country , and venturing forth among the godless people of the village at all hours . Every one about there knew that the Spook-visiter , though he made the island his head-quarters , had still a most troublesome habit of wandering about among the adjacent hills , and forcing his company upon whomsoever might fall in his way , by assuming the appearance of one of their neighbours . Old Foster , who , time immemorial , has dwelt upon the island as lord and governor of the same , and whose cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southern side , was , in his young days , the only man in these parts who did not fear the Spook-visiter ; and people , who will talk , used to say that it was a very equivocal tenure by which he became lessee of the island . This , however , was an unrighteous scandal upon the worthy governor , who , to our personal knowledge , owned no other landlords than the very respectable family in the neighbourhood , by whose courtesy he still tenants his picturesque domain . It was useless , however , for the governer to shake his head , and pretend to laugh at the idle fears of his neighbours . Had not the Spook-visiter been twice met , under the shape of Gill Ten Eyck , by old Barney Phillipson , the gray-headed negro , while ploughing in Indian field ; and did not the goblin offer to plough a whole morning for him , if he would lend him one of his master 's horses to ride over to Deacon Brown 's with ? Had he not been seen , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , talking beneath Experience Brown 's window , when others had observed the real Gill that very afternoon at the landing , and with their own eyes had seen him wave his straw-hat from on board the sloop as she hauled off with the turn of the tide on her weekly voyage to New York ? Besides , why did not people go to Indian Falls any more ? did not every one know that Squire Smith 's girls , in coming home from chestnutting , had seen the Spook rowing his skiff straight up the brook , over rocks and all , to the very foot of the fall ? Lipsey , too , ( who then had not dreamed of owning a boat of his own , and becoming the Charon of these parts )  --  Lipsey had seen the Spook-visiter under the exact shape of Sergeant Thompson , bobbing for eels off " The old-woman 's rock , " when no one had ever disputed that the sergeant was on duty that very afternoon at the Barracks , over the river . No ! Col. ***** ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn the thing into fun if he chose , but it was not for decent people nor decent people 's children to throw themselves in the way of such a rantipole character as the Spook-visiter after dark . It seemed hard , too , that a being of whom , upon the whole , nothing bad was ever told , should thus be placed under the ban of a whole neighbourhood merely because he chose to assume some harmless characters for the sake of enjoying their society . There has always , however , been an inveterate prejudice among the people of this world against associating with your chance wanderers from the other . They seem to think that , because a man 's body has gone under the earth , his spirit has no right to walk over it ! and if they do ever allow him to make a little excursion occasionally from his cramped and narrow dwelling into the free spots he once delighted in , he always has to take his airings after nightfall : while many insist that he must only come out on such dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would wish to be abroad in . I have , for my own part , been always a sturdy stickler for the rights of the much injured Ghost-fraternity ; and , seeing that the bodyless have such a great majority over the flesh-framed sons of earth , I can not but wonder that there are not more partisans to uphold their privileges and immunities . It must be something , when our voices can no longer commune with the friends that we loved , and when our forms are perhaps forgotten by the fire-side we once helped to cheer  --  It must be something to revisit , even in viewless forms of air , the scenes where nature ( the truest of her sex ) still meets us with her caressing flowers  --  still keeps her spring-time tryste with a " pudency as rosy " as when first we worshipped her unfolding charms  --  still sighs her autumnal parting with a sadness as unfeigned as when first we heard her fading footsteps over the rustling leaves . In the case of the Spook-visiter I have been at some pains to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , upon my word , after all my inquiries into his history , I can find no reason in the world why he should be debarred from the innocent indulgence of rambling about the neighbourhood in whatsoever form he pleases . The circumstances under which he first appeared here were certainly distressing enough to enlist the warmest sympathy in his favour . Poor Bornt Van Tromp ! he little dreamed , when serving his apprenticeship with old Boss Bogart , the cracker merchant , now immortalized in the grave writings of Mynheer Rapelje , that the would ever become the subject of a memoir like this ! Bornt was one of those unfortunate characters whom nature intended to make a figure in life , but whom fortune sends into the world in the very worst time for the exercise of their peculiar talents . How many a philanthropist is there in this humane age , when foreign paupers are provided for at the public expense and home-judged criminals are regarded as martyrs instead of victims to justice  --  how many a friend of the human race , whose over-running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How many a hero is there in these piping times of peace who can only show his passion for military glory at a Texian meeting , and whose corked-up valour must needs explode in a string of fiery resolutions against the doughty Santa Anna and his myrmidons ? Yet who can doubt that , if prisons were again converted into pest-houses , Howards would be as plenty as black berries among the first : and that as for the last , did really grim War erect her brazen front in our streets , these worthies would meet the virago face to face , and give the saucy jade just as good as she brought ? Now , the heart that beat beneath the jerkin of Van Tromp was not exactly cast in what poets calls the heroic mould , though it was the heart of as doughty a Dutchman as ever made our English ancestors quail when his namesake , the admiral , was sweeping the narrow channel with a broom at his mast-head . The bent of his mind lay in an entirely different path from that graced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesale killers of their kind . He had what , in our day , would be called " peculiar talents for society . " To wit , an irresistible propensity to make acquaintances , and a happy knack of rendering himself agreeable to every one in whose company he was thrown . Or , to express it in the quaint words of a good old author , " he was much disposed for the mirth and galliardize of companie , and his parts qualified him to shine therein . " Bornt could not , in fact , cross the street upon an errand , however hurried , without stopping upon the curb-stone to have a chat with some passer-by ; and when his boss sent him upon a mission that carried him any distance from the shop , he always consumed about double the usual time in hunting up some idle crony to go along and talk with him by the way . On Sundays he used always to lounge about the docks and slips for the sake of catching a chat with some indolent skipper , who , having lingered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the deck of his sloop , or lay stretched in full length upon her lazy boom , enjoying his pipe in the still sunshine . It was on one occasion of this latter kind , a soft , sunny , October morning , that , as Bornt sauntered down as usual to enjoy his weekly dish of gossip , he saw the sloop just shaking out her mainsail , and in the act of gliding out of the slip . Van Tromp felt grievously loth to forego his wonted enjoyment , and , as the vessel rounded to a moment at the pier-head while disengaging her forward rigging from that of a sister craft with which it had become entangled , he could not resist the temptation just to step aboard and exchange a parting word with old Yorpe , the black cook and steward . Yorpe had a world of things to say , nor would he let our hero depart without his stepping down into the cabin to take a farewell glass of cider with him . How long their parrorching would then have lasted it is difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not told she was under way , and warned Bornt quickly to the deck . But what was his surprise , upon raising his head above the companion-way , to discover that the sloop had already shot from the pier , and , having stretched across the broad bay , was now upon another tack , and making her way up the river at a rate which soon sent the spires and gables of the city fading in the distance . Our hero was at first not a little disconcerted at finding himself thus unexpectedly embarked upon a voyage which might last , he knew not how long ; for the sloop was bound to a port above the Highlands , which were thought very remote in those days . He soon , however , like many other historical characters who have surrendered themselves to their destiny in like emergencies , consoled himself with the idea that " mayhap it was all for the best ; " and , stretching himself along a hen-coop in the stern , he surrendered himself to a thousand dreaming fancies . The day was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft haze which mellowed the brilliant tints of the autumnal foliage , showed the landscape through an atmosphere more delicious and Elysian than any other clime can boast of . But one artist has succeeded in transferring the gorgeous hues of those dying woods to his canvass , and even his pencil has failed in representing the magic tissue which Nature weaves over the most glorious display of her charms  --  softening the rainbow blending of the various dyes , even while freshening each individual colour . The wind , though so slight as scarcely to ripple the water , was dead ahead , and the light craft , as she beat up with the tide , was compelled to stretch into every cove and inlet where the water was deep enough to allow her to lengthen her tack . At times she would glide so near to the steep banks of the river as to scare the kingfisher from his perch upon the dead limb that bent over it , while the sound of dropping nuts would be heard as the squirrel scampered from the boughs of some ancient chestnut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A thousand times did Bornt , when the sloop would then slowly luff up in the indolent breeze , while the huge boom went creaking over , raise himself upon his elbow and look wistfully on the shore , as if it were almost impossible to resist the temptation to leap to land . But he saw no one there to have a talk with ; and , though the skipper 's crew were all engaged about their own affairs , he thought bad company better than none . At last the bold promontory of West Point hove in sight , and then the headland of the island opposite was weathered , when , just as they were pushing deep into the bay beyond , and hugging the northern shore of the island in order to shun the sunken rocks upon her windward bow , a tornado burst from the hills of Orange , and , sweeping down the gorge now known by the name of Washington 's Valley , struck the broad topsail of the sloop and capsized her in a moment . So furious and resistless was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant of its crown of pines , which , being carried completely across the river , has left the mountain bald ever since . Nor was this all ; but the sloop , which was a round , jolly , Dutch little punchbowl of a vessel , rolled completely over and over , and that so rapidly that she came up with all standing , and apparently nowise affected by the sudden evolution ; just as you may have seen a brimming tankard balanced by some dexterous tapster within the round of a hoop , and whirled swiftly about his head without ever spilling a drop of the precious liquor , which was to be his guerdon for the feat . The topsy-turvy process , however , created some little confusion in the brains of the voyagers who had so unwittingly thrown this aquatic somerset ; and it was not until the sloop , having kept on her course as if nothing had happened , had neared Hungry Hollow , and was making Polipell 's Island , that it was perceived that one of her company was missing . Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more to be seen . He had disappeared , as if by magic , when no one had seen him go . The fact was , that his position upon the hen-coop raised his person just enough above the line of the gunwale for the friction of the water to wipe him clean off as the sloop was whirled over ; and , stunned by the movement , he could not make an effort to swim , but sunk , like a lump of sugar in a tea-cup , at once to the bottom . Our hero , upon again recovering his senses , was very naturally much disconcerted to find himself a drowned man , and ushered suddenly into the company of a hundred others who had been overtaken by the same fate at different places along the Hudson in years gone by . They now kept commons in the pass by West Point , that being the deepest and , to them , most commodious place in the river ; but , as Bornt soon learned , they enjoyed the jail-liberties of every part of the noble stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now assembled , was rather various than select ; but incongruity of character appeared to be no bar to social feeling among The Drowned of the Hudson . In one corner a Mohickander chief , whose canoe had been upset by a chance shot from Hendrick Hudson 's artillery , was playing back-gammon with one of Hendrick 's own sailors , who had fallen from the yard-arm on his voyage down the river . In another an English bucanier , whose iron corselet had carried him to the bottom as he stepped off a plank one stormy night while landing merchandise from a plundered galleon at Powles Hook , was flirting with a buxom Bergen market-woman , whose pung had broken through the ice , where the deep current along the Jersey shore had swept her hither ; while in a third one of Frontenac 's French gallants , that slipped over Glen 's Falls while reconnoitering them by moonlight , was smoking a pipe with old Antony Van Corlaer , who was absent upon leave from his quarters at the bottom of Lake Champlain . A sentimental Swede , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for Governor Risingh , was playing at chuck-farthing with a grim Spaniard , who had met his fate at Captain Kidd 's yard-arm off Sandy Hook , and with a score of the captain 's own ruffling camerados completed an assemblage , wherein , though every nation of Europe was represented , yet all conversed in exceeding good Dutch . The social appearance of the whole circle , with the companionable air of each individual member , delighted our hero exceedingly . He slapped the Swede on the shoulder with the heartiness of an old acquaintance , shook hands with the Englishman , bowed to the Frenchman , exchanged a grunt with the Indian , and , finally , lighted his pipe at the Dutchman with the air of a man who was sure of his welcome , and felt himself at once perfectly at home . The smell of the kitchen next attracted Van Tromp 's attention ; and there , besides the finest salmon , which at that time abounded in the river , he found some dish or other supplied from each of its beautiful tributaries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beaver 's tails from the Waha-manessing ; Walkill eels , Croton bass , and other varieties of the finny , crustaceous , and moluscan tribes , boiled , grilled , and stewed , in the greatest profusion . Of meat , indeed , there was not so great a variety ; though a delicate loin of seadog , secured by a drowned sealer as the animal was swimming across Newburgh Bay , did look tempting ; as did also some otter cutlets which the Indian had provided for his own especial eating . But the " removes " consisted only of a steak or two from a stray turtle , which are still sometimes taken in the mouth of the Hudson ; and a few canvass-backs , which feed in the season around the coves of the creeks above the Highlands , and are quite equal in flavour to those shot on the Susquehannah . These last had all been pulled under while diving for water-cellery , by the cook , who wore a belt , ' neath which he clapped their necks when securing these valuable additions to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best quality , Bornt found that it abounded in the subaqueous cellars . The holds of a hundred merchantmen had , at different times , been rummaged by the goblin wreckers , to the great chagrin and disappointment of certain enterprizing worthies , who from time to time have often since sent down diving-bells to explore for red-seal and black-seal in various parts of the river . Where there is wine , there is sure to be song ; and our hero , after doing full justice to the various good things before him , wiped his mouth upon a napkin of woven eel-grass , and joined in the chorus , which a knot of drowned bacchanals were trolling near . SONG OF THE DROWNED . I. Down , far down , in the waters deep , Where the booming surges above us sweep , Our revels from night till morn we keep : And though with us the cup goes round Upon every shore where the blue waves sound , Yet here , as it passes from lip to lip , Alone is found true fellowship ; For only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dead alone who never change . II . What boots your pledges , ye sons of Earth ; Or to whom ye drink in your hours of mirth , When gathered around your festal hearth ? Ye fill to love ! and the toasts ye give Will hardly the fumes of your wine outlive ! To friendship fill ! and its tale is told Almost ' ere the pledge on your lip grows cold ! For only the Dead , where'er they range , ' T is the Dead alone who never change . III . Then come , when the bolt of death is hurled , Come down to us from that bleak , bleak world , Where the wings of Sorrow are never furled : Come , and we 'll drink to the shades of the past ; To the hopes that mocked in life to the last ; To the lips and eyes we once would adore , And the loves that in death can delude no more ! For the Dead , the Dead , wherever they range , ' T is only the Dead who never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncouth ditty brought certain tender reminiscences into the moistening eyes of poor Van Tromp . He thought of his tight and trim little Manhattanese , with her plump boddice , and neat ankle and amplitude of petticoats above , who used to make his heart flutter as she tripped across the street before his window when flitting in and out from the neighbouring houses , ripe and restless as a bob-link glancing from thicket to thicket in the mating season . He thought of the rival beaux , by whom she was probably now surrounded , when his attentions were cooled at the bottom of the river for ever ; and , when called upon for a solo , the company were not a little surprised to hear so unsentimental a looking personage pour forth a little Dutch ditty , which Mr. Thomas Moore , had he the same access to the original that we have , would perhaps translate as follows : THOSE EYES . Those eyes  --  those eyes  --  I watch them so , While radiant with soul they glow , To see if one kind glance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever one fond thought arise To fill with tenderness those eyes . Sometimes a single beamy look Will make my pulses leap , like brook Which bounds to meet the sunshine sparkling Through alders long its current darkling  --  Then like that brook , in deepening glade , They 're given again to gloom and shade . Those eyes  --  those eyes  --  oh , I 'll no more Their cold and fitful light adore ! The flash of mind that 's to them given Is but a borrowed ray from Heaven , And not the soft , impassioned glow To warm its worshippers below ! The tender burthen of Bornt 's song was not lost upon a handsome young hunter , who had hardly yet become reconciled to his banishment from field and forest ; and who , when next called upon , impetuously broke forth with what he called A LOVE CHALENGE . Away to the forest  --  away , love , away  --  My foam-champing courser reproves thy delay , And the brooks are all calling , away , love , away . Away to the forest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' checker 'd glade sports the wind free ; Where in the bosky dell , While its young leaflets swell , In spring every floral bell Tuneth for thee ! Away to the forest , away . Away to the forest  --  away , love , away  --  My foam-champing courser reproves thy delay , And bird and brook calls thee  --  away , love , away , Hark ! how the blue-bird 's throat , carolling o'er us , Chimes with the thrush 's note floating before us . Away , then , my gentle one  --  Thy voice is missed alone ; Away  --  let love 's murmur 'd tone Swell the bright chorus ! Away to the forest , away . A Connecticut schoolmaster , who , even at that early day , had found his way into the land of promise watered by the Hudson , sat thumbing a tattered copy of Grca Minora , and sipping switchel from an old tin cup .

Then drain the cup , and let thy soul Learn , as the draught delicious flies , Like pearls in the Egyptian 's bowl , Truth beaming at the bottom lies . Of the symposia that followed we have obtained no record ; but , what with drowning and drinking , our hero felt stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright October sun was streaming down through the water , and the long river grass , upon which Bornt was reposing , seemed clothed with the hues of the rainbow as its feathery spears termbled upward in the quivering light . Farther off , the channel of the river was paved with muscleshells , whose pearly lining showed like a carpet of silver tissue in the glistening wave . Still more remote , grottoes of spar , whose incrusted pillars and crystalline fret-work had been washed hither from the limestone regions , by which some of the tributaries of the Hudson are traversed , lifted their airy wreaths and frosted pinnacles ; while cloisters of gloomy serpentine or isolated columns of basalt , which the eddies along the Palisades had swept up from below , were discernible in the dim distance . The drowned in the meantime were loitering about in the spacious courts , and amusing themselves each as he listed . The Frenchman , even at so early an hour , had found an antagonist at dominos while sipping his coffee off a marble slab which stood in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft sunshine . The Englishmen were betting at bowls and shuffle-board , and drinking rum punch ; while the Indians and Dutchmen , pipe in mouth , looked quietly on . As for the females , having no husband or children here to care about , their happiness seemed to be complete in making knick-knacks ad libitum for a fair in aid of a mission to Sputendeyvil Creek , the Devil's-danskammer , or some other satanic and heathenish place along the river . Some of the more elderly ones , however , passed their time full as agreeably in teaching some youngsters to waltz , who in return " Taught them the guitar and other fooleries . " The scene was one after Bornt 's own heart ; nor did he find that it lost its charm upon repetition from day to day . There was , indeed , mighty little conversation going on among the water-wraiths ; but this gave our hero a full opportunity of exhibiting his social powers to the best advantage . He had a happy knack of telling a story , and a power of mimicry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner that would have delighted every one but themselves ; and , like others who have this turn for anecdote and faculty of imitation , he would never let his gifts rust from lying idle . It was not long , however , before Van Tromp 's stock of stories began to run out ; and his hearers somehow would tire of them after listening patiently to the same thing for the twentieth time . He had a habit , too , of taking his friends by the button whenever and wherever he met them ; and no matter what might be the first observation suggested , or however his victim , like some hapless insect pinned by an entymologist , might writhe under the infliction , he would still insist upon boring him with some story , which he was determined should be in point to what had been spoken . The consequence was , that , though by no means personally disliked , our hero was so much avoided , that he was finally almost placed in Coventry by the good society of the place . He pined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his social habits ; and at length , partly out of compassion for him and partly from concern for themselves , the strict laws that prevail among water-wraiths were set aside to meet the occasion , and , contrary to all usages among the drowned , he was allowed to return to earth occasionally , to recruit his spirits . Upon one only express condition , however ; and this was , that , in order that he might not bring the lively circle to which he belonged into disrepute as a community of bores , he was never to make his appearance among the living , except under the form and in the guise of some one who had not yet been disimbodied . His power and privileges as a ghost enabled him easily to assume what shape and appearance he pleased ; and the talent for mimicry , which had survived the mishap of drowning , allowed him to complete the condition upon which alone he could enjoy the society of the living . Since that time , the appearance of Bornt Van Tromp upon earth is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbourhood around West Point than The Spook-visiter ; while the variety of forms under which it appears , seems to set detection at defiance . On one day he will appear in a slouched hat and weather-beaten features , at the turnpike-gate on the east side of the river , to delay the passing traveller with a moment 's chat . On another you may see him as a genteel Southerner , in black , flirting with a boarding-school girl on Cozzen 's piazza . On a third he will hang around the steamboat-landing , under the form of a grotesque old woman picking up chips ; while the chances are two to one that the next time you see him it will be in the guise of a beautiful girl pulling a light skiff in the little bay that lies between the Grange and Spookinsel , right opposite Giez . The last is one of the most agreeable shapes he assumes , and he is partial to it ; but if a singer chances to be in the neighbourhood , the Spook-visiter is certain to make frequent use of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice of the stranger , and make the woods vocal with his music . At night particularly , the echoing cliffs resound with his madrigals ; and that after an unearthly fashion , that has brought the neighbourhood into no good repute with the shoals of retired tradesmen and fortunate speculators , who have taken to building villas along the shore , making a great " Broadway " of the mighty river . He delights especially , however , to hang around the old mansions of the Hudson ; and often , when he pours through some embowered window his soft serenade , the notes will flit around beauty 's casement , and then float off upon the tide so fitfully and Ariel-like , that it is almost impossible to catch either the words or the music of a lay which , like that here given , sets the ordinary laws of composition at defiance . SERENADE . Sleeping ! why now sleeping ? The moon herself looks gay While through thy lattice peeping ; Wilt not her call obey ? Wake , love , each star is keeping For thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now streaming Athwart the dewy spray . Awake , the skies are weeping Because thou art away . But if of me thou'rt dreaming , Sleep , loved one , while you may ; And music 's wings shall hover Softly thy sweet dreams over , Fanning dark thoughts away , While , dearest , ' t is thy lover Who 'll bid each bright one stay The Spook-visiter is perhaps seen more often , however , under the form of a cadet , in which guise , in fact , he generally makes his calls at any agreeable house within a few miles of West Point ; and always when the young gentleman whose appearance he assumes must necessarily be restricted to his quarters . In this shape he has more than once made some well-remembered visits to places in the vicinity on either side of the river , whither a pair of bright eyes attracted him ; while sometimes he has represented the tastes of the corps not quite so reputably by his share in certain riotings at a once noted taproom in the neighbourhood of Buttermilk Falls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one 's character suffers from his freaks in the regions hereabouts ; and , indeed , his reputation is so light , that it has more than once had to bear the blame for little gaucheries , which were , in fact , practised by some of the least civilized of the annual Board of Visiters to the Academy , but which , like everything else that is strange , unaccountable , or of doubtful propriety , is always here laid to The Spook-visiter .

Mr. B  --  , of  --  , in Connecticut , received a letter from his old friend and college chum , the Rev. E  --  T  --  , who had been for some time established as a missionary in one of the islands of the Pacific , soliciting the fulfilment , on the part of his friend , of a most delicate and peculiar office for him . The request of T  --  , who , having been long isolated from the world , had arrived at the age of forty without marrying , was nothing more nor less than that B  --  would choose a wife for him , and prevail upon the lady to come out to her expectant husband by the first opportunity . Strange as it may seem , Mr. B  --  found but little difficulty in complying with the request of his friend . The subject of missions at that time filled the minds of the whole religious community ; and , in some sections of the Union , a wild zeal wrought so powerfully in the breasts of individuals , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sunder every domestic tie , in order " to do their Master 's bidding " in strange and inhospitable lands . Nor was this a mere burst of enthusiasm , that was to pass off with other fashions of the day ; for its fruits are still constantly maturing ; and now , as then , there are not a few instances of young females of respectability and accomplishments educating themselves for the avowed purpose of becoming the wives of missionaries . With these preliminary remarks , I will at once introduce the reader to the subject of the following sketch , with whom I became acquainted in the manner here related . I had been enjoying a week 's shooting at Quogue , on Long Island , when , wishing to return to New York by steamboat through the Sound , I engaged a seat one morning in the stage-coach for Sag Harbour , which sometimes stopped for dinner at mine host 's , Mr. Pierson Howell . In the present instance it was delayed merely long enough to receive my luggage and myself . The only other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen of her long cottage bonnet , I knew to be pretty , from the quizzical look my landlord put on as he shook hands with me at parting after I had taken my seat by her side . The day was warm ; and we had not driven far before , without appearing officious , I had an opportunity of obtaining a glimpse of my companion 's face , while leaning before her to adjust the curtains on her side of the coach . It was beautiful  --  exceedingly beautiful . Not the beauty which arises from regularity of feature or brilliancy of complexion  --  though in the latter it was not deficient ; but that resistless and thoroughly womanish charm which lies in expression solely . It evinced that feminine softness of disposition which is often the farthest removed from weakness of character , though , by the careless observer , it is generally confounded with it ; and which , though sometimes it may mislead one in judging of the temper of the possessor , yet almost invariably , like the ore-blossom upon the soil that is rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionate and noble heart . The reader who would realize the attractions of the countenance before me , need only call up their most winning expression in the features he most loves . I gradually fell into conversation with my companion ; and , stopping at South Hampton to change horses , her first remark upon our again taking our seats , was , that she feared we should not get into Sag Harbour until after dark , when she would be unable to find the ship which was expected to sail in the morning . As I knew that no ships but whalers lay at that time in Sag Harbour , I could not at first possibly conceive what a young and delicate female could have to do aboard of such a vessel ; and then , the idea suggesting itself that she might be the daughter or sister of the captain , who came to bid him farewell for his two years ' cruise , I asked her if she expected to remain on board the ship till she sailed . " Oh , yes , sir , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What ! to the South Sea ? " rejoined I. " You have relations on board , though , I suppose ? " " No , sir , I do n't know any one in the ship ; but I have a letter for the captain , which , I think , will procure me a safe voyage to the  --  Islands . " " The  --  Islands ! Is it possible you have friends in so remote a place as the  --  Islands ? They must be dear friends , too  --  pardon me  --  to carry you , unprotected , so far . " " My hu-us-band is there , " she answered , with some embarrassment , though the growing twilight prevented me from seeing whether the confusion extended from her voice to her countenance . The peculiarity in the young lady 's manner , as she pronounced the word " husband , " piqued my curiosity ; but , as it would have been impertinent to push my inquiries farther , I did not urge the subject , but merely remarked , that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . " Nor am I married yet , " was the reply . " And , indeed , " she continued , with a slight tremour in her voice , " I have never seen the man who is to be my husband . " An expression of unfeigned surprise , of a more lively interest , perhaps  --  for I have said " the maid was fair , " and we had now been some hours tte -- tte  --  escaped me : I scarcely remember what followed ; but , before we had reached the inndoor , the ingenuous girl had given me a full account of herself and her fortunes . She was an orphan child , and had been bred up in great seclusion in a clergyman 's family in Western New York . She was , in a word , the young enthusiast whom the Rev. Mr. B  --  had chosen as a wife for his missionary friend , and prevailed upon to encounter a six months ' voyage through stormy latitudes , for the purpose of connecting herself for life with a man she had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be useless in her situation ; much less did I give vent to the indignation with which her story filled me : her fanatical friends , who permitted a young , a beautiful , and delicate female to take so wild a step , had , perhaps , after all , acted from the best of motives . Indeed , the poor thing herself , though not exactly proud of having been chosen to the station she was about to fill , seemed determined to enter upon it with all the exalted feeling of one who fulfils a high duty , and who is on the certain road to a preferment which most of her sex might envy . It would certainly have been a very equivocal kindness to interpose another view of the subject , and disturb the honest convictions of propriety which could alone have sustained her in a situation so trying . I accompanied Alice Vere  --  for such I learned her name to be  --  to the vessel ; and , after bidding her a kind farewell , I took an opportunity , while passing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain , which might induce him to believe that she was not so friendless as she appeared to be , and secure her whatever attention it was in his power to offer . In the morning , having a few moments to spare before breakfast , I again strolled down to the pier ; but the whaler had hoisted sail with the dawn , and a brisk wind had already carried her out into the Sound : nor was it till years after that I heard the name of Alice Vere , and learned the issue of her voyage ; though the name , and the features , and voice of her who bore it , did , I confess , long haunt me . It was too pretty a name , I thought , to be changed lightly ; and , somehow , when I heard it , I could not , for the life of me , ask that into which it was to be merged for ever . The sequel of her story I learned from a friend , whose vessel , being driven from her course in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islands to water , where he casually heard the fate of the missionary girl . The tender and imaginative temperament of Alice Vere , though perhaps it impelled her to make the sacrifice for which she was schooled by those who called themselves her friends , but badly fitted her for the cold destiny to which she was condemned . The imagination of any woman , isolated upon the great deep for six long months , with nothing to think of but the stranger husband to whose arms she was consigned , could not but be active , whatever her mental discipline might be . But with a girl of fancy and feeling , who had taken a step so irretrievable when surrounded by approving and encouraging friends , what must have been her emotions in the solitude of her own cabin when such an influence  --  such a sustaining atmosphere of opinion  --  was wholy withdrawn . Doubt and fear would at first creep into her mind ; and , when these disheartening guests could no longer be controlled by factitious notions of duty , fancy would throw her fairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a prospect so forbidding . And thus it was with Alice Vere . Anxiety soon yielded to hope ; her future husband and her future home filled her mind with a thousand dreaming fancies . She was no romance reader , and , therefore , could not make a hero of the future partner of her bosom ; but a saint he indeed might be  --  a saint , too , not less in form than in godliness , for the association of physical and moral beauty is almost inseparable in the minds of the young and the inexperienced . She imagined him , too , as one who , though not " looking from Nature up to Nature 's God , "  --  for " God must be first and all in all with him , "  --  would still be one whose mind would look from the Creator to his works , with a soul to appreciate all their excellences . The fancied portrait of her future husband was laid in simple , though impressive , colours ; but the background of the picture was filled with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the early Christians wandered through in Grecian Isles , and skies such as bent over Him who taught beneath them in the golden orient . True , she was to be exiled for ever from the sheltered scenes and quiet fire-side of her youth ; but would she not be content to rove for ever with one only companion , whose soul could fully sympathize with hers in scenes so fresh and so Elysian ? With a mind softened , if not enervated , by these day-dreams , not less than by the bland and voluptuous clime in which they had been for some days sailing , our young enthusiast could scarcely suppress a cry of delight when , upon coming on deck one morning , she found that the ship had cast anchor in the beautiful bay of  --  , where her wildest visions of tropical scenery seemed more than realized . The water around the ship was as clear as the mountain streams of her native country ; and the palm trees and cocoas that bent over it , lifted their slender columns , and waved their tufted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever beheld ; while clouds of tropical birds , of the most dazzling plumage , sailed along the shore , or sported around the vessel , as if wholly regardless of man . A number of the natives had launched their light barks from the shore , filled with bread-fruit , and other acceptable luxuries , to those who have been long at sea . Alice was watching their approach with girlish interest in the novelty of the scene , when a boat from the opposite side of the crescent-shaped harbour made the ship , and , almost before she was aware of its approach , a striking figure , dressed after the clerical fashion of her own country , in a full suit of black , presented himself at the companion-way , and , leaping on deck , instantly hurried toward her . She turned round  --  looked at him intently for a moment  --  made one faltering step toward him , and fainted in his arms . The gentleman laid her carefully upon a flag that chanced to be folded near ; and , still supporting her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of surprise and anxiety , which soon yielded to complete bewilderment as she addressed him upon coming to herself . " Thank God ! " she exclaimed , gradually reviving ; " thank God ! thank God !  --  how can I ever have deserved this ? " and , bending her face forward , she impressed a reverential kiss upon his hand , and then covered her face in confusion . My readers have all read of love at first sight , and some , perhaps , have heard of instances of it among their acquaintance . The skeptics to the doctrine , however , I imagine , far outnumber those who really believe in it . It is the latter , therefore , whom I will beg to recollect all the circumstances which preceded this singular scene ; when they can not deem it unnatural that the wrought-up feelings of an ardent and sensitive girl should thus burst forth upon first meeting , in her affianced husband , her appointed friend and protector in a strange land , him that religion and duty taught her that she must love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness for long , long months of anxious solitude had pictured . I ought to add , however , that the interchance of several letters between Miss Vere and her betrothed before leaving her native shores , had , while partially removing the awkwardness of their first meeting , supplied perhaps that " food for young thoughts " which , in a nature artless and enthusiastic as hers , might engender the most confiding affections even for an object she had never seen . " And is this beautiful island to be our home ? Are these my husband 's people around us ? Oh ! how I shall love everything that belongs to this fair land ! But why do you not speak to your poor wanderer ? Alas ! alas ! can I ever deserve all these blessings ? " The embarrassment of the gentleman seemed only to increase as the agitated girl thus poured out her feelings . He begged her to be calm , and seemed most nervously solicitous to restrain her expressions ; and the captain approaching at that moment , he made a hurried and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm from her waist as she regained her feet , moved off to seek the mate in another part of the vessel . " Ah ! Mr. Supercargo , I mistrusted we should find you at this island ! " exclaimed the mate , turning round and shaking hands with him as the gentleman touched his shoulder upon joining this officer near the capstan . " All well at home , Mr F  --  . Here 's a letter from your wife . " The other tore open the letter , and devoured it with evident delight ; and then , shaking hands again with the officer , exclaimed , " Thank you , thank you ; all are well at home , as you tell me . But how in the world came that beautiful insane creature in your vessel ? " " A mad woman ! The devil a bit of a mad woman or any other woman have we on board , except Mrs. T  --  , the wife of Parson T  --  that is to be . " " The wife of Mr. T  --  ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's a gal from York State we are carrying out to be spliced to old Dead-eyes . " The gentlemanlike supercargo seemed struck with concern ; in fact , the true state of the case flashed upon his mind in a moment . The deep mourning which he wore out of respect for one of his employers , whose ship he was that day to visit , had evidently caused him to be mistaken for a clergyman ; and the excited imagination of the lonely girl had prompted her to see in him the future guardian of her friendless condition . Nothing , however , could be done : an attempt at explanation would but betray her secret to the coarse natures by which she was surrounded . Her lot in life , too , was cast ; his sympathy could avail her nothing , and a few days ' voyage would consign her to the care of him who might legitimately received the proofs of tenderness which he had so innocently elicited in his own behalf . He called for his boat , and , passing slowly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shore . Alice Vere had , in the meantime , retired to the cabin , where she expected her lover  --  it was the first time she had even thought the word  --  to join her . Her own feelings had so crowded upon her mind during the brief interview , that they had prevented her from observing his ; and the luxury of emotion in which she now indulged , and in which she thought there was not one consideration human or divine to make it wrong for her to indulge , prevented her from observing the lapse of time . Simple and single-hearted , with a nature whose affluent tenderness piety could regulate and delicacy could temper , though neither could repress , she poured the flood of her pent-up feelings in what seemed their heaven-appointed channel ; in a word , she was gone an age in love while numbering the minutes of her acquaintance with her lover . His noble and manly figure , his alert and elastic step in approaching her , and the kindly look of feeling and intelligence his features wore , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little dreamed was prompted by concern for another , of whom he was about to ask her ; nay , even the hurried tones of his agitated , but still most musical , voice , all , all were stamped upon her heart as indelibly as if their impress had been the work of years . The water , rippling along the vessel 's side , first roused her from this delicious revery , and the mate , who was a rough , but kind-hearted , seaman , at that moment came below to make an entry in his log . " Well , Miss , " he cried , " with this breeze , we 'll soon bring up at the parson 's door ; and right glad to be rid of us you 'll be , I guess , when we get there . Only thirty-six hours more , and you 'll be home . " " This island , then , is not Mr. T  --  ' s residence ? " " This ?  --  Oh , no . There used to be a Britisher here , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And does Mr. T  --  have to go thus from island to island in the performance of his duty ? or did he only come so far from his people to meet me ? " she asked , with some embarrassment . " Come ! " exclaimed the seaman , not a little puzzled ; " why , law bless your soul , Parson T  --  has not been here , at least that I know on . " " Surely he 's now on board , " cried Alice , alarmed , yet hardly knowing why : " surely I saw him speaking to you on deck ? " " To me , Missus ! I never cared to exchange two words with old Dead-eyes  --  axing your pardon  --  since I knowed him . Speaking to me ! Why , that  --  that was  --  why  --  my eyes ! you have not taken young Washington F  --  ' s handsome figure for old Ebenezer T  --  ' s mouldy carcass ? " The rude , but not unfriendly , mate had hardly uttered the sentence before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poles , for the use he had made of his tongue . Alice fell lifeless upon the cabin-floor . The seaman shouted for assistance ; and then , as he and the better-bred captain , who , as the father of a large and estimable family , was a more fitting nurse for the forlorn maiden , applied one restorative after another , she recovered animation at intervals . Fit succeeded fit , however ; and then , as the wind rose , and a brewing tempest called all hands on deck , the captain could only place her kindly in her berth , in the hope that the new excitement at hand might possibly be of service to his patient . The ship was driven widely out of her course . Alice was long indifferent to everything around ; but , as the storm lasted for several days , and finally threatened to destroy the stout craft in which she sailed , the near prospect of the death for which she had but now been longing , called all her religious feelings into action . She felt that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not allow her to wish for a sudden and violent death , though the peace of the grave was what she most desired . She prayed , then , not for life , but for an escape from its horrors ; alike from those which raged in the angry elements around her , and those which warred so fearfully in her own bosom . Weeks elapsed before the vessel reached the haven , of which she had once been within a few hours ' sail . The missionary girl had apparently recovered from all bodily indisposition , and her features were again as calm as ever ; but they wore the calmness of rigidity , not of peace . It was a sacrifice of herself to Heaven which she had meditated originally . " And why , " exclaimed she , mentally  --  " why should I shrink from the offering now , when Providence has enabled me to make it richer and more abundant  --  to make my soul 's triumph more complete as its trial is more bitter and severe ? " Still , when the isle of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she first looked upon the shore , and thought of the fate that there awaited her . Woman 's heart is a strange , a wayward thing . In many a bosom its strongest chords are never touched by the hand to which it is yielded . It is often bestowed with faint consent on him who seeks it  --  bestowed in utter ignorance of the power of loving  --  the wealth of tenderness it hoards within itself . " Circumstance , blind contact , and the strong necessity of loving , " will afterward mould it to its fate , and prevent any repining at its choice ; but when once its hidden strings have vibrated , and given out their full music  --  when once its inmost treasures have been disclosed to its owner , counted over , and yielded up with a full knowledge of their worth , to another  --  when " the pearl of the soul " has been once lavished in the mantling cup of affection , it revolts from all feebler preferences , and is true , even in death , to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to claim his bride . He was a plain and worthy man , with nothing to distinguish him from the members of his profession in our country , who mistake the promptings of zeal for the inspiration of a special calling , and who , without minds matured by experience or enlightened by education , leave the plough or the shop-board to become the instructors of those who , with feelings as sincere as their own , and understandings far more exercised in knowledge of good and evil , are expected to bow to their narrow teachings , and to receive them , not as humble soldiers of the Cross , needing guidance like themselves , but as the captains and leaders of the church militant , armed in full panoply  --  a living bulwark against its foes . Alice Vere had but little experience in society ; but the quickening power of love had lately called all her dormant perceptions of taste and feeling into play , and a very brief interview sufficed for her to read the character of her destined husband . She felt that she could never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have done the humblest brother of her faith ; and had she never known what love was , her regard would perhaps not have been withholden in time ; for every woman loves the father of her children , if he be not essentially ungenial . But if there be an agonizing thought to a girl of delicacy and sensibility , it is the idea of becoming a bride under such circumstances as surrounded poor Alice Vere  --  the thought that her heart shall beat against the bosom of a stranger , when its every pulse throbs for another . Still , a high , imperious duty , as she believed , constrained her , and she prepared to resign herself to her fate . The nuptial day arrived . It had been arranged that the master of the vessel , on board of which Alice , wistfully lingering , had begged to remain , should perform the ceremony , ( agreeably to the laws of the state of New York , by which marriage is merely a civil contract , requiring only a formal declaration of the parties before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony by a prayer , which , as giving solemnity to the occasion , was perhaps most proper in itself ; but it was painfully long , and seemed to refer to almost everything else but the immediate subject of interest . At length the bride , whose languid limbs refused to sustain her so long in a standing position , sank into a seat , and the missionary , glancing a look of reproval at her , abruptly concluded his harangue . The worthy seaman was more expeditious in getting through with his share of the office . He merely asked the parties severally if they acknowledged each other as man and wife . The missionary made his response in the affirmative with a slow and grave distinctness ; but Alice faltered in her reply . A tumult of feelings seemed oppressing her senses for a moment ; she looked to the untamed forest , whose boughs waved unfettered on the shore , to the broad main that spread its free waves around her , and the wild bird that sported over its bosom : " Then she turn 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And placed her hand in his , and raised her eye One moment upward , whence her strength did come . The certificates , which had been previously drawn up , being then signed and witnessed , the missionary concluded with another homily ; and the crew , who had been allowed to collect upon the quarter-deck during the ceremonial , dispersed over the vessel . It was now sunset ; and , as a heavy cloud , which threatened rain , brooded over the island , the captain politely insisted that Mr. T  --  should not think of returning to the shore , but take possession of his own private cabin . The rain soon after beginning to fall in torrents , drove those on deck below . Here the mates claimed the privilege of having a jorum of punch to drink the health of the bride ; and , the captain being willing to unite with them , Alice was compelled to retire to the new quarters which had been just provided for her ; while the festive seamen insisted upon keeping their clerical guest for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mock the tempest without , when a sudden squall struck the vessel , carrying her over , even as she lay at anchor under bare poles , upon her beam-ends . The seamen , followed by the missionary , rushed to the deck , where the glare of the lightning , as they looked to windward , revealed to them a female figure standing upon the taffrail , with arms outstretched toward a huge wave that lifted its over-arching crest above her , and threatened to ingulf the vessel . A cry of horror escaped the revellers  --  the bridegroom breathed a prayer as he clung to the rigging for safety ; and then , as the descending sea righted the vessel , a suffocating moan was heard above the surge that swept the body of Alice Vere like a drift of foam across her decks . The morning came at last , the sun rose serenely , the bright waves rippled joyously beneath the stern of the vessel , and their reflected light , playing through the sloping windows of the cabin , glanced upon the unpressed couch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made her way to the deck in the midst of the tempest ; yet none have ever whispered the sin of self-destruction against the lovely , the lonely , the ill-fated Alice Vere . THE END . Back matter
