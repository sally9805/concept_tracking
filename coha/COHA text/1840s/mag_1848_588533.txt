txt AT this day the enthusiasm with which the news was received throughout the West , can not be duly appreciated . Dr. McMurtrie , whose " Sketches of Louisville " were published in 1819 , was a witness of those occurrences , and his description of them indicates the feelings of the community by which he was surrounded . " Next to Fulton , " he says , " the western country owes a vast debt of gratitude to Captain Henry M. Shreve . It is to his exertions , his examples , and let me add , to his integrity and patriotic purity of principles , that it is indebted for the present flourishing state of its navigation . * * * The offer of the Livingston Company was rejected with scorn and indignation , and the affair left to justice , whose sword , at one blow , severed the links of that chain which had enthralled the commerce of the western waters . Had Captain Shrove been weak enough to have accepted of this offer , the result is obvious . No one would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote the best interests of his country , by adding the wings of commerce to the feet of agriculture , because ruin would have been the inevitable consequence ; the carrying business would have remained in the hands of the company , which would have continued just as many and no more boats in the trade than were sufficient to keep up the price of freight ; and , consequently , instead of paying two and a half cents per pound for every article of import , the merchant , and ultimately the c#sumer , ( for on his shoulders such things always bear at last , ) would have been compelled to pay six , seven or eight , as best suited the interests*or convenience of the company . " The simple fact , that suit was not brought under the patent laws of the United States , is , of itself , a tribute of praise to the ingenuity or inventive powers of Captain Shreve . The " Washington " was not built under French 's patent , as was the " Enterprize , " but in accordance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy demonstrates that the originality of his improvements was universally conceded at that time . The immediate effect of the contest was , to give to the " Washincr preference over all other steamers in the trade , as well as the abandonment of all further efforts to use Ful. ton 's engine on the Mississippi . Indeed , the debt due from the west to Fulton 's memory , although vast and gratefully acknowledged , arises from the direction he gave to the genius of others , and not from the usefulness or intrinsic value of his engine . The experience of four years ' demonstrated that neither Fulton 's patent , nor that of French , could ever be made of practical benefit to western commerce . In 1818 , Captain Shreve had matured in his own mind still further Improvements ; and , consequently , he built the steamboat " Ohio , " of 450 tons burthen , adding the other inventions his genius suggested . The principal change was in using double flues , and in supplying the boilers through the " aft stands , " thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cxvii. 4 // 212 Popular Portraits with Pen and Pencil . " stands " from being burnt out every few months . After running the " Ohio " about four years , and the " United States " about one year , he undertook another series of improvements , not merely on the engine but on the model of the boats . The steamers then in use were generally constructed like sea-vessels , and drew too much water for river navigation . Besides , they could not accommodate the crowds of passengers , arising from the increased business of the Mississippi Valley , and rapid immigration westward , without ceasing to carry freight . In 1824 he finished his new steamboat , named " George Washington , " constructed on the model now in common use  --  the first built with the upper cabin , or hurricane deck . Some of his partners objected to the plan , on the ground that the boat would be " top-heavy , " and refused their consent to the experiment , until he proved to them , by mathematical calculations , that the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers , would be less than that of the deck loads carried in the common " two-deckers " previously in use . He had introduced , some years before , the double engine which was generally connected with a stern wheel . Preference had been given to the stern wheel , because the boat was more easily managed than with side wheels attached to , and moved by a single crank . The numerous dangers in those rivers , rendered it necessary that the boats should be completely under the control of the pIlot , and more than the rudder was required for that purpose . Captain Shreve , therefore , constructed the " George Washington " with side wheels , each of which was to be worked by a separate engine , thus enabling the pilot and engineer to make sudden turns in the river , or to manage the largest steamers as easily as a skiff with oars . This suggestion was the occasion of general ridicule , and his associates gave a very reluctant consent to its being tested . Indeed , to one not familiar with steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur . The " George Washington , " however , soon became the model for all western steamboats , and the prediction of Captain Shreve was verified . We do not mean that no improvements have since been made on the engine or boats , but simply that those now in universal use in the Mississippi Valley , contain all of the various inventions of Captain Shreve , as well as those made since . It is possible that , simultaneously with many of his improvements , other persons were , in different parts of the United States or in Europe , working out the same results ; but if so , it was in this case as in that of Newton and Leibnitz ; none the less praise is due to his genius . His numerous inventions were the suggestions of his own genius , enlightened by daily and practical experience in steam navigation , and unaided by the valuable hints which scientific friends gave to his compeers . The difficulties in the path of western commerce were*still formidable ; for the innumerable snags , sawyers , sunken roots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tributaries , caused the most serious disasters , and greatly protracted the voyages from city to city . At that period , however , the attention of Congress began to be turned to the subject , principally through the exertions of western members and of the Hon. John C. Calhoun , then Secretary of War . Knowing the many obstacles to military success during the operations of Gen. Jackson in the southwest , and of Gen. Harrison in the northwest , throughout the war of 1812- ' 15 , for lack of suitable means of transporting supplies to distant points , Mr. Calhoun deemed it of vast moment that all constitutional means should be used to render the western rivers available for military purposes . He had seen a new element of power successfully introduced // into the ordinary routine of river trade , and his comprehensive and sagacious intellect could not overlook its importance . Instead of a delay of three months in forwarding supplies from Pittsburg for the defence o New-Orleans , steam could effect the object in ten or twelve days , if all obstructions were removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limits of constitutional power over the subject , he bent his energies to the legitimate improvement , by the Federal Government , of the national highways of " commerce among the several states . " Repeated acts of Congress from the formation of the Federal Constitution , had declared that the Ohio and Mississippi were under Federal jurisdiction-that the latter river was the " mare nostrum " of the republic , open equally to all of its citizens . In 1824 , Congress appropriated $75,000 for their improvement , and the duty of expending that sum judiciously , was devolved on the Secretary of War . Judging correctly that the experience of western navigators was worth more than all studied theories from men unacquainted practically with the obstacles to be overcome , he promptly caused the following circular to be issued to the steamboat captains of the west : " ENGINEER DEPARTMENT , WASHINGTON , June 1 , 1824 . " SIR : - The Act of Congress of the 24th of May , I 824 , having made an appropriation for the improvement of the Mississippi , by removing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , commonly called planters , sawyers , or snags , the Secretary of War is desirous of availing himself of your skill and experience in the navigation of the river , and requests that you will present such suggestions as may occur to you , as to the best means of carrying into effect the intentions of Congress . He particularly desires your opinion , whether the river could be freed , advantageously , by dragging the trees or snags from their bed , and what would be the best mode and time of doing so ; or whether it would he practicable to saw them off at a depth so low as not to endanger the navigation of the river at the lowest water ; and what would be the best mode and season of the year for effecting the same ; what would be the effect of passing heavy rafts of timber down the river ; and what would be the best form or mode of coustructing the rafts for the purpose of removing the impediments to the navigation . Any suggestions on these or any other points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates of the probable cost , will be acceptably received by this department ; the communications to be addressed to the Secretary of War , and endorsed Engineer Service . ' " ALEXANDER MACOMB , Maj. Gen. , Chief Engineer . " The replies to that circular embodied a large amount of useful information and many valuable suggestions . And surely no class of men were more likely to be observant of the evils to be remedied , n*r to reflect with much greater care upon the general subject itself , than those who were daily risking their lives and property on those waters . The magic effect of steam and rapidly increasing population of the west , were advancing commerce with unexpected strides , and giving more importance to the dangers with which it was threatened . The wildest imagination had not predicted the rising greatness of the Mississippi Valley , nor foretold its rapid advance in numbers , wealth and refinement-state springing up after state , " a mighty train . " But it was not to the private trade alone of that vast region , that the statesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the event of an Indian or other war , its triumphant conclusion might depend *n the celerity and certainty with which men and means could be despatched to the frontier . The rivers // 244 Popular Portraits with Pen and Pencil . of the west furnished channels of intercommunication , and for military operatiofl5* tot less than 15,000 miles in extent . From the western districts of Pennsylvania and Virginia to the farthest verge of ' American civilization , the new states could precipitate , whenever needed , along those rivers , with the rapidity of steam , hundreds of thousands of gallant and hardy volunteers , and supplies for ten times that force , to any point from the Atlantic to the remote wilderness , or from the lakes to the gulf . Hence , the removal of all dangerous obstructions from those great military and commercial highways was an important element of national strength and security . This has been seen and felt since the commencement of the Mexican war . When the exciting news of Arista 's advance upon General Taylor was borne by hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of the patriotic and brave hurried down those highways to beat back the foe . In about one month after the battle of Palo Alto , a western city , nearly two thousand miles from the scene of conflict , reported at the Brazos a volunteer regiment of her citizens , well disciplined and ready for action . A single snag might have proved fatal to that gallant band , and interrupted a whole campaign . In 1824 , the Mississippi was strewed with snags and sawyers . For untold centuries its fierce current had been uprooting from its alluvial banks and bottom lands , trees of giant growth , and sweeping them onward towards the gulf , until striking a bar , or caught in a bend , they were stayed in their course , forming for more than twelve hundred miles a leafless forest , whose strong and pointed branches , just peering above the muddy waters , threatened instant destruction even to the most skilful navigator , and defied human genius to track a tortuous course in safety through such a pathless waste . If now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snag can strike down at a blow a steamer of one thousand tons burthen , and instantly overwhelm her rich freight of men and merchandize in hopeless destruction , what must have been the perils in the navigator 's path , before one of those dread obstacles had been disturbed in its bed l From the tirchives of the War Department it may be seen , that on the 5th of July , 1824 , Captain Shreve wrote an interesting reply to the circular of May preceding , and made many important suggestions to the government . In that letter he stated , without hesitation , that " the river may be entirely freed from such obstructions , " and mentioned several modes of effecting the object . He offered to submit to the inspection of the department , if desired , the model of a machine invented by him for that purpose in 1821 ; but no request therefore was made . The Secretary of War advertised that a premium of one thousand dollars would be awarded for the best plan of ' removing snags , sawyers , &amp;c . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaend a higher estimate on the value of his invention . The award was made in favor of Mr. John Bruce , of Kentucky , and a contract concluded with him , by which he agreed , for sixty-five thousand dollars , to remove all of those obstructions from the channel of the Ohio river for its entire length , and of the Mississippi from the mouth of the Missouri to the Balize . Immediately he commenced building one of his premium machines at Pittsburg ; but as he soon perceived that it could never be made to work successfully , he abandoned it before completion , determined to rely on simpler means . He began operations , under the superintendence of Major Babcock , of the Military Engineers , using ordinary fiat boats , levers , chains and saws , worked by manual labor . After nearly two years had elapsed , he had removed only a portion of the logs and roots in the channel of the Ohio , // and had failed to master a single snag in the Mississippi . As the appropriation was nearly exhausted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West complained so loudly , that Major Babcock was superseded and Judge Samuel McKee , of Kentucky , appointed his successor . The new superintendent died in a few months after his appointment . Whilst Mr. Barbour , then Secretary of War , was hesitating whom to select for so difficult a post , he applied to Mr. Calhoun , his predecessor , for the necessary information . The latter remembering the valuable suggestions origin ally made by Captain Shreve , with whom he had no personal acquaintance , and perceiving that they had stood the test of subsequent experience , recommended that his services be secured , if practicable . Accordingly , the commission of Superintendent was forwarded to Captain Shreve , on the 10th of December , 1826 , and accepted by him on the 2d of January following . Pursuant to instructions , be examined the whole subject , and reported that it was impracticable for Mr. Bruce to comply with his contract ; that the apparatus then in use was not suitable to the enterprise , and that a new plan must be adopted . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most economical plan , and by the employment of such men and means as the nearly exhausted appropriation would permit . During that season , he used a twin-boat , with wheel and windlass worked by manual labor . The additional experience thus gained convinced him more fully that a mightier power than human strength applied to simple machines , was necessary to overcome the formidable obstacles encountered ; and he , therefore , urged the building of a steam vessel on the model invented by himself assuring the department of its efficiency and necessity . The commerce of the West was then valued at nearly $50,000,000 , and the losses by snags for the five previous years amounted to $1,045,000 . The young West , with all its giant energies , could hardly bear up under so heavy a burthen on its enterprise . Just emerging from a wilderness state and preparing for an active career , it beheld with dismay its growing commerce strewed with the wrecks of many a hard-earned fortune ; boat after boat , with valuable cargoes and brave crews , going down forever beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remedy that increasing evil , seemed entirely hopeless . Human ingenuity , it was thought , had been completely exhausted in its efforts to form some combination of mechanical powers by which those huge snags could be torn from their beds and safety given to navigation . As the currents changed , old sand bars were swept away and others formed . The river , diverted into ever-shifting channels , caused new snags to rise from its alluvial bed as the sand was washed off ; and the practised pilot , who , on descending , had passed over an unruffled surface at some well-known point , was often , on his return , startled from his fancied security by 6sudden crash , which instantly proved fatal to his hopes . The turbid waters concealed all objects below the surface ; the vast quantity of sand borne along rendered an accident irremediable ; those who fell into the stream were never again seen ; and the boat which went down , was soon so deeply imbedded , ( the nucleus of a new bar , ) that no power could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are truly formidable , and annually prove destructive to property valued at millions of dollars , there are but few to be seen , equalling in size those common to every bend in 1827 . Many of them measured from three to six feet in diameter , and were imbedded in the channels to the depth of ten or fourteen feet . They were in every bend , along every island chute , skirting the entire shore , and peering through every bar . Hence , it is not strange that the onginal // proposition of Capt . Shreve , to overcome so stupendous an evil , was received with doubts and misgivings . Met by incredulity on all sides , he tested his invention on a small scale , at his private expense , and thus knew that he was urging no absurd experiment . His letters show the confidence of true genius-full of hope and enthusiasm . He promised repeatedly that , if authorized to incur the expense , he would build a machine-boat , to be worked by steam , that would break off the snags , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the channels , or uproot them for the entire length of the Mississippi . When , after great importunity , he obtained the desired authority , it was so restricted with conditions , suggestions and fears , that a failure of his plans would have devolved the whole responsibility of the experiment and its *xpense on himself . But opposition came not from Washington alone ; many western boatmen believed the plan absurd-denied that a steamvessel could tear up or break off the snags without being dashed to pieces or sunk in the attempt  --  and therefore , remonstrated against the experiment . One of those remonstrances , now on file in the War Department , uses the following strong language : " It is said the present Superintendent ( Capt . Shreve ) has it in contemplation to construct a large and powerful steamboat , for the purpose of cutting out the snags , and pulling them out by the force of steam . Now , those projects are only calculated to get through the appropriation , without anything like the object contemplated . All machinery , whatever , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons who are well-acquainted with the Mississippi river navigation , as a useless expenditure of time and money . " This was the voice *of4espair . Fortunately , however , there were some western boatmen of more faith ; and who , having witnessed the triumphs of many of his inventions , believed , with Gen. Jackson* that " he was a man who would do whatever he undertook . " They petitioned to have his request granted . The consent of the Department was dated June 27th , 1828 , and the first snag-boat , the Heliopolis , was ready for operations by the 22d of July , 1829 . This machine-boat has twin hulls , about eleven feet apart , firmly connected together " abaft midships , " and so constructed that a blow on the snag-beam bears equally on every part and timber of the vessel . The snag-beam connects the twin-hulls at their bows-is placed at the water-line , wedgeshaped , and in the exact centre of percussion , so that a blow with it produces no Jar whatever , and consequently does not , as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with the boilers or engines . In addition to that simple contrivance , there is an ingenious conibination of the pulley , windlass , wheel and axle , levers , &amp;c. , for elevating loose snags , sunken logs and roots , masses of rocks , and similar impediments . When in operation , the machine-boat moves " under a full head of steam , " striking the snag with the whole momentum of the moving mass , a sudden blow , equal in violence to three or four thousand tons . If the snag be firmly imbedded , it is instantly broken at the point of leverage-generally a distance below the bed of the river equal to the diameter of the snag . But if it be too loose to offer the necessary resistance , the boat passes on , turning it over , and at the same time trimming off all of the limbs on the under side . A return passage of the boat trims the other side of the snag , and forces a chain beneath it ; and in about five minutes it is lodged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the snag-machinery are worked by the same steam engines . On the 19th of August , 1829 , the Heliopolis entered the Mississippi , // and commenced operations at Plum Point  --  the spot where the snags formed an almost impassable barrier . With great doubt resting on the minds of all , save the inventor , she dashed into that river-forest , breaking by single blows snag after snag , or uprooting them in rapid succession . In a few hours , every doubt was dispelled  --  the triumph was complete . Human genius had devised a mode of wrestling *iccessfully with the most formidable difficulties , and of breaking through the last and greatest barriers to western commerce . So perfect was that machine , in all its parts , that to this day , not the slightest improvement or alteration has been made on it . It has saved to the Federal Government and to individuals , untold millions of dollars , and given an impetus to commerce which no mind can estimate . Official reports to Congress , state that it has reduced the voyage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countless number of lives , and property to an incalculable amount ; effected a salutary change which , without its agency , ages might not have accomplished ; and proved indispensable to the governmwt in the discharge of its duties to itself and the valley of the Mississippi . Extravagant as such statements may appear , they still fall below sober reality . At this time , there are 1190 steamers , with an aggregate tonnage of 10,252,160 tons afloat on the western waters , which , with the other river craft , bear annually to and from market cargoes estimated at *432,651 , 240 in value . Without the snag-boat , that vast amount of property would have been endangered at every point *ilong those great rivers ; nearly ten millions of people have been compelled to struggle against all the evils incident to difficult transportation and intercourse ; many of the operations of the government , both in war and peace , greatly retarded and exposed to ever-recurring hazards ; the prosperity of half the Union checked in its rapid progress , and the national imports and exports lessened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources . One instance will suffice for illustration  --  the removal of the Red River Raft . The government engineers , after minute surveys , reported it to be nearly impracticable to remove that formidable barrier to navigation , and that the lowest estimate could not be less than two or three millions of dollars . They advised , therefore , that the work should be abandoned . Gen. C ass , then at the head of ' the War Department , properly appreciating the importance of the enterprise , and unwilling that it should be suddenly stopped without , at least , one serious effort , consulted Captain Shreve on the subject . rrhe answers of the latter were satisfactory , and he was ordered to undertake the more than Herculean task . The resul is thus stated in official reports to Congress : " The great raft of the Red River , consisting of an accumulation of rees , logs and drift-wood of every description , firmly imbedded in its channel for more than one hundred and sixty miles , was removed , and the navigation of that river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly twelve hundred miles . This work alone , in consequence of the immense quantity of public land reclaimed in the raft region , and rendered fit for cultivation ; - the enhanced value of other lands on the upper part of the river , and the reduced cost in the transportation of supplies to Fort Towson and to the Indians located in that neighborhood , has been worth millions to the government . " * * * * " That steam constitutes the only water communication with a considerable portion of the north-western part of the states of Louisiana , Arkansas , the north-eastern frontier of Mexico , *Texas , and the south-western territory of Missouri , to which the government is now removing // through which it flows , military posts will have to be maintained for ages , to keep the Indians in check , and to insure harmony among them , as well as to preserve a good understanding with Mexico . In the transportation of supplies and munitions of war to Fort Towson , the government has encountered difficulties almost insurmountable , and at one time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their regular provisions and clothing during a whole season , owing to the impossibility of passing the raft , " &amp;c . And this is only one instance , affecting a comparatively inconsiderable stream , by which , as is officially stated , eighty-five thousand dollars were saved to the government in one season , by the reduced cost of transportation . That raft has since re-formed for a few miles , as Captain Shreve predicted would be the case , unless a snag-boat should be kept operating there . Yet how vast that single undertaking , and how successful ! The whole cost , instead of being two or three millions , was about three hundred thousand dollars . It has also been officially reported , that through the use of sn ag*oats , so long as they were kept in operation , an accident from collision with snags rarely occurred . From causes already mentioned , they are indispensable to the safe navigation of western rivers . During the last two years , since they have been laid up for lack of suitable appropriations , the city of St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at more than one million , and the government several hundred thousand dollars . The success of the snag-machine suggested to their inventor the construction of a marine battering-ram for harbor defence . At the request of Gen. Jackson , he filed in the Navy Department an accurate description of this proposed military engine ; but he was prevented by other pressing duties from so far complying with the old hero 's wishes as to construct one for positive experiment . To those familiar with the subject , there can be no doubt that such a machine would answer the object in view . In twenty minutes it could sink the largest ship in the British navy , and be ready to operate against a second . As designed by the inventor , the machinery and propelling power would not be exposed to the enemy 's guns , nor could a point blank shot strike her . The descriptive letters were filed in 1829 ; and letters patent since obtained for such a machine by a distinguished naval officer , indicate that another person has freely used the hints and plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporter of General Jackson for the Presidency , from the time when he was first named in connexion with that office , Captain Shreve received his first appointment as Superintendent of Western River Improvements from John Q. Adams . He was continued in the same office to 1841 , enjoying the unbounded confidence of Presidents Jackson and Van Buren . To the surprise of the people of the west , he was among the earliest victims of the political revolution of 1840 . He was officially informed , by a letter , dated at Washington , September 11th , 1841 , that he had been removed , arid was instructed to transfer the public property under his charge to his successor . The same letter , which is among the strangest documents of that strange period , closes with the following remarks : " In concluding this communication , which finally dissolves your connexion with the Government as an Agent of this Department , I take the occasion to say , that the zeal you have manifested for the public interests , the ability you have displayed in conducting your operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of years , you have executed the various and important trusts committed to your charge , entitle your conduct , ( so far as is known to this Department , ) not only to an avowal of satisfaction , but also to an expression of high approbation . " // tioners , at the moment of his decapitation , is no slight evidence of his eminent abilities and services . Since that time , he has resided on his plantation , near St. Louis , devoting his attention to improvements in agriculture , with the same zeal and liberality always manifested by him for western commerce . Thus , after the lapse of thirty-four years literally spent on the waters , he returned to the quiet pursuits in which his early youth was employed , enjoying the pleasures of uninterrupted social happiness , and commanding the esteem and affection of a wide circle of friends . He commenced his career as a democrat , and still cherishes with deep enthusiasm the liberal faith of his party , ever ready to aid the cause with commendable zeal and frankness ; occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not once more attest the sincerity of his patriotism , by mingling in the stirring scenes of the battle-field , as on the 8th of January , 1815 , under the hero of New-Orleans . This meagre sketch of his eventful career indicates clearly his moral and intellectual character . No man of mere ordinary powers of observation or inventive genius , unsustained by more than common faith in man 's high destiny , or by an unusual degree of moral heroism , would have persevered , despite the ridicule and incredulity of contemporaries , in adding to the steam engine improvement after improvement , and in making new applications of its mighty energies to useful purposes . In the broadest and best sense of the term has his career been eminently democratic-devoted to the successful mitigation of the severity of human toil , and the development of the natural resources of his country . He has contributed more than often falls to the lot of one man , to the progress and blessings of his age , and to the rapid growth of new states in the far-off west . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has been often remarked , seldom enure to the possessor 's immediate advantage . As in an innumerable number of other instances , so in this ,  --  the world has prospered through the agency of one who has been strangely neglected , and almost unknown to fame . Notwithstanding no mind can compute the true value of his many inventions , he never applied , except in one instance , for letters patent to secure to himself the deserved fruits of his genius . He succeeded in effecting even what Fulton failed to accomplish ; and if he had turned his inventive powers to his private purposes , could have amassed enormous wealth . But , when proffered boundless treasures by the Livingston and Fulmon Company , he spurned the tempting bribe , as its acceptance involved a sacrifice of public interests for his personal benefit . If it be true , that the unknown inventor of the plough is more worthy of immortal honor than the proudest of conquerors , what measure of public gratitude is due him who , by his gifted intellect and untiring perseverance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent through them the life-blood of commerce , to quicken the whole system , throughout its vast and varied extent , into vigorous and healthful action l The pioneers in every cause , social or moral , physical or intellectualthe men who make the first essays for truth and right , for human elevation and progress , too often fall martyrs to the very zeal and daring without which success could not be won . It is not given to all to see far into the future  --  to prepare the way for coming events , or even to devise suitable remedies for existing evils . The gifted few encounter at every step the ridicule and prejudice of the short-sighted , and resistance from the timid and despairing . Hence , success in any enterprise , looking to untried reforms , whether in politics or the ordinary pursuits of human industry , depends , not alone on the sagacity of the reformer , but also on his unfaltering self-reliance , which no impediments can shake nor opposition overcome* // Such were the men who opened the western wilderness to civilization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mould to be broken in the first rude shock . The few who yet linger on the stage of i*ction , look back with joyful hearts along the dangerous paths they have trodden , and forward , with a sublime faith to the coming destiny of the republic . If the statesmen who have urged forward this confederacy in its career of prosperity and ever-expanding power , whilst surrounded by men of little faith , deserve the meed of a nation 's grateful remembrance , the hand of neglect should not be laid coldly upon the benefactors of humble toil , who , in a less prominent , but not less useful sphere , have , perseveringly , and with generous self-sacrifice , removed , one after another , many of the most grievous burthens , which for ages weighed down the struggling and comfortless sons of labor , in their unremitted efforts for a scanty subsistence . Those who have summoned the elements to minister to the varied wants of our race-who have substituted the useful metals and expansive force of steam for human muscles , and their unrelaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hands to spin and weave , dive and swim , draw and run , for the humblest of our kind-who have harnessed to our cars horses of iron and fire , and put wheels to our ships , so that mountain and valley , wind and tide , might no longer resist them in their course-who have made the subtlest of fluids convey , with lightning-speed , * our thoughts and wishes to remote friends and kindred-who , in brief , have subjected nature to the dominion of man , and made him " master of its laws , and lord of its hidden energies , " elevating him to a loftier sphere , in which his intelligence alone governs his wants , and supplies their ceaseless demands ,  --  those men are general benefactors in this working-day world , playing no unimportant part in democratizing the age , and hastening the era of equality and freedom . It is not strange , then , that complaints are heard when the fruits of their labors are filched from them-when they are turned empty away from that public table which their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many who have thus suffered , is the subject of this notice . For nearly twenty years government has used his private property without remuneration . At nine different times and in various forms , his claim has been acknowledged and encouraging promises made . Still he refrains from enforcing his rights , at the injury of that commerce with which his name is intimately identified-preferring to wait for even tardy justice at the hands of the government he so long and faithfully served . The plea of necessitythat as his genius alone has devised a remedy for evils of many centuries ' growth , so the government could not avoid the use thereof-would be valid , if coupled with a faithful observance of the constitutional obligation : " nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation . " It matters not in what form that private property exists-whether in houses or lands , copyrights or patents , ships or merchandise ; a government founded to secure to each of its citizens the full enjoyment of his legitimate rights , should never trample them and the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrongs its own children can not escape reproach . Its great duty is to dispense justice freely , and without delay , to all  --  to provide suitable means of adjusting all proper demands upon itself , so that its example may never encourage individuals in wrong-doing . This brief sketch illustrates the rapid progress of American art and power . Born near the Atlantic shore about the close of the American revolution ; borne over the Alleghanies on the advancing wave of western civilization ; nurtured in the wilderness where his young slumbers were oft disturbed by the wild war-whoop of a savage and remorseless foe , his has been the good // fortune to see a few become a mighty people ; the frontiers of the republic receding westward from the Mississippi to the Pacific ; the arts spreading their triumphs towards the setting sun , and state after state springing into existence to join the sisterhood of freedom , and to know too that his hand has not been " unseen in all the wondrous changes wrought . " Where for many weary months he once toiled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force his small barge up the great river of floods , he has lived to direct floating palaces , with fire and steam , over the same perilous track ; and a few weeks ago , at the opening of the telegraph in St. Louis , his was the first message borne by lightning from the banks of the Mississippi to the President of the United States on the tide-waters of the Atlantic . Thus has lightning , after the lapse of only one generation , joined steam in annihilating time and distance , ministering to the wants of commerce , and binding more closely together the expanding frontiers of our Union . The first rude settlements of a remote wilderness have been changed within the memory of many still living , into splendid cities ; the wigwam and log-cabin given way to magnificent dwellings and warehouses , factories and temples , observatories and universities-all the pride and glory of education and refinement . The scattered and unprotected few who sought in vain for purchasers of their surplus productions , have swelled to millions , busy in sending the frhits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in feeding by their bounty the starving populatioH of a distant land . Having reached the Pacific in its ever onward mission , our republic is now stretching southward towards the Isthmus " And the arts still followecI*vhere her eagles flew . "
