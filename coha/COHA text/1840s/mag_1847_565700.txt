txt Tuis is the work of an ingenious and vigorous mind , deeply interested in the great topic of the will 's freedom . The writer , while by no means deficient in those qualities which give value to a work of this nature , is still farther furnished for his undertaking by an unusually wide acquaintance with the psychological writers of the language . He enters the lists as an avowed opponent of Edwardsmanifests the utmost dissatisfaction with the whole scheme of the inquiry , and prosecutes a very close and acute examination of the intricate reasonings of that distinguished work . In deprecating , as he very earnestly does , the charge of misinterpreting Edwards , he advances claims of a somewhat uncommon character . He professes to have bestowed profound attention upon the work on which he comments ; and to have been influenced in his constructions of it , only by " a desire to ascertain the truth . " He says in his preface- " If I have come to the conclusion , that the whole scheme of moral necessity which Edwards has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Freedom of the Will ; by Albert Taylor Bledsoe . Philadelphia : H. Hooker , 16 South Seventh street . 1845. establish , is founded in error and delusion ; this has not been because I came to the examination of his work with any preconceived opinion . In coming to this conclusion , I have disputed every inch of the ground with myself , as firmly and as resolutely as I could have done with an adversary . * * * * The formation of these views , whether they be correct or not , has been no light task . Long have I struggled under the stupendous difficulties of the subject , " &amp;c . With these advantages and professions , our author enters upon the task of making a thorough examination of this celebrated work . But we are sorry to say that towards Edwards , his tone is abrupt and unceremonious ,  --  it possesses but little of the courteous deference which some men would think it due to themselves to employ towards so eminent a name ; while towards the advocates of the Inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profession of candor and impartiality . The confidence with which he asserts the correctness of his views of Edwards  --  the sensitiveness with which he seems to resent any doubt of it , resemble more the spirit of a man who is resolved that his opinions shall stand scrutiny , // than the calm reliance of one who is assured that they will . " There be , " says he , " pretended followers and blind admirers of President Edwards , who , knowing but little of his work themselves , are ever ready to defend him , whensoever attacked , even by those who have devoted years to the study of the Inquiry , by most ignorantly and flippantly declaring that they do not understand him . " - p. 21 . Upon the spirit of this amiable paragraph we have nothing to offer . We feel entirely too sure both of our processes , and of our results , in the interpretation of Edwards , either to be disturbed by such charges , or to have recourse to them . We suggest however to Mr. Bledsoe , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to the grammatical structure of the sentence . As it stands , it is more ambiguous than anything in Edwards , and in its expressed meaning Mr. B. might have some trouble to vindicate it ; since whatever be the ignorance , &amp;c. &amp;c. of the adyocates of Edwards , the world will be slow to believe that any have been reduced so low , as to undertake to defend their master by " affirming that they do not understand him . " But we pass on to his examination of Edwards . The first chapter is entitled , " Of the point in controversy ; " and treats of the meaning of Edwards 's phrase " determination of the will . " Mr. B. quotes the passage in which Edwards says that by determining the will must be meant , " causing that the act of will be thus and not otherwise . * *** As when we speak of the determination of motion , we mean causing the motion of the body to be in such a direction rather than another . " Conceding that this passage makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaches that the controversy respects the latter only , Mr. B. declares the " notion " of Edwards " unsteady and vacillating " on this subject , and proceeds to sustain his assertion in the following manner . " He ( i. e . Edwards ) informs us that the question is not so much how a spirit endowed with activity comes to act , as why it exerts such an act and not another ; or why it acts with such a particular determination ? This clearly implies that although the question How a spirit comes to act , ' is not chiefly concerned in the present controversy ; yet it is partly concerned in it . This question is concerned in it , though not so much as the other , " &amp;c . The illustration drawn from the phenomena of motion Mr. B. contends fails to " answer the purpose for which Edwards introduced it . " All the causes which move a body may , he maintains , be reduced to one , viz , force . Thus he says , p. 18 , that " force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may sometimes happen that one cause will move a body , and then another interpose and change the direction , it is but a " superficial observation " which judges that there are two distinct causes for these two effects . " For in reality both the motion of the body and its direction result from the joint action of the two forces ; or in other words , each force contributes to the motion and each to the direction . " This subject possesses some interest , and as our authors s views of it have been repeatedly urged of late , we will spend a word or two upon it . Is there then in any instance a cause for the direction of a motion , separate from that of the motion itself . Take a case : a current of air is moving north-it meets a wall , and in consequence moves east . Now as the wind was moving before it reached the wall , it is plainly erroneous to say that the wall contributed to its motion-in this respect then Mr. B. 's statement is unguarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken place , a change of direction alone ; and // 339 this change is owing wholly to the wall . Again ; a pair of dice are found to fall always with the same side uppermost , and we inquire for the cause . Now to what purpose would it be to reply that " force** is the cause ? The very thing sought , is the object which exerts this force ; a remark which may serve to show the looseness of Mr. B. 's statement that force is always the cause . In fact , that which exerts force is the cause . Who can help pronouncing when he discovers the weight with which those dice were loaded , that this is the cause of their falling as they do ? and yet who says that the weight makes them fall ? In such a case the only criterion of a cause in external nature , decisively indicates the weight as such , viz , uniformity of sequence . As they fall when the weight is not present , the weight is not the cause of their falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this distinction " is then , we think , at least premature . But to return to the " unsteadiness " of Edwards 's " notion on this subject . " This is made out , as we have seen , from his remark that the question is not so much how the cause comes to act , but why it acts with such a particular direction . Let us place by the side of this criticism of our author , another on an expression precisely similar , from p. 158 . In speaking of Edwards 's distinction between moral and natural necessity , Mr. Bledsoe remarks , quoting his author , " he expressly tells us that this difference does not lie so much in the nature of the connection as in the terms connected . ' n both cases he maintains the connection is necessary and absolute . The two terms connected are different , but the kind and nature of the connection is the same . " Here are two passages quoted from Edwards both of which are qualified by the clause " so much . " Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sentence , in the first instance , to turn . He emphasizes it-. - quotes it-repeats it - gives it all the meaning he can make it bear . In the other case he passes over the passage without noticing in the least the words which before were so full of significancy ; nay he utterly overrules them . There are no quotation marks here - no emphatic repetitions of the potent clause which before proved the unsteadiness of Edwards 's " notion " - no italics , save for such other members of the sentence as may serve to throw this into the shade . " Not so much A as B , " says Edwards in both cases ; not so much A as B , says his commentator . " This clearly implies " A , though not so much as B. But by the time we have reached the second pas . sage , the clear implication of " so much " is forgotten , and it is equally clear that not A at all , but B was the meaning of the author . Not the slightest reason is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest reason which would forbid the contrary construction . But were an opponent to emphasize the words " so much " in the latter sentence , as Mr. B. does in the former , and make Edwards say that this difference does consist " partly " in the nature of the connection , though not so much as in the terms connected , it would throw our author into convulsions , and the luckless advocate of Edwards would not soon hear the last of his " blindness " and stupidity . By what right Mr. B. treats this clause as significant , and emphatic , in the one case , and as a mere expletive in the other , we are not informed . We think ourselves entitled to demand of Mr. B. the justice of the old Jewish law , " Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights , a great and a small . " Mr. B. may interpret the phrase in either of the ways we have indicated ; but he ought , at least in the absence of any reason to the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both instances alike .. The charge of " unsteadiness " is however supported by two additional remarks . One , a vague reference to Edwards 's attacks upon his opponents , unsustained by any reference to the Inquiry ; the other based upon a professed quotation . As to the first , it is enough to say that we do not deem it just-as to the second , that we question the occurrence in the Inquiry of any such sentence as Mr. B. professes to quote . His very strong impression that Edwards by determination of volition meant the causation of it , has misled him into a quotation which we have not found in the Inquiry , and which we can not but think is erroneous . Mr. B. 's argument therefore upon the point in controversy , we are constrained to consider unsuccessful , upon every point save the concession with which it commences ; and his comment upon the phrase " not so much how a spirit comes to act , " &amp;c. , we feel to be uncandid . The second chapter is upon Edwards 's use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove that he employed it , in its application to motive , in the sense of a producing cause , rather than of an occasion merely . Mr. B. quotes the remarks in which Edwards assigns the sense in which he would have the word understood . The passage quoted , is without doubt the most important and deliberate statement of the whole work of Edwards ; and it is commended with no small earnestness to the attention of his readers . It is preceded , accompanied , and followed , with remarks which show how well he was aware of the importance of the statement he was making . The statement itself is quoted by Mr. B. in these words " I sometimes use the word cause in this Inquiry to signify , " &amp;c . The followers of Edwards conceive this statement to apply to that general and most frequent position of the Inquiry , that motive is the cause by which volition is determined ; and they interpret this latter position in that meaning of the word cause , which Edwards here says he " sometimes " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has questioned that this application of the definition was the one which Ed. wards had in mind in framing it . Friends and foes have united in assigning one application to this pregnant clause . It has been universally claimed on the one side , and as universally admitted on the other , that Edwards here refers to motive . Mr. B. however dissents , saying " his language admits of no such construction . He merely tells us that he sometimes uses the word cause to signify an occasion , but when and where he so employs it he has not explained at all . " Now in view of the fact that all parties have hitherto regarded the application of this statement as unquestionable , it might seem not inappropriate for Mr. B. to assign the reasons which in his view throw doubt upon it-nay authorize a peremptory denial of it . Mr. B. however assigns no reason , and makes no pretense of assigning any . All the world have deemed the thing clear ; and Mr. B. is content to say that the world have been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He has not once said , " says our author , " that when he applies it to motive he uses it in the sense of an occasion or antecedent ; and if he had said so , it would not have been true . " Now that Ed. wards has not once said this is nothing to the purpose ; saying so would have made it no clearercould have made it no clearer ; - that it would not have been true , is nothing to the purpose , for the truth of the statement is not the point in dispute ; and moreover , in very numerous instances , we are persuaded it would have been true . // 341 There is one consideration which is decisive of controversy here , and that is , that no other application than the one generally made of this paragraph is even possible . This is reason enough for not saying that it meant motive-it could mean nothing else . Mr. Bledsoe has riot ventured to tell what else the words do or can apply to . He must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement of the Inquiry , of all meaning-all relevancy . To say that Edwards did not mean to apply the remarks in question to motive , when there is nothing else conceivable to which they can apply , is a pleasant specimen of courage . Mr. B. must indeed have " struggled long "  --  and found indeed " stupendous difficulties " in the Inquiry , before he could have been willing to have recourse to so desperate an expedient as this . We would make no farther remark upon this passage , were it not that in order to present a correct picture of our author 's treatment of it , one word more is demanded . Let our readers peruse again the positive and confident statement , made in the face of the world , that the passage " admits of no such construction " as would apply it to motive ; and then compare with these some remarks on pp. 52-3 " Ever and anon he ( i. e . Edwards ) seems to catch a whisper from the voice of consciousness ; and he concedes that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a positive or productive influence . But this is not when he is engaged in the energy of debate . Let Mr. Chubb cross his path ; let him hear the voice of opposition giving utterance to the sentiment , that in motive there is no causality in the production of action , ' and that moment the voice of consciousness is hushed in the most profound silence . He rises , like a giant , in the defense of his system , and he declares that to excite ' as motives do is positively to do something ' - and certainly that which does something is the cause of the thing done by it ! Yea , to excite ' is to cause in the most proper sense , not merely a negative occasion but a ground of existence by positive influence . " These remarks in reference to the inconsistency of Edwards we deem entirely just ; but then they derive , their whole force from the fact that Edwards is speaking of motive in the passage referred to . If Edwards had not reference to motive when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pro . ductive influence , " where is the inconsistency of subsequently assert . ing that to excite as motives do " is positively to do something ? " &amp;c. &amp;c . Mr. B. seems entirely to for . get in this passage ( as well as in some subsequent expressions which distinctly charge upon Edwards the inconsistency of which we speak ) his previous bold denial that the formal statements of Edwards , in his account of his use of the word cause , had any such application . Here he teaches that the passage concedes " something  --  to those too , as his subsequent remarks show , to those who deem that motive has no causality in the production of volition ; there , he contends that Ed. wards has no where said that those statements refer to motive . Surely our author relies somewhat too much on the " blindness " of his opponents . Such is Mr. Bledsoe 's method of dealing with his great predecessor . It can scarcely escape the observation of our readers , that in none of the instances quoted does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons for his construction of the Inquiry . Without the most distant reference to the scope of a passage  --  to the exigencies of the connection in which a phrase stands , it is simply affirmed to admit " of no such construction "  --  to be emphatic , or expletive , at the pleasure of the critic . No writer would suffer more // than Mr. B. himself from such a mode of criticism It ' we should bring forward the title of Sec . III " The Inquiry involved in a vicious circle , " and say that " this clearly implies " that Mr. B. believes that there is some reasoning in a circle which is not vicious , and then attempt to crucify him as the author of a new absurdity in logic , the argument would correspond accurately to some of his most important strictures . Mr. B. does not however imply any such thing ; any one may see that the word vicious** is introduced , and reiterated , in this connection , not because it means any thing to the purpose of his argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt for the perverse author , by whom the world has been so long held " subject to bondage . " If Mr. B. were a professed controversialist , content to acknowledge that he had the prejudices and prepossessions of other men-content to do battle for them as he best might , and then abide the issue of the contest , it would excite no surprise , and perhaps would call for no censure , if he should be found to avail himself of whatever resources were within his reach . But disdaining as he does all partisan warmthprofessing to move in a region above these vulgar impulses  --  to have examined his author with profound attention , and to have arrived at his conclusions so reluctantly as to have " disputed every inch of the ground with himself as firmly and resolutely as he could with an adversary ; " - one wonders to see such ample promise borne out by such slender fulfillment . We are not prepared for so unscrupulous an exercise of belligerent rights , on the part of one who professes entire neutrality . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original view which it proposes of the nature of volition . The peculiarity of it may be indicated in a word-volition is not strictly an effect . It comes to pass-it has a ground or reason of its coming to pass  --  but it has no more than this-no producing cause . This strange theory Mr. B. sets himself in good faith to the work of maintaining . " All that I deny , " he says , p. 47 , " is that a volition does proceed from the mind or from motive , or from any thing else in the same manner that an effect properly so called proceeds from its efficient cause . " The theory is that " there is a clear and manifest difference between an ACT and an EFFECT and that volition is " action itself " - in distinction from " the result of action . " The ground on which this theory is maintained deserves a word of remark . Mr. B. repudiates logic altogether , and speaks of Edwards in his usual ungracious style , as a great reasoner rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , but " only reasoned about it and about it ; and hence he was necessarily devoted to blindness . " His own mode is different , as the following remarks show-p. 50 . " This question , I contend , is not to be decided by abstract considerations , nor yet by the laying of words together , and drawing conclusions from them . It is a question , not of logic , but of psychology . By whatever name you may please to call it , the true nature of a volition is not to be determined by reference to abstractions , nor by the power of words ; but by simply looking at it and seeing what it is . If we would really understand its nature we must not undertake to reason it out ; we must open our eyes and look and see . " The former course Mr. B. deems the " proud " method of the schools  --  the latter that " marked out for us by the immortal Bacon . " We return now to the theory itself ; and object to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While with Mr. B. , we recognize the broad difference between the // 343 acting of a cause , and its effect , we are constrained to conceive of volition as belonging to the latter class . When we have said this we have answered our author ; he only states his conviction , and we have affirmed ours . We will proceed however to do what ( notwithstanding his profession of reliance upon consciousness ) he has not done , make a particular statement of the conscious experience on which we rest . - 1 . We are distinctly conscious of such a thing as making or forming a volition . We are distinctly conscious of a process antecedent to volition ? of which volition is the result . There is an exercise of the mind 's power , from which the result stands distinguish ed , in the case of Volition , just as thought is distinguished from thinking , or the act of memory , from the effort of remembering . 2 . Again , we distinctly conceive not only of the exerting of a volition - as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal distinctness we conceive of volition as the state resulting from a prior acting of the mind as its producing cause . We are conscious of the present existence of volitions formed many years since , and which we are not now consciously re-forming . The forming of those volitions is a past fact-their existence is a present fact of consciousness . They are resulting states of a past acting of the mind . For the correctness of these assertions we appeal ( to have recourse to logic , the weapon which Mr. B. so earnestly forbids ) to the consciousness , and experience of others , as developed in the language and conduct of mankind . All men use similar language-every where it is an admitted and correct form of speech to say that we form the determination to do so and so ; - that we make such and such a choice . Now if the existence of the mind , and of the volition , were the only facts in the case , who could with propriety speak thus ? how could all men thus imply another element ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act of the mind " only implies the existence of an agent that is capable of acting , " and the necessary conditions , how can we speak of making or forming such an act ? Moreover , are not all men conscious of the present existence of volitionsformed , of choices made , long since , but which they are not now forming . Louis Phillippe , for instance , once deliberated and decided , on the question of being king of the French . Lie was once forming that volition in a manner in which it would be plainly erroneous to - say that he is forming it now . Do not all men feel the difference between being in a state of firm determination and being in the process of forming a choice-between resolved and resolving ? It can not be therefore that volition is action , in distinction from the result of action . The fact that choice is in many instances a permanent state of the mind , is decisive against such an opinion . This fact Mr. B. would seem to have overlooked ; as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this con. nection , than those transient acts which spend their force in accornplishing some physical action-specific volitions as they have been called-an oversight to which , as we conceive , his error is principally attributable . Mr. Bledsoe 's development of his theory includes another ground of serious objection  --  the fact that . it is destructive of every just idea of causation . That we gain no idea of causation from the observation of external nature , Mr. B. fully admits . He contends too , that the phenomena occurring within the mind do not fall within the category of effects . Whence , then , we ask , is this idea suggested to us ? from what quarter does it arise ? Our author feels the pressure of the difficulty , and makes // the following attempt to evade it ; we quote from p. 77 . " The only way in which the mind ever comes to be furnished with the ideas of cause and effect at all , is this : We are conscious that we will a certain motion of the body , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this act of the mind , this exertion of the will , that gives us the idea of a cause ; and the change which it produces in the body , is that from which we derive the idea of an effect . " This account of the origin of our idea of causation seems to us , we confess , radically defective . It is an account of nothing in the world but the observation of a sequence . We are " conscious of the volition ; " and we " discover " that the motion " follows : " that is , we know two events , and that one follows the other ; and that is all with which consciousness furnishes us , from which to develop the idea of causation . Is not all that is here claimed true , and seen to be true in any observed seqience in nature ? We know the existence of the antecedent , and we " discover " that the consequent follows , as truly when we see a drum beat , and then hear the sound , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not this give us the idea of causation ? When we apply a spark to gunpowder , and witness the consequent explosion , we are as sure of the existence of the first , and we " discover " as truly the occurrence of the second term of the sequence , as in the case Mr. B. describes : Why not say then , that the observation of nature gives us the idea of causation , if this be all ? The truth is , that Mr. B. 's scheme completely shuts out causation-it is fatally defective . There is no such thing in his scheme as a conscious exercise of power in the production of an effect . Causation is with him the knowledge of the antecedent and the knowledge of the consequent  --  and this is all . He formally denies that we have any consciousness of power at all ; and especially of power to the contrary choice . He says , p. 225 , " We are not even conscious of our power to act ; this is necessarily inferred from the acts of which we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice , we can not be conscious of it , nor of the power to put it forth . " We are not even conscious of our own existence-we infer it from our consciousness of thinking , &amp;c . " We are merely conscious of the existence of thought , of feeling , of volition ; and we are so made , that we are compelled to believe that there is something which thinks , and feels , and wills . " p. 229 . Cogito , ergo sum ; we confess we had thought that this argument belonged exclusively to the past ,  --  it seems however , that we were mistaken . Volition gives us the idea of a cause , and " the change which it produces in the body , is that from which we derive the idea of an effect . " The change which it produces ! Why , there is no producing in the case ; we discover that the change follows , and this , according to Mr. B. 's account , is all that we know . We are not conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover " in the connection of mind with the body a uniform sequence of motion upon volition , and nothing more . Apart from this consideration , which Mr. B. might censure as logical rather than psychological , his account of the origin of causation we must deem def*ctive as failing to specify the essential fact of consciousness in the case . When we will a motion , and the motion follows , the volition and the motion are not the only facts . In every such instance , we will to exert a motion  --  to cause , to produce it ; and immediately consequent upon this volition is an effort of the mind to // originate the motion  --  a causative nisus , as Prof. Tappan calls it , originating in the activity of the mind , acting upon our physical system and producing in that system the motion willed . The motion stands not in immediate connection with the volition ; ( and this fact constitutes our reply to Mr. B. 's position , which we can not examine at length , that the act of volition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exerting in an effort of which it is most distinctly conscious , its power for the origination of that effect . Thi* element , the exercise of power , one of the most familiar , and by far the most important , fact of the whole subject , our author entirely disregards ; and gives us instead , consciousness of the existence of the antecedent and the discovery that the consequent follows , and tells us that this is the only way in which the mind ever comes to be furnished with the idea of cause at all . The position , however , that volition is strictly an effect produced by the prior acting of its cause , has been , in Mr. B. 's view , the grand error of all previous philosophy . It involves the absurdity of an infinite series of acts prior to any volition . Thus , p. 210 , " The effect caused , and the causative act , are clearly distinct ; the one produces the other . If the causative act is a volition , then we have an infinite series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but some other effort of the mind , the same difficulty arises ; for if it be necessary to suppose a preceding effort of the mind in order to account for a volition , it will be equally necessary to suppose the existence of another effort to account for that ; and so on ad infinitum . " This argument , from its frequent occurrence throughout his reasonings , is evidently Mr. B. 's main reliance for the support of his theory . To us it is evident that it is more than thisit is the whole ground on which his theory was formed , as well as his VOL . V. reliance for its defense . Again and again he asks , is not all this true , supposing volition to be a produced effect ? Admit this , and you are at the mercy of " the necessarian , " as he complacently terms any one who differs from him . We can not but wonder whether Mr. B. would accept for a reply to this objection , one constructed upon the model of his reply to Edwards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of psychology , not of logic-to be " decided not by laying together words and drawing conclusions from them , " but by looking at it and seeing what it is , the argument is at an end when we have presented the testimony of consciousness in respect to it . For by what right does logic object against our views , when it may not make objection to his ? This consideration , fortified by a reference to the pride of the schools , and a flourish about the immortal Bacon , might serve our purpose against him , as well as it does his against Edwards . But to give this objection a serious answer , which we would be far from saying it does not well deserve , we observe that it lies only against such a view of the preliminary acting of a cause , as implies some change in the cause , previous to the production of the effect . It assumes that the exercise of activity by which a cause is supposed to produce , is , or involves some change ; and it affirms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are in the absurdity of an infinite series ; if it is not so produced , then we have the admission that a change may take place without being produced by a previous act . To this we reply , that the previous acting of the cause does not imply any such change as this reasoning supposes , or indeed any change whatever , previous to the occurrence of the effect itself . The activity of the cause is in constant and changeless exercise . The error lies in supposing that the exercise of power // by which the cause produces , commences immediately prior to the occurrence of the effect , and terminates when the effect is produced . The idea , of the preliminary acting of a cause , does not involve any idea of a change , save of that which constitutes the effect . The exercise of activity , on the part of the cause , is constant , and unvarying . It is endowed with power so to act at the beginning of its existence as a cause , and put thea into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin and cease with each particular effect , but continues permanently the same , there is no change for which to account , and of course there can be no infinite series of changes , volitions , efforts , or any thing else . This idea of the preliminary and productive action of a cause is one to which we say with confidence , that the objection above mentioned does not apply ; and our author makes no attempt to show that to this it does apply . The sole ground , therefore , assignable in defense of his theory , we feel to be untenable ; neither his appeal to consciousness nor the logic by which he supports it , sustains his view . If our remarks are correct , Mr. B. 's work , so far as it aims to present an extended theory of volition , must be deemed unsuccessful . If volition is a produced effect , as upon every ground of logic and of consciousness we contend that it is , Mr. B. would be among the first to acknowledge , that he has but increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It is not without some regret that we state our conviction that this is the case ; and that his work would require to be entirely re-written , before it would be received as containing a just account of the origin and nature of volition . One word more , and we let the theory go ; we would remind Mr. Bledsoe how many a supercilious remark toward his great opponent about " hiding sophisms , " " metaphysical juggling , " &amp;c. &amp;c. , falls to the ground with this hopeless theory of volition ; that they recoil upon their author , we forbear to say . We have now indicated by no means the sum of our author 's errors , but all that we deem it necessary to point out , and we are glad that so unwelcome a task is ended . We can not , however , let the work pass from us thus . Notwithstanding its errors both of temper , and of analysis , many of its discussions are unusua*ly vigorous and thorough , and many of its criticisms exceedingly acute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in numerous instances exposes its fallacies with great clearness and discrimination . His remarks " upon Edwards 's idea of liberty " as consisting in power to act according to our choice , are , doubtless , entirely correct ; and disclose one of those errors of the Inquiry which are susceptible of no defense . His strictures too upon the difference between natural and moral necessity , have great force , though by no means equally just to Edwards . This difference Mr. B. decides to consist in two things-first , that the terms connected are different-are of a moral nature ; and second , that it admits of no voluntary opposition . Such an idea of moral necessity we freely abandon to his tender mercies , remembering too what the tender mercies of some men are . It must be acknowledged however , that some of the statements of Edwards upon this point are justly liable to the utmost severity of critical animadversion . One of the most favorable specimens of our author 's powers , is found in his discussion of the " Argument from the foreknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unravels with great success ; and evinces a thorough familiarity with the most important distinctions pertaming // to the subject . lie discriminates broadly between those causes which are antecedent only in the order of our thoughts , and those which are antecedents in the order of events . Lie distinguishes too the different kinds of necessity ; - the necessity that a present event exists , he terms axiomatical ; that by which - the existence of a thing results from our knowledge of its existence , he terms logical ; and that by which an event is connected with its cause , causal . The discrimination is perhaps not made with the nicest degree of precision , but still with an accuracy highly advantageous to the discussion . Those only of our readers who are somewhat familiar with these distinctions , and are aware of the variety of ideas often comprised in that formidable word necessity , can appreciate the merit of the work in this particular . But we must not prolong our remarks . We have aimed to exhibit an accurate picture of a work to which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a work of mingled merits and defects . We greatly question the advantage which would be derived from it by any one who should receive all its positions as correct ; but a discriminating study it wiU amply repay . No one can read it without having his mind stimulated by the author 's freshness and ardor , and enlightened by his keen criticism and just observation . The tone of the work , toward both Edwards and his adherents , gives much occasion for regret ; and contrasts strongly with the bland ( and milky ) terms in which the author exposes some of the errors of those who advocate his own general views . This asperity is the more ungracious in Mr. B. , inasmuch as whether he is , or is not , conscious of it , no recent writer is so largely indebted to Edwards as himself . No one can observe his own guarded statements in respect to contingence and self.determination , and see how he cautions the advocates of the latter against their tendencies to error , without perceiving the traces of Edwards 's powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better purpose than the mere detection of its errors ; though that is what none would gather from any statement of his work . Nor is the name of Edwards the only one which we confess ourselves pained to see so slightingly mentioned . Of another yet living , render . ed by his worth , talents , station and long services , scarcely less venerable , our author seems to delight in showing his slender estimation . We confess ourselves at a loss to understand the motive of this gratuitous severity . Let the enemy overrun the territories of the republic , capture the city and make his way to the senate house if he must ; but once there to pull the beard of the Fathers is a barbarian triumph . The wisdom of this course is upon a level with its amiability . Often , as , in the perusal of the work , we have lighted upon some forcible argument , or some ingenious criticism , have we regretted that it should be set forth in a garb which serves only to gratify a transient heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those for whose benefit it is designed . Mr. B. will probably appear in this field again ; at least we hope he will . We take the liberty , in anticipation of such a thing , to suggest a more manly and generous criticism of Edwards ; we should be gratified too with some farther vindication of his theory of volition , if , as we suppose , he must still maintain it , and if it seem not too unreasonable , we would add a request for a more courteous and dig . nified tone . A little more caution and self-command , at these points , would enable us to follow him with no small satisfaction , into any field of investigation related to the subject of his present volume.
