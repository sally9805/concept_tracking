txt The precedent which New York is creating by the most extraordinary innovation in the greatest department of the State  --  the department of JUSTICE  --  a province hitherto , in all civilized nations , the most carefully guarded , is of such vital concern to the nation at large , and is in itself so fraught with danger to the very foundations of Social Order , that we could not refrain in this number from expressing our opinion of it in the fullest terms , though it may be of no avail to avert the evil . We therefore admit a second article , setting forth more completely the innoyation , which our leader partly embraces . We design in this Review to avoid local and sectional matters . But this belongs to the whole country , and the people must understand it . As the writer of this article conclusively argues , it is not so great a matter that the highest judges should be chosen by popular election , as that whesi chosenthey are to be turned out again i eight years , thos subjecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Justice to all those temptations to corrupt action , all the miserable caballing and strife which now pertains to the most petty political office , whose incumbent may desire a re-election . How different would it be , if , when once chosen* in the tumult of a popular election , they could settle down into that calm atmosphere which invests a judicial office whose term is to cover nearly the residue of life Then what is to be said of the probability under such a system , of possessin , , in the places of judgment any acenmulated treasures of judicial wisdom and experience ' ! All beneficial changes in the Constitution , howevernecessary and advantageous , are but feathers in the balance against the inestimable evil of this . But we commend the article below to the attention of our readers. - En . An . REV . " JUDGMENT is what gives force , effect and vigor to laws ; laws without judgment are contemptible and ridiculous ; we had better have no laws than laws not enforced by judgment . " BURKE . " I stand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tnn new Constitution of the State of New York is about to be submitted to the people for ratification or rejection , and will soon have passed the popular and final audit from which there lies no appeal . Shall we ratify the proposed Constitution , or shall we abitle by that which we already possess , modifying its defects through the intervention of the legislature , or of a Convention to be called hereafter ? To deliberate upon and decide this momentous question , the people have had but a few days ; about as long a time as is often occupied in trying an Insurance cause in the Superior Court , or a bank robber at the Sessions . Considering that we are a busy , toiling people , submitting to our daily tasks and destiny of labor , we have really but a few hours to revise what the Convention has been many months in doing . Indeed , indeed , " this is a sorry sight . " The reconstruction of the Constitution and political society of a great State ; the fundamental law of property and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century ; in theory , the work oft/ce people ; is to be puddered over for a few days , and huddled through ; done in hot and indecent haste , without deliberation or scrutiny , or an eye to the careful adjustment of its parts , so as to secure a symmetrical and perfect whole , which a work of such vast magnitude and fraught with such tremendous consequences so Imj ) eratively demands . This is to be hereafter cited against us , and , we fear , cited with resistless force , as one of our examples of our boasted capacity for selfgovernment . A Constitution of government is to be struck out by the people at a single heat-cut out and finished as quick as a tailor could make a decent suit of clothes ! Doubtless , it deserves to last about as long ; and the people will be wise to begin to think of having a whole wardrobe of constitutions , that they may be the more conveniently cleansed and repatched , as they , from time to time , grox* seedy and threadbare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour of final decision , we mean to free our skirts from all responsibility for the evils we apprehend , and the greater evils which we surely foresee , from the adoption of the proposed Constitution . We owe to the people of this Slate and nation , to men of all parties and without distinction of party , a fearless exposure of the fundamental errors in the principle upon which it proposes to constitute the JUDICIARY . What is done in the State of New York is not done in a corner . Standing at the head of commerce and opinion on this Western Continent , // her example has much of the little zeal and policy . Public opinioa- qwq some young men of great promise , ) this was a Convention of shallow men , undistinguished by either great learning or . great talents , a profound knowledge of books , or a deep insight into human natur , e or society . Shallow men are generally extreme in their opinions , seeking to make up in extension what they lack fl ( lepth of attainments or character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of universal remedies , and the founders of political Utopias . They are the reformers par excellence . Men of this description swarmed in the Convention ; and there , in grave council and solemn debate , these Solons and Justinians , these founders of systems and reconstructers of states and dynasties , each in turn proposed his petty scheme for laying over again the foundations of Justice , and rebuilding the structure of Social Order , in an important and powerful State . Such men were to construct an example for the rest of the Union , and a proof of the beneficent operation of Free Institutions . We again declare , what we believe no one will venture to deny , that the body of the Constitution-makers of 1846 are not for a moment to be compared with those who composed the Convention of 1820 , either for the integrity and attainments they possessed , or for the solemnity of purpose with which they assembled . The scene , indeed , exhibited beneath the dome of the Capitol at Albany , forcibly reminded us of another scene which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wholesome light of the outer world partially illumines the dark cave ; a caldron rises as from the depths of the earth ; the thunder mutters over our heads ; the " secret , black and midnight bags " enter ; and we are now prepared for a potent incanta-tion : 1st WITCH . Round about the caldron go ; In the poisoned entrails throw : Toad , that under the cold stone , Days and nights hast thirty-ones &amp;C . ALL .

Mingle , mingle , mingle , You that mingle may ? What wonder is it that from such an incantation there should go forth a charm potent enough to cause " Nature 's germins tumble all together , Even till destruction sickens ? " We are not more struck with the immensity , than with the harmony , of the material creation . Designed and formed by one infinite mind , it was launched into the fields of space harmonious in all its parts , and perfect as a whole-amid its alternations of day and night , its changes of climature and seasons , its sunshine and shower and dew ,  --  unchangeable in perpetual change ,  --  still breathing up an everlasting hymn to the all-bountiful and powerful Intelligence , who knew how to work with so complete a wisdom . The most perfect works of man are doubtless but faint copies of the work of the Divine hand . But the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product , is quite too painfully apparent in the Convention , and its labors even for any human work . This is , in a great degree , attributable to several causes already hinted at . If our Constitution had withheld any great natural right , had oppressed any class of citizens , had left our persons or our property without that security which creates the chief necessity for political society , the Convention would have been called with reference to that evil ; and a temedy for that defect would have produced , as to that at least , a united and harmonious purpose . Or if , without any such harmonizing cause , the Convention had been composed of men of profound political attainments , familiar with the history of ancient and modern States , and qualified // by their powers of investigation and habits of thought , to deduce from the experience of the great Past , valuable lessons to guide the great Future , some new and grand reforms might possibly have been made in our system , without destroying its symmetry . Unfortunately , neither of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a revival of the controversy between Anarch and Old Night , where " Chaos Umpire sat , And by decision , more embroiled the fray . " Committees were appointed on the motion of everybody , to inquire and report about everything . The Convention was soon swept beyond the old piers and harbors , and places of anchorage , far out on the tumultuous sea of reform ; and there was no man of such intellect , or weight of authority in the Convention , as to enable him to control the helm . Unpropitious as was this state of things , the Convention might still have been turned to some useful account , if any deep interest in its proceedings could have been excited . But the popular indifference manifested at the election of Delegates , rather increased during the Session of the Convention . During the four mortal months , through which the session extended , the people appeared to he indifferent spectators of the proceedings . The press plainly indicated this popular indifference . Short abstracts of the proceedings were published in the newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew beautifully less , until they almost ceased to be . They could not compete for public attention with the money articles or price currents ; nor even with the ordinary vulgar newspaper marvels ; and seductions , murders , little men and big babies , mannikins and monkeys triumphantly carried the day with the people , against the collective wisdom of the State , assembled in Convention at the Capitol . We do not mean to deny that the Con* vention has proposed some useful amendments . It would be wonderful if two hundred men could not , in the space of four months , produce some slight improvement in the mere details of the Constitution . Elections by single districts we regard as a real reform . But the good bears a very small proportion to the evil ; and as we can not have the good without the evil , we shall not take many and great evils for a little good . As we must take the whole , or reject the whole we elect to reject . The poison is mingled with the water , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should drink and die . The objectionable features of the proposed Constitution are too numerous to be presented within the limits which we have prescribed to ourselves for this discussion . Our special business is with the Judiciary . The changes proposed in our Judicial system are extensive and alarming . The mode of appointment , and the tenure on which the judges are to hold office , are radically changed . Now , the Governor and Senate appoint the Judges : under the New Constitution , they are to be elected by the people . No*v , the Judges hold during good behavior , ( or until they are sixty years old , ) under the new Constitution they are to hold for a brief term of years . This we deem to be the plague spot , the immedicable vulnus , of the proposed Constitution . It is an undeniable fact , that an enlargement of our Judicial system was greatly needed , and that but for this , a majority could not have been obtained in favor of calling the late Convention . We asked for bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The real and substantial purpose for which the Convention was called , has most signally and completely failed ; and the very reason which urged the people to call a Convention , is the very , and most conclusive reason , why the people should reject the Constitution proposed by it . The Convention hae given us radical change , but not reform , not improvement . We wanted greater judicial force ; they have not essentially increased it . We wanted a simpler system ; they have made it more com ple* and cumbrous .. We wanted to preserve , and if possible to increase , the weight and authority of the Courts , and to strengthen their hold on public confidence ; they have dragged the Courts upon the political arena , and have devised the most effectual method to destroy the purity and independence of the Judges , and the confidence of the people in the administration of justice . Our Constitution was generally felt to be an excellent instrument , under the administration of which , our State had advanced in a career of unexampled prosperity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but resulting from our rapid growth . It was extensively felt , and especially by the profession most conversant with the // matter , that the number of our Judicial officers , and the arrangements of the Courts for the dispatch of business , were entirely inadequate to the labors which devolved on them . Insufficient force was the evil ; an increase of that force was the natural and appropriate remedy . The proposed judicial system will prove entirely inadequate to the administration of justice , without ruinous delays . The names of Courts and officers are changed , but their number is not essentially increased . But while the new Constitution does not augment the judicial force , it creates an increased necessity for such augmentation . Instead of a County Court , for civil and criminal business , in each County of the State , and one Supreme Court , with Circuit Courts held in each County , we are to have eight Supreme Courts . These Courts are of equal jurisdiction , but each confined to its own local district . The decisions in one Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . The laws of property will become more and more unsettled and uncertain . On one side of a line , A , according to law , will be entitled to judgment against B ; but by going a few rods to the other side of that line , and into another district , B , upon precisely the same state of facts , will be entitled to judgment against A. The want of a common rule of right , will produce endless uncertainty and confusion , fraught with consequences ruinous to individuals and destructive of the most sacred ends of society . Wretched indeed is the servitude of that people where the laws are uncertain . The want of uniform decisions and a uniform rule of right , wilt produce another great evil in the infinite series of mischiefs in this new Pandora 's box , without a hope at the bottom , which the Convention has opened to the People . Men will have no confidence in the conflicting decisions of these co-drdinate and jarring tribunals ; and instead of appeals , as now , from two high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature years and acknowledged learning and talents , whose decisions have commanded great respect and been generally acquiesced in , there will be appeals from eight Courts . The number of cases appealed from the Court of Chancery , or removed by Writ of Error from the Supreme Court , to the Court of Errors , has always heen exceedingly small , compared with the number of cases decided in those Nov. , Courts . Not one case out of a hundred , indeed not one out of many hundreds , so decided in the Supreme and Chancery Courts , has been carried to the Court of Errors . A desire for delay has carried many cases to the Court of Errors , where there has been no hope of obtaining a reversal of the judgment , or decree in the Court below . This acquiescence in the decisions of our two highest Courts of original jurisdiction , is no doubt attributable to the confidence universally reposed in the pure and able men who have presided over them . But under the new system , this confidence must , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adverted to , and for other reasons which we shall present when we come to consider the new judicial tenure and mode of appointment . The want of uniformity in the decisions of the eight independent Supreme Court jurisdictions , and a lessened and ever lessening confidence in the learning , capacity or impartiality of the Judges , will yearly produce a bountiful harvest of appeals . All seasons will he equally seed time and harvest . The consequences are obvious to the meanest capacity . The Court of Appeals will , in a little time , be blocked up with business . It may spend six months in each year in hearing , and the other six months in deciding , causes . It may devote itself with ceaseless toil and unwavering fidelity , to the performance of its functions ; its judges may be as sleepless as the tides , with brains and nerves toughened to the hardness of steel , knowing norelaxation , no pleasure , no rest from their Sisiphine labors ; and yet the Court will be utterly and hopelessly overwhelmed with business in less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business will produce additional crops of appeals for the sake of the delay . That Court will be the final outlet to the tides of litigation , and that outlet will , in a little while , become almost impassable : an overslaugh , over which no keel can pass , until it has lain upon the bottom long enough to rot . Litigants xviii go in young , and come out of it with gray locks ; and appeals , like border fends , will be bequeathed from sire to son , connecting generation with generation of men , by perpetuated legal controversies . The delay is very often the denial of justice . Protracted litigation is a heavy burden for the rich ; it is utter ruin to the poor . A long suit requires to be pensioned on a long purse ; if the purse be The New Constitution : // very short , the suit dies , and with the suit perishes the right which it asserted . " There is great mercy in despatch , " says Lord Bacon ; " delays are tortures , wherewith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estates . " If any man imagines that the new judicial system will lessen the lawts delays , he is doomed to bitter disappointment . Here , there has been the most absolute failure of a much needed reform ; and to accept of the pretended reform , which the Convention has given us , is to postpone any real reform for an indefinite period . But the worst feature of the new Judiciary remains to be discussed . Was the change in the mode of appointing , and in the tenure of the Judges , demanded by public sentiment , or can it he beneficial ? lATe answer this question with a downright negative . An elective judiciary is a novelty and a heresy among us . The thing was never entertained in any quarter , until after the Convention had been decided on ; and then was not discussed by the newspapers , or in the primary assemblies of the people . The idea was so utterly radical , that no man dreamed that it could be incorporated into the new Constitution ; and it were a gross falsehood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State . It is very confidently believed , that if that question could he passed upon alone , and disconnected from other things , upon whose popularity it is mounted , the people would decide against the change by a vast majority . We hope that they will , even now , vote against it ; and that they may be induced to do so , we shall present the objections against an elective judiciary , more fully and distinctly than has yet been done . The change is desired by Demagogues ,  --  by New Shuf. fleites ,  --  and not by the People . The people have not asked for , but the New Shuffleites dictate the change . The people have had reason to think well of our present judicial tenure . It is unquestionably the tendency of party politics to produce a large amount of l ) Olitical corruption , and to deteriorate the standards of character and capacity , as qualifications for public office . Where , in our history and experience , have this tendency and deterioration been most manifested ? In the judicial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government ? Most unquestionably in the two latter . Every department of government has been affected by the bitterness of party strife , but the executive and legislative the most and the worst . In the main , we have had pure and enlightened Judges ; the Courts have maintained their ' respectability ; they have deserved and enjoyed public confidence ; and , with rare and unimportant exceptions , our citizens have felt that neither their politics , nor the politics of the judges , rendered them insecure in their persons or property , or was a harrier to the effective maintenance of their legal rights . But does this correspond with our experience in respect of the other departments of the Government ? Have they been equally confided in , and equally worthy of confidence ? Have both parties , have the people , believed them to be incorrupt , or administered with an eye single to the general good On the contrary , is it not notorious to all parties and all men , that the legislature has acted more as the political committee of the party having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole State and people ? And has not the Governor too often been the worthy coadjutor of a party legislature ? Such , certainly , has been our sad experience . The inference is irresistible and close at hand . The mode and infrequency of high judicial appointments , and the independent tenure on which the judges have held their offices , have withdrawn them from close and prolonged contact with political parties , popular elections , and partisan excesses ; while the other departments of the government , differently constituted , have been left to the full force of these malign influences . Our history , and the history of all free States , bear a concurring testimony in favor of keeping judicatnre at the widest possible remove from party influences . No man , or party , felt* aggrieved or oppressed by the principle on which our judicial system is constituted , or thought that any useful change could he made in that principle . The Whig party has called for no such change ; and it is but justice to the Democratic party , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eff*ct it . Amid this general content , the demagogues enter upon the scene . They tell the people that they are unjustly precluded from their natural right to elect the Judges . They could elect everything else , and why not the Judges ? Down by the ear of the People , the disgusting reptiles of the political scene , // Nov. , squat like the filthy toad in the Paradise Lost . The dear people must be flattered ; cozened and deluded by fulsomeness and falsehood . The awful and instruc tive scene in Eden , rises in our memory : the glorious earth which had not known mildew or blight , and the happy pair in unsinning obedience and blessedness . Of only one tree in that garden of the Lord might they not eat ; or , eating , die . " And the Serpent said unto the Woman , Ye shall not surely die : for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof , then your eyes shall he opened , and ye shall he as gods , knowing good and evil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the eyes " of Eve , " a tree to he desired to make one wise , " and she ate of the fruit thereof : " The fruit Of that forbidden tree , whose mortal taste Brought death into the world , and all our wo , With loss of Eden . " And in this way , imitating the foul example of the arch-demagogue , the NewShuffleites have sought to delude the people to their ruin . An elective Judiciary is made pleasant to the bewildered eye , " a thing to be desired , " and forthwith the charm is wound up , and the abominable proposition foisted into the new Constitution . We were surprised ; we blushed for Whiggism ; we blushed for the legal profession ; that no voice of Whig or of lawyer was raised in denunciation of this new and foul political heresy . Such a voice on the floor of the Convention would have awakened loud echoes in every county of the State . But those who would have united in such an opl ) osition , felt disheartened and betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good cause is never lost while life and courage are left to fight its battle , even single-handed , against a world in arms . We will strike at least one stout blow for the Judiciary as it is . We lift our voice in solemn warning to the people against this dangerous h cresv . We reiterate the unheeded admonition given to our first parents : " The day ye eat thereof , ye shall surely die . " There is " death in the pol " of which you are invited to partake ; a murderous dagger lies beneath the pillow as which you are urged to repose . We want language to express our loathing for the ingrained and thorough demagogue. is daily life is a daily lie . Ever ready to " crook the preg nant hinges of the knee , where thrift may follow fawning , " he is a swindler by profession , and his mind subsists on the vilest garbage of the political sewer . Selfish , corrupt , utterly base in his means and aims , he is the worst pest of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fair State . The character of the demagogue was once drawn in lines of fire by a great Whig statesman , recently lost to his country , who had qualified himself by severe and profound studies in history and political science for a career of the widest usefulness and renown . His worth even far transcended the appreciation of his country , which shed hitter tears over a great man cut down suddenly in the prime of his manhood , and in the midst of public service and honors . " History is written in vain , " said the lamented Legar* , " if mankind have not been taught that ( lemagogue and tyrant are synonymous ; and that he who professes to be the friend of the people , while he persuades them to sacrifice their reason to their passions , their duty , to their caprices , their laws , their Constitution , their glory , their integrity , to the mere lust ofiyrannical misrule , is a liar , and the truth is not in him . " Are the people likely to select more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have been selected under our present system ? Shall we have Kents and Spencers , Storys and Marshalls elected ? We are told that " if the people can be entrusted to elect Presidents and Governors , no good reason can exist why they should not elect judges . " This short asseveration contains two palpaple fallacies . First , it falsely assumes that the reason why judicial officers are not elective is , that the people are not thought worthy of being entrusted with their election ; and secondly , that it is expedient to elect them , because th' people are worthy . We deny both assumptions . The paramount reasons against making judges elective are , first , that electing them would bring them into too close contact with party excitements and excesses , and tend to impair their purity and impartiality ; and second , that such contact , even if it did not in fact make judges partial and corrupt , would destroy the confidence universally reposed by the people in the courts , and in the pure and impartial administration of the laws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people is a point not all involved . Ad- // 527 mitting their virtue , general intelligence and patriotism , as we do most cordially and sincerely , it does not show that the true reasons for making judges non-elective are not absolutely conclusive . It by no means follows that because the people are intelligent and honest , they are necessarily capable of selecting the best men for all offices . The people elect the President-hut do they elect his cabinet ? Do they elect foreign ministers ? Does any man of common intelligence suppose , that it would be discreet to make the heads of departments and foreign ministers and consuls elective by the l ) eople ? Are the people necessarily able to determine who are the best qualified for high judicial stations ? It is doing the people no injustice to say , that the average capacity and intelligence of those whom they elect to high offices are , or should be , greater than their own . The Governor and Senators are , or ought to be ( for the people should select no others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attainments . If they are not , why have the people , who are so bespattered with praise by demagogues , the power , and the want of intelligence and virtue , to elect them ? But if they are , their talents and character have given them an acquaintance with public men , and men of high judicial qualifications , throughout the bounds of the State , which peculiarly qualifies them formaking a wise selection . For example , suppose that a Chancellor or Judge of the Supreme Court is to be appointed . The station requires a man of spotless integrity and great attainments in the law . But the most learned and eminent lawyers , pursuing the quiet paths of their profession , do not become much known in political circles , to the people , or to political managers , throughout the State . The people 's knowledg*e of able men , and more especially of those who are not politically prominent , is almost exclusively local ; and , as a general thing , the men who are best qualified for judicial offices are the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who , by their tact and activity , obtain a controlling voice in the nominations . Would the people , under such circumstances , he very likely to make the best selection of a judge or chancellor ? But take the other mode of appointment . The Governor and Senators are in public life ; in active correspondence with all parts of the State ; in frequent contact with men of commanding influence and intellect , of all parties ; and have the best possible opportunity to know where the highest qualifications for the office may be found . If the Governors and Senators are upright men , and perform with fidelity the duties of their office , will they not , knowing the best men , appoint the best men to office ? If they are corrupt , and will not , we ask again , whyhave the people been so stupid as to elect such men to the offices of Gov .. governor and Senators ? Is it not a little absurd to say that the people can ( and therefore ought to ) appoint good judges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appoint good Governors and Senators , who should appoint good judges ? But supposiiig , for the sake of the argument , what is utterly false in fact , that the people are as favorably circumstanced as the Governor and Senate to know what men in the State are best qualified for judicial offices , there is yet another powerful reason why they are not likely to ohtam he best men by means of a popular election . Many men of the highest ability have little or no inclination for office . They are averse to the crimination and uproar which have become inseparable from political life and popular elections . Such men love their country quite as well as those who make a more ostentatious display of their patriotism wherever they hope to find a good market for it . They would feel constrained by a sense of duty , in many cases , to fill an important public office , if tendered by the appointing power ; but they would by no means consent to be run as a candidate for the same office ; to be assailed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their life misrepresented , their characters vilified , their secret arid most sacred feelings bared to the foulest obloquy , for the chance of being elected over , or , quite as likely , under the pressure of " regular nominations , " defeated by opponents in every possible sense infinitely their inferiors . It is a very great mistake to suppose that the best and ablest men are in public life ; on the contrary , the people are deprived of the services of many of tbe very purest and most eminently gifted of our fellowcitizens , by the causes just adverted to . But if we were to waive these objections , others , much stronger , remain to be stated ; namely , the bad effect of such elections upon the judges , the people , and the administraf on of justice . We may safely assume that no man will take a // nomination for a Judgeship , who does not desire to obtain the office . If a candidate , he will use the means ordinarily used by politicians , to be elected , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary , is to suppose the grossest absurdity . If he he a lawyer , as he most probably will he , he will he even more anxious to keep , than he was to get , his place . A lawyer can not be long from the Bar without breaking up his professional connections and losing his business ; and , once lost , they can only he regained by years of assiduity and labor which few are found willing to bestow . If he do not possess an independent fortune , and if , in addition , he have a family dependent upon his official salary for support , the retention of his office becomes a dire necessity . An elected Judge will be nothing more than a man , with a man 's frailties . No man can live by politics without living among politicians . No man can live among politicians without acquiring their opinions and habits , their ways of thinking and acting . This is human nature , which will outlast the new Constitution , and the parchments on which many subsequent ones will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold upon.his place , and upon those party leaders and managers who have the power to keep him in , or turn him out of , his place . He must stand well with them , and with the masses of his party . He must keep l ) opular , that he may continue to be available . A necessity is put upon him to do and to be all this , and it is said that necessity knows no law . Does any man of sense believe that a Judge , so circumstanced , will be any purer than other politicians ? In political causes , which not unfrequently arise , and which must arise more frequently under the new order of things , he must , necessarily , and therefore will , incline towards those who hold his place in their gift . He may look like the innocent flower , but he will he the serpent under it . Now , it is precisely in this class of cases that the most dangerous assaults may be made on the liberties of the people . The constitutional guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political parties , in high party times , and in the frenzy of political excitements , are most tempted to cast them down . It is then that the citizen flies to the Courts of Justice , as to an inviolable sanctuary ; but if a political Judge is the ministering priest at its altars , the place of safety becomes a scene of sacrifice . But the evil is not confined to this class of cases . The Judge is constantly solicited *nd tempted to the exercise of favoritism . His political friends at the bar receive indulgences which are not conceded  --  to others . In the details of practice , in matters of discretion , in cases of doubt upon the law or the evidence , the inclination of the Judge 's mind will always he in one direction . If this will he so , with reference to counsel , it will be more so with reference  --  to the litigants . The political friend will have the benefit of all doubts , and his adversary may rejoice if the partiality and favoritism stop there . Lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and matters of discretion are presented for judicial determination , will feel the immense force of these considerations . Subject these views to a practical test , and let any man make the case we suppose his own . A is an active politician ; B is equally active and influential in the opposite and dominant party . If an important question , in respect of property , should arise in the Courts , between A and B , would A prefer to have it determined by a Judge appointed in the present mode  --  a no party and unpolitical Judge  --  or by one whom B had caused to be elected at the last , and could cause to be re-elected or defeated , at the next , - election ? Every man feels that the answer to this question is self-evident . Every man feels that the moment party politics are introduced into the Courts of Justice , their sanctity is profaned , and no rights of person or property are safe .. Can any man tell us how party politics are to be kept out of the Courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It is tile most consummate folly to imnagine that the name of an office can change the nature of the man who fills it . The same causes , self-interest and habit , will make Judges as political as legislators ; and being political , one will just as soon as the other , lend himself to his party , and to party purposes ; to politicians , and to politic considerations , in matters of public and private concern . We deem it to be impossible , in the very nature of things-as human nature and political parties are constituted-for an elected Judge , who desires to be re.elected , ( as most Judges will , ) to he pure and impartial under the influence of selfinterest , and with a party motive to be partial and corrupt . Under the present system , Judges bold // during good behavior . If political considerations influence the appointing power , they relate rather to the past than the future . But once appointed , the judge no longer depends upon a party ; he holds by an independent tenure ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not warp his mind . He is not constrained to conciliate the favor of the dispensers of office , or buy the applause of the people , by the sacrifice of his integrity and independence . He little understands human nature , and has mingled among men to very little purpose , who does not see the gulf which lies between a Judge elected for a temporary period , and another appointed for a term closely approximating to the extreme limit of human life . In the one , the virtues and the magnanimity of the man have fair play and development ; in the other , they are chained down and crushed by a power against which most men would struggle in vain . Another cause of ihe greater purity of the indepen ( lent Judge , lies deep in human nature . He is independent , and therefore supposed to be above sinister influences . Being deemed incorruptible , no man atteml ) ts to corrupt him . It is said , if a woman hesitate , she is lost . A woman 's strength and safety often lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being deemed unassailable , it is unsolicited : whereas , solicitation might prove her ruin . An in ( lependent Judge , being deemed incorruptible , remains untempted and uncorrupted. , But the same law operates with equal force in the opposite direction , in the case of the elected dependent Judge . He is believed to be vulnerable to the influences to which other men , similarly situated , ordinarily yield . He is solicited , and he yields to the necessities of his situation . He becomes corrupt , because men have deemed it possible to corrupt him . As the safety of some lies in their supposed strength , so his overthrow is owing to his suspected weakness . " A popular Judge , " says the great Bacon , " is a deformed thing ; and plaudites ' are fitter for players than for magistrates . Do good to the people , love them , and give them justice ; but let it be , as the Psalm saith , nihil inde expectantes , ' looking for nothing , neither praise nor profit . " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what will be its effect on the people The need of justice is as universal as man . In a state of nature , natural jusVOL . IV. - NO . V. 35 529 tice needs political sanctions to enforce it . There , right is grasped , or wrong inflicted , by the strong hand . This creates one of the greatest necessities for civil society and political institutions . The man represented in the scriptures as " sitting under his own vine and fig tree , with none to molest or make him afraid , " is the very type and personification of a perfect civil state . Politically speaking , a man has no rights , except such as society effectually secures to him by institutions and laws faithfully administered . If our life , or limbs , or reputation , or property , may be rlestroyed with impunity by any man , or combination of men , because there are no laws , or the laws are not enforced for their protection , we have po right to life , limbs , reputation or property .

An active and sustained industry , the enterprise which achieves everything , because it dares everything , ( qualities which are so conspicuous in the Anglo-Saxon race , and especially marked in its American offshoot , ) could not exist if not fostered by laws and judicature . Acquisition is the spur to labor . The well we dig , the hut we rear , the clearing we make in the wilderness , the seed which we sow in hope , trusting to the Lord of the harvest for an abundant increase ; whi*tever thing of necessity or luxury we produce , to supply the wants of our physical , or gladden the love of beauty in our moral and intellectual , natures , become ours , by virtue of the labor which we have bestowed on them . In obedience to this great law , the ruder productions and implements of art are formed , and with advancing accumulations of property , spring up in all the paths of social life , poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the refinements of civilization . rhe sacredness of acquisitions makes wealth possible ; and wealth affords the leisure and means for those higher studies which minister to the noblest achievements in art and literature . The operations of this law are everywhere observable in the growth and decay of states . Without the dominion of . laws and tribunals of justice , the world would becorn.e a jungle , and its inhabitants ravin and devour each other like beasts of prey . Industry is the parent of wealth , and security the parent of indus // try . Security is scarcely more important than a sense of security . Fear paralyzes the bodies and minds of men . It is the worst of tyrants . Under its iron rule , " all virtue sickens , and all genius dies . " It smites the sturdy arm of toil with paralysis , and the teeming earth with blight . Nor do men labor merely because they love to gloat over the glittering heaps which they accumulate . The sanctities of the wedded state , and the tender love of offspring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enterprise and industry . We lay up wealth to secure comfort and consideration for our heirs . The house which we rear is to ahelter our children after we are gone , and the tfee which we plant at our door shall give a welcome shade to the posterity which inherits our blood and perpetuates our names . Nor is this a mere individual concern ; for , affecting all men , and in substantially the same way , it af. feds through their aggregation the whole people and state . It thus operates upon national industry and wealth ; visiting every stream , engine , and forge ; every forest which resounds to the stroke of the woodman 's axe , every field which whitens to the harvest , every road , lake , river and ocean , on which commerce , land or water borne , is busy in maintaining the intercourse of the world , by exchanging the products of every clime ; armies and navies  --  the glories of nations , in literature , arts , and arms , stand in this close relation to industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus see the importance of constituting our Judicial Institutions upon a principle which will make them worthy of , and secure to them , universal confidence . It is our boast , indeed it is a noble virtue , that we are a law-loving and law-abiding people . The judge should be the living voice of the law . The judicial is the highest of all magistracies ; elevated by its tenure beyond the vicissitudes of other official stations , having no fear but the fear of God , no aim but to administer justice , above all natural and " supernatural solicitings , " it strikes the mind with almost the awfulness of Eternal justice . From its high seats upon the Zion of our Constitution , and girt about by all the subject land , * it administers the principles of that univer sal law " whose seat is the bosom of God , whose voice is the harmony of the world . " Submission to the law , and security under the law , are mere correlatives . Universal confidence alone can secure that universal obedience in which lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obedience , and security , under a system so necessarily calculated by the very principle on which it is constituted , to make corrupt and vacillating judges , and to excite suspicion against their purity ? No character in ancient story makes a deeper or more uniform impression on the mind than that of the elder Brutus . He is an image of stern , inexorable justice . He rises upon the judgment-seat , and with unaverted face , pronounces the deathdoom of his son . The heart of the father bleeds , but the stern judge knows no relenting . How many Brutuses will Tammany Hall , National Hall , the Antirent districts , or any other districts , give to our annals to interest and ennoble distant generations ? What necessity calls for the proposed change ? Have the people lost their confidence in an independent judiciary Has their independence made the judges tyrannical or unjust ? Nothing of the kind is pretended . The reason given , is , that adherence to our present tenure and mode of appointment , violates the principle of representative government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms , and should be subordinated to his best interests . Those interests require an adherence to popular elections as to certain officers , and a departure from them as to others . What the people should desire is , the best means to effectuate the ends of society . Justice is the particular end ; by what means can it best be secured ? Justice is not a matter of will , of numbers , or majorities . Numbers constitute no element in judicature . The people , through their representatives , make the laws , and will ; and numbers , and majorities , enter into that process ; but the law once made , it ceases to be a matter of will , and its administration should be sacred from all interference , whether by minorities or majorities . The idea , therefore , is perfectly fallacious and absurd , that the appointment of judges should be brought nearer to the people , and that the judges should // 531 hold for temporary periods , to make them dependent on the popular will , because our institutions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : is it wise for us to make them political ? To render them objects of suspicion and contempt ? Is the character of a Scroggs or a Jeifries so admirable , that we wish to see it imitated in this country ? Should the judicial mind be stained with the dust of the political arena , and the emblematic ermine of his sacred office draggled with the filth of party politics ? The judge is emphatically the iEgis of the Constitution and the rights of the people . He stands aloof fiom the contentions of parties ; instead of representing a faction , he represents the whole people ; with a placid dignity he surveys the wide fields of human action : the rich man and the poor , the widow and the fatherless , the oppressed struggling against power , and legitimate authority struggling against popular excess , all appeal to him with confidence . With a voice unmoved by passion , and a heart which renders a perfect allegiance to the law , he interprets the sacred charter , and stands a ministering priest at the venerable altars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impartial administration of justice lies the sweet sense of security ; - life , liberty , reputation , the fruits of our toil , painfully gathered for those we love and who may enjoy them after we are dust , seem to us to be safe . Take away this sense of security , by destroying its best guaranties ,  --  unpolitical courts , unpolitical judges , unpolitical justice  --  and life becomes one lingering apprehension , and our death-beds would be tormented with the most agonizing anxieties for the fate of the dear ones whp should survive us . We could no longer bequeath our children to the justice of our country , but only to that Eternal Mercy which " tempers the wind to the shorn lamb . " To recapitulate our objections to the proposed judicial system : It will prove inadequate in force to the necessities of the State ; it will destroy the independence and purity of the judges , and confidence in the administration of justice ; and , destroying respect for the judges , the courts , and the laws , it will tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation , and property . We commend to the people of this great State , the following observations of that profound statesman , and early , and fast friend of America-Edmund Burke : " It has pleased Providence to place us in such a state , that we appear every moment to be upon the verge of some great mutations . There is one thing , and one thing only , which defies all mutation ; that which existed before the world , and will survive the fabric of the world itself ; I mean justice : that justice , which , emanating from the Divinity , has a place in the breast of every one of us , given us as our guide with regard to ourselves , and with regard to others , and which will stand after this globe is burned to ashes , our Advocate or our Accuser before the great Judge , when HE comes to call upon us for the tenor of a well-spent life .
