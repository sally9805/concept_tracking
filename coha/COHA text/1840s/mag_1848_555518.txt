txt THIS book is very unskilfully made up . Its contents are selected with little judgment from the miscellaneous writings of Sismondi , and are baldly and inaccurately translated . The biographical materials which are annexed are meagre and fragmentary ; but they add something to our previous knowl // edge of the labors and character of this excellent historian and sincere philanthropist , and increase our desire for further information . His unpublished papers and correspondence , if one may judge from the brief extracts given in this volume , must be entertaining and instructive , and we hope they may soon be given to the world in connection with a full account of his life and literary undertakings . Meanwhile , from materials already in print , we may form a brief sketch of his opinions and of the chief incidents in his career . John Charles Leonard Simonde de Sismondi was descended from a noble family of that name which flourished for a long time at Pisa , while that city was conspicuous among the Italian republics of the Middle Ages . When Pisa lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the family removed to France , and finally settled in IDauphiny , where in the course of generations their name was Gallicized into Simonde . The historian himself , led by the resemblance of the two names and by the preservation of the family arms , resumed the name of his Pisan ancestors . Having become Protestants , the revocation of the edict of Nantes drove the family again into exile , and they found a home at Geneva , then a city of refuge for the sufferers from religious persecution throughout Europe . In a country house , called Ch*itelaine , near the gates of this city , Sismondi was born , on the 9th of May , 1773 . His character , as is so frequently the case with distinguished men , appears to have been chiefly formed by the tender and judicious care of an excellent mother , whose counsels he continued to seek and rely upon long after he attained the age of manhood , and whose devotion he repaid by an almost romantic filial attachment . Educated by her till he was ten years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied Latin and Greek , while he practised music and drawing under private instructors , and subsequently attended lectures at Geneva to perfect his knowledge of the sciences . At school he was remarkable for conscientiousness and docility , and he gained prizes enough to attest his diligence and aptness to learn . Circumstances soon gave him a taste for political science , the theory of which he ever afterwards studied with ardor , though the gentleness of his character and his literary ambition prevented him from becoming an active politician . Rousseau and Necker were his countrymen ; new constitu // tions were soon to be rife at Paris , and the minds of most Europeans were excited to fever by the hope of an approaching political millennium . Children imitated their parents in playing at politics and forming ideal republics ; their boyish schemes of government reform were perhaps as wise , were certainly as practicable , as most of those afterwards formed by graybeards and members of constituent assemblies . Sismondi , then hardly ten years old , amused himself by playing statesman with his young friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young legislators met in a grove , where they erected a monument to Rousseau , and decreed by a unanimous vote that in their republic every person should be virtuous and happy . Sismondi , their elected chief , supported this decree in a written discourse of considerable length . The liberal and philanthropic spirit displayed in all his subsequent writings shows that this childish enthusiasm left a permanent impression on his character . The elder Sismondi was a man of some property , but his esteem for Necker having led him to make an injudicious investment in the French funds , his fortune was so much diminished that he thought it necessary for his son to be educated for commercial pursuits . The young man was therefore sent to Lyons , where he remained for some time in the countinghouse of an eminent Genevese firm . The business was distasteful to him , but he submitted to it with cheerfulness , labored assiduously , and became an excellent clerk . The practical knowledge thus acquired was afterwards of much service to him in his researches in political economy ; indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not carried too far , are not unfrequently among the most useful preparations for scientific inquiries and even for a literary life . Methodical industry , watchfulness , and great sagacity are as necessary for the merchant 's prosperity as for success in scientific investigations , historical research , and political studies . The easy tenor of Sismondi 's life at Lyons was soon interrupted by the political disturbances of the times ; the young liberal was to experience in all their severity the terrible consequences of too rashly reducing to practice those theoretical notions of liberty and equality which had captivated his boyish mind . The tumults at Lyons compelled him , in 1792 , to return to Geneva ; but even here he was not long to have a resting-place . French principles were // widely diffused there , and the popular party , soon gaining the ascendency , did not spare the aristocratic families who had hitherto ruled the city . The elder Sismondi was imprisoned , his house was stripped , and a heavy fine levied on the remainder of his property . Being released after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family in England . Landing there in safety with them in Fehruary , 1793 , he sought out an humble residence in the country , as most suitahle for his diminished means and friendless condition . During the spring and summer , the family boarded with the rector of Bearmarsh , a small parish in Sussex ; but finding the solitude there too gloomy for them , accustomed as they had been to society , they went to reside the following winter at Tenterden , in Kent . The active mind of young Sismondi found ample employment during this period of exile . He acquired the English language , and studied with ardor the literature and institutions of the country , and the system of agriculture which was practised on the great farms . The fruits of some of these studies appeared long afterwards in his economical writings . A short visit to London enabled him to visit the theatres , the courts of justice , the prisons , and many other objects of interest for a thoughtful mind ; he took full notes of all that he saw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much use to him in the labors of his maturer years . He always showed a strong but discriminating love for English institutions , admiring the trial by jury , and even the system of representation in Parliament , in spite of its glaring inequalities , as he discerned in it the principle of admitting different classes and interests , as well as mere numerical majorities , to have a voice in the national legislature . But he deplored the sad condition of the laboring poor , and the effect of aristocratic institutions in perpetuating and increasing monstrous inequalities of wealth . The spirits of Madame de Sismondi gradually sank under the sorrows of exile , and for her sake the family determined , though at the risk of meeting again the political persecution from which they had fled , to return to their native land . They accordingly set out for Geneva in the summer of 1794 , and again estahlished themselves at their beloved abode at Chhtelaine . But their misgivings proved to be too well founded ; Switzerland could not yet afford a home to persons // of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for old associates and for an order of things which had passed away ; and this time , the bitterness of exile was enhanced by grief for the cruel murder of a friend . The four former syndics of Geneva had been proscribed by the Jacobinical party , and one of them , M. de Caila , an intimate acquaintance of the Sismondis , came to ask shelter and concealment from them , till he could escape from the territory . The request was instantly granted , and he was lodged in a shed at the bottom of the garden , communicating by a back entrance with the road leading to the French frontier . Young Sismondi was placed as a sentinel to watch over the safety of their aged guest during the night . At two o'clock in the morning , hearing the noise of coming hoofs and voices , he knocked and called in order to wake N. de Caila ; but the old syndic , who was deaf and sound asleep , did not answer . The gendarmes soon arrived , and Sismondi , attempting to resist their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttend of a carbine . " His last hope was , that the noise and tumult at the door might awaken Monsieur Caila , and that he might still escape ; he listened with a bcating heart to hear the door open whi ( led to France . The shriek of Madame de Sismondi , on seeing bc r son struck to the ground hy a blow from the butt.end of a musket , did indeed awake M. de Caila , and he might still have fled , but disdaining a life to be purchased only by endangering those of his hosts , he generously presented himself to his executioners . Charles , still anxiously listening , had the anguish to hear the wrong door unlocked , and to see his revered friend led off to certain death . The day had scarcely broken on that painful night , when the family , still on their knees in prayer , heard the discharge of flre.arms , which finished the sufferings and the lives of the four virtuous magistrates . " - p. 26 . After this tragical event , the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Geneva . Intending to bid it farewell for ever , they sold Ch*telaine , which they ever afterwards called their Paradise Lost , and turned their weary steps towards Tuscany , the home of their ancestors . With the proceeds of the sale of their country-house , they intended to buy a farm , the product of which , with some economy , might suffice for their support . Young Sismondi was required to select the spot , and for this purpose he traversed // on foot many of the charming valleys which lie among the bends of the Apennines . " The rich territory of Pescia in the I/al di Nievole , between Lucca , Pistoja , and Florence , attracted his attention by the beauty and variety of its cultivation . Its verdant plain , watered with nstonishing art , cut into almost equal-sized fields , covered with corn , or cultivated as meadow-land , gardens , orchards , all bordered with poplars intertwined with the branches of the vines ; its hills formed in stages , where the ground , kept up by walls of trees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slopes , cheerful alleys of vines , pale olive woods , groves of orange and citron trees ; lastly , even the summits of the mountains crowned with forests of chestnuts , and ornamented with villages , filled him with admiration . He did not hesitate fixing his family in this beautiful industrious abode . He found , in a little valley called I/al Cisiusa , a country-house in an enchanting situation , standing halfway down the southern slope of the bill , from whence the eye wanders over the plain of Pescia , whose towers and steeples are outlined on the verdure of the opposite bill . It was in this agreeable abode , settled with his family , thiit Sismondi gave himself up to the care of its cultivation , and to the pleasure of deep study ? - p. 6 . This last removal took place in 1795 , and the family remained for five years in their new resting-place . The father , indeed , soon returned to Geneva , leaving the farm at Val Chiusa under the charge of his son . The ground had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on what is called the inetayer system , the landlord furnishing the stock and agricultural implements , the tenant performing the labor , and the products of the year , with a proper reservation for seed , being equally divided between the two at harvest . Land is universally cultivated upon this system in Tuscany and many other parts of Continental Europe ; and its effect in maintaining the peasantry in a contented and prosperous condition , supplying the wants of all without ministering too much to the inordinate extravagance of a few , besides preventing the population from increasing faster than the means of subsistence , is unquestionable . Sismondi was an attentive observer of the workings of this plan of social economy , contrasting its results with those which he had lately seen in England , where the system of large farms , money rents , and . pauper labor prevails , with its constantly accumulating train of evils . The comparison was a striking one , and naturally ex // cited his curiosity as to the causes of the vast difference in the social condition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unsuccessful ; and many years elapsed before he was able to shake off the old prejudices of the political economists , and to give the true explanation of this inequality in the distribution of happiness . With his native kindness of heart , Sismondi became warmly interested in the happiness of the Tuscan peasantry . He liked to visit them and observe their household arrangements , to watch the management of their vineyards and farms , and to be present at their harvest and vintage feasts . His mother retained some of her aristocratic notions , but her benevolence quickly triumphed over the force of old associations , and she soon shared her son 's delight in these rural enjoyments . The first fruits of the observations thus made appeared in the volume on the Agriculture of Tuscany , which Sismondi published at Geneva in 1801 . His mind was now teeming with literary projects , and he pursued his political and historical studies with great ardor . But he was not permitted to follow them without interruption . Inoffensive as his life and character appeared , political persecution had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found no refuge from it even in Tuscany . At this period , the Austrians and the French alternately had command in this region , and a stranger in the land like Sismondi , not disposed to sympathize warmly with either party , naturally became an object of suspicion to both . Before he had been more than a year at Val Chiusa , he was seized by the Austrians , with sixteen other inhabitants of Pescia , and imprisoned during the whole summer of 1796 . Thus equally harassed and oppressed by the friends and the opponents of liberal principles and free institutions , his mind was not apt to receive any improper bias in favor of either party . Persecuted and driven from one home to another by the former , he was now to learn , within the walls of an Austrian jail , that the Jacobins were not alone in the practice of tyranny and injustice ; but for the hardships he was now made to suffer , he might have renounced the generous enthusiasm of his boyhood . But his placable and unselfish disposition was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and proceedings of both parties , not suffering the abstract merits of principles to be darkened through // the outrageous conduct of those by whom they were professed . He never became an ahsolutist nor a radical , but adhered firmly to catholic opinions in politics throughout his life , arguing with equal earnestness against universal suffrage on the one hand , and unlimited monarchy on the other . The confinement was hard to hear for one who entered so heartily into rural pleasures , and had so keen a relish for study and literary pursuits . The hardship was greater , for his jailers , with true Austrian policy , denied him the use of pen and paper , and his active mind was left to prey on itself under the corroding influence of solitary thought , which so often drives less richly furnished and happily balanced intellects to insanity . From the terrace of his sister 's house the prison was visible , his songs could reach his mother 's ear , and he could even converse with her by signs . Soon a more direct correspondence was opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antonio , whose business it was to convey to the prisoner his food . " Bits of paper , ends of pencil , were hidden in the candlestick , in the bread , in the meat , even in the bottles of wine ; and the letters of Madame de Sismondi , safely received , were every day answered . The necessity of cheering and consoling his mother , and a lively attachment to those principles from which he never deviated , are apparent in all these little notes , in which Sismondi continually repeats ,  --  ' Love me ; do not afflict yourself ; when I converse with you , and when I read , I feel myself really out of prison . ' " During the days of suffocating heat , so difficult to bear when air and space are meted out , a simple mark of the attachment and goodness of his bailiff cheered the solitude of Charles . Every evening ices were brought , as from Madame de Sismondi . The thanks of the prisoner , and the astonishment of the mother , discovered the affectionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captivity of his young master : in his simplicity he did not suspect that the notes he carried might betray his generous imposition . " - p. 27 . He was released at the end of a few months , but was not allowed to enjoy his freedom long . The jealousy of the government , when once aroused , could not be quieted , and before a year had elapsed he was again arrested , though there was no definite charge against him , and doomed to a second term of imprisonment . This time , however , he was treated more leniently. // " He was confined in an airy convent at Pescia , and the means of writing were not denied him ; he had permission to search the library of the monks , and , with this condition , imprisonment would not have appeared hard , if the health of his mother had not failed from vexations and anxiety . Examinations had not been ahle to produce a single charge against him , but still his promised enlargement was deferred from day to day , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of Madame de Sismondi . With gay and gentle chat her son endeavoured to divert her grief . " You do not know the history , ' wrote he , of one of your English notes , found when they took away my pens and ink , and carried to the commandant , then to the vicar , who each did their utmost to find some learned philologist who could explain it . At last an abh6 presented himself ; but in vain had he recourse to the dictionary ; understanding nothing of this conjuring hook , he ended hy declaring himself too orthodox to decipher the writing of a woman . Then they sent to Pistoia ; the gentlemen translators could not understand how writing in English could only be ahout my dinner and my supper ; in short , they understood nothing ahout it , hecause they wished to understand too much . ' " - p. 28 . The mother of Sismondi had naturally enough conceived a strong prejudice against the principles of the French Revolution , the assumed regard for political freedom and the rights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She could not forget that it was the inroad of new ideas which had exiled her from her country , that a republican soldier had nearly killed her son before her eyes , that it was in the name of liberty that her guest , her friend , had been shot , almost in her presence . " Her son remonstrated and argued against this indiscriminate censure of a great cause on account of the unworthy conduct of those who advocated and upheld it ; and his letters on this subject certainly lost none of their force from the circumstance that they came from the depths of an Austrian prison . " If you could say , - These are tyrants , monsters , Frenchmen ; they only do what it is their business to do ; injustice triumphs , it is the lot of human kind ; virtue will have its turn , - you would console yourself , ' wrote Charles to his mother . But no , these are the favorites of your heart , those whom you so ardently wished for , those from whom you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much cruelty . You do not know // how to reconcile your opinions , your feelings , and your sufferings ; and till you are convinced that there is neither honor , justice , virtue , nor happiness for a country except in freedom , and that a counter-revolution is a hundred times worse than a revolution , you will doubly suffer . ' " Do not blaspheme philosophy , ' he again writes , for she is gentle and consoling , and religion still more so . The sermon I read to-day enchanted me ; the text was , " The works of the wicked are deceitful . " I read it in Italian to my priest , and I do not think the words have lost any thing of their eloquence , it is become so easy to me to translate as I read . ' " - pp. 28 , 29 . We know nothing of the circumstances which caused Sismondi , while in Tuscany , to be repeatedly imprisoned by both parties ; on this point , as on many others , the information afforded by M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the extracts from the unpublished memoir of his life and labors , is provokingly imperfect . He was the last person , we should suppose , to engage willingly in political agitations and conspiracies . He liked the quiet of a country life , his tastes were literary and refined , and at no period of his subsequent career did he ever betray the disposition of a demagogue , a seeker of court favor , or a revolutionist . But he was frank and decided in the expression of his opinions , and , refusing to side entirely with either party , was probably unreserved in his condemnation of both . " I am accused of no fact , " he writes ; " the witnesses have only their opinions to allege . " The following passages are taken from notes written in English , with a pencil , and sent secretly to his mother , while he was in prison , in January , 1796 - " Do you still blaspheme the noble English liberty , the habeas corpus , the trial by jury , and fixed laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them would shelter us from the injustice under which I am suffering , if we were in France . " " I am not a Frenchman , I do not approve their actions nor their government , at this time he had been arrested by the French party , but I adhere more firmly than ever to the opinion , that without liberty there is neither honor , nor justice , nor virtue , nor happiness , and that a counter-revolution is still worse than the revolution which preceded it . I am not a friend to democracy , but I should be ashamed to call myself an aristocrat , 4* // and to bear this name in common with the lower nobility of Pescia. " - p.29 . And again he writes - " As to politics , I would say little . My opinions on liberty are too steady ever to change : as to the French , what they make me suffer will not make me think worse of them , nor will it ever make me think better of kings and their satellites . " - p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sismondi was ever again molested on account of his political opinions , and the rest of his life presents but few incidents besides those which usually mark the career of a person devoted constantly to literary and scientific pursuits . But his turn of mind was not that merely of a recluse scholar , uninterested in what was passing around him , and busied only with abstract speculations and the history and literature of the past . On the contrary , his studies and successive publications all had a practical aim ; even his researches in history , which absorbed so much of his attention , were undertaken only with a view to investigate the causes which affect the present condition of mankind , and to elucidate the political and social economy of states by the experience of former ages . He was no dreamer , no mere enthusiast , though he retained to the last the generous sympathies , the quick and warm-hearted benevolence , which were first developed in the political fancies of his boyhood ; he was constantly in search of the means of eradicating vice and misery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and independence , the general well-being , of all classes in society . The spirit of a comprehensive and judicious philanthropy is the characteristic feature of all his writings , and gives them an interest far beyond that of the subjects of which they respectively treat . In 1796 , the year after his removal to Italy , Sismondi began his Inquiries into the Constitutions of Free Nations , a task which occupied most of his time for five years , though it was never completed or published . The subject at that time had unusual interest , as the French had hardly ceased making experiments upon it on a grand scale at Paris , and some of the strongest heads in Europe and America were still affected , through their hopes and fears as to the result of these trials , with a sort of political delirium . Sober goodsense , // a great aversion to extremes , and much historical research , the fruits of which were skilfully applied to illustrate and confirm his doctrines , were displayed in the only portions of this extensive work which ever saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were published in 1836 , as the first volume of his Studies in the Social Sciences . His original design was very comprehensive . " In the first two hooks were contained the exposition of my principles of liberty and government , in the third the analysis of the British constitution , in the fourth that of the French republic , in the fifth the ancient constitutions of Spain , in the sixth those of the Italian republics ; the four following , on Sweden , Poland , the Hanseatic towns , and the United States of America , were scarcely sketched out . " We may well suppose that a person engaged in such speculations became an object of suspicion to the despotic government of Austria , then wrestling with the athletic young democracy of France for the preservation of her power in Italy . But her fears were unfounded ; so temperate an exhibition of political doctrine , not gilded by rhetorical ornament or fervid declamation , nor seasoned by appeals to popular prejudices , need not have alarmed either the legitimatists or the radicals . Sismondi would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a century , in setting forth his calm and philosophical view of the matter ; it was well that the publication even of a part was deferred till the storm had subsided . The labor bestowed on this unpublished work , in one respect at least , was not without results ; it gave a new direction to his studies , and finally led him to undertake one of the two great histories with which his name is inseparably connected . In 1798 , he writes , " My inquiries into the constitutions of the Italian republics obliged me to study their history , and from this period are dated my endeavours to become master of it , and my resolution to write it . " But his appearance before the public as the historian of the Italian republics was still long delayed from the difficulty of finding a publisher , and from the extent and intricacy of the inquiries which formed the necessary preliminaries to so great an undertaking . Meanwhile , his pen was not idle , and his thoughts recurred to those great problems in the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attention . His taste and feelings ever inclined more to political and econom // ical speculations than to narrative and historical research ; if he did not always excel in them , perhaps the only reason was that he felt too strongly ; the warmth of his heart sometimes blinded his judgment . About the year 1800 , Sismondi returned to Geneva , where he was appointed secretary to the Chamber of Commerce . For this restoration to his native place lie was indebted to the discernment and clemency of the First Consul , who quickly saw that there was nothing to be feared from one of his temperament . When he became very intimate with Madame de Sta*l , however , there is reason to believe that Bonaparte watched his conduct with some suspicion . At Geneva , after the essay on the Agriculture of Tuscany , the appearance of which has been already mentioned , Sismondi published , in 1803 , his work on Commercial Wealth , in three volumes octavo . Upon this treatise he set little value afterwards ; at the time of its publication he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to apply the whole theory of political economy to France , of which the canton of Geneva was now a department . He advocated entire freedom of trade , and the destruction of monopolies , of the protective system , and of all restraints upon industry . Afterwards , when he began to suspect that the mere production of wealth did not always tend in an equal ratio to promote the well-being of a community , he recalled many of the opinions he had hurriedly expressed in this work , and in fact substituted doctrines for them which went to place the whole science of political economy on a new footing . When this work came from the press , however , it was favorably received , and added considerably to the reputation of its author . The professorship of political economy was then vacant in the university of Wilna , and it was offered to him with a handsome salary . The narrowness of his present means inclined him to look favorably on this proposition , and it is probable he would have accepted it , if he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mother , who was still at Val Chiusa . She , indeed , besought him to listen only to his own interests , reminding him " that foreigners , scholars , and men of letters are better received in the North than in other parts of Europe , that they find more roads to fortune open to them , and that they often make rich marriages . " But the alarm and depression of spirits of the poor // mother , frightened at the prospect of a long separation from her son , were easily seen through this mask of composure and Sisruondi , rightfully considering his duty to her as first in importance , declined the professorship . Obliged to seek occupation of some kind as a means of support , Sismondi now thought of entering upon public life , and of finding employment under the administration of the First Consul , for which he was well fitted by early training in the habits of business , and by facility in the use of his pen . " But the prudence of Madame de Sismondi turned him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew himself . His bold convictions , which he would never have been able to bend to the varying exigencies of politics ; his generous sentiments , which it would have been as difficult for him to sacrifice as to satisfy ; an absolute love of right , which would not easily admit of temporizing or delay ; that deep pride , which causes embarrassment in the presence of others when it does not give the power to govern them ; the enthusiasm of a thinker , the awkwardness of a recluse , the candor of an upright man , little flexibility , no address , hut a strong intellect , high talent , constant meditation on right and useful things , rendered M. de Sismondi less suited for public affairs than intellectual labor . His mother persuaded him to become an historian . He followed this advice , which was also in accordance with his own taste , and also because he had not found it possible to publish his manuscript on the Constitutions of free nations , of which be had brought the first part to Pescia . Theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had formerly done . Their time seemed to be gone by , - that of history was come . - p.8 . The great defect of the subject which he had chosen , the history of the Italian republics , was its want of unity ; Sismondi was aware of this , and exerted all his art , by tracing out the common features of their origin , progress , and fall , to weave together their intricate annals , and the effects produced on each by local peculiarities and the characters of their distinguished citizens , into one consistent and uniform whole . Of course , the thread of his inquiries was the progress and decline of liberty in these active and turbulent civic communities , and its general effect on the social condition of the Italians . Portions of the subject were splendid , and required but little skill on the part of the historian // to make the exhibition of them produce a strong effect on the mind of the reader . But there were many obscure dissensions and unimportant wars , many intricacies of local politics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magnificence or impressiveness of the picture as a whole . These needed to be but lightly sketched and thrown into the background , so that the attention of the observer should not be diverted from the grand features of the story . Sismondi 's patient and long-continued study of the subject exalted every portion of it in his estimation , and led him to spend too much labor upon its unimportant details . It might have been expected , then , that the portion of his task which he was obliged to pass over with the widest generalizations , crowding the events together , and bringing out into full relief only the principal characters and most striking features of the age , would be the most successfully executed . This was the case with the first six chapters , in which he gives a rapid sketch of the history of Italy , from the reign of Odoacer , its first barbarian monarch , in the latter part of the fifth century , up to the peace of Worms between the Church and the Empire , which was made six hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of the Italian republics , the proper task of Sis*nondi , which begins late in the tenth century , and extends to the early part of the sixteenth , when Charles V. was crowned at Bologna . The earlier period , to which the preliminary chapters relate , is an obscure one , especially towards its close ; profound darkness seems to rest over the whole peninsula , broken only by faint gleams of light from the expiring Roman civilization , and by an uncertain dawn that preceded the revival of letters by the moderns . At its commencement , says Sismondi , " the nation had reached the last stage of degradation to which despotism can reduce a civilized people ; at its close , it had recovered all the energy , all the independence of character , which the struggle with adversity can give to a barbarous nation . " His object was to give a brief view of this transition , to show how the infusion of fresh and vigorous blood from the North had resuscitated and strengthened the lifeless remains of Italian greatness , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than suffered conquest . // " His introduction had satisfied both Madame de Stadi , who heard it read with lively interest , and Madame de Sismondi , who mixed with her praises the counsels of the most delicate taste . Take care , ' she wrote to her son , to avoid every thing which approaches at . ever so great a distance the manner of the philosophical haranguers of 1789 , who thunder as soon as they open their mouths ; warmth must come from development . It is agreeable to perceive the fire under the ashes before the explosion , and the reader more willingly shares the opinions of the author when they come to him by degrees . ' " - p. 32 . The beginning of his history Sismondi wrote and rewrote with great ardor and rapidity ; his enthusiasm was kindled by the novelty of his task , and by the inspiring views which he gained of the destinies of the race from this turning- point in the annals of mankind . But as he went deeper and deeper into the obscure chronicles of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of petty wars and confused politics , his ardor cooled , his task seemed feebly done , and he began to despond . " His father and grandmother bad listened coldly to the first chapters of his history , and Madame de Sta*3l , so delighted with the introduction , treated what followed as dry and wanting life . " He repeated his attempts with unwearied perseverance , going over the ground again and again , but remaining still uncertain as to the success of his efforts ; a young and sensitive author , if really possessing taste and talent , usually finds it more difficult to satisfy himself than to please the public . His mother , from whom not one of his feelings or thoughts was hidden , tried to divert and sustain him , mingling excellent advice with her encouragements . " These exhortations were seconded by less sedentary habits , by excursions to Coppet , where Sismondi often staid several days , by journeys to the glaciers , and lastly , by the lively and animating conversation of Madame de Sta*il , and of the chosen society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his history in 1803 , but the first two volumes were not published till 1807 , when they appeared both in French and German , from the press of Gessner at Zurich . They do not seem to have had brilliant success , but worked their way gradually to quite a high place in the public favor , so that the author was encouraged to persevere . The third and fourth followed in the course of the next year ; // and in 1809 , Gessner being dead , Nicolle , of Paris , published the next four volumes , and a new edition of the former ones . Three more appeared in June , 1815 , and five others , which concluded the work , were issued at Paris in January , 18l8. * In the preface to the finished history , Sismondi speaks with honest pride of the consistency , in language and opinion , which he had maintained throughout . During the twenty-two years which he had given to this task , Europe had undergone the most violent convulsions ; the fall of the French republic , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the final restoration of the Bourbons , were all comprised within this period ; and of these events Sismondi had been no unconcerned , often not an inactive , spectator . But during this time , he says , " I have followed but one direction , 1 have constantly used the same language , and the political principles which I avowed in the first volume are found without alteration in the sixteenth . " His object had been , not to recommend to the nations of Europe any precise form of government , " but to make them feel the importance , the necessity , of liberty , in order to preserve the virtue and the dignity , no less than the happiness , of man . And this liberty , " he adds , " may exist in monarchies as well as in republics , in confederations or in a city which is one and indivisible . " The amount of labor which he had given to the work was immense . " In a task , " he writes , " which has continued for at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged constantly to read and think in Italian , or in Latin , and occasionally in German , Spanish , Greek , English , Portuguese , and Proven*al . " He makes this statement , however , while apologizing for the faults of his style in French , and does not mean to assert that all this toil was devoted to the composition of his history alone ; for a portion of these twenty years , as we shall see , was occupied * This account is taken from a postscript which Sismondi added to the preface when he had completed his work ; and as elsewhere in this preface he speaks of having devoted twenty-two years to this history , which fixes the commencement of his researches for it in 1796 , though he did not begin to write till 1803 , it must he correct . Yet in the chronological list of his writings , which he drew up a few weeks before his death , he places the publication of the last five volumes , from the 12th to the 16th , in 1815. // by other literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all grew out of his studies in Italian history , or were suggested by them . Of the researches which he had undertaken , to secure the fidelity of his narrative , he speaks as follows - " I have lived in Tuscany , the country of my ancestors , almost as much as at Geneva , or in France ; I have nine times traversed Italy in different directions , and have visited nearly all the places which were the theatre of any great event . I have labored in almost all the great libraries , I have searched the archives of many cities and of many monasteries . The history of Italy is. intimately connected with that of Germany ; I have made the tour of the latter country also , in order to seek out historical documents . Finally , I have procured at any price the books which throw light upon the period and the people that I have undertaken to commemorate . " A work executed with so much zeal and industry , and pervaded by an excellent spirit , could not fail to obtain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , complete , and judicious ; the writer 's judgment is neither blinded by prejudice , nor warped by fondness for original speculations . M. Mignet 's opinion of it is very favorable , and few will be inclined to make any deductions from the praise that he has awarded it . " M. de Sismondi has treated this subject in a manner at once learned and brilliant . He has gone back to the origin of those numerous cities , proudly erected into republics on the ruins of the imperial power , or of feudal establishments ; he has described their constitutions , shown their interior existence , related their struggles , exhibited their end . Turbulent Genoa , heroic Milan , mournful Pisa , prudent and powerful Venice , democratic Florence , and all those republics which , confined in a small space , had during a short period more animated life , more intoxicating passions , more varying vicissitudes , than the kingdoms of the continent ; and which have all fallen sooner or later under an ambitious usurper , because they were too free , , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak ; this is the long and grand history which has been retraced by M. de Sismondi . He has drawn it with vast knowledge , in a noble spirit , with vigorous talent , considerable art , and much eloquence . The interest which he gives to it comes , as it always does , from the interest he takes in it . He does not . // merely relate the events ; he passes judgment on them , he is moved hy them ; we feel the heart of the man heat in the pa , es of the historian . He carries us on with animation , his coloring is free , his thoughts are judicious . " - p. 10 . During most of the time occupied in the composition of this work , Sismondi resided at Geneva , enjoying the society of that place and its vicinity , which was then very brilliant , and making frequent journeys to Paris and Italy . He was intimate with Necker , and was a frequent guest at Coppet , which the genius of Madame de Stahl had then made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific men in Europe . Here he often found Benjamin Constant , and Muller , the learned historian of Switzerland , and the elder Seblegel , besides De Candolle and Cuvier , then occupied by those researches in the natural sciences which have since immortalized their names . Sismondi profited largely by intercourse with such men , without losing the simplicity of his character , or having his taste corrupted by the somewhat affected brilliancy and theatrical turn of mind which are the only drawbacks from the fame of the illustrious woman in whose house they assembled . His good-sense and sound discretion , which seemed to indicate that he was of English , rather than French or Italian parentage , remained unharmed by the petty vanities and jealousies , the love of glitter and tendency to display , which are apt to be manifested in a literary clique otherwise so splendid and imposing . He appreciated the talents and virtues of Madame de Sta*l , without being blind to her faults ; and she gave him her friendship and confidence without reserve , entering warmly into all his literary plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a young author is exposed . His mother appears to have been doubtful about the value of the influence and advice which he was thus receiving ; perhaps she was a little pained by observing her son so much devoted to the society of another woman , however illustrious , though the source of attraction was only intellectual , founded on sympathy in common pursuits . " Promise me , " she writes , " at least before you publish , to consult some clever person not of the court of Madame de Stad . " In 1805 , it was arranged that Sismondi should be the companion of Madame de Sta*il in her excursion to Italy , a journey so well remem // bered from its having furnished the materials for her celebrated novel , Corinne . Madame de Sismondi was a little uneasy at this , though she saw that her son could not fail to profit from a journey performed under auspices so favorable . She did not discourage the project , but warned him against expecting too much from it , and against some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah ! " writes she , " you are going , then , to travel with Madame de Sta*l ! You are only too happy to have such a companion . But take care , travelling is like a short marriage : always , always together , people see too much of one another ; defects have no corner in which they can hide themselves ; the spoiled child of nature and the world , as she is , must have in the mornings moments of fatigue and ennui ; and I know who is revolted by a defect in those he loves . He should therefore he doubly attentive to open his eyes to his own defects , and to keep them steadily shut to those of his companioa . How curious I am to know how she will get on in society in that country ! No doubt she will form particular intimacies only with those who know French ; for how can she express her thoughts in Italian ? she ! it is impossible . However well she may understand it , know it , read Dante better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the means , in that language , of making conversation flow as it ought . How can words be found in the language , when opin. ions and ideas are yet unborn ? You will see that she will not like the Italian prosody either . However , The will be admircd , and she will excite fanaticism ( fera fanatisma ) , as we say . " - pp. 34 , 35 . It is amusing to find that her prediction was exactly fulfilled . Sismondi writes from Rome , - " Madame de Sta*l pleases everywhere , but she finds nothing which pleases her ; she is angry at this fine-sounding language , which says nothing . In the poetry of which they boast to her she finds no ideas , and in conversation no sentiment . " She had certainly chosen her companion not because he could share her enthusiasm for the arts , or could lose himself in the poetic reveries in which she so much delighted when standing upon ground that was hallowed by the recollections of the past . Sismondi came to Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not even to revive his classical associations , but as a philanthropist , to study the present condition of the Italians , to investigate the causes of the degradation and misery of // their lower classes , and to suggest plans for rescuing them from poverty and debasement . In the eloquent and gloomy picture , which he afterwards published , of the Roman Campagna , he frankly confesses his want of taste , and his lack of sensibility to the wonders of nature and art . " Painters , " he says , " are thrown into ecstasies by the warm and rich tints which are reflected from these desert fields , and by the beauties which they lend to the landscape . I must confess that all these sensations , all these emotions , are unknown to me ; defects in my organs of sense deprive me of nearly all the enjoyments which others find in the arts . The rich colors of the Campagna of Rome , that I hear spoken about , entirely elude my sight , as the red ray is invisible to my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but among the ancient monuments , though some of them remind me of the glorious period of wisdom and virtue , far the greater number , and those which are most imposing from their size , and even from their beauty , remind one only of the opulence of those masters of the world , who had subdued nature because they had enslaved man , and who thought the work of a hundred thousand arms was not ill employed , if it procured for them the enjoyments of a moment . Thus my defective sight and the thoughts which I am most accustomed to indulge act together in annihilating , so far as I am concerned , all the charm which allures other travellers to Rome . " - . Ktudes sur l'J. *conomie Politique , II . 8 , 9 . This is a manly avowal , which shows the straightforward honesty of the man , and his hearty dislike of pretension and false sentiment . It is not wonderful that he should have written thus , though we are surprised that one like Madame de Sta*l should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes to see and a heart to feel for the depopulation of the country , and the wretchedness of those who cultivated the soil , especially when he contrasted their condition with the general well-being of the peasants of Tuscany . The picture which he drew of the Campagna surpasses in moral effect the most glowing descriptions by his companion , the eloquent and all-gifted Corinne . The travellers returned to Geneva in the summer of 1805 , and after rather more than a year 's interval devoted to their respective literary occupations at home , Madame de Staid invited Sismondi again to accompany her in a visit to Germany , an excursion no less fruitful than the former one , as in it she completed her preparations for that work which first raised // th ) German literature to the high estimation which it now enjoys in France and England . The first two volumes of his history were now published , and his companion was charmed to present to every one , as she said , " the new historian , preceded by his fame . " She occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choice society that this gay capital could afford was collected at her evening parties . Surrounded by persons of eminent rank or great talents , who were noted for their polished manners and sparkling conversation , Madame de Sta*il strove to forget Paris and the sorrows of her exile . But through all the splendor and festivities by which they were surrounded , Sismondi saw the feeble and depressed condition of Austria , which seemed to be waiting only for the final blow from the resistless power of Napoleon . He saw the desperate state of the finances , the uncertainty of private fortunes , the languor of the government , and the general anxiety and distress of the people . His active mind could not rest without attempting to investinate the cause of these evils , and to find a remedy for them ; though the result of his speculations could hardly have been satisfactory even to himself . He wrote and published a tract on Paper Money , which attracted considerable attention at the time , though it was not calculated to add much to his fame as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and argued strenuously in favor of the suppression of paper as a medium of exchange , and the restoration of a metallic currency . This advice may have been good enough , as far as it went ; but the adoption of it would have been a very insufficient restorative for an empire that was apparently sinking into dissolution . His anonymous biographer s estimate of it is quite too favorable . Strongly supported by the Prince de Ligne , considered , discussed , and praised by the ministers of Austria and Prussia , presented to the Archdukes John and Charles , approved by the Archduke t*enier , attentively read in manuscript by the emperor , and afterwards printed at Weimar , the paper of Sismondi , which for a moment raised the hopes of commerce , had no other result than to give its author the satisfaction of having thrown light on an important subject , and having conscientiously labored for the interests of the community. ** Returning to Geneva , Sismondi again applied himself with indefatigable ardor to historical studies and the labors of the 5* // desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish the publishers of the Biographie Universelle with all the lives of distinguished Italians which were required by the plan of their work , this being a task for which he was particularly fitted by his knowledge of Italian history and literature . He wrote them all , and sent them to Paris , long before the first volume of this excellent biographical work appeared , in 1811 . As soon as this labor was completed , he undertook another subsidiary task , to fill up the intervals of time that were not required for his history , as the only relaxation that he allowed himself was a change of employment . He prepared a course of lectures on the Literature of the South of Europe , which he delivered at Geneva in the winter of 1811-12 . Being well qualified for the work by his thorough knowledge of all the languages of Latin derivation , and by his researches in history , which were so extensive as to render him familiar with the literature of all the countries in which these languages were spoken , he soon found that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lectures , and that they might be woven together into a literary and critical history of some magnitude . He labored upon it during his residence in Italy in 1813 , and published it in the following year , in four volumes octavo . The work rose at once to quite a high place in public favor , and has retained its popularity ever since . " Many of my readers , " says Hallam , " must be acquainted with the Littrature du Midi , by NI . Sismondi ; a work written in that flowing and graceful style which distinguishes the author , and succeeding in all that it seeks to give , - a pleasing and popular , yet not superficial or unsatisfactory , account of the best authors in the Southern languages . " But this sound English critic objects , and with some reason , to Sismondi 's occasional tendency - probably derived from his recent visit to Germany and his acquaintance with German literature - to over-refinement in criticism , and to contrive strange hypothetical explanations of the nature and design of some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hypothesis , that Cervantes did not intend , in Don Quixote , to write a satire upon knight-errantry , but to make his hero a man of noble heart , high purposes , and a fine imagination , whose brain was somewhat over-heated by the sight of daily oppression and wrong , which he vainly attempted to re // dress ; in short , he would have us believe , that the worthy knight of La Mancha was only a sort of Tancred or Rinaldo man qu6 , " fallen on evil tongues and evil days . " This is of a piece with some recent follies in Shakspearian criticism , the authors of which would fain persuade us that the great dramatist did not intend to present Falstaff as a coward , or Macbeth as a tyrant and a murderer . It is right to say , however , that Sismondi did not often fall into this strange perversion of ingenuity . lATe have seen that the conclusion of the History of the Italian Republics was published in January , 1818 ; and as early as 1lay in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still larger work , the History of the French , which afforded him his chief occupation for the rest of his life . His preparations for this great task were made with the same thoroughness and conscientious diligence which he had shown in all his previous undertakings . He immediately hegan to collect the necessary books ; the purchase of an extensive library , formed without regard to expense , had become necessary to him , and he set about the collection of one with great ardor . " I look upon these quartos , " he remarked , " with a sort of respect and fear , when I reflect that I must go through them all , and must make myself as familiar with them as I have long been with the collection of Muratori . " Hitherto , he had worked chiefly by means of borrowed books , and had been obliged , therefore , to write out copious extracts . The ownership of the volumes enabled him to change this plan ; instead of copying at length , he prepared annals in which the memorable events of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drew them from the original sources . This mode led to a rigid comparison of the different chroniclers , their several accounts of the same transaction being placed side by side , and the discrepancies were consequently detected with ease . After three years spent in preparation , the first three volumes of the work were published , in 1821 ; the others followed , usually three at a time , at intervals of every two or three years , till 1842 , in which year the twenty-ninth and last volume was published , after the death of the author . He wrote the concluding sentence of it only five weeks before he died . The work properly begins with the reign of Clovis , though some preliminary chapters relate to the condition of Gaul // under the Romans , and it ends with the accession of Louis XVJ. , thus comprising a period of about thirteen centuries . As a whole , it is pronounced with quite general consent to be by far the ablest and most trustworthy history of France that has yet been written . Other historians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of style ; their narratives may be more flowing and spirited , their descriptions more vivid and picturesque , their philosophy more comprehensive and profound . But no one has been more cautious and thorough in the investigation of facts , or more accurate and conscientious in the exhibition of them . Freedom from prejudice and loyalty to truth might be inscribed on the work as its motto . Sismondi regarded history as the foundation of the social sciences , and as most precious from the perpetual illustrations it affords to moral , political , and economical truths . " No one has so well shown , " says lVlignet , " the influence which economical changes , taking place in the interior condition of a nation , have exercised on the form of its government and the crises of its existence . " He complains , however , that Sismondi has judged the state of manners and the actions of men in every age , not by estimating the ideas and the wants of that age , but according to a moral rule which is absolute and inflexible ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He says , also , that we sometimes perceive the spirit of the Protestant and the republican citizen of Geneva in the severity of the historian towards Catholicism and royalty . But he concludes with the following high praise , which may be admitted to be a fair estimate of the work . " In spite of these imperfections , the History of France is a vast monument raised to the honor and for the instruction of our country , by a man who loved it , though he was sometimes severe towards it : a man of immense knowledge , of sound and steady judgment , of great ability , of scrupulous honesty ; who , belonging to two distinct eras , has marked the transition between the school of the eighteenth century , whose generous principles he has followed up without its scoffing levity , and that of our own time , whose knowledge he possessed without having all its freedom of mind . " - pp. 20 , 21 . After the abdication of Napoleon in 1814 , Geneva , which had been annexed to France , recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the supreme council , // assisted in the work of reorganizing the little republic . But his joy at the re*istablishment of his country 's independence was darkened by many perplexities and fears ; the wretched policy of the restored Bourbons , and the doubts as to the future disposition which the Allies might make of the territories that had been wrested from France , cast a gloomy cloud over the future . Sismondi had been no Bonapartist ; if no other cause had given him a bias against Napoleon , he must have imbibed one from his long intimacy with Madame de Sta*l . He must have shared her feelings towards the man who had inflicted on her so many slights and petty persecutions . But neither was he a loyalist , and he dreaded the consequences of the subjugation of France upon the great cause of political freedom throughout Europe . When he visited Paris in January , 1815 , to superintend the publication of the 9th , 10th , and 11th volumes of his Italian Republics , he found the authorities there , instead of busying themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the national tranquillity , were occupied in celebrating the funeral obsequies of Louis XVI . The people deemed this an insult , the army had grievances of its own , and every thing appeared ripe for an explosion . Sismondi , then , was not surprised by the return of Napoleon from Elba in March of that year ; perhaps he welcomed the event , as the accession to power of a man who , having found how hollow were the alliances of kings , would now be disposed to throw himself into the arms of the people , and to strengthen his own throne by protecting their liberties . After the publication of the . ilcte . /Idditionnel , which his old friend and fellow-citizen , Benjamin Constant , had assisted in inditing , and which appeared to him a better constitution than any which France had yet received , and especially after two decrees had been issued , abolishing the slave-trade and restoring the freedom of the press , Sismondi gladly came forward as a supporter of the government of Napoleon . The patriotic party generally seemed inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either from policy or conviction , to lend a hearty support to their cause . Intimations were also sent , it is said , to Madame de Sta*l , inviting her to return to Paris , on the ground that her advice was needed respecting a new constitu'tion ; but she coldly replied , " He has done without me and without a constitution for twelve years ; and even now , // he has no liking either for the one or the other . " She could not yet pardon the author of her exile . In a series of articles published in the Jlloniteur , Sismondi endeavoured to prove that the . Iicte *dditionnel offered sufficient security for the liberties of France , and that the interests of the people now required that they should support the Emperor . Napoleon was pleased by these articles , and the more so because they were written by one who had never experienced his favor nor courted his protection . As a token of his satisfaction , the cross of the Legion of Honor was offered to Sismondi ; but he declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might have more power . " Napoleon then invited him to l'I*lys4e Bourbon , the palace which he occupied at that time , as he wished to converse with him . Sismondi went , and the Emperor talked to him in private for nearly an hour , speaking with great frankness of his own position and projects , of Italy and Switzerland , and even of literature , and receiving the free but respectful remarks of his guest with perfect good-nature . Immediately after leaving him , Sismondi wrote down in his private journal all that he could recollect of the conversation , and this record is now published . We can extract but a small part of it . " He asked me how we were pleased with our constitution at Geneva . I told him that the theory of it was very bad , but that it did not act badly , and that we were very much attached to our independence . The Genevese , ' said he , have the spirit of wisdom , and the habit of liberty ; but is it , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I gave him rapidly an idea of our constitution . On this subject be spoke to me of J. J. Rousseau ; he said he did not like him much , he found much pretension in him , and a style constantly on the stretch . I said to him , that it resembled that of a living author , Chateaubriand , whose style was brilliant , but without simplicity . Yes , ' said he , he aims at effect ; one feels that he is occupied about his phrases , and that beneath these there is no maturity of thought . I have not read the whole of the Genius of Christianity ; it is not in my way ; it is a system which I do not believe ; but , for example , in what he has written against me there is no thought , nothing solid , it is all for effect ; however , he is certainly a man of talent . ' I told him that I preferred his talent and his character to that of another cclehrated man of his tirhe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said he , he is entirely on the system of reaction ; he conceives nothing but the ancient // ri*gime ; he sees all that in his imagination , and he has not a mind which can apply itself to real things . ' He then spoke to me of English novels , of Richardson and Fielding , and asked me some questions about the Italian and Spanish novels , in the same line as Gil Blas , or in that of Pigault le Bran . I showed my surprise at his knowing these things . It is because I read a great deal in my youth ; I worked hard , and read many novels also . In my youth I was much more discreet than I am now ; till my first campaign in Italy , I dared not look a woman in the face ; I should not say so much for myself now . During that time , also , I went through a course of law , and when afterwards we were working on the Code Civil , the councils of state were quite surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them it was because I had studied it . ' Ah , ' cried I , that is what makes great men ; it is having successively applied their mind to every thing ; it is because they have struggled hand to hand with difficulties ; it is what princes want , and which renders them at this time so incapable of extricating themselves from such perplexing difficulties . ' Ah , it is the fault of the system , ' replied he ; but it is irremediable . The Duke of Orleans is the only one of the French princes who has been put to this proof ; during his exile he ceased to be a prince , to become a man , therefore he is the only one who has profited by adversity . So they say . ' But he then broke off the conversation on that subject . He spoke to me of the popes , who had at all times prevented the Italians from becoming a nation . I said to him , that people had had at first a great opinion of Pius VII. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a monk , and not the courage of a great man . ' Yes , his firmness has been much boasted of ; I had the air of persecuting him ; he said to me himself that he was , that he wished to be , a martyr to the faith . But , answered I , how is that , holy father ? - you are well fed , well clothed , lodged in a palace , and you call that martyrdom ; but you are not disgusted with life . ' Then he laughed . Again returning to the praises of the French nation , and comparing them to another nation , he called the French we ( nous autres ) with quite a national feeling . We had already walked nearly three quarters of an hour ; at the two last turns he was much heated , he took off his hat , and his forehead was bathed in sweat . At last he turned towards the palace , we entered his room , he said he was charmed to have made acquaintance with so distinguished a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " - pp. 59 - 61 . The battle of Waterloo followed , and Sismondi retired to Geneva , unwilling to witness the completion of measures which tended to the degradation and misery of a country // which he loved as much as his own . Madame de Sta*l received him , on his return , with as much kindness as ever , but his friends at Geneva looked coldly upon him ; with all their esteem and respect for his motives , they could not soon forget his momentary adhesion to the cause of the Emperor . Conscious of the purity of his own intentions , and of his steadfast attachment to the cause of freedom , Sismondi did not attempt to justify himself , hut sought refuge in his work . " I have always endeavoured to forget myself , " he said " and , thanks to my studies , I can live in other ages than my own . " But he never suffered the habits of a recluse or the tastes of a student to deaden his sympathies , or lessen his interest in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political gossip ; but whenever a crisis arose in the affairs either of his own country or of any other , in which he thought the interests of humanity or the well-being of the poorer classes were concerned , his voice and influence were sure to be exerted to the utmost . He wrote warmly against the slave-trade in 1817 , he advocated powerfully the emancipation of Greece six years afterwards . " The love of the human race was in him so sincere , so lively , so universal , that it had the power of giving him the greatest delight and the deepest affliction . It governed him to such a degree , that it affected the theories of his mind as well as the dispositions of his soul . " A severe affliction was at hand for him in the loss of a friend who had contributed more than any one , except his mother , to his enjoyment and to the direction of his thoughts and character . In July , 1817 , he was called to Coppet , whither had just been brought the body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who had been to him as a guide and a sister . No one out of her own family grieved more deeply than he for the death of Madame de Sta*3l . " There is something confusing , " wrote Sismondi to his mother , " in a misfortune which has taken place at a distance ; at first , one sees nothing changed around one , and it is only slowly and by degrees that one learns to know one 's own grief . It is over , then , for me ,  --  this abode where I have lived so much , where I always felt myself so much and so happily at home ! It is over , - that animating society , that magic-lantern of the world , which I there saw lighted up for the first time , and where I have learned so much ! My life is grievously changed ; there // was no one , perhaps , to whom I owed more than to her . How I suffered on the day of her funeral ! A discourse hy the minister of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brogue and Miss Randall kneeling before the coffin , bad begun to soften my heart , to make me feel the full extent of my loss , and could not restrain my tears . ' " - p. 39 . Four years afterwards he was called to suffer a still greater bereavement . While at Geneva , in September , 1821 , the news arrived that his mother was dying at Pescia . He immediately set out , and travelled night and day to join her , but arrived too late . On the 30th of that month , feeling the approach of death , Madame de Sismondi had caused herself to be raised and carried to the window of her room , where , in sight of the rich landscape gilded by the setting sun , and with no regret but for the absence of her child , she expired . His father had died suddenly about eleven years before , and the only object of affection in his own family who now remained to Sismondi was a married sister , who resided at Pescia , to whom he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her children with constant and tender solicitude . His avocations , however , did not permit him to reside near them , and fortunately his own home now was not a solitary one . Two years before he had married Miss Jessy Allen , whose elder sister was the wife of his friend , Sir James Mackintosh . In her he had a devoted and intellectual companion , who sympathized with him in his pursuits , while her accomplishments and sweetness of disposition were a constant source of cheerfulness and solace to him for the rest of his days . He had purchased a country-house near ChCne , about three miles from Geneva , where he resided after his marriage . Except occasional journeys to France , Italy , and England , he passed the last twenty years of his life at this place , devoted assiduously to his literary employments , and entertaining many visitors , especially those who had been driven from their own homes by their exertions in the cause of freedom . The Genevese were proud of him , and many distinguished foreigners were drawn to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day was given to his studies and labor with the pen , the remainder to the exercise of walking , and to numerous correspondents in all the countries of Europe , and the evening always // to conversation , " which be could keep up in the language of each of his guests . " He had refused , in 1819 , a chair of political economy which had been offered to him in France , because it would have prevented him from passing a portion of each year , as was his habit , with his mother and sister in Tuscany . Sixteen years afterwards , he declined also the title of special professor of history , which the Genevese Council of State had awarded to him . He was never ambitious of mere titular honors , though , in 1838 , be accepted with pleasure the distinguished compliment paid to him by the French Institute , in making him one of the five foreign associates of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences . He also accepted , in 1841 , the cross of the Legion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him by Napoleon . In 1822 , Sismondi published what was in form an historical novel , in three volumes , called Julia Severa , or the Year 492 ; but it was in truth an historical and antiquarian disquisition , which had grown out of his studies for the beginning of his History of the French . Its object was to show the condition of Gaul under Clovis hy a series of dramatic pictures , which might convey in a pleasing form all necessary information respecting the institutions , the manners , and customs of the Franks . Ten years afterwards , he inserted in Lardner 's Cabinet Cyclopa*dia an abridgment of his History of the Italian Republics , in one volume , and at the same time published this abridgment in French , under the title of Histoire de la Renaissance de la Libert6 en Italie . In the winter of 1821 , he gave a course of lectures at Geneva on the history of the first half of the Middle Ages ; and in 1835 , he published in Lardner 's Cyclopa*dia , and also in French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of A History of the Fall of the Roman Empire , and the Decline of Civilization , from the year 250 to 1000 . The works of which we have already enumerated the titles make an aggregate of about sixty volumes , to the composition of every one of which great labor and research were necessary , and which are all executed with an equal measure of conscientious diligence , fidelity , and taste . They are all standard works , and if he had published nothing else , would have secured a brilliant and lasting celebrity for his name . But we have yet hardly alluded to that class of his // works which he valued most highly , as they contained the fruits of the observations and theories which were most peculiarly his own , and in which he was most deeply interested , because they were related most intimately to the subject at all times nearest his heart , the well-being of all classes of society , the causes of the evils which they suffered , and the means of improving their condition . We refer to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disciple of the common English school in that science , and had , indeed , openly revolted from the authority of Adam Smith . His works on this subject , written before the change of opinion here alluded to , and published at the very beginning of his career as an author , have already been briefly mentioned . The first work which betrayed the alteration of his opinions was the article on Political Economy which he furnished for Dr. Brewster 's Edinburgh Encyclop*edia , in 1815 . Four years afterwards he republished the substance of this article in French , somewhat altered , and with material additions , in three volumes octavo , entitled New Views of Political Economy , or Wealth considered in its Relation to Population . In 1827 , the work passed to a second edition , and was greatly enlarged . In 1836- 38 , appeared the three volumes of his Studies in the Social Sciences , two of which were devoted to Studies in Political Economy , and contained additional proofs and illustrations of the doctrines he had formerly advanced . They were among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the reception of them by the public with keener interest and anxiety , perhaps , than he had ever before felt on the appearance of any of his works at the bar of public opinion . Sismondi had enjoyed singular advantage as a political economist , - not , perhaps , for excelling in the theory of the science , but for noting by observation the effect of different systems , when reduced to practice , on the welfare of the people . He had lived in Tuscany , Rome , and Geneva , in France and England ; he had witnessed the effects of the metayer system , of the minute subdivision of the land in France , and of its aggregation into monster farms in England ; and he had been no inattentive observer of the workings of what may be called one of the great characteristic features of modern civilization , the manufacturing system . His studies in history , moreover , had carried him over the // period of transition from the theory and practice of the ancients to those of the moderns , had led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields of Italy under the Roman empire , and of the changes brought about hy the invasion of the barbarians , the effects of the establishment of the feudal system , the reasons of the prosperity and the decay of the Italian commercial republics , and of the various degrees of comfort enjoyed by the peasantry of the several subdivisions of Italy in modern times . Certainly , few had ever possessed more abundant means for informing his theories on this subject by the light of experience . The peculiarities of his views may be attributed in part to this fact , that his conclusions were formed a posteriori , or under the guidance of actual observation , and not by logical deduction from abstract principles , after the manner of Ricardo and his followers . But they were derived in a still greater degree from the qualities of his heart ; he was more of a philanthropist than a man of science ; the great object of his speculations was to point out the means of ameliorating the condition of the laboring classes . Hence he utterly rejected the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which treats only of the production and consumption of wealth ; he maintained , on the contrary , in accordance with the etymology of the phrase , that the object of political economy is the political regulation of society as if it were a household , - that is , with a view to the general well-being , the equal distribution of happiness among all its classes and members . He asserts that the proper appellation of the science which the English economists have exclusively studied is Chrematistics , - * XP*MaTUTTU* , - a phrase applied by Aristotle to the art of money-rnakin* .. Ricardo and his disciples , while professing to separate the two objects , have really confounded them ; looking , in truth , merely to the creation of value , they have tacitly assumed that this was the only interest of society , the only end which legislation should have in view . No sooner do they arrive at a principle , than they demand the immediate application of it , - that it should be incorporated into the laws , and made binding upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seldom directly enunciate it , is , that the augmentation of the national wealth is at once the sign and the measure of national prosperity . Sismondi admits // that it is so , if the wealth be distributed with some approach to equality among the people . But if the vast majority of the nation is beggared , while enormous fortunes are accumulated by a few , if pauperism increases at one end of the social scale as rapidly as wealth is heaped up at the other , then , even though the ratio of the aggregate wealth to the aggregate population is constantly growing larger , the tendency of things is downward , and sooner or later , unless a remedy be applied , society will rush into degradation and ruin . The great merit of Sismondi as an economist consists in this attempt to give a new direction to the science by holding up the general welfare , the material prosperity of all classes , as its chief aim and purpose , and hy considering the mere production of wealth only as suhsidiary to this end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter even more important than their rapid increase , he illustrated hy a vast collection of facts and arguments , and urged it upon the attention of the public with the most passionate earnestness . He made a twofold application of it , the first to landed property and the condition of the peasantry , the second to commercial wealth and the condition of the inhabitants of towns . He was far more successful in the former case , as his observations had been made chiefly in the country , and he was but little acquainted with the theory and effects of the commercial and manufacturing systems . He protested against the aggregation of land into vast estates , and its cultivation in large farms , tracing to these causes the misery and final disappearance of the peasantry , and the depopulation of the country . The illustrations of these doctrines which he found in England and Italy are very striking , and are set forth with more animation and eloquence than are often found in his other writings . His account of the Campagna of Rome is a vigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathos and beauty , and showing by a very clear deduction of historical facts the causes of the present desolateness of this magnificent plain . To the latifundia of the Roman nobles in Pliny 's time , and to the princely domains of opulent landholders in our own day , the preference of pasturage to tillage , and the natural decay and impoverishment of the true cultivators of the soil , whose places are gradually filled by im // mense herds of cattle , are naturally attributed . Then passing to happy Tuscany , the place of refuge of his early manhood , and of which , notwithstanding his frequent imprisonments there , he had so many pleasant recollections , he draws an Arcadian picture of the happiness of its peasantry , cultivating with minute care their small farms , and paying rents in kind and proportionate to the amount of their harvests . The contrast is a striking one , and is drawn by one who had a heart to appreciate the vast difference between the two cases , and a mind capable of ' tracing this difference to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we borrowed his eloquent account of the depopulation of the Scottish Highlands by the heartless Duchess of Sutherland and her noble coproprietors . On the subject of manufactures and the wretchedness of the laboring classes in towns , as we have intimated , Sismondi is not so successful . He shows , indeed , with great clearness and vigor the extent of the evil , the deplorable state to which the operatives with their families have been reduced , and the necessity of applying some remedy , so as to prevent alarming outbreaks , and even the utter disorganization of society . But he is not happy in tracing out the origin and nature of the evils complained of , nor in finding the remedy which all admit to be necessary . The subject of over-production is a difficult one ; Ricardo , 1Jill , and MeCulloch contend that a general glut is impossible , as every article brought to market is a source both of supply and demand , the owner of it being always desirous of exchanging it for something else of equivalent value , and thus contributing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market to precisely the same extent to which he burdened it by his desire to sell . This theory is ingenious , but unsound ; it overlooks the important fact , that the demand and supply of one capital article , food , are regulated by causes peculiar to itself , wholly irrespective of the presence or absence , the high or low prices , of other commodities . The consumption of agricultural products depends on the number of appetites to be satisfied , and can be enlarged only by an increase of the population ; the supply of these products is determined by the quantity of land capable of cultivation , and by improvements in the modes of husbandry . Neither of these sources of supply can be increased at will , or on demand // the land is all occupied or owned , and the number of acres is limited ; improvements in agriculture are made by the progress of discovery and invention , and not merely because they are needed to feed the people . Now , manufactures must be exchanged for food , and consequently may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their increase , but there is a limit to the supply of the only article for which they can be bartered . And we can not here say , as the English economists are fond of saying in the case of a particular glut , " Transfer your industry from the article of which there is a surplus to that of which there is a deficiency . " Industry can not be transferred from manufactures to agriculture ; the land is all owned and held at a monopoly price , and the landlords refuse to employ more labor upon it , even if a greater amount of food should be produced by the introduction of more hands . They find , or think that they find , that a greater net product remains to themselves when few hands are employed than when there are many . Hence , they endeavour to get rid of the agricultural laborers , instead of increasing their number . The policy of English landlords , as we have recently shown , is to depopulate their estates , to make the peasantry give place to flocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practised for centuries on the Roman Campagna , which reduced the fields of Italy in the age of Pliny to a desert , and subsequently surrendered them to the Northern barbarians because there were no men left to defend them . The dispossessed peasantry are driven into manufacturing industry , and thus the glut of manufactures is increased by the very causes which diminish the supply of food . The present distress of England is attributable , not to the manufacturers , but to the landlords . To cry out , then , as Sismondi did , against over-production and the displacement of human labor in manufactures by machines , is to mistake the cause and the birthplace of the evil . The distress of the poorer classes is more manifest in the manufacturing than the agricultural districts , it is true ; but it had not its origin there . It is created in the country , though it appears in the most aggravated form in the cities , as the poor fly thither for refuge ; it is caused by such landlords as the Dukes of Sutherland and Buccleucb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the management of their vast estates may be applied the indignant re // proach which was uttered by Galgacus against the Romans , that " they make a solitude , and call it peace . " The evidence of statistics on this point is so clear , that the conclusion is irresistible . In England , only one fifth of the population is engaged in agriculture , while in France at least two thirds , and in the United States more than three fourths , derive their subsistence immediately from the soil . In respect to the ownership of the land , to its division among a greater or smaller number of proprietors , the disproportion between these three countries is even greater . And this enormous , this fatal difference for England is attributable entirely to her aristocratic institutions , her laws of primogeniture and entail . The system which leads to these results is advocated by such economists as Ricardo , McCulloch , Alison , and Chalmers ; the great merit of Sismondi is , that he was the first strenuously to protest against it . Their favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning laissez faire la mis*re ; laissez passer la mort . " What he cried , answering Ricardo in a long conversation which they had at Geneva shortly before Ricardo 's death ; " is wealth , then , every thing ? Are men nothing ? " It is impossible to do justice to the earnestness with which Sismondi labored and wrote upon this subject , without extending our extracts beyond the proper limits of an article . The following is taken from a letter which he wrote after the publication of his Studies in Political Economy . " It is possible that the self.love of an author may have some share , without my being aware of it , in the earnest thirst I feel to attract the attention of the public ; but this thirst seems to me nothing but the feeling of the immense sufferings of humanity , - sufferings which we all contribute , without thinking of it , to increase , by a conduct which in its details we figure to ourselves as indifferent . I cry , Take care , you are bruising , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even see whence comes the evil which they experience , but who remain languishing and mutilated on the road which you have passed over . I cry out , and no one hears me : I cry out , and the car of Juggernaut continues to roll on , making new victims . " - p. 455 . We must borrow one paragraph , also , from the conclusion to his History of the French , which he wrote , as already observed , but five weeks before his death . // economy and that of history ; thus the economist must often appear , in this long recital , by the side of the historian ; I have endeavoured not to let those lessons be lost which are given by experience , as to what contributes to create and to maintain the prosperity of nations . But above all , I have always considered wealth as a means , not as an end . I hope it will be acknowledged by my constant solicitude for the cultivator , for the artisan , for the poor who gain their bread by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are with the laboring and suffering classes . " - p. 49 . The following extract from his anonymous biographer is interesting , as it shows that Sismondi was no radical , and that he rejected with contempt the silly theories which have recently been broached about a new organization of society , and which have found a few advocates among ignorant and enthusiastic persons in our own country . " It was painful to Sismondi , after having repudiated the economical theories which England was teaching to France , still to have to repel the different systems which connected themselves with the demand for industrial organization . He rejected in turn the coöperative systems of Owen , the Saint Simonians , and the disciples of Fourier . To attempt to suppress personal interest , and to think that the world can go on without it , ' he said to some of them , is sufficiently bold ; but to imagine that all the labor of the community , the conducting of all its interests , can be determined at any moment of the day by the plurality of suffrages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He accused others of ordering a body to walk , after having taken away all the muscles , all the stimulus of individual interest . They take away from you hope , liberty , family affection , ' cried he , sorrowfully , all to make you happy ! Alas ! there is nothing true in their books but the evil they would remedy . " ' - p. 43 . The temperate and catholic character of his political opinions , also , appears from a letter which he wrote in the summer of 1835 . " I have not given up any of my youthful enthusiasm ; I feel , perhaps , more strongly than ever the desire for nations to become free , for the reform of governments , for the progress of morality and happiness in human society . I hope that I have gained in theory and in experience , if , on the other hand , I have been disenchanted of what I hoped in almost all the men I have known : but this disinganno does not affect the ideas and the sentiments // dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been carried into the midst of the conflict . I am a liberal ; still more , I am a republican ; but never have I been a democrat . I have nothing in common with that party which alarms you by its violence and its wild theories , any more than with that which is intoxicated with the love of order and furious for tranquillity . My ideal , in respect to government , is union ; it is the agreement of the monarchical , aristocratical , and democratical elements ; it is the Roman republic , in short , in its best days of virtue and of strength , and not the modern principles , which I do not acknowledge to be principles . " - p. 452 . The health of Sismondi began to fail in 1840 ; the disease , a cancer in the stomach , which finally carried him off , caused him intense suffering , but did not interrupt his labors as a historian , or the fulfilment of his duties towards his country . " During two years he continued writing the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was accelerated in its progress by the troubles that overthrew the constitution of Geneva in 1841 . " That constitution , as we have seen , he had contributed to make , in 1814 , acting with Dumont and others , and aiming to render it as liberal as a wise regard to previously existing institutions , the habits of the people , and the necessities of the times would permit . The radical party found that it was not sufficiently democratic , and , having kept the government in anxiety for a long time , they broke out in insurrection in March , 1841 , violently overthrew the constitution , and caused a constituent assembly to be called for the purpose of carrying their political theories into effect . " Sismondi was elected a member of it , and , notwithstanding his state of suffering and weakness , he caused himself to be carried to the place of meeting to defend to the last the old and salutary institutions of his country . Alone he dared to resist the popular torrent , alone he combated the changes proposed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1842 , in spite of the alarming state of his health , he pronounced before the assembly the last words that he ever uttered in public . " This impromptu speech , full of goodsense , moderation , and power , was interrupted by painftil convulsions , and he was carried borne in a state of the greatest exhaustion . " His only desires , now , were to finish his history , and then " to go to Pescia to die beneath the beautiful sky of Tuscany , // amid the flowers , the fruits , and the trees which he had planted , and with the recollections of the mother who had watched over and matured the promise of his youth . " The former hope was accomplished , hut the progress of his disease made the fulfilment of the latter impossible . His mind was still vigorous , and his desire and capacity for intellectual labor remained undiminished ; hut the frail tenement in which the strong spirit was lodged gave evident tokens of approaching dissolution . On the 9th of May , he wrote the last sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the month he drew up a detailed catalogue of his works , which is in some measure an autohiography . On the 8th of June , he corrected the first four proof-sheets of the 29th volume of his history . " On the 10th , he wrote two letters , one to the son of his old bailiff , at Val Chiusa , to remind him that a small pension which this peasant had engaged to pay to his mother , who was a widow , was due . The other letter , which gave to a Bordelais , employed on a History of the Vaudois , the list which he had asked him for , of the authors which he ought to read , ended with the words of the gladiator to Ca*sar , Moriturus te salutat . On the 13th , the dying man still corrected proofs . On the 14th , he added a codicil to his will , in which , acknowledging the blessings which Providence had heaped upon him , he surrenders his soul into the hands of God , and begs his wife , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him depart with love , but without regret , as he himself quits this world , and all in it which he held dear . ' " On the 25th of June , he continued lying down , motionless , and without speaking till about one o'clock ; then he asked to get up . He was dressed and laid on a sofa , where he remained quiet , and at three o'clock in the afternoon he ceased to breathe . " - p. 50 . It is not necessary to make any elaborate attempt to draw the character or write the eulogy of such a man , after furnishing even the most imperfect sketch of his life and undertakings . Those who wish to know more of him must seek information from his own writings . But to show the estimation in which he was held in France , even by those who were not the most capable of appreciating such works as his , we may borrow the conclusion of M. Mignet 's Hoge , read before the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences on the 17th of May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those men who have done most honor to literature hy the greatness of their labors and by the dignity of their lives .
