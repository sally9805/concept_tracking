txt INTUITIVE TRUTHS , or truths of Pure Reason , are those which lie at the foundation of all knowledgetruths to be assumed , not provedtruths which every body knows , or ought to know , without being taught - truths therefore about which there can be no dispute that does not imply fatuity or insanity , at least on one side of the argument . Yet  --  and it is a signal lesson to the pride of human reason-there is nothing about which metaphysicians and schoolmen of all schools , Platonic , Aristotelian , Lockean , Kantean , Scotch , German , French , Transcendental , Common-Sense , Pyrrhonic and Eclectic ,  --  have raised more doubts , and waged more controversies , than about these Intuitive Truths . The axioms of geometry have never been disputed by men or angels since first the great Geometer of the universe described in boundless space the diagram of his creation , and sent the spheres to roll and shine each in its own elliptic circuit . But though Plato preceded Euclid by a century , the axioms of that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub judice lis est . Who will tell us , then , that we live too late to make discoveries in philosophy ? As Plato left room enough for Aristotle , and Aristotle for Plotinus , and Plotinus for the Schoolmen , and the Schoolmen for Des Cartes , and Des Cartes for Kant , and Kant for Hegel , and Hegel for the seers of the Dial ; so there is room enough even now . Certainly there is no end as yet to progress in philosophy ; - the only doubt is whether there is any beginning . We have , in our day , been somewhat interested , at least as lookers on , in the strifes that have agitated the great empire of philosophy ; and we have learned that inasmuch as // intuitive truths are of all propositions most certain , clear , and stable , the best way , and in many instances the shortest way of establishing a disputed proposition , is by introducing it as a squatter upon the domain of " pure reason , " till by preemption or some other process it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intuitive truths . Thus in the controversy about " fate " and " free will , " which has exercised the wits of metaphysicians in this apostate world for some thousands of years , and which the great poet tells us baffled the mightier powers of fallen angels ere this world was created ,  --  the fatalist or necessitarian on the one side , and the free-wilIer on the other side , are insisting , and have been for centuries , each that his own dogma on that subject is not only true , but intuitively true-so true as to be unconsciously and necessarily assumed in all reasoning upon human actions-so palpably true that no man can doubt it without showing marks of insanity or idiocy , and none can gainsay it without contradicting his own words and thoughts , giving the lie to his own consciousness , and denying the very elements not only of all knowledge , but of his own intellectual and moral nature . The philosopher of the one party , when he makes out his catalogue of intuitive truths , gives a high J ) lace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the chooser a full power to the contrary choice ,  --  a power which in the same circumstances , and under precisely the same influences objective and subjective , might have chosen the other way . " The man that does not know this , " quoth he , " does not know any thing ; you can not begin to reason with him ; - put him into Bedlam . " On the other hand , the philosopher of the opposite party , with equal confidence , assumes it , and insists upon it , as a constitutional cognition of the mind , an element in all reasoning upon human actions , that choice is in every instance determined by motives ; and that , the state of mind immediately antecedent rernaimug the same , the choice could not be other than it was . He does not prove this  --  and indeed how can he ? - otherwise than by taking it for granted , and showing that he who denies it is a numskull and has no right to believe any thing . There are many important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but scanty prospects of obtaining permanently and generally the credit and authority demanded for them , unless they can in some way obtain a settlement among the intuitive truths . We can not speak particularly of the many dogmas , political , critical , historical , which , though they are of the greatest importance in the systems of thought to which they belong , are so incapable of proof that they must ultimately be rejected and cast out as fallacies , unless they can be adopted into this privileged category ; but we may put in a word in behalf of the great doctrine of apostolical succession . We suggest the question to the asserters of that doctrine , whether it would not be wise to make a bold push at once , and get rid of the troublesome demands for proof so pertinaciously urged on the part of " dissenters , " by enrolling their great first principle among the independent and eternal verities of the " pure reason . " Certainly this great dogma has one at least of the most striking characteristics of the truths commonly called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into which it does not itself enter as an element . It is so essential to the entire system of thought with which it stands connected , that every attempt to prove it , which has any appearance of plausibility , is found upon analysis to involve as an inseparable principle of the argument an assumption of the very thing to be proved . If // then this dogma is a truth of any kind , it must surely he an intuitive truth . But to suppose that it is not a truth , is to subvert the entire system of " church principles " from the foundation ,  --  a conclusion not to be admitted for a moment . As for the difficulty that this dogma of the apostolical succession is actually denied , and is most strenuously disputed against ,  --  is there any thing in that which may not be got rid of ? Intuitive truths are defined as truths which all men believe , and no man denies . They evidently depcnd then for their authority upon " catholic consent , " for this is the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ab omnibus ; and " catholic consent , " as is well known , takes no account of the opinions of " dissenters ; " so that the catholic consent in behalf of any doctrine , is simply the consent of those who agree in holding it . Since then those who deny the doctrine of apostolical succession are all " dissenters " either in form or in heart , their denials and arguments are no more to he heeded than the notions of lunatics ; and so , in spite of all that they can say or print , the doctrine may be assumed as an intuitiv* truth . Besides ; though the propositions to which this name is applied are classified as undeniable and indisputable , there is not in the whole category one proposition so undeniable as the plain matter of fact that of all the truths in philosophy , none are more denied or more disputed about by philosophers themselves , than the very truths which are so confidently set up as impossible to be denied or disputed , except under the influence of insanity . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is insane , it is becoming equally difficult to say who is not . If a philosopher mounts to the denial of some intuitive truth , he can be put down in the very height of his great argument ' by telling him " Much learning doth make thee mad . " Why then may not the " dissenter , " who becomes so audacious as to dispute against apostolical succession , be put down by the cry of German neology , ' which is only another name for " the very error of the moon Should it be objected that the " dissenters " are too many to be thus disposed of , it may be remembered on the other hand what hosts of the learned have formally denied many an intuitive truth well known as such . If all the philosophers of India and Arabia , of Greece and Alexandria , of the middle ages and of modern times , who have constructed their systems in bold defiance of intuitive truths , were assembled in one convention , the asylums of Utica and Worcester put together would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or St. Luke 's ever echo with such jargon as they would utter . We have been led into these remarks by the perusal of an essay on intuitive truths , or truths of pure reason , which a friend of ours more versed in such studies than we profess to be , has sent for publication . New Englanders , it is well known , even from ancient times , delight greatly in metaphysics ; and they can read a disquisition on cause and effect , or on fate and free will , with the same gusto with which a Parisian reads a newspaper criticism on the last night 's opera . For the gratification of the taste which enjoys this kind of light reading , we give place to the essay , though it is somewhat aside from the pursuits and topics in which we are just now more particularly interested . Our friend , we conjecture , intends to make a book , and desires the benefit of a little preparatory criticism of principles . Should any other of our friends be disposed to criticise the essay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cheerfully forward it to the writer of the essay . // INTUITIVE TRUTHS . THE word reason , as often used , is a comprehensive term , signifying all those powers and principles of mind , which are employed in the discovery of truth . Sometimes it is used in a more limited sense , to signify those mental powers and principles , which are employed in those acts of reasoning , in which we establish the truth of one proposition by exhibiting evidence that it is included in another one already conceded to be true . It is sometimes used in a still more restricted sense , signifying those truths , which every human mind believes , without any process of reasoning , and for the belief of which no other cause can he assi*ned than the original constituton of mind . Those who treat on reason in the last mentioned sense , sometitnes render the term more definite by a distinctive adjective , calling it pare reason . By other writers , the same thing is indicated , hy the terms , intuitive truths , laws of belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and principles of common sense . iIost writers on mental science recognize the existence of such principles , and hy some , they are definitely drawn out . But the great desideratum is , some test for deciding which are , and which are not , these principles ; and then a rigorous application of this test . The writer , in this article , will attempt to supply this deficiency , with the hope that others who may have thought more accurately on the subject , will examine , and point out all deficiences or mistakes . The following may then be laid down as proper and sufficient grounds for deciding , which are , and which are not intuitive truths or the principles of pure reason . First , all mankind talk , write , feel , and act as if they believed them to be true . Secondly , when any person acts as if h disbelieved any one of them , he is said to have lost his reason , and is considered as insane . An attempt will now be made to show which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time , to point out some things which have been thus designated , but are not entitled to this distinction . The leading , and perhaps the most important of these truths is , that every change is produced by a cause , which , in given circumstances , has power to produce it . Before discussing this proposition , it is important to secure exact and discriminating views in regard to the ideas expressed by the words power and cause . These words express simple ideas , and like all other words of that class , can be defined only by mentioning either the causes or the effects of the idea , or else the circumstances in which it occurs . Thus an emotion of the ludicrous is a simple idea , and is defined as that which is caused by the sudden combination of incongruous thoughts ; or it is defined as that which causes laughter . In one case the cause of it is mentioned , in the other the effect . But the words cause and power are most readily identified , by describing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , the lodestone , in given circumstances , invariably draws iron to itself . In every experiment , when circumstances are perfectly similar , this phenomenon occurs . Every person after witnessing this many times , and finding that , in the same circumstances , there is this invariable antecedent of a sequent phenomenon , has a new idea attached to the antecedent , expressed by the terms cause and power . The lodestone is called a cause of this change in the iron , and is said to have power to produce it . But these words are used in another sense , with reference to any circumstance which is so indispensable to a given phenomenon , as that it will not take place without it . Thus in the case of the iron and the lode- // 363 stone . The attraction will not take place until they are placed adjacent to each other , and this will not take place until some person produces this proximity , and so the person , and the proximity , are both called causes of the event , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction is indicated by the terms efJicient cause and occasional cause . An ij/lcient cause is a real existence , which , in appropriate circumstances , has power to produce a change , in some other real existence . An occasional cause , is any circumstance so indispensable to the existence of a given phenomenon , as that it will not take place without it . Thus the lodestone is the efficient cause of the movement of the iron , and the proximity , and the person who produced it , are the occasional causes . The cause next immediately before the change is called the immediate or proximate cause , and the more distant causes are called intermediate or remote causes . Efficient causes are of two classes . The first , is material causes or mattei* . These have the power of producing certain changes in mind by the instrumentality of the senses ; and these effects are called ideas of touch , taste , smell , color , figure , weight , attraction , divisibility , inertia , and various others . Material causes also , have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other material bodies . Thus fire causes certain sensations in the mind , through the aid of the eye and touch , and it also changes solids to liquids and liquids to vapor . Matter can also be changed by the volitions of mind . The second kind of efficient causes are minds . These are so constituted , that they are susceptible of change by matter through the senses , and at the same time with power to act without any other cause , than their own constitutional endowments . The phenomena of mind may be classed thus ; First , the changes produced in the mind , by material objects acting on the senses . Secondly , those constitutional changes , which have no other cause than the constitution given by God , and which take place without any power in the mind to prevent them . Among these are the conceptions and emotions , the succession of which is regulated by certain laws of our mental constitution which the mind can not refrain from obeying . Thus , associated ideas bring past associates , and certain conceptions always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental phenomena are volitions , or changes which , in all given circumstances , the mind has power to prevent . All those changes in matter or mind , which the thing changed had no power to prevent , are called necessary events , and their causes , necessary causes . All events , where the cause had power to refrain from producing the change , are called contingent events , and their causes , contingent causes . All events that directly or remotely are caused by volitions , are , in refercnce to these volitions , contingent events ; because in the given circumstances they could have been otherwise without any change in the constitution of things , whereas necessary events , in the given circumstances , could not have been otherwise without such a change . Moral causes or motives , are those circumstances which so influence volition , that , had they not existed , the volition would have been otherwise , or would not have existed . An excited desire is called a motive or cause of a given volition , because had it not existed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been otherwise . The object which excites the desire is called a motive or cause , because without it , the desire would not have existed , and consequent- // 364 A Chapter on Intuitive Truths . ly the volition would not have existed . The constitutional susceptibilities , and the induced characteristics , are called motives because , without them , the desire and consequent volition would not have existed . As an example , a man steals , and the cause assigned is , gold , as the object exciting desire , or it is the desire of gold , or it is the man 's avaricious disposition . Any one of these , in common parlance , would be assigned as the motive or cause . Sometimes it is the case that a cause is sought for what did not happen . Thus it is asked why a man did not choose to go to a certain place , and why a fire did not burn . And the answer may be , that the man did not go because he was sick , and the fire did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarity which seems to demand a distinctive designation and it may be named and defined thus . A negative cause is any circumstance which had it not existed , a given event would have existed . Thus in the above examples , sickness , and war*t of combustibles are negative causes . These distinctions enable us to discriminate in using the terms power , ability , and their equivalents . The only case in which we conceive of power as existing in a cause , is in substances or real existences of matter or mind . Those alone are efficient causes , which actually produce changes . All other things spoken of as causes are circumstances without which the given event would not have taken place . It is owing to this that the same thing may be spoken of as having power and not having power , at the same moment of time . Thus fire is said to have power to explode powder , in reference to its constitutional power ; and at the same time it is said not to have this power , because the appropriate circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So a man when he is asleep is said to have power to read , in reference to acquired abilities , and not to have power to read be . cause he is asleep . This distinction may be indicated by these terms and definitions . Direct power exists when the constitutional power exists , and also the appropriate circumstances indispensable to its exercise . Indirect power exists when the constitutional power exists , but the appropriate circumstances for its exercise are wanting . A distinction is also often made between natural power and moral power . When a man can do a thing by willing to do it , he has natural power ; but when there are not motives that will actually secure his choice to do it , then it is said the moral power is wanting . According to this very common use of language , natural inability implies the want of constitutional powerto perform a thing ; and moral inability signifies the want of motives that will actually secure a given volition . Thus a man is said to be able to cure his habits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unable to do it , in reference to a want of motives that actually will secure this result . We now return to a consideration of the intuitive truth , that every change is produced by some cause , which , in appropriate circumstances has power to produce it . This proposition , it is manifest , refers only to real existences or efficient causes , and therefore it may be stated in another form thus . Every change in matter or mind , is produced by some real existence or efficient cause which has power to produce it . Material existences are not endowed with power to change themselves , but are dependent for change on some ab extra cause , either of matter or mind . But mind is endowed with inherent powers of activity , so that it changes its states without any cause ab extra , having constitutional powers of change . Of course the meaning of this term // must be thus limited . There are certain changes in mind which are produced by ab extra causes ; there are others which are the necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God is the remote efficient cause ; and the class called volitions are acts of the mind itself , which do not result from any necessary constitutional law , but of which the mind itself is the sole efficient cause , motives being merely occasional causes . With these discriminations and limitations , it is maintained that the above intuitive truth is believed by all mankind , and that they speak , write , feel , and act so as to prove that they believe it . And any mind which acts as if this truth were not believed , is said to have lost its reason and become insane . The assertion that any existence , or any change in existence , sprang into being without any efficient cause , is always deemed incredible , and no case can be found where any sane persons ever talked or acted on such an assumption . It is true , some atheists have maintained that there was a time when all creation , with its myriads of contrivances and powers sprang into being without any cause ; but in all practical matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sophistries hide its enormous absurdities . There have been many abstruse discussions among metaphysicians in regard to this principle of mind , and most of them relate to the following questions : First , What is the idea of power or causation ? Secondly , When and how is this idea first gained ? Thirdly , flow is the idea of causation gained in common experience , or in other words , what is the process by which the cause of a phenomenon is detected ? In reply to the first , ( What is the idea of power or causation ? ) Brown , flume , and some others , assume that it is simply a perception that , in given circumstances , a particular change is invariably preceded by a particular antecedent , and that antecedent invariably followed by this sequent phenomenon , - together with a belief of a future similar connection . To expose the error of this assumption , it may first be remarked , that what the nature of the idea is , must be determined by an appeal to the internal experience and observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but a few speculative metaphysicians , that this definition describes not their idea of power or causation , but only the circumstances in which the idea is called into existence . They say that they can conceive of a cause which acts for the first time , and the only time , and which therefore is not an invariable antecedent of an invariable sequent . And they say also , that they can conceive of an invariable antecedent of an invariable sequent , without attaching to it the idea of a cause . We can imagine a constitution of things in which phenomena might precede and follow as invariable antecedents and sequents without the power of causation in the antecedents , and the same succession also , with this power . This proves that the idea of invariable antecedence and sequence is not th idea of causation . It can be proved by another consideration . It can be shown that mind is the efficient cause of its own volitions , and that this is an intuitive truth . It can also be shown , that in volition there never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the sole idea of causation . For mind in choosing never can be twice in precisely the same circumstances , as it must be in order to be a cause in the sense claimed by flume and Brown . For mind , by every act of volition , gains some new knowledge and experience , and some new force of habit , be it ever // never is twice in precisely the same circumstances . If then it is conceded that mind is a cause , it must be allowed that the controverted assumption is false . The idea of a cause is a simple idea , which , it has been shown , can be defined only by mentioning the circumstances in which it arises in the mind . One of the occasions when it always exists is , when there is an invariable antecedent of an invariable sequent phenomenon . But this is not the only occasion when it exists . The mind possesses an ever living consciousness of its own power as a cause , and this consciousness is intuitive , and not the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is , When and how was the idea of power or causation first acquired ? In reply , some say that it is an idea which comes at the commencement of existence as a part of the first mental consciousness . Some say that it originates when the infant first perceives that its own volitions move its muscles , and affect outward objects . Others say that it originates when repeated experience has detected some invariable antecedent of an invariable sequent . But these are all assumptions without a shadow of proof . For who can go back to the mysterious silence of early infancy to question its vague and forgotten experience ? These are questions entirely out of the reach of philosophical investigation , which asks for evidence and not for imaginary theories . The third question is , What is the process by which we detect causes ? In reply it may be said , that mind is recognized as a cause by intuition , but in regard to matter , we can detect causes only by discovering what it is that in precisely similar circumstances , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intuitive truth is , that when in given circumstances there is an invariable antecedent of a given phenomenon , which , in those circumstances , is an invariable sequent , there is no power in the thing changed , or in the antecedent cause , to prevent this result . Thus in the case of the lodestone and the iron , it is impossible to believe that the iron has power to refrain from approaching the lodestone , or that the lodestone has power to refrain from attracting it . And thus in every other case where antecedents and sequents have been uniform . It is the belief of this principle which gives most of the force to the mode by which the doctrine of fate is defended . Its advocates endeavor to establish the position that every act of volition has the " strongest desire " or " most agreeable " object as an invariable antecedent , and that volition is the invariable sequent of this antecedent . And when this is maintained , the mind feels that if it is so , there is no power in any mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inasmuch as this antecedence and sequence is an assumption contrary to fact , no mind can by this argument shake off its sense of the conscious power of free agency . The third intuitive truth is , the unity and plurality of efficient causes . We can imagine mind so constituted as to notice changes and qualities , and yet without power to trace them to separate causes . We might suppose that one and the same thing produced all the effects on our various senses which we now trace to various distinct causes . And we can conceive that mind might be so constituted , that when one and the same thing produced different effects on the different senses , each effect might be regarded as produced by a different cause . Thus the color of a fruit might be regarded as produced by one cause , its taste by another cause , and its smell by another . Instead of this , we believe these diverse effects to be produced by // one and the same cause . And when several diverse objects act on the senses , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct causes . And no other reason can be assigned for this belief , but that constitution of mind imparted by the Creator which secures this result . The unity of our own mind , as the sole distinct cause of our own mental acts , and as the recipient of all the ministrations of the senses , is one of the particulars included under this general head . If any person should maintain ( as some writers seem to do ) that there are distinct and diverse agencies that perform our different mental acts , each receiving diverse external impressions which are not experienced by the others , nothing could be said to prove the contrary , except that all mankind talk , write , feel and act , as if each believed that his mind was one indivisible agent , performing all mental acts and receiving all external impressions . And thus of material units ; if any one should maintain that a fruit or a flower was not the one and only cause of the sensations of color , figure , smell , taste , and touch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument could prove the fact . We could simply say , that mankind believe in this unity of cause , and prove their belief by their words and actions . The fourth intuitive truth is , that those objects which act on the senses are real existences , or efficient causes . There are some philosophers who deny that there are two distinct classes of efficient causes . Such maintain that mind is the only real existence , and that matter does not exist as a real efficient cause of those effects on the senses which we call the qualities or properties of matter . What is generally believed as to the real existence of matter , is by them deemed a mental hallucination , and not a reality . There are others , and among them Stewart abroad , and Tappan in this country , who seem to teach , that though matter may be a real existence , still it is not the efficient cause of its supposed effects on our senses , but that the direct volition of the Creator is the sole cause of every change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of matter on our senses . low these things have been discovered , we are not informed ; nor has any evidence of the truth of these theories been produced . They are assumptions without proof , and are contradictory to an intuitive truth . For all mankind always have believed , that matter exists , and that it produces its various effects on their senses ; and it would be as impossible to destroy this belief as it would to destroy the belief of the existence of their own minds . And any person who should talk and act as if he disbelieved this truth would be deemed insane . The fifth intuitive truth is , that mind is a separate distinct exsstence or efficient cause , and not matter , or a portion of the material body . Materialists maintain that mind is a peculiar organization of matter in connection with the body , and that with the body it will be dissolved and its powers annihilated . This is all a mere assumption , without a shadow of proof . For by the word matter , we mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the senses , the effects called color , figure , and the other qualities of matter . Of course the only way of proving that the mind is matter , is to show that it has the qualities and properties of matter ; that is , that it produces some of those effects on the senses or on other material existences which matter produces . Some have attempted the proof in this way . They say , Mind must exist in some place , so that it is there , and not elsewhere . This involves the ideas of position in space , extension , figure , and divisibility , which are four of the properties of matter . For if it is in one // place and not in another , there are limits to its extension , and this is figure , and this extension can be divided into two or more portions . ' This is rendered plausible only by a want of discrimination as to the ideas of position , extension , figure and divisibility in regard to matter . For the position and extension of matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of space certain effects would be produced on the human senses if they were there . That is , in a given point of space , a certain cause called matter acts to produce the sensations of extension , figure , color , and other effects of matter . Now in regard to mind , it is true that it exists , and produces its appropriate effects in a given point of space , and that there is a limit to the extent of space in which it thus acts ; but it is to be marked that matter produces not one of the acts of mind , and mind produces not one of the effects of matter , and therefore there is not one reason for calling them the same , or even similar things , but every reason there can be for calling them dissimilar and distinct things . It is true that both exist and act in limited points of space , which extension of space , of course , has limits and can be divided ; but this does not at all involve the necessity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one particular . They are no more one and the same thing , because they exist in space and act within certain limits , than fire and water are the same thing because they exist in space , and have the properties of figure and divisibility . In opposition to this unsupported assumption , it can be shown that every language on earth has terms to express the distinct existences called spirit and body , and every adult that is not insane , talks , writes , feels , and acts , as if he believed that the part of himself which feels and thinks is not his body , nor a part of his body . The sixth intuitive truth is , that the mind is the sole efilcient cause of its own volitions , and that , in given circumstances , it has the power of deciding to deny or to gratify any excited desire . The advocates of the doctrine of fate deny this principle . They maintain that mind is constituted with susceptibilities of desiring diverse species of good , which can be excited with different degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chooses to gratify the most intensely excited desire , so that there is the same invariableness of antecedence and sequence between the most highly excited desire and volition , as there is between certain conceptions and their invariably sequent emotions . And , in consequence of this , they maintain that mind , in the given circumstances , has no direct power to choose any other way than as it does choose . In opposition to this , it is maintained that mind is formed not only with these susceptibilities of desiring different kinds of good with different degrees of intensity , but also with a quiet , never-ceasing desire for happiness in general , and with faculties ( called usually reason and conscience ) enabling it to judge which modes of enjoyment will secure the most happiness on the whole ; - that when various desires coexist it can , and sometimes does , deny the most highly excited desire in obedience to reason , and sometimes it does not ;  --  and that , in all cases of volition , there is power to decide in either of two ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given desire . This , it is maintained , is an intuitive truth , believed by all men , as proved by their words and actions . Should it be claimed that this susceptibility of desiring happiness in general , is one of the susceptibilities which can be more or less highly excited , and that when the dictates of reason are obeyed , this is the strongest desire ; it is replied , that the different degrees of // desire are matters of consciousness , and that when a susceptibility is more highly excited at one time than another , we are conscious of these different states . But the testimony of consciousness is opposed to this assumption of such varieties of degree in our desire for happiness in general . It is an assumption , made to support a theory , xx'hich has no foundation in fact . The seventh intuitive truth is , that we are the same persons now as we were in times past . Personal identity can be established by no process of reasoning , but all mankind believe it , and any one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insane . The eighth intuitive truth is , that what we distinctly remember is a reality . By this it is not intended that we are never mistaken in our recollections , but that there are things so distinctly remembered that it is impossible to disbelieve the testimony of memory . A person just returning from a scene of terror and distress could by no process be made to doubt that it really was as he remembers it . The ninth intuitive truth is , that our own acts and states of mind belong to ourselves and are realities . If a person maintains that what we think and feel is not as we are conscious that it is , or that it is another mind and not our own , that has this experience , though we could not disprove the assertion , we could by no means be made to believe it . It is this certainty as to the nature of our ideas , together with confidence in our memory , which is the foundation of the certainty we feel in what are called mathematical axioms . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed as an intuitive truth , but because the idea expressed by twice two is felt to be the same as is expressed by the word four . It is the certainty we feel as to the identity of the ideas and the memory of the words used to recall them , which has led to the naming of such expressions intuitive truths . So the expression the whole is greater than a part , is not an intuitive truth , but the confidence felt in its reality rests on intuitive truths . For we have always had a given idea recalled by the word whole , and another idea by the word part , and another by the word greater , and when these words are announced they recall ideas which are perceived to be true to past experience . So that this ma**im is no more an intuitive truth than the expression white is not black , or the top is not the bottom . Our confidence in the truth of such expressions rests wholly on our confidence in the reality of just experience , and confidence in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , that mind never WILL choose what involves evil without compensating good . The conscious power of free.agency is so strong , that many persons , if asked , do you feel that you can choose to put your hand in the fire , when no good will be gained by it , will reply in the affirmative . But if asked , whether they believe they ever shall do it , and all would answer in the negative . Much of our confidence in human testimony rests on this principle . Whenever it is shown that a witness knows that he will gain evil and no good from falsehood , all must believe that lie will speak the truth . The eleventh intuitive truth is , that contrivance proves an INTELLIGENT CAUsE , and the nature of a contrivance proves the design of the author . The mind is so made that it can not believe that existence can originate without an efficient cause . Yet the existence of unorganized matter would not prove the existence of an intelligent cause . But when an existence is discovered where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end , no person could observe it without believing that the // cause of ' it is an intelligent mind , with the capacity of adjusting means to ends . Nor could the end design . ed be observed , without the belief that it wa* he intention of the author to accomplish this end . If a savage should find a watch in his forest shades , nothing could convince him that it sprang into being there without any cause . If he should notice its delicate machinery and nicely adjusted parts , he could not be made to believe that a brute , or any but an intelligent mind contrived it . If he should have its movements explained , and should perceive that it accurately pointed out the hours of the day , he could not be convinced that the author had no such design in the contrivance . An interesting case is recorded of the exhibition of this principle in the mind of a young child . His father had planted a bed with seeds arranged in the form of letters to spell the child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were discovered by the delighted child , the father in vain endeavored to force his belief that they came by chance . " No , father , somebody planted them - somebody meant to have them come up and spell my name , " was the persevering response . It is this principle which is the foundation of some most elaborate arguments to prove the existence of God , and the benevolence of his character , one of the most interestin of which is found in Paley 's Natural Theology . The last intuitive truth is , that things will be according to past experience , when there is no reason to the contrary . The mind is so constituted that whenever any regular succession of antecedents and sequents has been discovered , the belief always follows that this uniformity will continue . Why do men expect that the sun will rise , the seasons return , and harvests wave in the fields ? It is simply because their minds are constituted to believe that things in future will continue to be as they have been in past experience . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the enjoyments of mankind , rest upon this principle of the mind . Every process of inductive or analogical reasoning rests upon this principle as the foundation . Every inductive process consists in accumulating facts to establish a certain uniformity of phenomena in given circumstances , and when this is done , the belief always is secured that this uniformity is perpetual . Thus , it is by a process of inductive reasoning that we arrive at the conclusion that all iron is magnetic . The principle that things will be according to past experience , is the major proposition , or truth conceded . Then facts are brought to light to show that in all past experiments all iron has been found magnetic . When this is done , the belief is secured that all iron is and will be magnetic . Analogical reasoning differs from inductive , in having some want of uniformity in certain respects , so that the expectation of entire uniformity is not so strong . For example , when we reason from analogy that the moon is inhabited , the argument runs thus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , and we are to reason from our past experience . According to this , a planet has inhabitants . But in two respects this differs from an inductive argument . The first is , there is but one case in which experience has been known , and the second is , that this experience in several points is dissimilar from what we find is true of the moon , which in some respects is unlike the earth , and therefore may be unlike in respect to inhabitants . Analogical reasoning , therefore , is far less conclusive than inductive . One of the most interesting specimens of analogical reasoning is // found in Butler 's Analogy . In that work the foundation principle is , that things will be according to past experience where there is no reason to the contrary . The writer then exhibits evidence that in past experience the soul goes through various changes resembling death and yet survives ; that the dissolution of the body is no evidence of the destruction of the soul ; that there is no kind of evidence that the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the above principle , its existence continues when the body dies . This enumeration , it is supposed , embraces all that may properly be called intuitive truths , according to the test indicated at the commencement . Some writers have placed other propositions among the intuitive truths , but it is believed that a rigid analysis will show that they are only specific instances included under some one or other of these more general principles . Several of those enumerated as intuitive truths in this article , have never before been thus presented in any work which the writer has examined . These principles , it will be seen , are the foundations of all our knowledge . There is no proposition that can be announced , the belief of Which can not be traced back to one or the other of these maxims as the basis on which it rests . And the grand hope for the future development of truth and exposure of error , is connected with a full development of these principles , together with expert methods of developing errors , as contradictory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
