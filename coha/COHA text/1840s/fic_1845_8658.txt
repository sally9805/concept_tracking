Boston Miscellany , October , 1842 . The plan of Faust was conceived by Goethe very early in his literary life , but was executed slowly and at long intervals of time . The first draft is supposed to have been made between 1770 and 1775 . It was published , for the first time , in 1790 , in a complete edition of the author 's works , where it appeared as a fragment , without the introductory scenes , and with important variations , in other respects , from its later form . It was first published in its present shape in the edition of the author 's works that appeared in 1807 . In the introductory stanzas , which were then prefixed , for the first time , under the title of Zueignung ,  --  ' Dedication , '  --  and to which the translator has given the title of the Spirit Land , the poet expresses his feelings on resuming the favorite work of his earlier years at a later period of life , when most of the friends and companions of his youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a tenderness and delicacy of sentiment , which are not very frequently the prevailing characteristics of Goethe 's works , and which render this one of the most pleasing of his minor poems . Main text I. THE SPIRIT LAND . Poet Again ye throng around me , shadowy dreams , That wont before my youthful eyes to play ! Shall I once more your ever changing gleams Attempt to catch before they pass away ? And now ye nearer press . Then since , it seems , Ye must and will appear , I bid you stay ; Although your presence racks my tortur 'd brain With a deep sense of long-forgotten pain . For with you come fond thoughts of many a day Of bliss , and many a form to fancy dear ; And like some ancient , half-remember 'd lay , Departed loves and friendships re-appear , Fresh bleeds each grief , that time could ne'er allay ; And memory reckons o'er , with wo severe , The good , whose flower of happiness was crost In its fresh bud ,  --  the early lov 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I sing , The gentle hearts , for whom I sang before ; Dissever 'd is the friendly gathering , And that first kind response returns no more . The few survivors of my joyous spring Are scatter 'd far o'er every sea and shore , While I , abandon 'd , tune my ancient strain To a strange crowd , whose very praise is pain . And o'er me steals a long unfelt desire To reach the silent , solemn Spirit Land ; Low , lisping notes , as of the olian lyre , Breathe from the strings beneath my wavering hand ; Tears follow fast on tears ; the soul of fire Grows faint and weak , by softness all unmann 'd ; And the fair scenes , in which my lot is cast , Appear like dreams ;  --  I live but in the past . II . SCENE IN THE LIBRARY . CHARACTERS . Faust . Wagner , a Student , residing in his house . The outline of the plot of Faust is , of course , familiar to most readers . Dr. Faustus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compact with the Prince of Darkness , by which he surrenders his soul to eternal punishment hereafter , on condition of renewing his youth , and being gratified in all his wishes in this world . After the dedication , and the introductory scenes , the piece opens with the appearance of Faust , or Dr. Faustus , seated in his library ,  --  surrounded with books , and at the same time beset with cares and doubts ,  --  the victim of weariness , disgust and despair . While he is indulging in a train of reflections on the vanity of learning and science , analogous to these sentiments , he is overheard by Wagner , a student residing in his house , who supposes him to be reciting a Greek play , and comes in to improve himself in the art of declamation . The following dialogue takes place between them . Faust . Faust Oh death !  --  ' t is he !  --  I know his knock : Perdition seize the senseless block ! While communing with spirits , face to face , ' T is hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wagner Wagner ( enters ) . Forgive me , sir ! I heard your declamation , And thought you must be reading some Greek play . I long have wish 'd to mend my recitation : ' T is necessary at the present day , A clergyman , indeed ,  --  ' t is often said ,  --  Should to an actor go to learn his trade . Faust . Faust Aye !  --  if he mean himself to be a player ; And that is not unfrequently the case . Wagner . Wagner But how should one , who hardly feels the air , Or sees the light , except on holidays , Chain 'd to his parchment rolls , without vacation , Know any thing of graces or persuasion ? Faust . Faust Persuasion , friend ! comes not by toil or art ; Hard study never made the matter clearer : ' T is the live fountain in the speaker 's heart , Sends forth the streams that melt the ravish 'd hearer . Then work away for life ; heap book on book , Line upon line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gape and look , And fools may think your stock of wisdom ample : For touching hearts the only secret known , My worthy friend , is this :  --  to have one of your own Wagner . Wagner But still the manner 's every thing in preaching : I know it , though I fail in that partic'lar . Faust . Faust Manner ! find out some matter worth the teaching Nor be for words and forms a barren stickler . The spirit 's all :  --  no matter for the letter . Good sense and truth are good enough for men . Hast any thing to say ? Out with it , then ! And the more natural the style , the better . Your pompous words , your phrases nicely join 'd , Will find the people deaf as any adder ; They 're but dry leaves , that rustle in the wind , No comfort for the soul ;  --  peas in a bladder . Wagner . Wagner But art , alas ! is long and life is short ; How much to learn !  --  how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , dull sport , And head-aches often force one to adjourn it . How hard to master all the kinds of aid That help us on to learning 's fountain-head ! And then , before the journey is half made , The chance is , the poor traveller is dead . Faust . Faust What fountain-head ? Is parchment then the spring At which the soul must quench its dying thirst ? My friend ! for this no streams refreshment bring , Unless the source in thine own bosom burst . Wagner . Wagner But , pardon me ! it gives me great delight To enter into the spirit of various ages , And see the progress we have made in light , Compar 'd with what was known by ancient sages . Faust . Faust Great progress , to be sure !  --  of ages past , Mine honest friend ! the knowledge we inherit Is small : their history is a book seal 'd fast :  --  And what we call the spirit of an age Is commonly the gentleman 's own spirit , Quickening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then mankind , the world , the human heart , You 'll grant that these , at least , are points of knowledge . Faust . Faust Points , if you please ,  --  but which , with all your art , You 'll find it very hard to learn at college . Besides ,  --  what serves your learning ? When all 's o'er , You dare not tell the world what you have learnt : The few , that , having gain 'd this valued lore , Had not sufficient caution to disguise it , And to the crowd display 'd their precious store , Have for their pains been crucified and burnt , To prove how well the crowd knew how to prize it . But come , my friend ,  --  ' t is late ;  --  we 'll break off here . Wagner . Wagner Sir , as you please ;  --  I gladly would remain To talk with you so learnedly a year . I hope to-morrow you 'll give me leave again To ask a few more questions of you here . Though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reach the bottom of the business . After the retirement of Wagner , Faust relapses into his former gloom Dark and bewildering thoughts crowd upon his fancy and plunge him deeper and deeper into the " slough of Despond , " in which he is engulphed , until , at length , in his agony of feeling , he resolves to shake off the burden of his miserable existence by suicide . He grasps the poisoned vial , which he has long kept ready for this purpose , and is in the act of lifting it to his lips , when his ears are saluted from without by the sound of cheerful voices singing , in several choirs , the Easter Hymn of the Catholic Liturgy , which celebrates the resurrection and ascension of the Redeemer . The several stanzas sung by the different choirs , with the reflections successively made upon them by Faust , close the scene . Chorus of Angels . Angels Rejoice ! ye sons of men , rejoice ! Awake the choral strain ! The Savior who was crucified , Has broken his death-chain ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , He points you to a better world , And proudly leads the way . Faust . Faust What glorious sounds are these that break at once So loud and clear upon the stilly night ? Is this the midnight bell that should announce The approach of Easter Sunday 's holy light ? And does the choir repeat the charming strain , That angels sang of old on Judah 's blessed plain Proclaiming peace on earth  --  but hark ! that sound again ! Chorus of Women . Women With sweetest spices o'er him strew 'd , In finest linen bound , We laid him ,  --  we that lov 'd him much ,  --  In his cold burial-ground ; And now we fondly come again To wash with many a tear The grave in which we buried him ,  --  But ah ! he is not here . Chorus of Angels . Angels Rejoice ! ye sons of men , rejoice ! The Loving One that bore The agony of death for you , Is buried here no more ; But mounting high above the sky To realms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And proudly leads the way . Faust . Faust Celestial sounds ! why come ye here to greet A grovelling earth-worm with your cheerful breath ? Go ! tell your tale where hearts congenial beat , I hear the message well , but want the saving faith . Faith dearly loves the miracles she hears , And most delights , where wonders most abound ; But I no more may reach the lofty spheres , From which the voice of Revelation sounds . Yet ah ! in youth how sweetly o'er me fell Heaven 's kiss of love upon the Sabbath day ! How full of meaning was the deep-ton 'd bell ! And what an extasy it was to pray ! Strange longings led me from my parent 's hearth O'er hill and dale to wander far and near ; And there with many a hotly-gushing tear I felt an unknown world within me have its birth . And now ,  --  e'en now ,  --  with that accustom 'd song , So often heard in youth 's enchanting hours , What hosts of cheerful recollections throng Upon my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ! sweet voices ! as before : I weep !  --  I feel myself a man once more . Chorus of Disciples . Disciples His mission done , the Buried One Has gone in peerless pride To sit forever on his throne By his Great Father 's side . Alas ! that we , the faithful few , To whom he was so dear , Are left behind in misery To mourn his absence here . Chorus of Angels . Angels Rejoice ! ye sons of men , rejoice ! Awake the choral strain ! The Saviour , who was crucified , Has broken his death-chain ; And ye that follow 'd him with love ,  --  If ye devoutly prize The counsels that he gave on earth , Shall meet him in the skies . III SCENE IN MARTHA 'S HOUSE . CHARACTERS . MEPHISTOPHELES . MARTHA . MARGARET . The impression made upon the mind of Faust by the incidents represented in the above scene , as expressed in his reflections , are merely momentary . He is infended as a type of frail humanity ,  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relapses at once into his habitual tendency to evil . In the next scene he concludes his compact with the evil Spirit , ( here personified under the name of Mephistopheles ) agreeably to the popular tradition ; and having taken the form of a gay , young cavalier , sets forth , accompanied by the demon to whom he has sold himself , in quest of adventures . The scene in Martha 's house occurs in this part of the play and serves as an introduction to Faust 's love for Margaret , which forms the principal subject . Margaret is on a visit to the house of Martha , a married woman , in the neighborhood , whose husband is absent . Mephistopheles introduces himself by pretending to have known her husband abroad , and giving her an account of his supposed death . Faust , before obtaining a personal introduction , had already sent to Margaret through the agency of Mephistopheles , but without informing her from what quarter they came , a present of some valuable jewels to which allusion is made in the dialogue . Mephistopheles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty I take in entering thus upon your leisure , ( bows respectfully to Margaret , )  --  Does mistress Martha Swerdtlein live hereby ? Martha . Martha She does , sir , at your service :  --  what 's your pleasure ? Mephistopheles Mephistopheles aside to Martha . Madam , I had a message to relate ; But as you 're now engag 'd with company Of rank , I 'll call again this evening late , If you permit me and the hour agree . Martha , Martha aloud to Margaret . There , child ! what think you now ? This gentleman Just took you for a lady of condition . Margaret . Margaret Oh me ! the gentleman is much too good ; I 'm but a poor , young , simple , artless blood : These ornaments I wear but by permission . The gentleman must really look again . Mephistopheles . Mephistopheles Oh madam ! ' t is the tone , the look , the air , That prove your rank , and not the pearls you wear . I 'm truly happy that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , good sir , this message , Pray ? Mephistopheles . Mephistopheles Madam , I can not say the tale is merry , But life is short : we all must have our day . Your husband 's dead ;  --  he bade me bring the news . Martha . Martha My husband dead !  --  the faithful , honest soul ! Oh , I shall faint . Margaret . Margaret Dear madam , pray take heart . Mephistopheles . Mephistopheles Allow me , madam , to relate the whole . Margaret . Margaret At such a loss as that I could not choose But weep myself to death . Mephistopheles . Mephistopheles ' T is hard to part , We know ; but time brings all extremes together . Grief turns to joy :  --  rain follows pleasant weather . Martha . Martha Where died he then ? Mephistopheles . Mephistopheles In Padua he lies . By Saint Antonio 's church , in seemly guise , A cool , still spot for everlasting rest . Martha . Martha Pray with this message sent he nought beside ? Mephistopheles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request , That , as his soul through purgatory passes , You 'd order for his good three hundred masses , But left his purse quite empty when he died . Martha . Martha How ?  --  nothing to help out his soul 's release ? Not e'en a keep-sake or a pocket-piece ? What every labouring , handy-working man Lays by to leave it to his wife or send it , And toils , begs , starves to death ,  --  rather than spend it ? Mephistopheles . Mephistopheles Madam ! it grieves my heart to give you pain ; Your husband did not even pay his bills : Yet ,  --  to be just ,  --  he suffer 'd many ills , And of his various faults repented sore : Aye , and of his unlucky stars much more . Margaret . Margaret How sad it is men should be so distrest ! I 'll surely say my prayers for his soul 's rest . Mephistopheles . Mephistopheles It is high time , my sweet and pretty maid , You had a husband of your own to pray for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is not the day for . Mephistopheles . Mephistopheles What then ?  --  a gallant should not be delay 'd :  --  A sweetheart that should tell you pretty stories , Cheer you by day and keep you warm by night . Margaret . Margaret The people here , sir , think it is not right . Mephistopheles . Mephistopheles Right or not right , they do it when they can . Martha . Martha But let me know the rest . Mephistopheles . Mephistopheles My dearest madam , I watch 'd beside your dear , departed man In his last moments , doing all to glad'em That lay within my power . He suffer 'd much , But own 'd his fate was richly merited . I am , he said , a wretch , for leaving such A wife at home , alone , dispirited . I could have died with some faint hopes of heaven , Could I be sure she had forgiven me here . Martha . Martha weeping . Poor , dear , good man ! he was long since forgiven . Mephistopheles . Mephistopheles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I. Martha . Martha He lies ! he lies !  --  What ? On his death-bed lie So shamelessly ? Mephistopheles . Mephistopheles He stretch 'd the truth , I fear , At least , if I may judge :  --  indeed , ' t was clear . I did not want , said he , for occupation : House-work of all sorts was an endless task : Do what I could my wife was never easy . And then to feed her was an operation , Almost as hard ; her stomach was not queasy : I could not give so fast as she could ask . But this was nothing ; had I been allow 'd To eat my share in peace , and quietly I could have borne the rest ; but daily ,  --  nightly ,  --  ' T was one continual scolding , long and loud ; Until one day I thought it best to quit her . Martha . Martha The wretch !  --  the villain !  --  could he so forget her ,  --  Abuse her so ?  --  the wife he lov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt your absence more ; He told me this .  --  When we from Malta sail 'd , I for my wife and children pray 'd sincerely ; And Providence my constancy rewarded ; For , on our voyage as we proceeded cheerly , Forthwith a Turkish packet-ship we hail 'd , Which , instantly , sans crmonie , we boarded And took : ' t was laden with a most rich treasure For the Grand Seignior ; and , I say it with pleasure , I had my share or more :  --  perhaps ' t was merited . Martha . Martha Where is't ?  --  what came o n't ? Has he buried it ? Mephistopheles . Mephistopheles Light come , light go .  --  God knows with whom he spent it ; But this he said .  --  When I to Naples came There took a fancy to me a fair , young dame , I being alone , of wife and friends bereft , And much she cherish 'd , much befriended me , In a most loving guise ,  --  howe'er she meant it ;  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That in the end I had not a farthing left . Martha . Martha Oh the vile thief !  --  What ? waste upon a woman , Off in the moon , his hard-earn 'd family stores ? Rob his own wife to pamper up a common  --  . Mephistopheles . Mephistopheles Well ! well ! the poor man 's dead : that pays all scores . You 'll put on weeds to wear a week or two ; But give me leave to say , that were I you , I 'd lose no time in tying the knot again . Martha . Martha Alas ! my dear sir ! I should seek in vain A treasure like the first : so good a creature !  --  He had his faults ;  --  was much too great a rover ;  --  Drank hard ;  --  to naughty women sadly given ;  --  Of cards and dice a most intemperate lover : Mephistopheles . Mephistopheles Well ! well ! and he ,  --  to keep the balance even ,  --  No doubt o'erlook 'd some petty peccadilloes , And so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you 're tir 'd of wearing willows , I 'd gladly change myself a ring with you . Martha . Martha The gentleman is pleas 'd to be facetious . Mephistopheles Mephistopheles ( aside . ) I must be off , and that in season too ; She 'd force the devil himself to keep his word . ( To Margaret . ) How stands your heart , my love ? Margaret . Margaret What are your wishes ? Mephistopheles Mephistopheles  --  ( aside . ) Innocent thing ! she never yet has heard She has a heart .  --  ( To the ladies )  --  Fair ladies both , good night ! Martha . Martha But , sir , before you go , I fain would ask What proof you have of this sad visitation ? To make it public is a mournful task ;  --  But yet to read his death in black and white Would be , methinks , some little consolation . Mephistopheles . Mephistopheles Madam , two witnesses will be enough : I have a friend to join me in the proof , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha . Martha Pray do . Mephistopheles . Mephistopheles The young lady , I hope , will stop and see him too . A fine , young gallant !  --  he has travell 'd much , Is passionately devoted to the ladies . Margaret . Margaret Oh sir ! I 'm not fit company for such . Mephistopheles . Mephistopheles For any body on earth . whate'er his trade is . Martha . Martha Then , sir , this evening we shall look for you At the summer-house in the garden her helow . ( Exit Mephistopheles. )
