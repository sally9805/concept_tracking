txt WHOEVER has sailed up the Hudson , in a clear day , may have observed , among other noble and beautiful sights that greeted him on the banks of that inajestic river , the residence of the accomplished author of the volumes bearing the above-named titles . After leaving the wilder and bolder scenery of the highlands . at the opening where the hills begin to recede and stretch away with a somewhat more subdued sweep and even outline , he may have noticed at the left on the northern side of the village of Newburgh , a chaste and finished villa , in the Tudor gothic style , with growing trees surrounding it , marking the taste of an individual who has given a fine practical illustration , as well as an acceptable theory , of both Architecture and Gardening . Our country has not yet dsdicated many temples to Beauty . We do not suppose that Mr. Downing would wish his quiet home to be regarded by the public as one of her shrines . But from his books we should believe him to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " beautiful sisterhood " of the elegant arts ; a willing and prompt encourager of whatever fosters and enlarges our aesthetic culture ; a scholar of comprehensive views and a refined heart , and a hospitable gentleman of course . Such is the sort of person , we presume , that almost every reader of these works places before his mind and associates with the pages ; and he is certginly an author of no ordinary good fortune who can convey through his writings so favorable and so true an impression of his qualities . At any rate , in the department of toil and study which he has chosen and thoroughly given himself to , Mr. Downing stands , as an American , quite alone . It is , indeed , hot a few years since he first made himself known in connection with the subject . The first edition of his " Landscape Gardening ' * was published in 1841 . And whatever degree of merit may attach to his efforts , that merit can yet be shared , so far as the community are aware , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion nor rival . The ground is all his own . For any appearance of a competitor hitherto to question his claims or dispute his positions , or supersede his labors , he may be as dictatorial and as despotic as he pleases . We regard this as a circumstance by no means to be rejoiced in , for the country 's sake ; we wish a multitude were reaching towards the same distinction when we take the general interest into consideration . And we can not doubt that this Sir Joshua Reynolds of our rural decorations himself , if he might but advance the people at large to a deeper and more active interest in his favorite cause , would be ready to divide his empire and distribute the prerogatives of his sovereignty . Meantime , we will be grateful for what he has done . We will hope that he has communicated an impulse that shall not be soon spent ; that he is kindling up an admiration for sylvan scenes and natural beauties that will not die till it has wrought out some worthy and durable results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fallen , for its early advocacy , into the hands of no unscrupulous speculator on the one hand , or narrow-minded bigot on the other .

In the first place , the indifference is not so remarkable as it has been ; it is beginning to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence . There never was a stubborn hostility to artistic pursuits here . They have been neglected rather . But the circumstances of the time did not favor a very thorou* , h or assiduous application to them . Every age has its work ; every period its pressing necessity ; every era its own glory . We have never heard that a nation in the first half-century of its existence , engaged too in a sharp struggle for its liberties , nay for its lifc , has devoted itself much to laying out iloxver-gardens , trimming hedges , or transplanting shrubbery . Our fathers , grave and earnest men , have had solid tasks on their hands . If the founders of the Republic had been inclined to push their horticultural experiments to much extent , they must have turned up the soil with their bayonets , literally made their swords their ploughshares , and without any transformation of the article , used the spear for a pruning-hook . They were not wandering like Arcadian lovers in search of luxurious valleys bathed in a perfumed and dreamy air . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their eyes hardly awakened a thought that could comp*re in majesty with the great thought of Freedom , Justice , Equality and Right which had taken firm possession of their souls . They did battle for the honest cause first ; were loyal to the dictates of divine conscience ; and is not that enough ? Is. it magnanimous in our transatlantic neighbors , especially for our brothers in England , to taunt the men they jwoyoked with oppression and drove into hard necessities , with the reproach that they did not busy themselves with founding schools in the fine arts instead of thrusting back the arm of despotism ? that they , did not expend their energies in adorning Bunker Hill with comely terraces and covering it with parterres of roses , instead of shaping its summit into a rough redoubt and enriching it with heroes ' blood ? But , what might have been foolish effeminacy or shameful unfaithfulness in the Puritans and first Republicans , is a very differemit thing to their posterity . The period of comparative poverty that followed the Revolution , imposing the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to an easy condition . Wealth has begun to heap up its revenues , and it is time to study a wise , rational expenditure of it . Men of leisure , opulence and education are multiplying ; and it ought to be a serious inquiry how they shall devote their resources fur the common benefit , in methods worthy the consideration of the age . The interests of even the subordinate departments of national endeavor demand consideration now . No nation can be said to have a harmonious and complete development or a true greatness , unless it has its Art . That element is essential . WI en it is wanting , something is wanting in the mind and heart of the people . If there is no constant ardor of devotion to the Beautiful ; if no hands " build altars to the Sublime ; " if there are no - " longings to obey 1'he haunting oracles that stir our clay , To make the unseen with actual glories rife And call the starred ideal into life * " then the culture of that people has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symmetrical , but onesided and partial . And this has begun to be understood and felt , here as well as elsewhere . There has been , within a few years past , a perceptible awakening of interest in these subjects . The attention of large numbers of persons has been directed to rural improvements , as well , indeed , as to artistic studies in general . In the vicinity of nearly all our cities are to be found mansions and villa residences , surrounded by grounds whose arrangement gives ample evidence that while much has been done , much more is to be expected . If there is any doubt that a new regard for gardening is springing up and growing , a few moments ' examination of the establishments of Messrs . Hovey &amp; Co. , of Boston , or of Thorburn , of N. Y. , or of Sinclair &amp; Co. , of Baltimore , or of Landreth , of Philadelphia , or of Prince , of Flushing , or of the Horticultural MagaJue , started ten years ago and still conducted by the former firm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking away from the old rules or no-rules respecting architecture , becoming independent of the wretched customs that have been // too prevalent , and asking for cultivated artists to design their buildings instead of ordinary carpenters ; excellent and worthy men are carpenters , but justice to them does not require that they should be subjected to the mortification of a failure in attempting to do what they have not been educated to do . And justice to the interests of all requires that the higher processes of this , as of other intellectual vocations , should be assigned to a distinct and learned profession . The sort of structures that have been common-dull , inexpressive and heavy as they often are ,  --  is to be exchanged for a positive and intelligent style . Convenience and elegance are about to be consulted , and not a senseless habit , nor a degenerate imitation of classic models . Kitchens , parlors and sleeping-rooms are not to be always thrown into the form of the Greek temple , nor domestic comfort sacrificed to the proportions of the Parthenon . Modifications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others such as he , are frequently tried already . To pretend that we love , or can love at present anything like a fixed , regular , original American style , would , of course , be preposterous . A tendency to imitation-not merely a contemplation and study , for the discipline and expansion of the artist 's faculty-but to imitation of the forms of antiquity , we regard , indeed , as the fault of all countries in this century , and not of ours alone . But long perseverance will bring such a style as we just spoke of , a style having reference to our climate , position and habits , and adapted in all respects to our needs . Human beings must have permanent habitations , from the burrowing Troglodyte to the luxurious millionaire , as long as their human hearts retain their social affections , and their physical constitution is unequal to the exposure of an unsheltered life , under the cold canopy of heaven . Then , every individual who erects an abode for himself or for another , should be conscious of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences of what he does he ought not to regard as trifling or transient . They will remain after he has gone to a more silent mansion . Disease and mortality , inestimable misery may be entailed on a family , and on many families , by a careless builder . And harm no less real and lasting may be inflicted on the taste of the community . Whoever orders and superintends the erection of a human home , places that upon the earth which must , in the ordinary course of things , stand there and speak and exert its share of influence , for good or for evil , in moulding the preferences and guiding the future methods of more than one generation . Whoever builds an illproportioned , unsightly house , insults the community , wrongs his neighbors , perhaps lowers the standard of taste and detracts from the common weal . We are indebted , then , deeply , to those who , . by their writings or their example , stir up a spirit of investigation , elevate the tone of feeling , and honestly help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day a quicker apprehension and appreciation of the results of art . Painters , sculptors , architects and musicians , are characters that constantly become more significant among us , and more operative . A disposition for travel is spreading . All classes find a new joy in turning their backs on cities , the artificial usages that exert a tyrannical dominion there , the conventionalities and outside vanities that glitter and mislead and bewilder there . The centralization that goes on at the bidding of commerce and manufactures is felt to carry with it a dangerous trial for purity of heart . It is found a salutary thing that the pulse , heated and swollen in the ambitious strifes and competi-* tions of masses , should be quieted by the cool breath of solitude . The acquaintance between men and nature promises to strengthen into an intimacy . Nature in her holy simplicity is revealing herself , with all her wonderful and enrapturing loveliness , to watchful eyes . She calls the children of the land to witness that she has finer sights to offer than dioramas and panoramas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off their eyes from sunsets of machinery , lamp-light and screens , and lead their feet up her steep* mountain-sides till they stand face to face before the august splendors of an .. autumnal nightfall . She would show them a pomp and pageantry around , * their daily walks more gorgeous than in. all the costliness of St. Peter 's . She would wean them from " the world 's accursed sorcery , " and lift up their hearts in loving worship to Him who made // " the hills Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun ; the vales Stretching in pensive quietness between , The venerable woods-rivers that move In majesty , and the complaining brooks That make the meadows green ; and poured round all , Old ocean 's grey and melancholy waste . " She would teach them that the narrow schemes of selfishness do not embrace the true purposes of life nor the grandest things in the universe , any more than the smoky and dusty atmosphere of the town contains the sweet fresh breezes that are borne down from forest-crowned heights . She would touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while she unfolds that visible veneration of Wisdom and Love that God has written out on the woods , the plains , the rivers and the sea . And these offers are not scorned . Nature 's overtures are not wholly disregarded . in the heightened eagerness for visiting scenes of natural beauty , then , and in the raised estimation of country life , we see a sign of hope for the advancement of the kingdom of Taste . It would certainly be a strange insensibility , if the rare sights presented by the surface of the American continent were always unheeded . It were a special sin in us to become sottish slaves of gain , with such pleading memorials of the Almighty 's Omnipotence and Bounty scattered around us . Against us , of all mankind , the sentence of John Milton would lie heavily , who says , " In those fair seasons of the year when the air is calm and pleasant , it were an injury and sullenness against nature not to go forth and view her beauties , and partake in her rejoicings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the least apprehension lest this tendency to rural retirement will reach excess here . The characteristics of our people leave no chance of a hazard of that sort . They make such a fear altogether superfluous . How immensely should we gain and be ennobled as a nation , could we rear up , among our lofty peaks and graceful streams and picturesque valleys , to take in their features and reproduce them for the admiration of the world , such men as Photogenes , Corregio , Claude Lorraine , Poussin , and Salvator Rosa ! could a genuine enthusiasm for real beauty be enkindled ! And as bustling enterprise is rapidly intruding , with wide encroachments , on the domains of the wilderness , how important it is that close after the hardy , pathless pioneer , should follow the discerning eye and the ornamenting hand of the artist ! Particularly ought we to be regardful of preserving the charming varieties of our landscapes . The science of arranging grounds and transplanting trees , in other words , of landscape-gardening , is therefore one deserving the most careful cultivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man 's awkwardness alone , and leave no substitute for the features destroyed , would be an outrage upon humanity and religion . What Hogarth taught long since is true , that they who would succeed in Art , have but to follow the same rules that should guide them as auxiliary students of Nature . Another encouraging circumstance in the aspect of the concerns of Taste , is the preference that is shown in many minds and many places for agricultural avocations , over those of traffic and commerce-a preference that is probably destined to exercise itself soon in a yet more marked degree . A profound respect appears for the business of the farmer . Look for evidence at the subscription list for Henry Colman 's Agricultural Survey in Europe , and observe the names recorded in it . Young men , at an adult age , shake off the dust of their feet in disgust upon the cities where they have passed their infancy , and go back to the interior to learn to be farmers , as they call it-apprentice themselves to the exalted calling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temptations where the freshness and virtue of their childhood was put in awful peril . Is this at all extraordinary , if the calculation made by some practical merchant approaches correctness , that out of every ten young men who go into business in the competitions of great seaports , not more than one can be said to succeed ? that nine-tenths at least , and probably more , fail signally ? It is an appalling comment on the imperfect distribution of labor . Wise parents , too , not seldom choose a situation for their children among agriculturists , rather than expose them to incur the risks and abide the ordeal of trade . Stout-hearted reformers , ready to grapple with dire forms of evil , look with a feeling akin // to despair on metropolitan vices , and turn with hope to the healthful freedom and naturalness of the cultivators of the soil . They share in the emotion of that mightiest Reformer and holiest Preacher who wept over Jerusalem , and loved the silent haunts of Olivet and the secret seclusion of Bethany more than the thPon*ed marts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrims , who would make wearisome and circuitous deviations from their journeys , rather than encounter one of those populous centres-one of those " Vanity-Fairs , " whose wickedness is so rife and so revolting . The truth is , we hold every author to he a public benefactor who promotes an inclination towards a practical devotion to agriculture . The experiments and publications of the gentleman referred to above , Mr. Colman , have no doubt been exceedingly useful in this regard , as well as in assisting and enlightening the profession itself . Hundreds of aspiring and well-meaning youths press into our large towns yearly , under the most erroneous impressions as to the facilities held out there for the accumulation of wealth ; and they are obliged to go home again chagrined and disappointed ; happy if they do not linger on with their moral discrimination weakened , their native affections wasted , their integrity sullied , their whole higher nature dragged down and trampled under foot ; happy if they have not lost what they never can regain . It n*eds still to he more thoroughly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean employment ; that he has one of the grandest kinds of work given him , among human toils . If there is any man who stands , in the midst of his ordinary ever-recurring tasks , close by the hidden springs and glowing mysteries of creation , it seems to be he . If there is any man who has opportunities to catch the meaning of the " open secret , " it is he . His advantages for possessing himself of a solid understanding , a shrewd judgment , and a reverential posture of the soul , if he will only seek and appropriate them , are , in this land of diffused education , unequalled . The laws of God operate around him almost unperverted by the conflicting forces of the will of man . The bright arch of the skies bends over him , expanding the scope of his thoughts ; the green and fruitful earth whereon he labors is suggestive of continually enlarging discoveries and inventions ; the growing plants that start up noiselessly at his invitation out of the earth 's prolific lap , keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ek ) quent voices , sounds that the Creator inspires , utterances of the love that fills the heart of all things , whisper to him , rebuke his disohedience , and draw him to goodness . By him the wisdom that day uttereth to day and the knowledge that night showeth to night , is most plainly to be read and most easy of interpretation . Surely , the undevout tiller of the soil , having such access to communion in the presence-chamber of the Great Designer , no less than the undevout astronomer , is mad . Of course we do not intend reproach on the employments of other artizans , the tradesman and the mechanic . We have a faith that all earnest and upright labor is honorable and sacred , if not , with Carlyle and the monks ( some monks ) , that " all work is worship . " But we presume the tradesmen themselves will admit that their department is just now somewhat overcrowded ; that it were hotter the rising strength of this age were diverted into some other direction ; that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , agriculture must remain the basis of our institutions ; and that hitherto , in the common estimate of mankind , judging by their literature or their conduct , it has not held the elevated rank that belongs to it in a just scale of human dignities . And this . is all we claim . Nay , a little more we claim : it has not been in Tyre and Carthage and such spots as they-the models of mercantile ambition-that divine thoughts have been born to quicken the mind of centuries , and trumpet-tones gone forth to rouse the world 's slumbering powers , echoing and re-echoing through the farthest halls of Time . Now agriculture and horticulture are kindred sciences , if indeed the former does not include the latter , as horticulture includes arboriculture and floriculture . It is more convenient , perhaps , that the terms should be kept separate in their signification , and yet there is an intimate relationship between them . XVhen Mr. Downing is advocating the aesthetic phase of horticulture , he is laboring in a field which is prepared for // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for the cultivation of the ground . The moral influence in either case , is very much the same . Mr. Jefferson asserted that " corruption of morals in the mass of cultivators , is a phenomenon of which no age or nation has furnished any example ; " and probably very few persons have either lived among flowers and hedges , and read the literature of Gardening , in anyofthe works that really set forth its charms , from Columella 's De Re Rustica down to Loudon 's Emcyciopwdia , without feeling themselves , for the time being , to be breathing in a pure companionship . The calming , moderating , reflective character of either of t.hese related pursuits must be obvious . It is an excellent idea that M. Ferrus and others have lately acted upon , of providing a farm to be subdued and cultivated by the insane of the hospitals in Paris , and as one would have expected , it has succeeded admirably . There are a vast number of persons wandering up and down on this earth , not convicted yet of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom the malady may be ascribed without much boldness of metaphor , that would be healed of their restlessness and discontent and frivolity , by a like treatment . If there is a sanative virtue coming up out of the soil for those who handle it , that can hush the frantic fury of madness , reinstate the prostrate reason on its lost throne , and reduce the incoherent mutterings of the maniac to right expressions of connected thoughts , then the same virtue may surely exert a spell over all the heart 's malignant diseases , banishing its selfishness , assuaging the fever of its ambition , restraining the rage of its revenge , and quelling its every baser passion . Can we conceive a voluptuary loving to put his hands to the real work of gardens ? In tropical climates he might delight his senses in their luxurious shades , dally with pleasure in the midst of their delicious fragrance . But then he is no true gardener , in spirit or in deed . His presence there is a profanation , and his vices do open violence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sensualist . He and foul thoughts must dwell asunder . He is above the mere details of his occupation , too , and yet they help to exalt him . Among the germinating produces that rise and *shoot upward about him-wonders of God 's creating , he is awed by the nearness of the Divinity , and a solemnity as of a sanctuary not built with hands , encircles him . He feels , with Lord Bacon , that Gardening is " the purest of human pleasures , the greatest refreshment to the spirits of man ; " with Sir William Temple , that " it is an employment and a possession for which no man is too low nor too high ; " he can share in the compassion of the English poet , who exclaimed , " I pity that man who has completed everything in his garden ; " and he believes the saying of the French King , who declared that " the love of Gardening is the only passion that augments with age . " The branches and flowers he trains up , become associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he cherishes them with a tender affection . Nay , if he is what he ought to be , they will sometimes assume a yet higher office . They will be his teachers , and willing to receive their hallowed instructions , he will be ready to take upon his lips the poet 's words : - " Floral apostles , that in dewy splendor Weep without wo , and blush wiLhout a crime ; O , m ay I deeply learn , and ne'er surrender Your love sublime ! In the sweet-scented pictures , Heavenly artist , With which Thou paintest Nature 's wide-spread halls , What a delightful lesson thou impartest Of love to all ! Posthumous glories , angel-like collection , Upraised from seed or bulb , buried in earth Ye are to me a type of resurrection And second birth . Neath cloistered boughs each floral bell that swingeth , And tolls its perfume on the passing air , Makes Sabbath in the fields , and ever ringeth A call to prayer . Were I , 0 God , in churchless lands re-maining , Far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find in flowers of thy ordaining , Priests , sermons , shrines ! , Classic mythology paid perhaps the best tribute in its power to all the processes of the cultivation of the ground , by placing them under the protecting guardianship of some of its least blameworthy and contemptible deities . The // precepts of Grecian Sages were uttered in the still retreats of G ' rdens . Philosophers and scholars have chosen their resorts for the contemplation of immortal Wisdom . And probably very few of those men ( we rejoice that they are so many and are multiplying ) who retire every year from the perplexities of more public business , to close their days in beautifying some secluded acres , do so without being conscious that they gain fresh accessions of inward power and peace . Their tenacious desires for extrinsic good are weakened ; the tight grasp of avarice is loosened ; and if they do not positively draw near to Heaven , they gradually acquire freedom from the servitude of mammon . They make unexpected advances in the attributes of a genial , well-developed manly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical regard to ornamental gardening and architecture could spring up and take a strong hold upon the popular mind at this early period of our history . The forming period is the period of chief concern , in taste as in all other points of education , with communities as with persons . What is well done now , is well done for a long ' future . What is ill-contrived and clu*sily executed now , must inevitably be removed , and the retraced steps taken again . Every wrong bias given to the habits of the people in these matters , as in all other matters , by vicious examples , is a misfortune . Materials are only prepared , in this way , for a change by and bye , and the attainment ofhigh excellence is deferred if not precluded . An instance of the effect of bad beginnings may be found in the protracted sway exercised by the formal , geometric , otherwise called the ancient style of gardening , on the continent of Europe , and especially in its Southern portions . If Louis XIV. , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fame , and by the help of Le Notre , a disciple of the ancient schools , was able to produce a result of such magnificence as the gardens of Versailles , what might he not have done if both of them had been free from the established prejudice ? Charles II. , his . imitator , might not have been misled , and so might have secured a better progress for the Art in his country ; William might not have plunged still further into the wrong path by encouraging still worse excesses ; Britain need not have waited for the reformatory suggestions of Addison and Pope , and Holland might have done some service , instead of being afflicted by an incubus of stiffness , trimness , close clipping and paint , with statues of Dutch Venuses. * How much mischief , too ,  --  one Mr. " Capability Brown " was capable of doing by his false notions to all England ! As sure as this art is destined to continual improvement , every poor specimen , every shapeless structure and incongruously disposed country-seat must give place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that each such specimen prolongs our imperfections and makes the desired end more difficult . For this reason , the present should be regarded as the great opportunity to introduce enlightened views . The face of the country at its first settlement , and in many places * We can not forbear inserting here Pope 's Satirical " Inventory of a virtuoso gardener , " written about 1713 , and quoted by Mr. Downing , as illustrative of that inclination to verdant sculpture , which was imported into England from abroad , and which the better love of Englishmen , even from the time of Bacon himself , revolted against .

The form into which the virgin soil is now moulded must be retained for a long time to come . The contour of plantations , the curves of groves , roads , walks and river-banks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliterated . Inquiry ought therefore to be aroused and kept alive . Judicious and learned treatises ought to be written and circulated and read . Each citizen should feel that a personal responsibleness is devolved on himself , and contribute his own share to the advancement of the whole . Should we be fortunate enough to have annals and reach a reverend age , it would be desirable that the masters of taste and the lovers of beauty in that remote epoch , looking back on our achievements and the impulse we shall have given , either in a right or wrong direction , shall find something in us to eulogize and be thankful for . Whatever tendency we encourage , let us remember that verdict of the hereafter . Should not we kindly provide for future anLiquarians too ? Should not we be gathering some worthy materials for decent ruins and interesting relics ? In case such despisers of their present , and such lovers of the mouldering past , - of whatever " comes down covered with the awful hoar of innumerable ages , " should , by any possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Camden and Stowe , or the Laird of Monkbarns himself willing to pass their days tracing faded inscriptions , like old Bosius , in subterranean chambers , would it not be a bitter cruelty to disappoint their wonder-seeking curiosity ? to leave them nothing but melancholy proofs that their ancestors had no eye nor hand for the elegant , or the graceful , or the endearing , but were only plodding disciples of the awkward and the temporary ? Unlikely as it may seem now , little as the spirit of the times seems to favor such a prophecy , it is not impossible that men may again be born as richly inspired with veneration for what is ancient , and high , and hallowed by the centuries , as Burke and Sir Thomas Browne . We are amenable to posterity for what we do with our noble heritage . In climate , as well as other fixed natural conditions requisite for success in the different departments of gardening , America enjoys the most various advantages . The United States alone , embracing so vast a latitude , include almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ev&amp;y kind of growth except those which belong to tropical and frigid extremes . They offer variety of surface enough to satisfy the most fastidious demand . They contain abundant opportunities in numberless localities , to secure within given limits a perfect harmony of the parts and an entire unity of expression . Art could carve our hills into monuments of combined beauty and grandeur much more easily than Stasierates could carve Mount Athos into a colossal statue of Alexander . There is smoothness and grace of outline in our scenery , sufficient to delight the author of the " Essays on the Sublime and Beautiful , " with bold blufTh , and rugged peaks , and broken chasms , and romantic glades , enough to inspire an Ossian . Streams , lakes , rivulets , cascades , either make artificial works in water superfluous , or supply the means for their construction . There are slopes of as accurate a pitch of elevation as those that have made so fine an exposure of the plains of oriental celebrity in Media arid Persia . There are forest trees of wonderful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides and plains from the Penobscot to the Columbia . And as to foreign kinds not yet imported , we have a commercial intercourse that might enable us to vie with England , which has introduced into the island , within a century , some thirteen or fourteen hundred species . It will be deeply to be deplored if in ruthless haste we insult the Dryads , strip our land of its noble ornaments , cut trees away and never plant them , lay our homes and fields bare in a shameful nakedness , expose ourselves to the burning rays of summer and the bleakwiuds of winter ,  - -  all , when we might have enjoyed the delicious coolness , or the sheltering protection of shady groves and groups . We inherit English blood , too , and by virtue of that we should be gifted with an ardent love of whatever is picturesque and charming in rural life . For the reason that there is a contagion // in the passion for rural decoration and rural pleasure , every devotee has ground for perseverance . We need not be disheartened from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not take . There is a sentiment native to humanity that forbids such an apprehension . Besides , they have generally been of very rapid growth , as their history shows . It is stated that Cosmo De Medici commenced the first botanical garden in Europe , at Pisa , in the year 1543 ; and that in fifty years it was found necessary to devote a second inclosure for the accommodation of the plants . In the year 1812 , a single mercantile house shipped for a Scotch port more than two millions of seedlings . In 1760 , fifty-two years before , there were not more than half-a-dozen nurseries in all Scotland . The mighty genius of Walter Scott alone , with the love for nature that breathed through him , was enough to set his countrymen on fire for such enterprises . The magician 's magic was felt here , as it was throughout the entire realm of the intellect and the affections . It might seem that our population would be peculiarly predisposed to this branch of artistical study , because it is exercised on the scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual are intimately blended ; the practical element enters into it somewhat largely ; and therefore , it may appear that it will suit the humor of this community , in this material age , better than arts where the processes are more abstruse . But then , it is to be remembered , that it is a pursuit which requires a large share of personal exertion . The attention to it must be almost universal . In order to great success all householders , all proprietors of lands , we had almost said the tenant too , must be interested in it . Let there be no indifference to the subject , therefore , under the impression that excellent proficiency will come of itself . We have been regarding our subject very much under its national aspects . In this connection another consideration presents itself , which ought by no means to be overlooked . Gardening and architecture are arts that promote a genuine patriotism . As lovers of our country we are bound to cherish them . Everything that beautifies the land , enhances its worth in the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course heightens and confirms their attachment to it . That very pains that . is expended upon it , being of an agreeable nature , endears it the more . It is not less true , that those objects in any country , which are a source of common pride and gratulation to all the people , increase the patriotic sentiment , than that , as Herder maintains , they are indispensable to a national poetry . Such objects are venerable architectural erections , public or private , and a territory richly overspread with proofs of human refinement . It will be found , we suspect , a rule of few exceptions that those nations which have had the strongest rural associations , combined with a vivid perception of the beauties of art , the copyist of nature , have manifested the most decided national spirit . Is it not just what philosophy might have predicted ? Give a man a few roods of soil ; let him cultivate it and adorn it ; let him plant his home in the midst of it ; let him pass his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fixed locality ; and is it not inevitable , in the nature of things , that he should feel a closer tie uniting him to his native land , than the migrating boarder in the fifth story of a city hotel ? It is a. sound policy to endow as large a portion of the population as possible , with some property or interest in the immovable ground . Multiply the bonds that join the citizen with the soil , and you provide a support for civil Institutions . Wise statesmen have understood this , and our shrewd political economists would do well not to forget it . Something is due to gratitude also . If the good earth is our mother she is entitled to a filial service . Who does not believe that statistics of crime would show a vast proportion of offences that come under the cognizance and penalty of the legal statutes , to be committed by persons that have no ownership in the soil ? The homeless , the itinerant speculator , the restless vagabond , your floating , strolling dodging vice-fanciers , these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these , are found the mischiefs of rebellion and knavery . In these are nursed the beginnings of insubordination . Injustice that the laws do not forbid , but through their imperfection still wink at , is perhaps nearly as much sustained by the holders of // land as by any other class . But generally , they will be apt to follow the provisions of the law , and abide by its decisions . It is for their interest to do so . They who have something at stake are likely to respect the preserving power , and they , thank Heaven , are here the many . Efforts to diffuse a satisfaction in rural pursuits , a relish for rural pleasures , ought , for these reasons , to meet a zealous encouragement from the community . It is a matter of principle as well as of good taste . In these efforts , it is very important that a right direction be pursued ; that labor be bestowed where it is needed ; that instructions be afforded which can be made available ; that rules be laid down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Downing has been in a good degree successful , though considerably less so in the cottage residences than in the landscape gardening . In the former , as well indeed as in the latter , his aim is excellent- " to inspire all persons with a love of beautiful forms , and a desire to assemble them around their daily walks of life . " Perhaps we misjudge in supposing that the effect will be less popular and general than is to he desired . In our opinion this particular end is not perfectly accomplished in the work before us . The author has performed a different work , a work worthy his eminent talents , and performed it well . But notwithstanding his endeavors to the contrary , we suspect most of his plans are on a scale implying expenditures beyond a safe economy for any but a limited class . We wish he would only popularize his work still more ; or that he would write another for a cheaper sale , and in that way made secure of a wider circulation . Not that he should abate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; not that he should concede anything to false principles in the art . This would be one of the most pernicious of all possible mistakes . We have suffered enough from it already ; we have had examples in abundance of a defiance of certain primary , fundamental rules that ought never to be violated . In the attempt to imitate grand classical models with the outlay of a few dollars ; to reconcile a vast design with a small fortune ; to compress the various beauties of antiquity into dimensions of a few feet-without marble , or anything in fact , but the lighter kind of materials , all fitness and comeliness have been sacrificed . The orders have been grossly insulted , the eye pained , Art burlesqued . Let the principles therefore be preserved and insisted on in their purity , at all hazards . Real artists must guide and sway , or there will be no lofty attainments . The past shews that if it shows anything . But practicability must be consulted . Common builders , all through the land , need instruction , instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and follow . A spirit of Art must be enkindled among the people . Great models must rise to plead silently with their subduing eloquence ; and then the people must be drawn to behold them , to gaze upon them ; to appreciate them , in the secret confession of enraptured minds . How was it in Florence and Venice and Rome , in the fifteenth century ? The patronage we want is the patronage of the whole community , the riches of the opulent with the toil and the emotion of the poor . If the theory is correct , that the arts can flourish only under monarchs and a nobility , only amidst striking inequalities in all physical advantages , only amidst enormous accumulations , in a few hands , of affluence , luxuries and power , why then we must prepare our minds for a sad deprivation ; we must despairingly conclude to dispense with the arts , and on those terms , we , for our part , will resign them cheerfully . But we cherish a different belief . What we are longing to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes , in keeping with the scenery and simply adorned ,  --  improvements of our natural inheritance . In order to that , the peeplo at large , we repeat , must be touched , moved and taught . We have already intimated our conviction , that no style has been yet adopted in this country , that is to become either national or permanent . It may require centuries to develope and perfect one . But really we can not see why we should not have one . Whether we shall ever have Strasbourg Cathedrals , St. Paul 's Cathedrals , Parthenons and Pantheons , is not to be predicted . But that we shall have a style of architecture both domestic and public , seems tons not at all an*Utopian expectation . Why should not the mind of this vast section of the Continent ex*-press itself in this form , as well as in // other forms ? Why should we be bound , as a matter of course , by the customs of departed ages ? Artists have been so long obliged to turn to antiqui*ty for perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped by an ancient mould . Contemplating the creations of the master spirits of the old time , musing amid magnificent ruins , studying at Rome , they are very apt to go back , out of all the present , to classic periods , for their subjects , as well as for their inspiration . They dwell in epochs that never can really return , and give us new , often finely executed embodiments of the conceptions of an exploded mythology . They still produce new gods and goddesses . They do well to study antiquity . It can not be dispensed with . But the question is , whether , having learned in its schools , they might not bring their genius and skill to bear upon present realities . Might not a new power be at once placed in their hands , if they chose subjects that would appeal to the heart of the living world ? Having sat at the feet of Apelles and Phidias , Michael Angelo and Canova , might they not bring forth the results of their acquired wisdom in glorious representations of actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be said that the heart of humanity is essentially the same always , and that heroic actions , whenever achieved , will always excite the same emotions . There is , without doubt , a great deal of truth in this . Love and hate , suffering and joy , magnanimity and cowardice , are to-day what they were before Homer was born ; in London or Illinois , what they were in Thebes and Attica . Hence , to a considerable extent , we may account for the success of " Cato , " " Ion , " " Julius Ciusar . " Talfourd may have done as well in the development of the Greek idea of Destiny , as in his speeches on the " Custody of Infants ' Bill " in Parliament . And this not only proves the versatility of his powers , but the identity of profound feelings all over the globe , from Mount Olympus to Rydal Mount , or Chimborazo . The natural working of the passions is always and everywhere the same ; they may , thercfore , be powerfully portrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This unchangeableness of all the attributes of the human soul is sufficient to explain the interest that attaches to intellectual productions of which antiquity has supplied the themes . Besides , a graceful execution has a certain intrinsic charm in itself , apart from all mutable conditions . But after all , it would be very singular , if events , discoveries , triumphs , heroisms with which we have a near and special sympathy , did not enjoy a priority of place in our regards ; if their representations did not peculiarly affect us . And we would submit , whether it is not the legitimate province of classical antiquity to give culture , enlargeinent and refinement to the productive mind , rather than to provide the ideas for that mind to unfold ; whether a genuine enthusiasm is not necessary for artistic superiority . Whether the arts , like the literature of a nation , to deserve the name , must not simply express the best sentiments and character of the people . If this nation , having tasted of freedom , sprung up for the race so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceivable sphere of worthy effort ; think any great thoughts ; live any full and harmonious life ; be impelled by any lofty aims-then we shall have Artwith styles of our own . If otherwise , then we deserve to be servile imitators all our days . It will be a deserved , as it will be an inevitable fate . To apply what we have been saying of the fine arts in general , including poetry and the drama , to rural architecture in particular : we must have abodes of some sort ; utility demands so much , and moreover , claims to have a will in their arrangement . But we wish them to wear an artistic expression also . And these united claims of the beautiful and the useful are easily reconciled . Now , in order to reconcile them , our domestic architecture must grow directly out of the wants and the position of the people ; not of some other people , but of this people . Climate , comfort , occupation , modes of life , materials , must all be considered . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different mineral fields , and ourluxuriant forests , * * Experiments with various kinds of wood , are continually bringing bcautiful specimens into use . We were lately shown , at Chickering 's large Piano Forme Establishment in Boston , Mass. , some most exquisite veneering material of the softest grain and capable of a fine polish , wrought out of the root of the black walnut . // we are not afraid of the result . We do not feel confident that either of the prevailing styles , Classic , Italian or Gothic , which now divide the preferences of our builders , will ultimately constitute precisely the style of the nation . Nor do we predict anything completely original . Perhaps this is not required hy the convenience of men , or promised by any aspiration in them . It appears to us more probable that some modification of the Northern European method will he likely to characterize our future edifices . However this may he , the architecture must he a graceful expression of the sentiment of the people , and adapt itself gradually to the wants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties that obstruct the advancement of domestic architecture among us , there are two or three minor dangers and detestable habits that we would just notice , as we pass . One of these is the tendency to a profusion of worse than senseless ornament . Dwelling-houses are hedizened with meretricious finery . In some districts , this passion for gaudy display grows contagious , and rages into ridiculous extremes . Carved blocks and all fantastical things are appended indiscriminately , to a column swollen as with dropsy , to the door , under the eaves , over a window ; sometimes where there is no defect needing to be thus concealed , sometimes where there is no elegance to be brightened . The first germs of a tasteful spirit are thus loaded with trash , and suppressed . What happened in Diodesian 's gorgeous baths , when the superabundant embellishments fell from the walls and crushed a gathered multitude , is emblematic of the effects of this practice on the life of art . It should be a warning . Let us at least be simple . Let us avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with good common sense . In more senses than one it is true-what Bassanio says to Portia : " Thus ornament is but the guiled shore To a most dangerous sea . " Again , there are frequent blunders in the selection of a site . In the town , where land is purchased by the square foot , this is excusable ; for there is the apology of necessity . But in the country , the proper domain for rural improvement , the excuse does not hold . Yet the dwellers there often choose a bog to build upon , when , with a little exertion , they might have secured a commanding eminence , with an en chanting prospect ; or a batTen heath , where they might have appropriated a sylvan retreat ; or a bleak corner , where they might have found a sunny slope . Others have an unaccountable determination to press their dwellings close to the vile roadside , instead of occupy .. ing a green quiet spot , at a reserved distance from the clamors and impertinences and dusty clouds of the trodden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Roman , Pliny ! " If you have a country-seat left you by an ancestor , " exclaimed Varro , " in an ill-air or upon an ill-soil , sell it and buy another ; sell it though you receive but a fourth part of its value ; sell it for anything rather than live upon it . " There is an equally inexplicable neglect of shade , either from climbing .. plants and vines , or from the branches of trees , united with a decided predilection for verdigris and white lead . But this is a mistake only , of the few whose hearts are shut in a close , hard insensibility , against the sweetest sights and sounds of nature . Yet another defect to be attended to , not uncommon , is incompleteness in the finish of the whole . Some incongruity appears . The house is excellent , perhaps , but the surrounding grounds are sadly deficient . Or the house and grounds are both well , but the fences and hedges are bad . Or one part of the house itself contradicts another ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evils that spring from an imperfectly cultivated mind , or else from a calculating beyond one 's means . If they appeared only in the plans of individual citizens , and never in cases where a number of persons are associated together , as a corporation , in the erection of banks , hospitals , customhouses , colleges , and halls for a variety of other public uses , the fact would be less discouraging . As it is , the fault must be ascribed , we suppose , to youth and inexperience . Among our public structures , churches hold the preéminence . It is right it should be so ; for the idea of worship is the highest and most indestructible in the human soul . The oldest existing traces of architectural attempts are but // the struggling , imperfect , and yet sublime expressions of the sentiment of reverence towards a power and a wisdom above . From the most primitive periods , religion has reared monuments of gratitude , penitence , trust or fear . It has raised the altars of an external propitiation , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temples of the spiritual sacrifice . Genius has ever been bringing her tributes to that profoundest thougl*t which recognizes the Infinite , and which gives birth to eternal aspirations after a Goodness kindred with the perfection of God . Among us , descendants of the Puritans , a right appreciation of the value of sacred edifices is plainly appearing . The edifices themselves , indeed , were always honored ; nowhere more so than in the Pilgrim 's heart . But with our stern foretathers it was an honor that had no affinity with iesthetics ; it was a respect for the uses of the " meetinghouse , " and not at all an admiration for its intrinsic comeliness . Accordingly , the early churches of New England were the rudest conglomerations of timber , mortar , clap-boards and shingles . They were located often in some unproductive spot , rocky or sandy , absolately good for nothing , and therefore , to be cheaply bought . The old horror of image-worship was upon those men . They were the children of iconoclasts . Popery with its abominations was still an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staunch a foe to receive any concessions . The life-like representations of martyrdom and the saints called up a feeling very different from the sense of beauty . The picture-hung interior of a cathedral or a chapel would have , to their perceptions , the very order and glare of the infernal pit . The lines drawn by art on the ceilings were as full of awful significance as the terrible inscription that shook the courage of Belshazzar . A cartoon was a device of the devil . But this reaction against the accompaniments of worship was anything but a revolt against worship itself . Protestantism , for the sake of the substance , was willing to part with the glitter of the Romish dress , and the stateliness of the Romish ritual . Hence , we believe , there is room enough in Protestantism for the cultivation of the arts , at least of architecture . Faith remains ; and while that remains there is hope . The age of an absence of faith is the only really fatal period for art , as for all other great interests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of mechanism , of restless physical enterprise , is throwing its shadow over the world now ; and we may even yet be only in the penumbra . Butwe have a perfect confidence that faith will return to bless and sustain the repentant race ; and therefore , it is that we look for a new power and a new glory in art . The influence of the Catholic mystical schools has departed , not to return . But Christianity lives , and will live for ever . The invincible church survives . Humanity , too , sinning and dependent , but of unlimited capacities , is still engaged with the mighty mystery of life . Heaven 's arch of wonder is stretched over us . The inward prophecy of immortality spreads the solemn hush of devotion through the spirit . And while all this is true , there can be little question that men will use the forms of material things as symbols both to express and to inspire a faith in things invisible . Churches , as gathering-places for social prayer and religious instruction , centres of holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come . The only question is , shall they be awkward or graceful structures ? Shall they delight or offend the eye ? Shall they expand or belittle , elevate or confuse the mind that contemplates them ? In the villages and the cities where they stand , prompters to prayer , tokens of eternity , voiceless pleaders for righteousness , shall they be an ornament or an ugliness ? Should they not blend beauty with sanctity ? We would have quarries opened in our mountains , that these churches might be of durable materials ; that the enduring stones might gather about them hallowed associations from generation to generation . We would have them located in the sweetest places that nature offers , where the din and tumult of crowds can not come to disturb ; in quiet groves , amidst growing and climbing green , in the shaded and winding approaches ; so that the breath of prayer from mortal lips might be mingled , as it rises , with the incense that goes up for ever from the joyful works of God . We would have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but fine proportions , in a style corresponding with the dignity o* // the purpose , and as well adapted as the rural dwellings scattered around should be to the conveniences of the home 's daily life . We should have no fear of paintings or sculpture , if they should embody love , self-denial , meek submission or any disinterested affection ; if they were memorials of excellence ; if they perpetuated the power of worthy examples . Were the inspired scriptures written in Mosaic , on the walls , as in the temples of the days of Constantine , it would be no harm . We would in every possible way imitate in our sanctuaries the soul-subduing grandeur of that primeval temple of nature , inscribed with the wisdom , informed and made living by the indwelling spirit of the Almighty . Our religion is a spirit and a life . It is " greater than the temple . " But whatever deepens its influence , opens the heart for its advent , brings home its message , is not to he despised . Its founder did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavenly lessons by the lilies of the field . We wish to return for a moment before we conclude , to the other part of our subject , the cultivation and especially the ornamenting of the ground . The praise accorded to Mr. Downing for his success in this department of his study , and in his treatise on landscape gardening , hardly admits of qualification . Those who have not been accustomed to consider gardening as a distinct art , will be surprised to follow him in his discussions of the clearness of its principles and the minuteness of its details . He has done for America what Sir Uvedale Price , or Whately , or Loudon , could not do . The work abounds in practical directions , while it also awakens that passion for the beautiful which must precede the beginning of exertion . His catalogue of deciduous and evergreen trees ; his descriptions of the characteristics and adaptations of each ; his quick perception of their effects in scenery , with the interspersed classical and poetical references , make the chapters devoted to these topics among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranging of trees , there is room for almost indefinite improvement . A person with a ready discernment of the graceful and the picturesque may be constantly introducing features with new expressiveness into his grounds , approaching VOL. xvl. - No . LXXXLI. nearer and nearer to the standard of perfection , as long as he lives . Any person will understand this who has observed the important change that may be introduced into the view of a natural landscape , by the removal of a single branch . As to creepers , vines and climbing plants , very little has been accomplished with them here , hitherto . And though we must rely on importation for a considerable number of varieties , there are yet many of native growth that hang their graceful festoons almost exclusively in the wild and unbroken forests . The managementof earth and water is treated by our author with such a degree of intelligibleness and*thoroughness as to answer all the purpose that is intended to be answered . V/e thank him heartily , too , for whatever checks he would impose on an exaggerated fondness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , when they are at variance with the character of surrounding objects . " An ambition for showy and excessive ornament , in gardening as well as in architecture and elsewhere , is a pretty sure indication of a taste not more than half-formet . It is a childish fancy . A mature discretion is necessary to regulate such a tendency , and prevent it from producing ludicrous or painful abortions . Bacon was right : " As for the making of knots and figures with divers colored earths , they be but toys ; I , for my part , do not like images cut out in juniper or other garden stuff ; they be for children . " We surely do not want Turkish boudoirs , winter-alcoves , Indian shades , or elaborately constructed grottoes . They are not suited to us ; they are too expensive . But we may have and shall have , occasional vases and pieces of statuary upon our terraces and in our conservatories ; arbors and rustic seats ; fountains and cascades . When we have reached the more substantial merits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refinements will come of themselves . We would begin with the simplest processes . In transplanting trees , for example , we would infuse a new zeal . Of the whole mass of householders and landholders , how many are there who have ever taken the spade into their hands for such a work , or seriously thought of it ? And yet there are few ways in which one can more easily benefit posterity . Are we in so great a 25 // hurry that we can not wait for the tree to grow ? Is no result worth anything that is not attained in a moment ? Or , have we not kindness coupled with foresight enough to do a gracious deed for those that shall live when we are dead ? Without any outlay of money , or at the most trifling cost , by an hour 's labor on a few vernal or autumnal days a resident in the country may open to himself a source of many years of inestimable enjoyment . lie may transform his home from a blank target for wind , sun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boughs , decked with clambering woodbines or honeysuckles , sheltered from storm , invitingly cool in summer , and made melodious by the voices of singing birds . This practice of transplanting , ought to be especially applied to the ptaces of burial . They who are regardless of the abodes of their dead can hardly make good their claim to any share in the portion of humanity . They must go apart from the long line of conscious and loving beings , from the faithful Jacob who lifted a commemorative pillar over the grave of Rachel , even from the vanished tribes that built those wilderness-mounds in our western territories , - from all civilized and uncivilized families of men . Whoever could persuade the people of country districts to enclose and adorn their grave-yards , to dispose appropriate shades among them , to lay out pleasant walks and plant flowers , would perform a most thankworthy service . Too frequently these spots present a repulsive barrenness ; witb dilapidated fences , a sterile soil , and not a shrub nor tree , scarcely a grass-blade , to relieve the monotonous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their rural adornings ; shrines wbitber the bereaved and sorrowful would love to make their pilgrimages and linger long , pouring out tears ,  --  the sad offering of bleeding affections , and find some sweet solace for their grief . They might add their bitter drop of consolation to assuage the bitterness of that cup which every mourner drinks . They might even take something , in the dark prospect , from the gloomy associations that cluster about the event of dissolution . It were better , we say , that the old custom of cremation were revived , that the lifeless but beloved form were burned to ashes , and the ashes scattered on the tide of some flowing stream , than that it should be left to its long slumber in a place marked only by hideous features . Though the body is unconscious after the spirit is gone , yet the tabernacle of dust ought to be revered for the spirit 's sake . We know not what the retrospective vision of the departed may be . Above all , we do know that the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office it pays to the dead , with every happy contemplation it indulges in the consecrated assembly of tombs . The rapidly spreading taste displayed in rural cemeteries is destined to no speedy extinction . It is a dictate of man 's better nature . There are two ancient fables that contain , beneath the allegory , a beautiful meaning . The mythologists held that they who were inspired by Peronia , the guardian divinity of rustic solitudes , could walk , barefooted and unharmed , over burning coals ; another superstition , if that deserves to be called by so harsh a name which only overestimates a truth , taught that bunches of flowers will preserve the wearer from the fumes of dissipation , refresh the thinking faculties , and keep the affections always young . The pursuits of which we have been speaking , have , we believe , a salutary moral efficacy , to heal the diseases of the heart , to purge away follies , base passions and selfish ambition from the life , to make sin appear the mean , disgraceful thing it really is ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We would not exaggerate . We would not urge so absurd a notion as that all gardeners are saints , or all persons of taste exemplary Christians . Conservatories are not direct instruments of regeneration . If we appeal to antiquity , we must be fair , and there are faults in that quarter that militate against our position . Nero , not a model of the Christian graces , is said to have expended a sum equal to thirty thousand pounds sterling , for the blossoms that were employed to decorate a single entertainment , and Cleopatra , unspiritual as she was , to choose the mildest possible term , was so enamored of flowers , that she caused the floor of her banqueting apartments , at one of her suppers , to be strewn with roses a cubit deep . But after all , such instances prove nothing ; for they are more than answered by the instincts of our humanity . It needs no argument to prove that the // open sky , the water-fall , the clouds , the fields , encourage all that is best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they win us , just so far as we will allow them , away from evil . Lovers of nature will he likely to be the strongest lovers of virtue . Fellowship with the one leads us to loyalty to the other . When we till the ground under the open expanse of heaven , out in the glorious presence of God 's works , we are invited to a free and loving communion with the Spirit of Solitude and of Life . Nature is but " the garment thou seest him by . " We have new revelations of purity and truth in woods and gardens . " God Almighty first planted a garden . " It is a striking record that one of the first consequences of man 's disobedience was his banishment from that garden . Where the Creator speaks , and where his immediate agencies work before our eyes , we feel a something that impels us to harmony with his will . his smallest gifts are large enough to suggest to us the profoundest emotions . With the variation of a syllable , Wordsworth says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human heart by which we live , Thanks to its tenderness , its joys and fears , To all the meanest flowers that bloom can give Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears . In conclusion , we have to say of our national prospects in these studies and toils of art : Let us be of good cheer : Let not the slowness of results disheart en us . The future has something in store for us , not only in triumphs of physical science , but in other kinds also . By and bye , perhaps mechanism will even stop and wait a little for the beautiful arts to come up . Perhaps both will advance , with even step , together . When love-letters and business epistles are blown from New York to Boston , in an air tube , in half an hour ; when the Mexican I*resident and the Esquimaux chief , the one in his chair , the other on his mat of state , hold a pleasant after-dinner chat by the magnetic telegraph ; when steam engines , waking the echoes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey between Washington and Astoria ,  --  then at least , if not before , we will have " Landscape Gardening and Rural Architecture , " on a satisfactory scale . We can not seriously bring ourselves to believe , as some seem disposed to think , that we are at present to be exiled from the whole Paradise of Beauty , and only permitted to glance back , with trembling and sighs of despair , at the cherubs ' flaming swords . To the writer whose volumes it has afforded us pleasure to notice in our humble way , we have only to express our hope that he may have as good reason to say respecting all the works he may ever favor his countrymen with hereafter , as respecting these , with Sir William Temple , " of all the paper I have blotted , I have not written anything for the public , without the intention of some public good . " Nor will hiz aim be fruitless.
