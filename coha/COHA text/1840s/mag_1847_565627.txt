txt AT a sitting of the French Academy in June last , a paper was presented written by M. Le Verrier , a young astronomer of Paris , the object of which was to prove that there exists , in the solar system , a planet hitherto unknown , situated at double the distance of Uranus from the sun , which on the first of January , 1847 , would be at or near a point in the ecliptic whose longitude is 325 degrees . This extraordinary hypothesis has recently been verified by the actual observation , with the telescope , of the body in question . It was first seen by Dr. Gall6 a distinguished astronomer of Berlin , on the 23d of September , and it has since been seen at London , and more recently at various observatories in our own country . Although in apparent brightness this stranger is equal only to a star of the eighth magnitude , and consequently must remain forever invisible to the naked eye , yet the telescope invests it with all the characters of a planet , readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by its motion around the sun , which , though comparatively slow , is still vastly greater than belongs to any of the stars . It requires more than two hundred years to complete its circuit ; and although its exact magnitude is not yet determined , yet enough is known to assure us that it is one of the largest of the planets , and more than a hundred times as large as the earth . This discovery , by theory alone , of a body hidden so deep in the abyss of space , and until now invisible from the creation of the world , determining not only its existence but its exact phice among the stars , proclaims most audibly the perfection at which physical astronomy has arrived ; and it invests truth itself with a solemn grandeur , when we think how far into the recesses of nature it will conduct the mind , that diligently follows its leadings , even in the secret retirement of the closet . The method of investigation , although laborious and intricate , is not difficult to be understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The planet Uranus ( Her . schel ) has been long known to be subject to certain irregularities in its revolution around the sun , not accounted for by all the known causes of perturbation . The tables constructed with the greatest care for any particular epoch , from observations on the planet , guided and corrected by the theory of universal gravitation , do not accurately give its place at periods of a few years either before or after that time . In some cases the deviation from the true place , as determined by observation , has been two minutes of a degree  --  a quantity indeed which seems small , but which is still far greater than occurs in the case of the other planets , Jupiter and Saturn for example , and far too great to satisfy the extreme accuracy required by modern astronomy . From 1781 , when Herschel discovered this planet , to 1821 , observations had been accumulated on its motions for forty years , a period abundantly sufficient to afford the necessary data for determining the elliptic elements of its orbit . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole century ; for before this body was determined to be a planet , it bad been recognized and its places assigned as a star of the sixth magnitude . In the year , 1821 , Bouvard , a French mathematician of emi // nence , compiled tables ' of this planet , availing himself of the most recent , and what he deemed the most perfect observations , and allowing for the perturbations occasioned by the attractions of the other planets , chiefly those of Saturn and Jupiter , which on account of their great masses , as well as their proximity to Uranus , would of course more or less disturb his motion . Bouvard himself ; however , was struck with the fact that his tables were incompetent to represent the actual places of the planet , as it had been seen by the older astronomers , and he even suggested the possibility of an unknown planet , whose hidden action upon Uranus occasioned the disagreement in question . For the benefit of such of our readers as have not given their attention to subjects of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordance with the law of universal gravitation , every body in the solar system is attracted by and attracts every other ; that such large bodies as Saturn and Jupiter exert a powerful influence in disturbing other members of the system , their effect being sensibly felt upon the earth , although , when nearest , the former is distant from us about eight hundred and the latter about four hundred millions of miles ; that this disturbing force exercised by one body of the system over the others , is proportioned to its quantity of matter , or mass , and is therefore so much greater in the sun than in one of the planets , only because the sun contains so much more matter than the planet ; that , in the same body , the power of attraction diminishes rapidly as the distance is increased , being four times less when the distance is doubled , and nine times less when the distance is trebled ; or , as astronomers express it , the attraction diminishes in proportion as the square of the distance is increased . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent the motions of a planet revolving around the sun in an elliptical orbit , it is necessary not only to estimate the different velocities which the body would have on account of its different distances from the sun , arising from the eccentricity of its orbit , but to allow also for the united effects of all the disturbing influences ( perturbations ) which result from the actions of the other bodies of the system , some of which tend to accelerate it , others to retard it , and others still to tura it out of its path . Thus the exact place of a ship , even when carried forward by a uniform breeze , can not be determined from the reckoning , only after due allowance is made for all the currents that have either conspired with or opposed its progress . Before such allowances can be made and applied , the exact weight of each of the bodies in the system must be known ; and it is one of the sublime results at which modern astronomy has arrived , that the planets have in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantities of matter ascertained with as much precision , as that of an ordinary article of merchandise . Now the only planets in the solar system heretofore known to disturb the motions of Uranus , are Saturn and Jupiter , the other planets being so far off and so small , that their attraction is insensible . In constructing tables , therefore , to represent the motions of Uranus , or by means of which its exact place in its orbit can at any time be calculated , it was only deemed necessary to allow for the disturbing influences of these two great planets . But after making the allowances required , still , after a few years , Uranus was found by observation to deviate very materially from the calculated place . Some other cause , therefore , must disturb its motions beside the attractions of Jupiter and Saturn . Several hypotheses have // been at different times proposed to account for the disagreement in question . First , it has been urged that at so remote a distance from the sun as eighteen hundred millions of miles , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself loses somewhat of its constancy or uniformity ; consequently , tables founded on this law , as those of Uranus are , would not give results exactly conformable to observation . This hypothesis is not only unsupported by any evidence , but is at variance with all known facts in astronomy . Halley 's comet , for example , during its late revolution , departed to a distance from the sun equal to twice that of Uranus , ( about 3,600,000,000 of miles ) yet on its return in 1835 , after an absence of more than seventy-five years , it was true to the time appointed , having come to its perihelion within a day of the time assignto it by calculations founded on the law of universal gravitation . Moreover , we have independent proof of the unerring uniformity of this law , when extended to distances far greater than that of Uranus from the sun , or than that of Halley 's comet in its aphelion , since it is found to prevail even among the stars , regulating the revolution of sun around sun , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars of which the two members revolve about a common centre of gravity , which they do in exact obedience to the law of universal gravitation . Secondly , the resistance of a supposed ether , or subtle elastic medium , diffused through space , has been assigned as the cause of the phenomenon in question . But , were this the cause , we might expect to see it manifested in the motions of the other planets , and the more as their motions are more rapid than those of Uranus . The existence of such a medium has indeed been inferred , in consequence of certain effects manifested in the movements of Encke 's comet ; but it may be easily conceived , that an exceed.i.ngly light body would indicate such a resistance , while a dense body like the planets would not . A particle of down may experience resistance , when moving swiftly through a medium , where a musket ball would not be sensibly affected . Thirdly , the hidden influence in question has been ascribed to a great satellite of Uranus , hitherto undiscovered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of short period , completing a cycle during the revolution of the satellite about its primary , which would occupy but a short time , whereas the changes in the perturbations occasioned by the cause under consideration are exceedingly slow . Moreover , in order to produce effects on Uranus so great as those to be accounted for , a very large satellite , would be required , of such a magnitude , indeed , that it would not fail to be seen with , the telescope . Fourthly , the disturbing influence of a comet , has also been proposed to account for the irregularities of Uranus . But comets have never been known to exert any appreciable influence upon the motions of the planets . The comet of 1770 passed among the satellites of Jupiter , without sensibly disturbing their movements ,  --  a proof that the quantity of matter in these bodies is inconceivably small . Nor , from the eccentricity of the orbits of comets , could we suppose a comet to linger in the immediate vicinity of Uranus so long , as the perturbations which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , the suspicion of the existence of a planet , lying beyond the orbit of Uranus , did not originate with Le Verrier , but had been entertained by several eminent astronomers , for twenty-five years before the subject engaged his attention . // But merely to conjecture the existence of such a body , or even to assert its existence without proof , implies very little ; but to establish its existence by satisfactory evidence , and still more , to tell where it lies among the myriads of stars , to weigh it , to assign its distance from the sun , and the period of its revolution - these are the points of difficulty , and it is the successful solution of the problem under all these various aspects , that constitutes the glory of this youthful astronomer . Le Verrier did not undertake the formidable task of determining these points , until he had fully proved , that the disagreement between theory and observation in the motions of Uranus , was no fault of the tables themselves ; that they were true at least as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new and laborious discussion the observations , both old and new , which had ever been made upon this body , from the time when its place was first noted , on the supposition that it was a fixed star , down to the present time . He re-calculated the formulte which afforded the basis of the tables of Bouvard , and scrutinized every possible source of error in these tables . Some errors were indeed detected ; hut after making full allowance for these , the actual place of the planet , as determined by observation , was still widely at variance with that resulting from calculation . For example , in 1838 , after calculating the maximum error which could exist in the tables ,  --  an amount probably much greater than actually does exist ,  --  he showed that it could not exceed 30 seconds of space , whereas the disagreement between the calculated and observed places of the planet , was 125 seconds ; and , in 1831 , this difference amounted to 188 seconds , of which 140 could not be explained , without admitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , Jupiter and Saturn . Assuming , then , the existence of an undiscovered planet , the first inquiry was , where is it situated-at what distance from the sun  --  and in what point of the starry heavens ? First , it could not be below Saturn , that is , between Saturn and the sun , because then it would disturb Saturn more than it did Uranus , whereas the motions of Saturn are fully accounted for without implying any other than the attractions of known bodies . Secondly , it could not be between Saturn and Uranus ; for if so , it must be very near Uranus , otherwise it would at the same time disturb the motions of Saturn . But being very near to Uranus , it must be very small , otherwise it would disturb Uranus more than it does . But a small planet , nearly at the same distance from the sun as Uranus , would be very unequal in its action on the latter planet , its disturbing force being great when in conjunction with it , but very small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it . No such changes in the actual perturbations occasioned by the body occur. * Hence , thirdly , the body must be beyond Uranus . Is its orbit near that of the latter planet , or remote from it ? It can not be very near , for then the same inequality of action would be observed , as though it were on the other side of Uranus and near to it , which inequality does not exist . Nor can it be very remote , for then it must of course be very large in order to produce the perturbations it does , and being very large , its effects would be visible on Saturn as well as on Uranus , as would be the case were its distance so great that the distance between these two planets * This rensonin " does not appear to be entirely conclusive , since if ' the two bodies in question both revolve in orbits nearly circular , and at nearly equal distances from the sun , they might remain in the immediate vicinity of each other for many years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ten times as far from the sun as Uranus is , then the distance between Saturn and Uranus would bear so small a ratio to the whole distance , that a body powerful enough to affect the latter so sensibly , would exert at least an appreciable attraction on the former . Now the other planets , as we recede from the sun , have their orbits placed . at distances continually approximating to the ratio expressed by 2 , the distances of each planet in succession growing nearer and nearer to double that of its predecessor . Thus Saturn is nearly twice as far from the sun as Jupiter , and Uranus more nearly twice as far as Saturn . Hence it was most reasonable to expect , that the orbit of the planet sought , would be situated at twice the distance of Uranus ; that is , at about three thousand six hundred millions of miles from the sun . On trial , Le Verrier found that a planet whose orbit was thus situated , would fulfil the conditions rendered necessary by the changes which the perturbations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Hence it was inferred , that the unknown planet revolves around the sun at double the distance of Uranus . The distance from the sun being determined , and the orbit , like those of the other planets , being supposed nearly circular , its period or time of revolution might be found by Kepler 's law ,  --  that the squares of of the periodic times are proportioned to the cubes of the distances. * By this law its period would appear to be about 237 years . This was to be regarded as only a first approximation . We shall find that Hence , the distance being double that of Uranus and the periodic time of the latter being 84 years , we have i3 2 842 23X8428X84 square of ' the periodic time of the body sought . Therefore , the time itself=V8X 84=237468 years . the actual period is somewhat less than this . It was easy to show that its orbit must be nearly coincident with the ecliptic , since the perturbations occasioned by it were nearly all in the direction of the ecliptic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , they were perturbations of longitude and not of latitude . To these extraordinary but apparently satisfactory results , the paper of Le Verrier presented to the French Academy at their sitting on the first of June , conducts us . Being now fully convinced himself of the existence of the planet sought , and intent on finding its true place , this able astronomer still continued his laborious researches , until he was able to deduce , mathematically , those conclusions which had before rested chiefly on analogical evidence , or at least upon general inferences derived from the doctrine of universal gravitation . Equations were formed between the irregularities of Uranus to be accounted for , and the elements of the body in question , both known and unknown . These equations involved nine unknown quantities , and their resolutions presented difficulties apparently insurmountable ; but by the most ingenious artifices the several unknown quantities were successively eliminated , either directly or by repeat . ed approximations . Moreover , in science as in morals , the pathway of truth is easy and simple , and grows continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thorny , and , as we advance , becomes at every step more and more complicated . All who have attempted difficult solutions of mathematical or physical problems , must have been aware what unexpected facilities often suddenly appear in the resolution of complex expressions , which contain the hidden truth ; they must have been most agreeably surprised , to see involved and // apparently unmanageable members of ' equations cancelling each other , and suddenly vanishing , and difficult expressions Calling off at the right and left , and constantly simplifying their work as they approach nearer and nearer to the final expression , which contains the naked truth . Hence the maxim , that Nature is very kind to those who fait*fully study her laws . Such encouraging facilities seem to have inspired our young astronomer , in his difficult arid laborious undertaking , until he arrived at expressions for the elements of the unknown planet , which gave its exact place among the stars , its quantity of ' matter , the shape of its orbit , its distance from the sun , and the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 31st of August , these latest results were presented , stated numerically as follows Longitude of the planet , * 3*0 32 ' Jan. , 1 , 1847 . S Mass , that of the sun being 1 , . Eccentricity , ... 0107 Time of revolution , . . . 217387 yrs . Longitude of the perihelion , . 2840 45 ' Major axis of the orbit , that ) of the earth being 1 , 36154 He was therefore enabled to say , that the planet was then just passing its opposition , and consequently was most favorably situated for observation , and , on account of the slowness of its motions , would remain in a very favorable position for three months afterwards . In order to test the correctness of these elements , the effect of a planet , having these conditions , was investigated in relation to the motions of Uranus , in order to see how well the places of that planet , determined by the aid of ' these corrections for many different periods , would correspond to the places actually observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the discrepancies between the calculated and observed places , without these corrections , was enormous , sometimes amounting to 125 *econds of an arc . The comparison was made in respect to thirtythree sets of ' observations , of which twenty-six were selected from observations made since 1781 , when the planetary character of the body was first made known , and seven from the records of l ) previous observers , who had marked its place supposing it to be a fixed star , from that of Flamsteed in 1690 , to that of Lemonnier in 1771 . The places of Uranus , determined with the new elements , agreed with the places actually observed at these later periods , generally within one or two seconds , and often within the fraction of a second ; and with the earlier periods , with one exception , to within about seven seconds . These elements of the unknown body , were varied and the limits ascertained to which such changes could be carried , without involving a greater disagreement between the calculated and observed places ; and these limits were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On every side the existence of an unknown planet , having these elements , forced itself on the belief of Le Verrier , and he probably felt as confident of its existence before it was seen in the heavens , as he has done since . Still it became an important inquiry at last , whether there was any hope of ever seeing the interesting stranger , or whether after so much toil , the indefatigable student must rest his belief ' in its existence , solely upon his faith in the immutable laws of ' truth , whose leadings he had followed into depths of space so profound , and must take his dubious chance for fame in the weak belief ' of the few , and the total incredulity of the many . In estimating the probability that the planet would be visible to the telescope , he reasoned thus . Uranus has an apparent diameter of four seconds , and since the mass , or quantity of matter , of ' this planet is two and a half times less than that // of the planet sought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily find its volume , and then , knowing as we do its distance , its apparent diameter would be easily determined . Now it is a known fact , that the densities of th planets decrease as we recede from the sun , and therefore the density of the body in question is probably less than that of Uranus ,  --  a circumstance which would contribute to increase the comparative volume , and of course the apparent diameter . But even allowing the density to be as great as that of Uranus , the apparent diameter will be over three seconds , and consequently , the planet ought to be visible in good telescopes , and with a perceptible disk . If among the small stars situated in that part of the heavens where the planet is at present , a faint body be discerned having a perceptible disk , it will at once be recognized as the planet itself ; but if no such appearance should distinguish it from the small stars surrounding it , then a map of these must be carefully inspected ; and if any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , indicating a movement more rapid than belongs to any of the fixed stars , then that luminous point will be recognized as the body sought . It happened , fortunately , that charts of that region of the heavens were in the course of publication at Berlin , containing a perfect representation of all stars to the tenth magnitude ; and the very folio containing the constellation Capricornus , in which the hidden body was supposed to be , was then just issuing from the press . Le Verrier , therefore , wrote to M. Gall6 of Berlin , communicating his latest results , and requesting him to reconnoitre for the stranger , directing his telescope to a point about five degrees eastward of a well known star called Delta Capricorni . So precise and complete were these directions , that the Prussian astronomer no sooner pointed his telescope to the region assigned , than he at once recognized the wondrous body . Its place was only 52 minutes of a degree distant from the position marked out for it by Le Verrier , and its apparent diameter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's letter to Le Verrier announcing his discovery , reached the latter while an article of his on the latitude of the planet , was in the course of preparation for the sitting of the Academy on the 5th of October . This confirmation of all his hopes , is added to his paper in a modest postscript , in terms less evincive of exultation than might have been anticipated . But the very phraseology of Gall6 indicates that , previous to the actual discovery , he had himself but feebly embraced the idea of its existence . " The planet ( says he ) which you have described , really exists I , ' The congratulatory letters which now flowed in from the most celebrated astronomers of Europe , occupy a conspicuous place in the Comptes Rendus of Oct. 5th , being communicated to the Academy by M. Arago , accompanied by very interesting remarks on the history and importance of the discovery . " Other astronomers ( said M. Arago ) have sometimes found , accidentally , a movable point , in the field of their telescopes , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descried the new body without having occasion to take a single look towards the heavens-he saw it at the point of his pen . He determined , by the power of the calculus alone , the place and the magnitude of a body situated far beyond the known limits of our planetary system ; of a body whose distance from the sun exceeds 1200 millions of leagues , and which in our most powerful telescopes offers a disk scarcely perceptible . In fine , the discovery of Le Verrier is one of the most brilliant manifestations of // the exactness of modern astronomical systems ; and it will encourage the ablest geometers to search , with new ardor , for the eternal truths which , according to an expression of Pliny , lie hidden in the majesty of theories. * ' M. Arago adds ; that he had received from M. Le Verrier a most flattering commission-the right of naming the new planet , and therefore he proposes to call it Le Verrier . When Sir William Herschel first discovered the planet Uranus , he named it after his royal patron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France , La Lande proposed to call it Herschel , and this name has continued in our owa country to the present time . But , as the other planets have names derived from the ancient mythology , as Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter and Saturn , it seemed to the leading astronomers of the day , most accordant with sound analogy and good taste , to give it a corresponding appellation ; and they , therefore , after proposing a number of mythological names , fixed upon that of Uranus , ( the most ancient of the gods , ) and this name has generally prevailed . But Arago , for the sake of securing the desired honor to Le Verrier , proposes to restore the same to Herschel , and that the planet Pallas also shall be named from its discoverer Olbers. rhe names Janus , Neptune and Oceanus , have also been proposed by others ; and time only can decide which of the names will finally prevail . For a time the contest for the honor of this achievement , seemed likely to awaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The English astronomers claimed that a young mathematician of Cambridge , Mr. Adams , had , without the least knowledge of what M. Le Verrier was doing , arrived at the same great result . But having failed to publish his paper until the world was made acquainted with the facts through the other medium , he has lost much of the honor which priority of discovery would have gained for him , although great admiration may ever be felt for his genius and capacity . In the history of great discoveries and of great inventions , it is a remarkable flict , that the same idea has frequently occurred to two individuals nearly at the same time . Thus it is still a question , whether Newton or Leibnitz first devised the method of Fluxions ; and the greatest single discovery in Chemie*try , that of oxygen gas , was made almost simultaneously by Priestly in England , Scheele in Sweden , and Lavoisier in France . The explanation is easy . The secret rests in the Eternal Mind , and is withheld from the view of man , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready ; then the curtain is withdrawn , and Truth darts her heavenly rays upon the few , who are at the moment gazing towards her with the clearest vision . Would we give the due meed of praise to all who have contributed to bring about this grand triumph of the human mind , our honors must be widely distributed . In the noble array of intellects which would stand before us , Newton , who furnished the mighty key that turns the secret wards of creation , must undoubtedly occupy the highest place . But Kepler , who first traced the existence of laws in the planetary system ; Fl amsteed , Lemonnier and Bradley , who noted the places of the planet Uranus , at different periods , mistaking it for a fixed star ; Herschel , who brought it to light and established its planetary character ; Leibnitz , La Grange , and La Place , who invented and perfected that wonderful instrument of research into the arcana of nature , the fluxionary calculus : these all , and many more , are entitled to share with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic of great truths , that have been attained by long and // laborious processes , to draw after them many other great truths , which they serve to establish . If their discovery has brought into requisition the profoundest principles of science , it follows that those principles , leading as they have done to a correct result , a result which nature owns , are themselves true , and receive , in the discovery , a confirmation the more signal as that result is the more hidden from ordinary view . Seldom has this point received so beautiful an illustration as in the discovery of Le Verrier 's planet . Let us glance at the several great truths which this discovery confirms and illustrates . In the first place , it affords a triumphant proof of the truth of the law of universal gravitation . It was the knowledge of this law , which first suggested the existence of such an undiscovered planet , since it was only on the supposition of the universal prevalence of of this law , that the unexplained irregularities in the motions of Uranus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also by the application of the law of universal gravitation , in its exact expression , namely , that it acts in proportion to the quantity of matter , and inversely as the square of the * distance , that the invisible cords which bound the stranger to the planet Uranus were followed back through the depths of space , until they revealed in the wide expanse of heaven , the very spot where it lay concealed . The law of gravitation , therefore , answers completely to the test proposed by Lord Bacon , that before a new discovery can be considered good , nature should respond to it through all her works . Non canimus sardis , respondent onznia silvce . It is said that Newton , when engaged in his first computation on the motions of the moon , instituted for the purpose of verifying his theory of gravitation , seeing , as he approached the end of the solution , that all was coming out in exact numerical conformity to the doctrine , was so overwhelmed with the great consequences of the discovery , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was obliged to hand it over to a friend to finish it . These consequences were , indeed , well fitted to overpower even the mind of Newton , since the simple truth which was beginning to shine out with perfect clearness in his mathematical expressions , unveiled nothing less than the hidden mechanism of the Universe , and would give to the astronomer the power , almost divine , of looking through all time , present , past , and future . But , probably , Newton himself did not at once comprehend in his mighty grasp all the great consequences of the truth he was approaching . The astonishing reach of the principle of universal gravitation can scarcely now , after the lapse of one hundred and fifty years , be fully comprehended , since almost daily , like a sounding line sent out into the depths of creation , it is disclosing to us new wonders respecting the worlds hidden in the abyss of space . How vast and unexpected are the results it has afforded in our knowledge of the grand machinery of nature ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , comets , or stars ; it teaches how to weigh the sun and planets as in a balance ; it assigns the exact fig. i*re of the earth , and of every body in the solar system , independently of any measurement or observation ; it explains not only the ordinary motions of the heavenly bodies , but all their irregularities , of which the moon alone has no less than sixty , and assigns the exact numerical value of each ; it accounts for the tides , and , with the aid of a few observations , computes the height for every time and place ; it teaches how , by means of the pendulum , to fix an invariable standard of // weights and measures ; it suggests new fields to the eye of observation , directing attention to objects which have eluded the keenest vision , aided by the highest powers of the telescope , and corrects the last refinements of instrumental measurement ; it has led to the grand result of the stability of the Universe , amid all the apparent causes of disorder and ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost to the region of the stars , and brings it back again on the day which itself appoints for its return ; and , finally , it tells us of new planets still lurking in the solar system , points out their hiding places , assigns their exact weight and the period of their revolution , and directs the practical astronomor precisely where to point his telescope , to bring them down to earth . If any thing more could be wanting to establish the truth of the doctrine of universal gravitation , we surely have it in this last and most wonderful of all its revelations . In the second place , the discovery under review proclaims the unerring certainty of the method of Fluxions , or the Infinitesimal Calculus . The fundamental principles of the Calculus are difficult to be expressed in an elementary form . So refined and almost spiritual are some of them , that it is only after having made some proficiency in the use of this method , that the learner feels fully assured that it rests on a foundation as immutable as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained by the calculus , applied , in its most refined and subtle forms , to the law of universal gravitation . The hidden truth was caught in its magic folds , but was so deeply involved within them , that to develop it and bring it , in its simple unity , to the light of day , required a labor and a skill which may well be compared to the task of finding a grain of gold when hidden among the sands of the sea uhore , and as exceeding all that the ancients conceived of the difficulty of threading one 's way through the mazes of the Cretan labyrinth . Moreover , if we resolve the Calculus itself into the elementary principles of mathematics which it employs , in one or other of its processes , we shall find that the whole of this science is inwoven in its fabric ; and it follows , that a confirmation of the truth of the method of Fluxions , is , at the same time , a confirmation of the exact , eternal truth of the entire science of mathematics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Verrier 's planet , proves that the other planets of our system are correctly weighed . It is only on the supposition that the quantity of matter in Jupiter and Saturn is exactly determined , that it could be inferred that their united actions upon Uranus , to disturb his motions , was insufficient to account for his irregularities ; nor , had there been any essential error in the estimates of the masses of those planets , could it have been determined what amount of error remained to be accounted for by the hidden body . In the fourth place , we derive from this discovery new confidence in the unifrrmity of the laws of nature . This doctrine , now so generally taken as an axiom , is by no means self-evident , nor has it always been actually believed . The ancient schools of philosophy taught just the opposite doctrine , averring that we could never know from what takes place in our world , what laws prevail in distant worlds ; that motion itself was one thing on earth , and perhaps quite another thing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mythology-a religion which distributed the several parts of the natural world to different divinities , Jupiter being lord of the air , Neptune of the sea , and Pluto of the realms below ; while various subordinate deities controlled particular kingdoms in the great empire of nature , Eolus presiding // over the winds , and Urania over the starry sphere . In these distant and independent realms , thcrefore , it was natural to believe that different laws prevail as different monarchs rule ; but the religion of the Bible , teaching as it does the doctrine of one God , leads us to anticipate the grand result , proclaimed by all the discoveries of astronomy , of a perfect uniformity in the laws of nature , throughout her boundless realms , in earth , in air , in ocean , and in the remotest planets and stars . Finally , the harmonies of truth , and the attribute by which she remains forever one and indivi*ible , are strikingly illustrated in the example before us . P he astronomer in his closet constructs a series of mathematical formulte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of mathematical demonstration . These he transforms , in a thousand ways , spreading them over reams of paper . All the while the truth , for which he is seeking , lies concealed deeply hidden beneath massive piles , with which it is encumbered . These one by one , often to the surprise of the operator himself , melt away , until , at length , the truth , so long and so laboriously sought , divested of every disguise and incumbrance , shines out in its own native simplicity and beauty . But if it is true in theory , it is true also in fact ; and the astronomer now sallies forth from his closet , and looks upward with his telescope , and there sees the confirmation of all his labors written on the skies . Not only do we find here new cause to admire the harmonies of truth , but its fertility , or the power of truth to beget truth , urges itself upon our consideration with new force , when we think how the discovery of the planet Uranus has furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far removed into the depths of space , which , again , in its turn , has perhaps an equal chance of guiding us on the way to still more distant worlds.
