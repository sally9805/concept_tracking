txt DEAR Snt ,  --  In several passages of your late very able and interesting address to the National Institute , you assumed , as an ascertained principle of political economy , that the rate of wages regularly declines with the increasing density of population . In my work entitled , " New Ideas as Population , with remarks on the theories of Godwin and Malihus , " I endeavor to prove that the rate of wages regularly rises with the increasing density of population . As the principle in question is a very important one , I am deirous to have the benefit of your deliberate opinion upon it . Although you mentioned to me in conversation that you had read the work just alluded to , I thought it possible that the subject might not have particularly attracted your attention , and it was with the view of bringing it distinctly to your notice that I took the liberty of saying to you that I would write you a short letter upon it . I will not trouble you by recapitulating here the argument in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . I should be happy to bear from you on the subject , and to furnish , if you desire it , any explanations that may be in my pos*ession . My address is at Boston . With great respect , I am , 4lear sir , very truly your friend , and obedient serv't . Signed , A. H. EVERETT . lion . George Tucker . * Having known a few months ago that a correspondence was in progress between Mr. Alexander H. Everett , now our Minister to China , and Professor Tucker , of the University of Virginia , on the important and interesting subject of the Doctrine of Population and Wages , on which those two distinguished and accomplished gentlemen held different opinions-Mr . Everett being strongly antiMalthusian , and Professor Tucker , to a great extent , if not entirely , Malthusianwe suggested to one of the two gentlemen that it would be an useful mode of spreading before the public the materials for an enlightened judgment on this much Vexed question , to publish the correspondence . The ready assent of both to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the present pages . The present publication contains an argument on each side . Two replies and corresponding rejoinders , have since taken place-Professor Tucker in each case leading off in the amicable and courteous encounter of opinions , and being followed by Mr. Everett . The last letter from the latter gentleman is dated from on board the U. S. ship-of-the-line Columbus , being written during the passage of that vessel from New York to Rio de Janeiro , on the way to China . The two friendly combatants being now at the antipodes of the globe in reference to each other , the correspondence on this subject may now therefore be said to have reached its termination . According to the natural division into pairs of letters , we divide it into three parts , which will be given in three of our successive numbers . Without note or comment by ourselves , ( though strongly anti-Malthusian , of course , in our economical philosophy , ) we shall leave every reader to judge for himself to which side of the argument the preponderance of truth inclines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deemed to have stood enlisted on the side of the weaker cause , none will question , at least , his right to the full application of the line- - Si Pergama deztra Defendiposeent , etiam kac defenuafuiseent. // NO . II . Proessor Tucker to Mr. Everett . University of Virginia , May 14 , 1844 . Mv DEAR Sia ,  --  When your letter from Washington reached me I chanced to he engaged in preparing some sheets for the press , and I thought it better to delay my answer until I could give an undivided attention to the subject , which , I agree with you , is an important one , and which would seem from the opposite views entertained of it , to be also one of difficulty . I do not wonder at your dissent from the theory of Maithus . When I first read his book , it appeared to me to afford so dangerous an apology for bad government , and to present so cheerless a view of human society , that I revolted at it , and felt assured that it was founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detect , and I accordingly , some years afterwards , attempted an answer to it , which was one of a series of Essays published in Washington in 1822 , though written eight or ten years before . I then endeavored to show that the tendency of mankind to increase was over-rated by Mr. Maithus ; " that when the natural course of things is not disturbed by the mistakes of government , or the errors of national opinion , numbers will not reach a dangerous or mischievous excess ; " that " the stock of human happiness is likely to increase with the increase of numbers ; " with other propositions contravening his theory . I have since read much , and thought much , on the subject , and have persuaded myself that while Malthus 's premises are in the main true , it is quite as reasonable to say that since man is exposed to so many evils , physical and moral , which are destructive of life , and which he can not evade or subdue , his multiplying propensity is necessary to counteract them , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moral restraint , ) are necessary to check the undue force of that propensity . Such , accordingly , has been the ground that I have always taken in my lectures on Political Economy , in this institution . You see then , sir , that we do not differ in our general opinion of this celebrated theory as to the melancholy consequences , which it considers to be the inevitable result of man 's tendency to increase and multiply . But it seems that we do differ on the effect of that increase on the wages of labor . Instead of " wages regularly rising with the increasing density of population , " as you maintain , I have come to the conclusion that the general and natural , but not inevitable tendency of such increasing tendency is to lower wages , and that the occasional exceptions to the general rule are but temporary . To narrow the field of discussion , I will state the general principles on which I rely . If these postulates be conceded by you ,  --  as I think they will ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , any one or more of them be denied , it is unnecessary to proceed farther , until our disagreement about them is adjusted . They are 1 . That all human subsistence is derived from the earth , principally from the products of the soil , or the animals nourished by them , and in a very small proportion from the products of the waters . 2 . That the quantity of food thus furnished has natural limits , which can not be exceeded , whether it be equal to the support of 200 to the square mile , or of twice or thrice that number . 3 . That man , in common with other animals , has the power and the propensity of multiplication , so that if this propensity has not strong counteractions , such as want of food , disease , &amp;c. , population will double in a given time . 4 . That when it is uninfluenced by these considerations , the faculty of doubling ( comprehending both the capacity and inclination ) is in every stage of its progressive increase , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 5 . That the quantity of human aliment which any portion of the earth can produce , until its utmost limit is reached , is in proportion to its fertility and the degree of human in skill exerted on it . industry and 6 . That the number of persons which can be supported on a given area is dependent partly on the quantity it can produce , and partly on the character of the aliment ; the same area being capable of producing generally less animal than vegetable food , and less of some kinds of vegetable food than of others . // 7 . That the means of subsistence are unequally distributed among the members of the same community ; so that while some have an ample supply , others may not have enough for comfort , or even to support life . From these general facts and laws it follows that in an isolated community , if the population increase , it must be either because the soil is made to produce more food , of the same character and in the same proportion as it previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual is less in quantity or inferior in quality . When the sharers are more in number , either the sum to be shared must be augmented , or each one 's dividend must be diminished . In the first case the laborer receives the same return for his labor ; in the last , lie receives less . But it must be recollected that food can not go on increasing ; and whether the soil be capable of supporting 100 or 500 to the square mile , that limit will be reached after a few periods of duplication . Thus , suppose the population to be only ten to the square mile , which is less than the average in the settled parts of the United States , then in the first period of duplication the numbers would be 20 to the square mile : in the 2d . . . 40 3d . . . 80 4th . . . 160 5th . . . 320 6th . . . 640 which last is a degree of density which we may consider to be physically impossible , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must furnish him not only with food , but with clothing , fuel , and all the other comforts of life derived from the natural world . In this progress of population every increase of numbers makes a corresponding increase of food necessary . But after the whole land of a country is taken into cultivation , the increase of its product is more and more difficult . It may be easy enough to raise that product from five bushels per acre to ten , and even from ten to twenty . But to raise it from 20 to 40 would be a slower process , and one requiring a far greater expense of labor and capital ; and then to double that product might be physically impossible ; or if not , it certainly would be to raise it from 80 bushels to 160 per acre . Yet in all these stages the tendency to multiply may be as strong as it was at first ; and the increase of population is adjusted to the dimishing rat.e of increase of food by the smaller amount of raw produce allotted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be said that prudence naturally checks this multiplying propensity ; and that men marrying only when they are able to support a family , the increase of numbers will go on pan passu with the increase of food . If the amount consumed by each individual were a constant quantity , then I admit that the increase of population could not exceed that of the products of the soil . But this amount is a varying quantity , admitting of great contraction . The human stomach does indeed require to be filled , as Adam Smith remarks ; but it makes a great difference as to the number which a given surface will support , whether it be filled with meat or bread , and yet more with bread or potatoes . Now experience shows that when population is up to the level of the means of liberal subsistence , the generative faculty still rules ; and forcing a greater number into existence , the excess are compelled to put up with a cheaper mode of subsistence ;  --  to substitute , to a greater or less extent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bread . And inasmuch as the rich consume as liberally as before , the whole of the necessary reduction falls upon the poor , that is , the laboring class , who have thus to take yet less raw produce for their labor or lower wages . Does observation confirm these speculative views ? It does . Thus , according to a comparative estimate made some years since on authentic facts , the quantity of food earned per week , in India , England and the United States was as follows : In India , 20 2-5 cwt. parts of rice . England , 80 wheat . U. States , 192 wheat . The rate of wages , too , varies in the different parts of this country , if estimated in raw produce , and decreases with density of numbers . Thus : In the New England States the average rate is 2 pecks per day . Middle States , 34 pecks per day . // Western States , 3 9.00 " We have evidence also , that real wages have fallen in England with the increase of population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall of the one has not been in proportion to the increase of the other . The ordinary wages of day labour has lately been a peck of wheat , or something less a day , and it is stated to have been some centuries since two pecks a day , though I can not now recall the authority for the fact . But , by a table published by Arthur Young , and to be found in Lowe 's Appendix , the price of labor from the early part of the 18th century to the beginning of the 19th , had risen from 10 to 20 , while wheat had risen in the same period from 7* to 20 ,  --  thus showing that , estimating the laborer 's wages in wheat , they had risen more than 25 per cent. , or more accurately as 7* to 20 . And Barton , in his work " on the state of the laboring classes , " details the rate of wages in wheat , from about 1747 to 1807 ,  - -  and he estimates the decline in 60 years to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pints . The inherent difficulty , not to say impossibility , of wages continuing to rise with the increasing density of population , may be farther shown by the following illustration . Let us suppose a country dependent on its own resources , ( for to such my attention is now confined ) with a population of forty persons to the square mile-about the present population of Ohio . This allows to each inhabitant , on an average , the product of 16 acres . When the population shall have doubled , or reached 80 to the square mile , that allows to each one the product of 8 acres . The next duplication would of course limit the average consumption to the product of 4 acres , and if we suppose it to attain 320 to the square mile , which is less than the present population of England , exclusive of Wales , that density would reduce the quota to 2 acres . Now it would be conceding a great deal to admit that , by any improvement in husbandry , first 8 acres , then 4 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as the 16 had done ,  --  especially when for some articles consumed by men , such as timber and fuel , ( if the country contained no fossil coal or peat ) the product can be but moderately increased by human industry and skill . But if this liberal concession , warranted by no experience , be made , it would suppose the wages of labor to he merely undiminished but not increased . To infer such increase , we must suppose that the reduced number of acres has actually produced more than the larger number , so that not only half the land is made to yield more than the whole had done , but the fourth more than either , and the eighth the most of all . When we recollect how extremely difficult it is only to quadruple the product of poor land , and that it is impossible so to multiply that of the rich land , and not easy even to double it , the greatest average increase on all the lands , which has been here supposed , and which is the undisguisable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly inadmissible , even on this simple d priori view of the subject . Such a result , too , is rendered yet more marvellous and incredible by the fact , that when the general average of the land to each individual is reduced from 16 acres to *2 , a portion of the society still retains much more than their proportionate part ,  - -  some even the original 16 acres ,  --  for their exclusive consumption in pleasure grounds , preserves of game , forests , &amp;c . So that we must conclude that as population advances to density , and each individual must subsist on a smaller portion of the earth 's surface-the increased subsistence required is met , partly by making the soil more productive , and partly by the great body of the community ,  --  comprehending the laboring class , consuming cheaper and coarser food . And since that class obtain but the means of subsistence for their labor-at least in densely peopled countries  --  to say that their subsistence deteriorates with increasing numbers , is the same as saying that wages fall . Both Malthus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , and this is virtually admitting that labor falls : for raw produce rises only by its exchanging for greater quantities of labor . Ricordo , indeed , paradoxically as I think , maintains that labor rises as well as raw produce but even he admits that the laborer will receive , in the progress of society , a smaller amount of raw produce , and that not only his command of corn , but his general condition will be deteriorated . Though Adam Smith does not // formally notice the effect of an increase of population on wages , he virtually recognises the principles here insisted on by adverting to and explaining the facts that the real wages of labor ( which he defines to be the amount of the necessaries and conveniences of life received by the laborer ) are higber in this country than in England , and are at the lowest point of depression in the crowded population of China . Thus , you see , sir , that I am able to adduce fact , reasoning , and authority in support of the opinion I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have hitherto been considering a community isolated from the rest of the world , or rather supported directly from its soil ; which , indeed , I think , is the best way of ascertaining the proper effect and influence of an increase of population on wages . But as you rely , in support of your views , upon the ability of a thriving , prosperous nation , to draw supplies of raw produce from abroad in exchange for products of its skill and industry , I readily admit that this is practicable under particular circumstances , and that , by this means , wages , not merely nominal but real , may increase with increasing numbers . Such a nation may derive a part of its supplies from countries newly settled , and consequently underpeopled , like the United States and New Holland ;  --  or from such countries as Poland , which , having no manufactures , are willing to give a part of their raw produce in exchange for them . This has , for half a century or more , been the condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drawn part of her subsistence from other countries , especially Ireland . But besides that even here this counteraction to the general law I have insisted on has not been sufficient to arrest the decline of wages , but only to check it , such counteraction can not be permanent . In the same degree that one country produces less than it consumes , the others from which she draws her supplies , must produce more ; and as her demands increase with her increasing population , so must their excess . But that , we have seen , is physically impossible . So that when they have reached the limit of their utmost supply , the law , apportioning wages to population , which had been suspended or checked , is immediately renewed in full force . Besides , the strong tendency which mankind have ever shown to increase to the level of subsistence , may be supposed to be constantly operating in the countries affording the supply , and , sooner or later , to consume all that they raise . That result may be confidently expected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of increase , they are not likely , in a century more , to have any surplus provisions for export . Even in Poland , where the nobles are too proud to engage in manufactures , and the serfs too poor and too ignorant , a farther increase of numbers would have been likely to make them turn a part of their labor to manufactures , necessity and want having been the great parents of invention . Since they have exchanged their absurd government for another , they will probably increase with the rest of the Russian , Prussian , and Austrian dominions , and , in time , have no regular surplus of grain . I do not think that any argument can be drawn from the supplies which great cities , like London , draw from the country . As a half or even a third of the population are sufficient to raise raw produce for the rest , and as the other operations of industry are better carried on in towns , the people of every country naturally distribute themselves into two portions , one in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small ones or a few large ones , depends on the rivers , harhours , and other localities , and on their commerce and manufactures . The progress of population tends to enlarge these cities , but , as we have seen , to lessen the supplies that can be exported , and , consequently , that can be imported . I have thus far considered the raw produce earned by the laborer as the measure of his wages , because it is the most indispensable , and constitutes the largest part of his expense . But your position , that labour becomes more productive as it increases in quantity , is entirely correct as to manufactures , and all the other comforts of life , except food . By means of the division of labor and the steady progress of inventive art and productive skill , our clothes , furniture , utensils of all sorts , are constantly becoming cheaper and better . Indeed , this result is partly produced // by the greater cheapness of human labor , in consequence of its multiplication , of which I have spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention was too exclusively drawn to this striking effect of a dense population , and to the particular circumstances of the United States , where labor is more and more productive , that you have been led to your general theory . The circumstances of the United States are , however , peculiar . Here a people possessing the arts and the husbandry of a dense population , are in possession of a vacant , or almost vacant , territory , and , of course , there is nothing to lessen the wages of labour , when measured in raw produce , until the whole country is settled and its best lands taken into cultivation - while their increase of population is constantly adding to the l ) roductiveness of their labor in every other employment . Nor have the wages of labor fallen in England , at all in proportion to the increase of its population , in the last half century . But her situation has also some peculiarities . Her vast colonial possessions , her extensive foreign commerce , her abundance of coal and iron , by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventions of Watt , Arkwright , &amp;c. , have enabled her to buy the grain of Ireland , ( and of other countries whenever she wanted it , ) to supply her own deficiency . Her husbandry has , moroever , been greatly improved of late years , and vast tracts of commons , before worthless , have been added to her arable lands , so that the increase of her agricultural produce has almhst kept pace with the increase of her population . These checks , however , to the law which regulates wages , are but temporary ; and if her population continues to increase , the wages of her laborers , in conformity to that law , must decline . You have in favor of your views , the concurrence of Gray , in his work on the " Happiness of States , " - of Lowe , in his " State of England , " and of some other English writers of respectability . But after reading all they have written on the subject , I find nothing in their books which you have not substantially stated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your views are equally applicable to theirs . Perhaps you will ask , if I agree with Malthus as to the increased difficulty experienced by the laborer in earning subsistence in an increasing population , in what do I differ from him . My answer is , that I differ from him as to the force of the preventive checks , which I think that Malthus has underrated ,  --  that in this country especially , where we start with a higher standard of comfort to the common laborer than exists elsewhere , or proha* bly ever has existed in any extensivc country , it is not improbable that prudent forbearance of marriage until the means of ordinary comfort can be attained , will operate sooner and more forcibly than it seems to have done generally in the old world ;  --  and lastly , that when population has reached its utmost density , consistent with the general comfort of the people , by reason of the large proportion of the population , that will then be found in cities , which can not keep up their supply of inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retardation of marriage , the annual supply of life will not exceed its annual waste , and , consequently , there will not exist that pressure of population on the means of subsistence , supposed by Mr. Malthus , or the sufferings it occasions . At the risk of being tedious , I have thus fully detailed my views on this interesting subject , and though I dare not venture to hope that I shall make you a convert to my opinions , having seldom had that good fortune in my discussion of speculative topics , I thought I would at least satisfy you that the doctrine I advanced had been the result of much thought and deliberation , and was supported by not a few arguments , such as they are . It will give me pleasure to learn from you the points on which we may still differ . I am , very respectfully and sincerely , your friend . ( Signed , ) GEORGE TUcKER . Hon. A. H. Everett , Boston .

I feel myself greatly obliged by the attention which you // had given to my request , and by the careful manner in which you have answered it . I am staying here a few days , on a visit to some personal friends , and shall return next week to Massachusetts , where I shall have more leisure to reflect upon the subject . After deliberately weighing your suggestions with the respect to which they are , on all accounts , so fully entitled , I will take the liberty of troubling you with some further observations upon the points on which we differ . I am , dear sir , very truly and respectfully , your friend , ( Signed , ) A. H. EVERETT . Hon. George Tucker . NO . IV . Mr. Everett to Professor Tucker . Washington , D. C. , Jan. 29 , 1845 . DEAR SIR ,  --  I have deferred answering your very interesting letter of the 14th of May last , until I should have had time to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinions upon it in counnection with your suggestions . I will now , agreeably to your desire , state to you as concisely as I can , my views of the points upon which we differ . In your Address to the Institute , you assumed , as an ascertained principle in Political Economy , that the reward of labor , or , in the common phrase , the rate of wages recrnlarly declines with the progress of population . I took the liberty to request from you an explanation of the grounds upon which you assumed this principle as true , and stated as my opinion that the rate of wages regularly rises , or , in other words , that labor regularly becomes more productive , as population increases in density . In your letter now before me , you say that my position is " entirely correct as to manufactures and all the other comforts of life , excepting food : that by means of the division of labor , and the steady progress of the inventive arts and of practical skill , our clothes , furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper and better . " You also agree that the progress of population increases the productiveness of agricultural labor ; but you think that this increase is less rapid than in the case of labor employe* in manufactures , and that there is a limit beyond which the amount of the produce of a given tract of land can not possibly be carried . On all these points we entirely concur . I now come to those upon which we differ . You maintain that population naturally increases everywhere , with great rapidity , excepting so far as it is kept in check by a deficiency * in the supply of provisions , and that the inhabitants of every part of the globe must necessarily subsist upon the produce of the territory which they occupy . rhese positions being admitted , it would , as you say , follow of course , that a given amount of produce must be distributed everywhere among a constantly increasing number of persons , and that each will receive a smaller share : in other words , that , as population advances , the reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase , the rate of wages will decline . I differ from you in regard to the correctness of both these positions . On a review of the past and contemporary state of the world , I see no reason to believe that population , under ordinary circumstances , naturally increases with great rapidity , or that the population of every part of the globe must necessarily subsist upon the produce of the soil they occupy . 1 am satisfied , on the contrary , that a rapid increase of population ,  --  or indeed any increase at all ,  --  is a comparatively rare occurrence , indicating , wherever it takes place , an uncommonly prosperous condition of the society : - that such an increase naturally brings with it an increase in the productiveness of labor in all its departments , less rapid , no doubt , in agriculture than in manufactures , but capable in both of being carried to an indefinite extent ; - and that , although the amount of the means of subsistence , which can be drawn from a given territory , is limited by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not limited by that or any other cause , hut may be raised by importation to any quantity , which the demand may require . The increase in the amount of the supplies , both of agriculture and manufactured articles , occasioned by an increase of population , being thus more than proportional to the increased number of consumers , it follows , of necessity* // that unless there be some artificial inequality in the mode of distAbution , each person will receive a larger share than he did before ; - in other words , that the reward of labor , or rate of wages , will rise . In order to simplify the discussion , and keep it within a moderate compass , 1 will waive , for the present , any examination of the supposed tendency to a rapid increase of population , and confine myself to a few remarks on your second position , namely , that the quantity of provisions at the disposal of a community is necessarily limited to the direct product of the soil they occupy . If it can be shown , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactured or agricultural , at the disposal of a community , is limited only by the extent of the demand , and that an increase of population , whenever it occurs , is a principle of abundance and not of scarcity ,  --  it will , of course , follow that there can be no decline of wages resultini* from this cause , at least until the whole productive power of the globe shall he exhausted ,  --  a contingency which , for the present purpose , may be safely left out of view . In order to bring the question to a point , let us suppose a community occupying a territory where the limit of the possible amount of agricultural produce has been reached ; and let us suppose the population of this community to be doubled . As there is no further employment for agricultural labor , the additional members of the community will , of course , engage in the various branches of manufactures ; and on the principle , in which we agree , that the progress of population increases very rapidly and to an indefinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this whole class of products ( including , according to your enumeration , clothes , furniture , and all sorts of machinery ) is consequently much cheaper . as compared with any fixed standard of value , than it was before . The productiveness of agricultural labor not having increased at all , its products remain of the same value , in comparison with any fixed standard , and are , of course , dearer in exchange with manufactures . If a barrel of flour would before exchange for a yard of broad-cloth , it will now exchange for two . In the mean time the rate of exchange between flour and broad-cloth remains the same as before in other countries where no increase of population has taken place . In France and England a barrel of flour exchanges for two yards of broadcloth ; in Poland it still exchanges for only one . rrhe merchants , whose business it is to watch the markets and take advantage of differences of this kind in the value of the same articles in different places , now purchase cloth in England or France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard to the barrel , carry their flour to London or Paris , where they sell it at the rate of two yards to the barrel , and thus realize upon the operation a profit of one hundred per cent . deducting charges , whatever they may be . But in every branch of business which yields a profit beyond the usual rate , competition , of course , springs up immediately . Other merchants engage in the trade , and content themselves with smaller gains , until the profit is reduced to the ordinary rate . A barrel of flour now sells in England for a sum sufficient to reward , at the ordinary rate , all the labor that has been employed in bringing it to market . Now the labor employed in bringing a barrel of Polish flour to London is , in this case , the labor employed upon a yard of British cloth , and that employed by the merchant in transporting the cloth to Poland and the flour to London . If cloth has fallen 100 per cent . at London in consequence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent , excepting so far as the price may be increased by the freight and charges incurred in the two voyages . What then will be the reward of labor or rate of wages at London , compared with what it was before the increase of population took plaoe ? Estimated in manufactures , it has risen 100 per cent . Estimated in agricultural produce , and allowing 50 per cent . for freight and charges on the two voyages , it has risen 50 per cent . If these two classes of products be supposed to enter in equal parts into the consumption of the community , the average rise will , of course , be a medium between the two rates . If wages were before at the rate of a dollar a day , they will now , after the population has been doubled , be $ 1.75 . If , as you suppose , although I do not agree with you in // this , the rate of wages is regulated exclusively by the state of the supply of agricultural produce , there is still a rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which commanded , before the increase of population , only a dollar , now commands , even on this supposition , $ 1.50 . If , under the same circumstances , we suppose the population to be tripled or quadrupled , there will be , for the same reasons , a proportional increase in the productiveness of labor and in the rate of wages . The result here contemplated is , as you perceive , the necessary consequence of the regular course of trade , as it proceeds from day to day before our eyes in every part of the world , excepting so far as it is interfered with by the arbitrary regulations of different countries . The theory is verified , at this moment , in large sections of our own country . New England , and even Western New York , receive their means of subsistence , to a considerable extent , from the western states ; and should they continue to increase in population as they have done , must draw still more largely upon the same rich granary . I will now advert to the objections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result here supposed . After remarking that the inhabitants of a densely peopled country may temporarily obtain a part of their supplies from abroad , you say that " this state of things can not be permanent . In the same degree that one country produces less than it consumes , the others , from which she draws her supplies , must produce more : and as her demands increase with her increasing population , so must their excess . But this , we have seen , is physically impossible , so that when they have reached the limit of their utmost supply , the law apportioning wages to population , which had been temporarily suspended or checked , is immediately renewed in full force . " In other words , and to continue the illustration employed before - if the density of population , and with it the demand for foreign grain , should continue to increase in England , the merchant , who has been in the habit of suppl*ingthe British market with grain from Poland , would find , after a while , that he had exhausted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with voL. xvII. - No . Lxxxviii. advantage his former trade between London and Dantzic . What would be the consequence l Would the cornmerchant discontinue his business because he could no longer freight his ships at the same ports as before l Of course not , He would now send them to the Black Sea , to the United States , or to any other part of the globe , where grain or flour were to be had . As long as there was an effectual demand for further supplies of grain at London , the corn trade would afThrd a profit ; and as long as it afforded a profit , it would be carried on with one part of the world or another . The only assignable limit to the extent of the supplies of food that might , if wanted , be obtained in this way , is that of the productive power of the whole globe . When the productive power of the whole globe , land and water , shall have been put in requisition to its utmost extent , if population should still continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficiency of food . Until the occurrence of such a state of things , which is obviously chimerical , and is admitted to be so by Mr. Malthus and his partisans , there can be no necessary deficiency in any quarter ; and the value of labor , whether estimated in food or any other article , will increase , instead of declining , exactly in proportion as population increases in density . I have thus , my dear sir , given you my views upon the theory of this subject , as treated in your letter ; and particularly upon the two points stated above , in which we differ . The final test of truth in regard to this or any other theory , is an appeal to facts . You give in confirmation of your views a table of the rates of wages in different countries , in which they are stated at 20 and two-fifths pints of rice per week in India , 80 pints of wheat in England , and 192 pints of wheat in the United States . Of these countries the United States are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest rapidity ; England probably holds the second place in this respect ; while India is a ruined and exhausted country , in which wealth and population have long been declining , and which is gradually sinking into complete desolation . That the country where population is most rapidly increasing is also the one where the wages of labor are highest ; and 20 // that in the country which holds the second place in this respect , they are four times as high as in another where population is declining , are facts which it is not very easy to reconcile with the supposition that an increase of population regularly occasions a comparative scarcity . They coincide very well with any doctrine that an increase of population produces abundance . The same may be said of your statement that in our western country , where population increases more rapidly than in any other part of the Union , the rate of wages , estimated in grain , is nearly four pecks a day ; while in the middle states , where population increases somewhat less rapidly , it is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the increase is st-ill less rapid , only two . It seems to me that each of these cases , if not abso7 lutely fatal to your theory , must be accounted for as a-n exception to the general rule , and can give it , of course , no direct support . It is true that , if the rate of wages were affected by no other circumstance except the comparative density of population , it should be , on any view of the subject , higher in England than it is in this country , and higher in New England than it is in the middle and western states . But no one supposes that the state of population is the only circumstance which affects the rate of wages . The state of population determines the productiveness of labor , the products of which are naturally distributed among the members of the community on the principle that every one shall receive the whole produce of his own industry , or its equivalent in money : and so far as this principle is permitted to operate , the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the population . But the operation of this principle is controlled by the political institutions of every country , and in most cases , to a greater or less extent , counteracted ; so that the rate of wages is a compound result of the state of population and the character of the government . If , for example , the density of population be twice as great in France as it is in Spain , the rate of wages in the former country would be naturally twice as high as in the latter : but if the French government regularly employ one half of the working men in the army , and half the produce of the labor of the other moiety in paying the expenses of the wars in which they are engaged , there will remain only one quarter of the regular produce of the labor of the whole population to be distributed among the actual laborers . The rate of wages , instead of being twice as high as it is in Spain , would be only half as high ; and so - of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first thought ' , as if the physical advantages of different countries would have a good deal of weight in determining the reward of individual labor ; and that this would naturally be much greater in a very fertile region than it is in a barren one . Such , however , does not seem to be the case : and this is one of the strongest proofs of the ascendancy of the moral part of our nature over the material . All experience shows that the influence of a fine climate and a very productive soil in removing the necessity and with it the disposition to labor , neutralizes entirely the effect that would result from the greater advantages under which labor is applied-under such circumstances , and that the total produce is not so great in these countries as it is in those where subsistence is less easy . The inhabitants of the temperate zone , taking the world round , furnish at the year 's end a much larger amount of products than those who live within the tropics . The principal economical result of great physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favored by the soil and climate , and become , in consequence , the great objects of attention . By estimating the reward of labor in these , it may be made to appear in almost every country much higher than it is in others . Thus the rate of wages , estimated in wine , would appear to be much higher in France than it is in Great Britain or the United States . Estimated in bananas and oranges , it would be higher in the West Indian Islands than in any other part of Christendom . If rice were the standard , labor would be bet-. ter paid in China and India than in Europe ; and if wheat be employed for this purpose , it appears greater in the grain-growing countries than it really is . This is one of the reasons why the rate of wages , estimated in wheat according to your statement , appears so // much higher in the United States than in England , instead of being , as it naturally should be , lower ; and is probably the only reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eastern states of this Union . In comparing the reward of labor at different periods in the same country , a particular product of the country , like wheat , is a better test than money ; though still an uncertain one . But in comparing the reward of labor at the same period in different countries , any one article is obviously of little or no value . The only sure test is the general condition of the laborer , that is , of the community at large ; the extent to which the people are supplied with the necessaries , comforts , and luxuries of life ; such as lodging , clothing , fire , food , machinery of all kinds , professional aid , education , religious instruction , and amusements of all descriptions . On applying this test , it will be found , I imagine , that the reward of labor at this and every other period , and in all parts of the world , bears a direct proportion to the density of population , excepting so far as this result is counteracted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out . England is precisely the country in which the effect that I ascribe to the increase of population in augmenting the productiveness of labor is most apparent . The reason is that a more than usually large proportional amount has been applied to manufactures , in which there is more room for the improvenient of methods , and consequent increase of productiveness than in agriculture . It is calculated that the machinery of all kinds now in use in Great Britain represents the labor of three hundred-some say eight hundredmillions of men . Assuming the former estimate as an approximation to the truth , it follows that the productiveness f labor and the total amount of its products have been augmented , chiefly since the commencement of the present century , 3000 per cent. , and that the British nation have at their disposal the means of commanding the labor ( or its equivalent in machinery ) of three hundred millions of men in other parts of the globe . As the labor of one man employed in agriculture under tolerably favorable circumstances will furnish the means of subsistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation have at their disposal the means of commanding annually agricultural produce sufficient for the subsistence of the whole human race . Excepting so far as their own arbitrary regulations prevent it , the natural operation of the laws of trade would regularly supply them in their own ports with all the foreign grain that might be wanted , at the low prices at which it is sold in the grain-growing countries , with the addition of the regular charge for transportation , calculated at the lowest possible rate . From these considerations , which are obvious and undisputed , it results that , whatever may be the reasons which prevent the re*vard of individual labor in England from being as high as it naturally should be , they are not to be found , as you suppose , in any deficiency in the supply of the means of subsistence . It is unnecessary for the present purpose , and would carry me far beyond the limits of a letter , to go into the inquiry what these reasons are . The large deductions made by the government from the annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public expenses and pay the interest on the debt ( amounting annually to about three hundred million dollars ) are undoubtedly one . The Corn Laws are another . A third is probably to be found in the rapidity with which the immense mass of machinery now in use has been introduced , and which has probably not permitted the increased consumption resulting from the greater cheapness of the articles made by machinery to keep pace fully with the increased supply , so as to continue in employment the same number of men as before . Numbers must have been discharged and as the local situation of England renders it difficult for many of them to find employment elsewhere , the labor market is overstocked , paupers abound , and those who work are obliged to take such wages as they can get . If in a working population of about ten millions , machinery is suddenly introduced , equivalent to the labor of three hundred millions ; in other words , if every working man is suddenly enabled to do the work of thirty , supposing the demand for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of every thirty working men will be thrown out of employment . // If the demand and consequent production be doubled by the increased cheapness of fhe manufactured articles , the labor of two men supplies them , and twenty-eight must still be dismissed . If demand and consumption be ten times greater than before , twenty laborers out of every thirty are , nevertheless , compelled to quit their places ; and so of any other proportion . If the whole ten millions were kept in employment , the result would be equivalent to the labor of three thousand millions of men . However great may have been the increase in the total amount of the produce of British labor , occasioned by the introduction of machinery , it has , of course , remained far below this point . Without claiming any thing like strict accuracy for these estimates , which are merely approximative and of the lowest kind , I incline to think that the sudden introduction of this immense amount of machinery has contributed to a greater extent than is generally supposed to the pauperism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined in England with a profusion of national wealth unparalleled in the history of the world . So far as the evils alluded to have arisen from this cause , they can only be remedied hy emigration . Where , as generally happens , improvements are gradually and slowly introduced , the increased demand keeps pace with the increased production , so that no one is thrown out of employment , while all enjoy , in their own consumption , the benefit of the increased cheapness of the article . As to our own country , Massachusetts , the State in which the population is most dense and the soil least productive , is also the wealthiest in the Union . This combination of circumstances settles the question as to the effect of the progress of population upon the reward of labor , unless some particular reasons can he found in the condition of that State for considering it as an exception to the rule rather than an illustration of it . In a community where taxation is very light , and trade comparatively free ,  --  with the grain-growing countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine any cause that should prevent the individual laborer from receiving his just proportion of the whole produce , or , in other words , should prevent the real rate of wages from being higher than it is in the less populous parts of the Union . A slight observation of the condition of the State of Massachusetts , with reference to accumulated capital , public buildings , rail-roads , and other public improvements ,  --  education and religious instruction ,  --  learning and the arts ,  --  navigation , commerce , and manufactures ,  --  and the individual accommodation of the people in the way of lodging , clothing , food , and amusements , is sufficient to show that there is all the difference that might he expected , on any view of the subject , in her favor . The difference on the other side in your estimate ,  --  supposing it to be accurate ,  --  m ust be accounted for , as I remarked before , by the fact that the western States are a grain-growing country . Good claret wine ,  --  such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle ,  --  can be made in the south of France at about a cent a bottle . Supposing the wages of a French peasant to be about afranc , or twenty cents , a day , and those of a New England laborer about a dollar , the comparative reward of labor in the two countries , estimated in French wine , would be twenty bottles per day in France , and two in New England . Estimated in ice or granite , which have been pleasantly described as the only two natural products of Massachusetts , the reward of labor in that State , as compared with what it is in the west , would appear greater than it really is . But , without going into farther details on this subject , it is certain that , in a community which is really wealthier than another ,  --  or , in other words , which receives regularly in return for its labor a larger amount of produce ,  - -  a comparatively lower rate of wages , if real , can not be accounted for , as it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficiency in the supply of the means of suhsistence . Before closing this letter , I will advert very briefly to one or two passages in yours , not material to the main argument , but involving some not unimportant errors in fact and opinion . You say , incidentally , that a popuJation of 640 to the square mile is physically impossible , " because the acre which , in this case , would be allotted to each individual , would he insufficient to supply him with food , clothing , fuel , and the other necessaries and comforts // of life . " This statement falls of itself , with the general proposition implied in it , that necessary supplies can only be obtained from the territory occupied by the party which is to use them . But , independently of this objection , the statement is liable to the still more direct and peremptory one , that the degree of density in population , which you suppose to be physically impossible , has been actually realized in various parts of the world . The present average population of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now before me , published at Brussels , in 1838 , by the chief clerk in the department of finance , and which may be regarded as semi-official , at 125 to the 100 hectares of land , which is about one to every two acres , or 320 to the square mile . Some of the provinces of that kingdom have considerably more than the average density . East Flanders is represented , on the same authority , as having a population of 250 to the 100 hectares , or about double the average density . It reaches , of course , about 640 to the square mile ,  - -  the density which you suppose to he physically impossible . The population of Holland is , according to my recollection , still more dense than even this ; but I have no document at hand from which I can draw the exact figures . That province is said to be the most populous region of equal extent in Christendorn : and it must , as I should think , appear very singular to those who believe that the inhabitants of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce of the territories they respectively occupy , that the most populous region should produce nothing , with the exception of cheese and butter , and the common garden vegetables , which is employed by the inhabitants as their usual means of subsistence . You say , toward the close of your letter , that you " do not think that any argument can be drawn from the supplies which great cities like London receive from the country . As a half or even a third of the population are sufficient to raise raw produce for the rest , and as the other operations of industry are better carried on in towns , the people of every country naturally distribute themselves into two portions , one in the country and the other in towns ; but whether in many small ones or a few large ones , must depend upon the rivers , harbors , and other localities , and on their commerce and manufactures .. The progress of population tends to enlarge these cities , but , as we have seen , to lessen the supplies that can be exported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument drawn from the supplies furnished to large cities by the country is that , in every such case , a population occupying a more or less extensive territory , subsists wholly on supplies imported from abroad . In London , for example , a population of more than two millions occupies a territory of perhaps fifteen or twenty square miles in extent , which does not produce anything whatever that can be used as food . Every instance of this kind seems to me to be fatal to a theory which supposes that the inhabitants of every part of the globe must necessarily subsist upon the products of the soil they occupy , and rests upon that supposition as its sole foundation . I do not see that this argument , which appears to me entirely irresistible , is affected by your remarks , as quoted above . When you say " that the progress of population , while it enlarges the cities , tends to lessen the supplies that can be exported , and consequently that can be imported , " I understand you to mean that it tends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the country to the towns . If this be your meaning , the remark is no doubt true , because a greater quantity will now be wanted for consumption in the country ; but this fact has no tendency to show that ( he population of cities is not supported entirely by supplies from without , or that whole proviiices might not , if necessary , he supported in the same way . I agree with you in the opinion that the progress of population has , in general , a tendency to diminish the quantity of agricultural produce that can be exported ; but the articles which are exported , in exchange for provisions , by a country subsisting on supplies from abroad , are , in general , not the produce of agricultural but of manufacturing labor ; and the progress of population tends , as you remark in your letter , to augment very much the amount and the quality of this description of products . In exchange for these , any corresponding amount of imports of any kind that may be wanted can , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , that I have tasked your patience somewhat too severely . I trust , however , that you will consider the length of this letter as a proof of the respect that I feel for your opinions , and of my wish to show you that I have not come to a different conclusion without a full consideration of the subject . I should , of course , adopt , without hesitation , any correction of these conclusions that might appear to be necessary . If you notice any errors in the suggestions that I have now made , you would particularly oblige me by pointing them out . On the other hand , it would give me great pleasure to find that these suggestions have met your approbation , and have led you to take a view of the subject , which , I think , must be admitted by all to be more agreeable and satisfactory than the one stated in your letter . I am , with great respect , my dear sir , very truly , your friend and obd't servant . Signed , A. H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the several colleges send forth their annual catalogues , containing the names of the officers and students , the requisites for admission , the course of study and other information necessary to be spread before the public . Any one who carefully examines these catalogues , will be struck with the great similarity of the several collecres in all their arrangements ; the course of studies continued through four years , embracing the same subjects in all , with only some slight variations in the text books . It is indeed singular , that in this land of experiment , no college has been organized upon a different plan . Each new college has been fashioned after the old model , as if no improvement was possible . The four classes , the fixed course of studies , the yearly advancement from one class to another , originally copied from the preparatory schools in England , are found in all . We do not propose in the present article to offer any new plan for a college , but simply to point out some obstacles in the present system , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so important to the literary character of our country . It has frequently been a subject for complaint , that our colleges send forth so many superficial and defective scholars ; and some reform in the system of instruction , or other change , has been loudly demanded . Some have recommended changes in the course of study , so as to allow each student to pursue that branch of science most congenial to his taste , with the hope of making the pursuit of knowledge so inviting , as to secure the requisite amount of application . So me , again , have urged the institution of prizes and honors as stimulants to industry ; and others have demanded of those entrusted with the government and discipline of these institutions , a more rigid administration of discipline . All these methods have been tried , and still our colleges remain substantially as they were , and annually send forth a multitude of young men , who have acquired nothing during the four years course of study , but a few general ideas , together with habits of desultory application and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired effect , because the real evil is neither in the studies , nor the want of incitements to study , nor in the want of such discipline as the syat*m admits . In the first place , the freedom of choice in studies is of little importance , for at the age when a majority of our young men enter college , the freedom of choice is not exercised s much upon the different branches of study as upon the alternatives of study and pleasure ; and experience has shown that those who would not be industrious* when pursuing a fixed course of study , are uniformly found making choice of those studies , which promise the least amount of labor . The difficulty is not to induce them to pursue a particular branch of study , but to induce them to study at all . At no period of life is continuous application so irksome , or idleness and pleasure so attractive , as between the ages of fourteen and eighteen . That is the period of the most rapid growth of the body , and the most marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both of body and mind , require the most assiduous care ; and when least can be expected from the attractions of knowledge , in the way of securing application to study . It is , as every * Catalogue of Brown University for 1846-7 . Catalogue of Howard University for 1846-7 . Catalogue of Yale College for 1846-7. // 130 College Education . one who has reared a family knows , the thoughtless , the reckless , the indolent period of life . in the second place , prizes and honors are well as far as they go , and can not well be dispensed with ; yet they have little effect upon the great mass of students . A few trials will show who are to be the successful competitors , and the remaining portion of the class are left to the influence of the common motives to application . Prizes and honors may be useful in producing a high grade of scholarship in a few , and thus elevate the standard of attainment in a college ; but the great majority of students can not be stimulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they can have no hope of obtaining . For those , then , who are too dull or too indolent to aim within the range of prizes and honors , and those for whom knowledge has no charms , there is nothing left but regard of discipline . But discipline is administered under great disadvantages in an American college . The laws are , indeed , sufficientl y strict and severe , but there are no facilities for administering them effectively . By these laws students are required to occupy rooms in the college buildings , unless specially excused , to lodge in them at night , and he constantly in them during the hours appointed for study . For convenience in enforcing these regulations , the buildings are generally so constructed , that from twelve to sixteen rooms open into the same entry ; and an officer of the college , commonly a tutor , occupies one of the rooms , and has the supervision of the remainder . But the utmost vigilance on the part of the tutor , will not enable him to secure a strict observance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another , or go out of the building without his knowledge ; unless , indeed , he were to stand sentry in the hall . They can assemble together for conversation or amusement , provided they keep moderately quiet ; they can , and frequently do , collect together , to read over their Latin and Greek lessons , the best scholar in the group performing all the real mental labor , and the others deriving less benefit from the exercises , than if they used a liberal translation . Every method which ingenuity can devise to lighten the labors of study , and yet appear passably in the recitation room , can be resorted to without interruption from the tutor . The consequence is , that the law requiring students to be in their rooms and attend to their studies during study hours , becomes practically no more than this : students are forbidden to make any noise , which might annoy the tutor , or disturb those who are inclined to study . In practice , the attempt to compel an attention to study by a supervision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recitation room is made the arena of discipline , the tribunal where the application and industry of the last two hours study is to be tried . To an experienced teacher , the manner of the recitation reveals , in some degree , the character of the last two hours study ; and yet he is often at a loss to determine whether the blunders of the recitation room are the results of indolence or stupidity . There will be cases so marked as to leave no doubt of their being fit subjects for punishment , but many will aim only at that degree of attainment which will allow them to escape without marked censure , and which , for want of accuracy and thoroughness , will be of little practical use . Nevertheless , all the discipline of a college , which acts upon the industry of the student , must depend upon the daily recitation , and the examination at the end of the session ; mostly , however , upon the former , for the examination is too remote in the mind of an indolent boy , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordeal . Yet a little reflection will show how difficult this discipline of the recitation must be . All that the instructor can require , is a knowledge of the lesson . How this knowl // edge was obtained , whether by intense and persevering study , by desultory and irregular application , by the aid of another and a better scholar , or by literal translations , he has not the means of knowino ; and could he know , he has not the power to enforce that kind of application which will tend to invigorate their minds , and lay the foundation of good scholarship , in good habits of study . He has still another difficulty to contend with . A number of students , of various ages , capacities , and degrees of preparation , ( for whatever standard a college may assume for the terms of admission , there will always be some below that standard , ) are put into the same class , and are designed to go through a few years course of study together . It is impossible so to regulate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed to advantage on his lessons . The lessons must be graduated to the medium scholars of the class , and are not long enough to keep the best scholars employed , and too long for the poorest to master thoroughly in the allotted time . By this means the former are in danger of forming habits of idleness , and the latter are little benefited by their industry ; while their defective recitations lower the standard of attainment for all the indolent members of the class , who will not fail to take credit to themselves , as long as any rank below them . The instructor may discriminate , and discipline those whom he is persuaded do not come up to the measure of their ability ; he can make the recitation room exceedingly uncomfortable to those who come there badly prepared ; but there is a limit to the effect of this , unless it is followed in some cases by the severe discipline of dismission . The dread of dismission for deficient scholarship , where this punishment is frequently inflicted , will secure a certain amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the student that interest and zeal in his studies , which are essential to success . The discipline of the recitation and examination rooms fails of its effect , because the previous discipline of the study room is wanting . The latter permits , I might rather say , encourages negligence , the former punishes it , often to the ruin of the individual , and with little benefit to the other inemhers of his class . Something can be effected by a judicious blending of discipline with rewards , and bringing parental and public approbation and disapprobation to bear upon the students , together with the exercise of a strong personal influence on the part of the instructors . It is upon these means that the judicious instructor mostly depends . But even these are applied to boys in college under great disadvantages . Rewards , as has been before remarked , are operative only on a few . Parents can not be made acquainted with those little aberrations from the line of duty , which , if persevered in , as surely corrupt the mind and the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college may be ignorant of them , till their effects begin to appear in gross negligence and immorality . The parent reviews the report of his sony s conduct and proficiency at the close of the college term , but he knows too little of college life to comprehend it fully . He finds that his son has not secured the approbation of his instructors , and he is disappointed , but he knows not what remedy to apply . His admonitions are of great importance , and may do much to correct the evil ; but his son , a lad of fifteen , perhaps , has learned in college that he is a man , and that it is puerile to heed the admonitions of his father . The father , too , instead of blaming his son , may feel that his negligence or misconduct is the result of unfaithfulness on the part of his instructors , or pressed with other cares , may have little leisure to attend to such matters . He has committed the education of his son to the college , and holds it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon those students who most need // 13*2 College Education . its restraining power . The college has a public opinion , a standard of excellence , and a code of morals of its own ; and the tyro soon learns to disregard the good opinion of those without , provided he does not incur the censure of the great body of the students , and can win the applause of the clique with whom he associates . If he becomes acquainted with the inhabitants of the town in which the college is located , it is often with those who are easiest of access ; with vain , frivolous persons of his own age , who will rather encourage him in idleness and dissipation , than exercise a conservative influence over him . The personal influence of the officers of college is also impeded by the peculiar relation which they sustain towards the students . Every man who has had a family to govern , well knows that there is a period in youth when it becomes impatient of control ; when the pursuits of pleasure are most ardent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irresolute ; when it is necessary to make the boy feel that he is still a boy , and incapable of judging and acting for himself . It is precisely at this wayward period of life , that the lad is sent to college , and placed under the government of men whom he knows can have no peculiar personal interest in his welfare , and at the same time invested with all the prerogatives of a young man . With the self-conceit consequent upon his elevation , he feels himself in all points , except the single ope of literary and scientific attainment , fully equal to his instructors . He acknowledges in them no right of control , farther than is - given them by the statutes of the college ; and even these he feels himself under no moral oblioations to obey . The impossibility of executing some of the laws strictly , leads him to claim a like license in all , and henceforward he stands in the position of personal hostility to the officers of government , whom he regards as imposing restraint upon him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of reluctant yielding to authority , a submission to an irksome discipline , to be endured only for the sake of gratifying his parents , or for the distinction which a college education affords . In the mind of such a student , everything is associated with discipline and restraint . He studies by constraint , goes to the recitation and lecture by constraint , and every escape from duty he deems just so much taken from his t*isk . It is extremely difficult for the most accomnplished instructor to inspire anything like enthusiasm for learning , in minds so disposed ; and it is not surprising , if , after many discouragements , he leaves them to get along as they may , and addresses himself to those who , from riper age , and more efficient early training , are better prepared to profit by his instructions . I would not say that all , or even a majority of the students in our colleges answer fully to the above description ; but the number is large*enough to lower materially the standard of attainment , and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth so many superficial and inferior scholars . On a careful examination , we shall find our colleges still more deficient in the means for the correct moral training of young men . So far indeed from affording the means of efficient moral culture , we fear that they offer peculiar temptations to vice . A parent is content if his son does not deteriorate in college ; he does not expect him to make any progress in virtue and piety . Many a broken-hearted father can bear witiiess to the dangers of college life , and many a ruined man may find the cause of his ruin in habits contracted while obtaining his education . Youth is , indeed , the most critical period of life ; and there is danger , wherever it comes in contact with temptation . Perhaps the prop*tiomi of young men ruined in college , is not greater than in other situations in life . // There is a fearful loss of character among the clerks in our large cities , among those apprenticed to the various mechanic arts , and a greater still among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In looking at the wreck of moral character among these , we might consider college comparatively safe . Of clerks and apprentices , it is estimated that one-half , at least , are ruined . The proportion of students is less than this ; but the difference is owing , more to the difference in their pursuits , than to any peculiar security which the college affords . Nearly all our colleges are situated in the vicinity of large towns , which have within them all the sources of ini.quity which belong to the largest cities . There , may be found eating and drinking houses , from the genteel lunch and hotel , down to the most loathsome dens of vice ; gambling-houses , and houses of ill-fame approached by secret passages , unknown to the public , but easily found by the initiated . In addition to this , private rooms can always be hired by clubs of young men , in obscure places , for the purpose of more private dissipation . And then there are amusements of some kind almost every evening : concerts , balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds of the young from serious pursuits , and prepare them , by a kind of mental dissipation , for the seductions of vice and folly . And what is there in the discipline of college to counteract all this ? Nothing but the personal influence of the officers of instruction and government . They may coi4nsel and advise , but they can not control . They may check , in a degree , the frequenting of public amusements , by requiring students to be in their rooms in the evening ; but unless the rooms are visited several times in the evening , they can not prevent it . A taste for amusement is incompatible with good habits of study ; and a student who cultivates it , soon loses his relish for intellectual pursuits . His studies become an insupportable task , and he neglects them ; but something must be found wherewith to fill up his vacant hours , and failiiig to find sufficient amusement in public , he resorts to books , which inflame his passions and undermine his virtue ; or he indulges in smoking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , and corrupt his moral feelings . Nor is it possible for the officers to keep the evil-disposed student from scenes of riot and excess . The law , indeed , requires him to be in his room at a reasonable hour , and lodge there at night ; but there are no adequate means of enforciiig this salutary law . He may steal out , and elude the vigilance of the officer , and returii again without his knowledge . He can leave his room after the officers have retired for the night , and at the latest hour lie will find the haunts of vice open . In the Eiiglish colleges , which are built in the form of a quadrangle , with only one entrance , the door can be locked at an appointed hour , and all egress denied ; but our colleges have no such convenieiice ; they are open at all hours of the night . What careful parent , residing in a large town , would allow his son , at sixteen years of age , the means of leaving and returning home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send him to college at that critical age , where such liberties can not be prevented ; and will , perhaps , blame the institution if his son is ruined . Another evil in college , is the unrestrained intercourse of the students , at an age when the passions are strong , and the judgment and will *veak and wavering . Young men of corrupt principles can not be altogether kept out of college . In a large collection of students , use what precautions you will , tbe leaven of vice will always exist ; and when the passions are addressed , the young mind is quite as susceptible of bad iml ) ressions as of good . By little and little , the moral principles may be uiidermined by this daily mingling with the vicious ; and the youth , whose guileless heart knew no evil when he left his home , is soon prepared to rush to the commission of // any vice , whenever an opportunity offers . We know of no college in which there are not secret societies , established under pretence of literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice , in which the obligations of morality and religion are set at nought , and resistance to the government of the college encouraged ; and meetings held at late hours , for the purpose of unrestrained dissipation . Into these societies many young men are inveigled , almost as soon as they enter college , pledged to secrecy , and made to feel themselves bound in honor to maintain them , by every means in their power . All attempts to suppress these societies have hitherto proved abortive ; for their very existence is sometimes one of the secrets , which the members are bound not to divulge to the college authorities . Indeed , such is the difficulty of controlling the habits and morals of the students by preventive discipline , that , in many of the larger colleges , it has been mostly abandoned . The rooms of the students are not regularly visited , no especial care is taken to keep them in at seasonable hours , and very little is done in the way of private admonition and advice . The government is wholly penal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full below it , whether from incapacity or indolence , are summarily dismissed . A standard of morals is also fixed , and any one detected in a gross offence is expelled or dismissed ; but owing to the difficulty of detection , much immorality is practised with impunity . Such a system may be best for the reputation of the college , but it is cruel towards the young men who resort to it for education ; and yet , as our colleges are organized , it is almost unavoidable . To form an idea of the loss of young men from the failure of college discipline to effect what is expected of it , both as regards scholarship and morals , we have only to look at the successive catalogues of a college , and note the number of students who leave without having completed their course of studies . Take the case of Yale College , which enjoys a high reputation , both for scholarship and discipline . As appears from the catalogues , all the admissions to the class graduated in 1841 , amounted to one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of the senior year , showing a loss of fifty-nine , or nearly three-eighths of the whole . Of one hundred and twentyseven , entering the freshman class in 1839 , seventy-three only are found in the senior class three years afterwards . The small colleges , probably , do not exhibit a proportionate loss ; for in these , there are better opportunities for the exercise of the personal ii*fluence of the faculty ; and the necessities of these institutions may induce them to retain students who would be dismissed from the larger colleges . It will be readily admitted , that all who leave college without completing their course , are not dismissed for deficient scholarship or immoral conduct . We might , perhaps , set down one-fourth of the number to ill health , pecuniary embarrassment , or other circumstances , which render a change of pursuits expedient ; but after making this allowance , the proportion is by far too great ; and shows conclusively that the discipline fails of its most desirable effect , the prevention , rather than the punishment , of indolence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which our colleges are deficient ; and that is , in preserving and promoting the health of the students . When a young man has reached the age of eighteen or twenty , the care of his health may be left with himself , guided by such suggestions as may be thrown out in a public lecture , or in occasional conversation . But a lad of fifteen needs something more than suggestions and advice . At no period of life does the health require such unremitting care , and at no other period are there equal carelessness and recklessness . At that age , personal clean- // 135 Jiness , strict temperance , and regular exercise , are indispensable , both for present comfort and for formincr a strong and vigorous constitution . The neglect of these , particularly at a lime when the stature is rapidly increasing , brings on a languor , both of body and mind , and predisposes to secret vices , destructive to the health and morals . It is this languor which makes all kinds of stimulants welcome a a relief ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nerves and ruins the health of so many , owes its prevalence , in a good degree , to this cause . Some colleges have provided means for gymnastic exercises ; but these exercises being no part of the system of discipline , are neglected by those who need them most . We know of none where conveniences are provided for bathing , much less any measures adopted to secure attention to this very essential requisite of health . Shall we wonder , then , that the health of young men so often suffers in college ? We often hear of students who have ruined their health by too close an application to study ; but , for every one injured by hard study , there are at least ten injured for want of exercise , and the neglect of personal cleanliness . Taking then into account the defects of college discipline , in the all-important matters of scholarship , morals , and health , it is by no means surprising that the result should be so unsatisfactory , or that thiiiking men should be desirous of some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these institutions , would appear from the fact , that while the means of education have rapidly advanced , the increase of students in the several colleges , has not kept pace with the increase of our population . But the question may he asked , Are the colleges less adapted to their peculiar work than they were in the last generation ? To this we answer , That while the general features of the colleges have not changed , the circumstances of the community have changed . In the last generation , boys did not begin the study of the classics so early . Good classical schools were few in number , and it was not thought advisable to send young lads from home to prepare for college , till they were capable , in some degree , of taking care of themselves . There were not then , as now , boarding-schools all over the country , promising to take boys at any age , and act the parent for them better than it could be done at home . The consequence was , that a majority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in some degree formed ; after they had the discernment to see the use of systematic application , and appreciate the advantages of a liberal education ; and on that account had less need of college discipline , our colleges are proper places for young men , fit to be entrusted with the responsibility of their own conduct ; they are utterly unsuited to boys who need the discipline of the school-room , and the watchful care of masters and monitors . Another circumstance has contributed to render our colleges unfit places for the younger class of students . When they were founded they were located in villages , where the temptations to vice arid idleness were few ; and where it was extremely difficult for the student to take the first step in wickedness without the knowledge of the faculty . These villages have now grown into large towns , which afford not only temptations to every kind of iniquity , but also facilities for concealment . The moral principles of a boy may be perverted , and the seeds of ruin sown , ere the instructor is aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed for I ) ubhic life , must pass through the ordeal of temptation ; but let not this take place , till increased knowledge and maturer judgment will enable them to pass through it in safety . From this vie'v of the failure of our colleges to effiect what is expected of them , an important question arises , What can he done to improve them ? shall all the students be compelled to prepare their lessons in a common // room , as in the grammar schools ? Shall they be constantly kept under the watch and word of tutors and proprietors , to prevent them from being corrupted by unrestrained intercourse with each other ? Shall the buildings be surrounded with high walls , with iron gates and massive locks , to prevent egress during the night ? And shall gymnasia and baths be constructed , and persons be employed to enforce daily exercise , and see that the proper ablutions be performed , and due care taken of their health ? Any system of this kind would be attended with great expense , and even then would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professed to do all this , have failed to secure a close attention to study , or preserve unimpaired the morals and health of their inmates . No alterations in the organization or discipline of our colleges could remedy the evils complained of , so long as young lads of fourteen or fifteen years of age are sent to them to receive their education . Fix the age of admission at seventeen or eighteen , and other reforms would not be so much needed . It might be well to alter , in some respects , the requisites for a degree , making it depend more upon the amount of knowledge acquired , as ascertaiiied by a searchiug examination , and less upon the time spent within the college walls . There can be no good reason why the student , who can fully sustain his examination for a degree , should remain in college till his duller classmate is prepared to receive the same honor . Nor is there any good reason why the indolent or stupid youth , who has lived out his four years in college without being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the close of that period , or indeed at all , if he can not sustain a thorough examination . A diploma ought to be an evidence of scholarship ; but so worthiess has it grown , that the private recommendation of the president , or of a professor , is of more value than the parchment certificate of literary qualifications , given under the seal of the authorities of the college , and delivered with so much solemnity on c* : mmencement day . The graduate of West Point is known to be a proficient in the studies pursued at that institution ; but we would laugh at the simplicity of the man , who would infer , that the graduate of one of our colleges was *iecessarily a scholar . The expense of erecting so many college buildings , might be dispensed with , if students were not admitted so young . It is better that they should lodge at their boarding-houses , and prepare their lessons there also . If there were a smaller number in the same building , there would be less interruption from unseasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been said of the inexpediency of collecting so many students together as are found in the larger colleges . But if students were not sent to college till their characters were in some degree formed , the number of students in one institution would be no evil , but rather a great advantage . The stimulus to exertion is much more keenly felt where the number of competitors is large . They are brought in contact with minds of every grade , and in the strife for honor , powers are often developed which had otherwise remained dormant . In proof of this , it may be observed that , while in a small college , well managed , there is perhaps a less proportion of very inferior scholars , there are none who reach so high a degree of attainment , or exhibit powers so well developed , as when higher honors , arrived at by a sharper competition , await the successful aspiraiit . A large institution of learning also gives its tuembers an opportunity of forming an extensive acquaintance and numerous friendships  --  a great advantage to yonng @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the benefit resulting from bringing together so many individuals of different creeds . Men learn forbearance and charity by being in constant intercourse with others , whose religious opinions differ from their own . Extremes of opinion are corrected* // and unkind feelings suppressed . That religious body which fears to trust its young men , after the ordinary course of religious instruction is completed , among those of different creeds , must either have little faith in the power of truth , or some misgivings whether its own creed is founded in truth . There is a period in life when the careful parent would wish his son to be under the influence of those whose religious belief was the same as his own ; but the time will come when the son must think and act for himself , and this will be quite as soon as he is fitted to withstand the temptations of college life . But what is to be done with the tyro who has completed his preparation at the grammar school , or at the academy , and is yet too young to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advantage of good instruction are prepared for college at fifteen ; how are they to spend the next three years ? The ans*ver is easy . XVe have only to extend the sphere of the preparatory schools ; we have only to put the college tutors into the grammar schools to exercise their vocation there , and the difficulty is at once removed . The two lower classes in all our colleges are mostly taught by tutors . It requires no great attainments-no extraordinary ability , to instruct in grammar and pure mathematics ; and little else is taught in the lower classes in college . Accuracy and thoroughness is all that is required . A cursory examination of the course of studies , published in the catalogues of the several colleges , will show that there is nothing in the studies of the first two years which could not be taught as well in an ordinary academy . It requires no great collections of books , and philosophical apparatus , and minerals , and geological specimens , to aid either pupil or teacher , in algebra , geometry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first two years of the college course . If a lad is prepared for the Freshman class at fifteen , he can be prepared for the Junior class at seventeen ; or what would be better , he could spend one or two years in the study of the modern languages , or in healthful , invigorating exercise , and enter that class at eighteen or nineteen , and have three chances to one of graduating  --  a better scholar at twenty-one , than if he had spent the whole time in college . If it be thought that the preparatory schools are not in a condition to carry students so far forward in their studies , we have only to say , that if the demand for a higher grade of instruction in these schools is made to exist , the supply will not long be wanting . Let the same price be paid for tuition which is charged in the colleges , and able teachers will soon be found to take charge of them . These schools , situated mostly in small villages , with a limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be free from most of the objections urged against colleges . Idleness can be prevented by the discipline of the school-room , and any vicious or improl ) er conduct can he speedily discovered and properly punished . The students , distributed among the families in the vicinity , and kept under the restraints of domestic life , have neither the opportunity nor the temptation to operate together for improper purposes . Two well qualified instructors could take care of from forty to fifty boys in such a school , and could afford to labor for a compensation much smaller than in a larger town , where the expenses of living are greater . In the large towns , where such schools can be supported by the local patronage , the parent has the additional advantage of having his son at home at the same time . The expense is much diminished by this circumstance , and he can superintend the moral education of his son , and urge him on in his studies by motives which filial affection will render doubly powerful. - The diminished expense might also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the education of their sons , and thus raise the standard of scholarship in the colleges themselves . Were we to dra*v out a plan for the education of a boy , designed for one of the learned professions , it would be something like the folloxving : - Let his education be begun in the common public school , where he would meet with all classes of boys and all descriptions of character . To guard his moral feelings from contamination , let him be allowed and encouraged to relate at home whatever he sees and hears among his play-fellows , and let his parents approve or disapprove as the case may require . Let him thus early become acquainted with the distinction between right and wrong , good and evil , and taught to cherish the one arid avoid the other . He will thus acquire a hardihood of character , a power over his own desires , and a strength of purpose and of will far superior to the boy who has been kept out of harm 's way , and furnished with a private tutor to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline of a large school , composed of boys of every shade of character , is useful to break the will to rightful authority , and cultivate patience and fortitude under evils which must be borne for the sake of after benefit . He who fears to trust his son among the poor boys of the common school , and therefore sends to a select school , patronized only by the rich , should remember that the rich have their peculiar views as well as the poor , and that the effeminacy and peevishness of the spoiled children of fortune are quite as contagious , and more disastrous in their effects upon the character , than the rude manners , and harsh , blunt passions of the sons of poverty . At the age of twelve or thirteen we may suppose the lad to have completed the studies of the common school , and to he ready to enter upon a higher course of instruction . If , then , he can enter a higher school without leaving the paternal roog let him begin the study of the ancient languages. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands constantly at his elbow , to remove every difficulty in his way , and think for him as well as iiistruct him . Let the powers of his mind be taxed as much as they can bear without discouragement ; and let him not only be encouraged , but compelled to think for himself . Large schools have this one advantage over small onesthe teacher has not the time to aid the scholars in their lessons , and they are under the necessity of depending upon themselves . When the boy arrives at that period of life when the stature is rapidly increasing , , let him not be kept too constantly at his books . If , then , he can spend a year or two in some employment which requires considerable physical effort , he will be benefited thereby . When the energies of the system are being expanded upon the increase of the bodily frame , the brain should not be too severely taxed . Then let the muscles , and all the organs of the rapidly increasing body , be strengthened and invigorated by cheerful exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right description in the vicinity , let not the parent , in his haste to finish the education of his son , be induced to send him away from home before he has arrived at an age when he can be relied on to take care of himself , under the advice and direction of judicious friends ; and when he arrives at that age , which is seldom under fourteen or fifteen , let him be sent to some quiet village academy-not to be placed at board with the principal , among a horde of other boys , but in some well ordered family , where the domestic influence may still be felt , and his responsibility to the domestic circle continue to be insisted upon. - The quiet influence of evenings spent at the fireside of a virtuous family , is far more effective than all the restraints and guards resorted to in the best regulated boarding-schools. // A youth of good talents thus educated , might , at the age of 18 or 19 , he a proficient in the grammars of the ancient languages-be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tolerable correctness. - lie might also have mastered the usual course of pure mathematics-made some progress in the modern languages , arid stored his memory with the leading events of history . Then entering college , and placiug himself under the guidance of accomplished instructors , he would be prepared to appreciate the higher beauties of the classics  --  to enter to advantage upon the study of natural philosophy and metaphysics , and profit by the lectures and more practical studies of the last two years of the college course.
