ARGUMENT . Semiramis , a descendant from the Kings of Egypt , founder of Babylon , and afterwards Queen of the Assyrians , in her early youth had been beloved by Assur , of the family of Belus , and his love for her had met with a corresponding esteem . Being , however ambitious , she was married afterwards to Ninus a descendant of Balus , king of Phenicia , of whom she had a child called Ninia . Assur afterwards made her believe that it was Ninus ' intention to send her away from his bed and throne , and Semiramis , who otherwise could ill brook either a companion , or a check to her absolute will , of a warlike temper , and already conqueror of so many nations which she had made tributaries to her , yielded to the solicitations of Assur , and prepared herself the poison which Assur administered to Ninus at a banquet . Ninus having discovered before his death the treason of his wife and Assur , and fearing for the life of Ninia his child , left him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Belus , and charged that he should be taken to Memphis , under the name of Arasce , where he , at maturer age , became the Commander in Chief of the armies of the vast Scythian Empire . Ninus sent to Memphis his crown , his sword , and a papirus which related the high treason , and secured for his son the succession to the throne on his coming of age . Assur seeking for royal away , had searched for Ninia to kill him , but neither Semiramis nor himself having succeeded in tracing him , it was thought that he had perished . Azzema , a Princess and descendant of the family of Belus , was the heir to the throne , and beloved by Arasace who had saved her honor and her life . Assur to be sure of the throne , was also a pretendant , and Idrenus wished also to marry her . What happened at Babylon on the day appointed for the choice of Azzema 's husband , and successor to the throne , is the subject of this drama .
