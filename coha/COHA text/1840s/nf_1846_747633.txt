txt LIKE the common law of this country , which is based on that of England , the Rules of Order in our deliberative assemblies , are rnainly derived from those of the mother country . Our national Congress , ( with many modifications , however , ) have adopted all the rules for conducting business in Parliament , applicable to our republican institutions and form of government , and , in the absence of any special laws of order , those laid down in Jefferson 's Manual , which are a digest of those of the British Legislature , are considered good authority . Our State Legislatures copy , in general , the principal rules of order adopted in Congress . The States , however , differ , very essentially , in many particulars , although in all , the rules of the two houses of Congress may be con- /z/ sidered as the basis of their several forms of proceeding . For Societies , Boards of Managers , Town Meetings , and the business meetings of local institutions in general , no fixed rules have ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence a great want of uniformity in the arrangement and mode of conducting the details of business , is apparent among us . Presiding officers , with some knowledge of legislative rules , find no difficulty in managing a meeting , because they bring this knowledge to bear ; but those deficient in this particular , labor under great difficulty , and are constantly liable to serious embarrassment , especially should there be any among those over whom they preside , disposed to be troublesome or captious . The mode of conducting a business meeting for a Society , and the rules necessary for its government , are , in themselves , entirely simple and easily comprehended ; but as they are not clearly expressed in any Legislative Manual , some study is necessary before they can be properly understood , and promptly and efficiently applied . And /z/ while it is scarcely possible that any individual , possessing ordinary experience and good common sense , will be at a loss in satisfactorily directing the business of a meeting , yet , it is evident , that with some knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , greater facility will be possessed by the Chairman , and a degree of regularity , propriety and dignity , given to the doings of a meeting , not to be hoped for under less favorable circumstances . Uniformity of proceeding can never be obtained while every presiding officer is allowed to decide questions of order according to his own will , or on the mere ground of temporary expediency . Invariably the object of a meeting is , or should be , to obtain a free , full and unbiassed expression of opinion ; and to secure this , the rights and privileges of both officers and members , majorities and minorities , must be properly guarded . Rules of order have been found necessary to promote these ends , and hence their adoption in all deliberative assemblies . Without such rules , the influence of a pre- /z/ siding officer , which is very great , or the pertinacity of a popular member or members , in advocating a favorite scheme , might wholly frustrate the real object of a meeting , and render its proceedings altogether nugatory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry out the true purposes of a meeting , as to protect the rights of every member . The deficiency heretofore felt in this particular , it is now , with much diffidence , proposed to supply in this publication . The rules for conducting business here laid down , are based upon those in use in legislative bodies , with such suggestions , modifications and alterations , as appear to be necessary to make them applicable to the purposes intended . The leading objects are to relieve presiding officers from embarrassment , to give greater facility in the transaction of business , to economize time , and to produce uniformity and impartiality in the government of societies and meetings and if these should be in any degree promoted , the design of this work will be fully accomplished . /z/ The usage is now well established that no anonymous call for a Town or Ward meeting , is entitled to any attention whatever , from discreet and sober-minded citizens . Every call should have one or more signatures , or the endorsement of some committee , in order that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call emanates . The call should also state , in brief but explicit terms , the object of the meeting . Vagueness in this matter sometimes leads to serious difficulty . A call for a meeting of citizens " on the Oregon Question , " would give any one , whether in favor or otherwise of possessing Oregon , the right to be present , although the authors of the call might have intended it to embrace those only in favor of claiming the whole of that territory . So also , with a call for a meeting " to consider the expediency of abolishing the Death Penalty , " which phraseology opens the door to those who sustain capital /z/ punishment , as well as to those who oppose it . The words " friendly to , " or " opposed to , " are generally sufficient to render the whole matter clearly understood . Very many meetings in this city have been rendered entirely abortive , and many converted into scenes of confusion and disorder , from the want of proper attention to these particulars . 1 . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears on the call of the meeting , should open the business , by nominating a Chairman , as follows : " Gentlemen , as the hour designated for this meeting has arrived , I propose that we proceed to organize , and beg leave to nominate Mr. , as Chairman . " This motion , being seconded , he will immediately proceed : " It is moved and seconded that Mr. take the chair gentlemen in favor of that motion will please to say l aye ' " and , ( after a short pause , ) c those of the contrary opinion will please to say @#@ no . ' " If the ayes are a majority , he will add , " the motion is agreed to Mr. will please lake the chair . " /z/ 2 . The Chairman thus chosen will immediately proceed to the stand , and say : " The meeting will please come to order will the meeting nominate a Secretary ? " Some other individual , who has also been f. prominent in calling the meeting , will then nominate a Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon these nominations the Chairman will put the question as follows : " Gentlemen , you have heard the nominations just made shall these gentlemen be your Secretaries ? As many as are in favor , say ' aye , ' contrary opinion , ' no . ' " If the ayes prevail , as is almost always the case , he will declare the gentlemen to be chosen , and invite them to take their seats at the desk . In case Vice Presidents are appointed , they should be nominated previous to , or in connection with the Secretaries . When the business of a meeting is thus opened , it rarely happens that any opposition is made to the regular nominations for officers . All opposers may safely be set down as disorganizes , as the right to nominate officers clearly rests with those who called the meeting . Upon them rests the // responsibility and expense , and to them belongs the honor of commencing the proceedings , and of opening the way for business . 3 . The meeting being thus organized , the Chairman will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting , as published in the papers or in handbills , which he will read , or cause to be read by the Secretary . Or , he may , at his option , instead of reading the call , verbally offer some remarks explanatory of the objects of the meeting . Either course is strictly in order . This being done , the Chairman will say , " the meeting is now organized , and ready to proceed to business . " 4 . The proper course is then for some individual , who has been designated for that duty by the persons who called the meeting , to rise and say " Mr. Chairman I move that a committee be appointed to draft resolutions for the action of the meeting , " or , " expressive of the sense of the meeting . " The motion being seconded , the Chairman will , after asking if the meeting " is ready for the question , " put the question in the manner before mentioned . If the motion prevails , /z/ the Chairman will say " the motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many shall the committee consist ? " Some member of the meeting will then probably nominate " three , " perhaps another " five , " and another " seven . " The custom is to take the question on the highest number first . If that does not prevail , the Chairman will proceed with the next highest , and so on until the meeting agrees to a certain number . If only one number be named , and that number be five , the Chairman will say : " The number five has been named , and as no other number is mentioned , the committee will consist of five . " 5 . The Chairman should then ask : " How shall the committee be appointed will the meeting nominate ? " If those present desire to name the committee , they will then nominate , and when the number is filled up , and the names read off by the Secretary , the Chairman will say , " Shall these gentlemen be your committee 7 " If no objection be offered , he will add u @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , however , in forming committees , is , /z/ for several voices to say , " the Chair will appoint , " whereupon the Chairman will ask , " Is it the pleasure of the meeting that the Chair appoint the committee ? " If no objection be made , he will then , himself , select and announce the committee . 6 . It is customary to place the gentleman who makes a motion , as the first on the committee , it being understood that he will act as its chairman . Any other course is calculated to give offence , and I have known such an omission regarded as a personal affront . If the gentleman so named , or any other appointed on the committee , does not wish to serve , he may decline . In such cases it is usual for the gentleman to assign his reasons , whereupon the presiding officer asks , " Shall the gentleman be excused ? " and if no serious objection be made , he will declare him excused , and appoint another in his place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise committees , involving labor and trouble , unless they are willing to share that labor and trouble themselves . 7 . When the committee is announced , /z/ the gentleman first named will go to the Secretary 's table , and obtain a copy of the names of his colleagues , and request them to accompany him to an adjoining room , or some contiguous place . During the absence of the committee , it is usual to call upon some well known speaker to address the meeting . When the committee have agreed upon a report , they should immediately return , and the chairman should place himself near the President , and in view of the person speaking , who will most probably bring his remarks to a close , as soon as he finds the committee returned and prepared to report . The moment he ceases , the chairman of the committee will address the presiding officer of the meeting , and say : " Mr. Chairman the committee appointed to prepare resolutions , have instructed me to report the following , " and then hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them himself . The Chairman will receive the resolutions and say , " the committee appointed to prepare resolutions report the following they will be read , " and then direct the Secretary to read them . After /z/ being read , he will continue , " the resolutions are before the meeting will the meeting consider them separately or altogether I " Most probably members will say " separately , " whereupon the Chairman will say " the resolutions will be considered separately the first resolution is before the meeting . " Some gentleman will then rise to speak , or to move that it be adopted . In the former case , the Chairman will say , " Mr. , " naming him in the latter case , he will say , " it is moved and seconded that the resolution be adopted is the meeting ready for the question ? " If no one rises , after pausing a moment or two , he will put the question in the following manner : " As many as are in favor of the adoption of the resolution will please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ' no . ' " Should the ayes appear to preponderate , he will say , " the ayes appear to have it , " and if no one calls for a division , he will continue , " the ayes have it the resolution is agreed to . " 8 . Should a division be called for any time previous to the result being declared by the /z/ Chairman , he will say " a division is called for gentleman in the affirmative will please rise . " He should then direct the Secretary to count the number standing , and when this is done , and the number reported to him , he will say " forty- four gentlemen are up , " supposing that to be the number , and then request those up to be seated , afterwards pursuing a similar course with those in the negative . If the Chairman is in serious doubt himself , as to the preponderance of voices , he may announce to the meeting that " it is impossible for the Chair to decide , " and then request the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most of our Town and Ward meetings it is now the usual custom to have the resolutions prepared beforehand , and this is decidedly the better plan . In this case , and when the appointment of a committee is not desired , the gentleman who may be charged with the duty of offering them , will rise and submit them immediately after the Chairman announces that " the meeting is organized , and ready to proceed to business . " 10 . The resolutions , of course , constitute the real business of a meeting , although very /z/ many political meetings are called on the eve of every important election , not so much to do business , as to hear the remarks of distinguished speakers . And in many instances , the meeting is no sooner organized than great clamor and confusion ensue , by calling for this or that individual to address the meeting . In most cases , however , it is better to have the resolutions presented before the speaking commences , for if they be kept back until late , they are often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digested . In meetings not of a political character , the resolutions , which are usually introduced with some remarks by the gentleman who presents them , often elicit much interesting discussion , so as to be kept before the meeting during the whole session. * 11 . When a resolution before the meeting contains a blank , that should be filled before the question is taken on the resolution . To fill up a blank is precisely the same as to make an amendment , excepting that when several suggestions are made as /z/ to number and time , it is usual to take the question , first on the highest number , the largest sum and the longest time. * 12 . When resolutions are prefaced by a preamble , the question is not taken on the preamble , until the resolutions are disposed of . Should all the resolutions be negatived , the preamble falls to the ground , and is not acted upon at all . 13 . In the progress of a meeting , when a speaker has concluded , and a resolution is pending , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question is upon the resolution is the meeting ready for the question ? " This will either bring up another speaker , or a call for the " question . " In the latter case , the Chairman , unless interrupted by some one rising to speak , will proceed to take the sense of the meeting on the resolution . In public meetings of citizens it is not usual to force a question until all have spoken who desire to speak . To call for the " question , " while any one is speaking , is usually con- /z/ sidered an act of great rudeness , but this course is sometimes adopted , by a wearied audience , to get rid of an uninteresting speaker . 14 . Sometimes the resolutions submitted by a gentleman , or a committee , are not satisfactory , and require modification and a careful revision . If the matter can not be reached by amendment , it is entirely in order to refer them to a committee , or to recommit with instructions . A resolution , however , may be withdrawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it belongs to the meeting . 15 . As soon as the resolution is adopted , and so announced , the Chairman , if no other business immediately offers , should say , " There is no business before the meeting . " This opens an opportunity to those present , to introduce fresh propositions for the consideration of the meeting . 16 . In other than political meetings it is not customary to allow a speaker to occupy the floor , unless he rises to speak on a resolution already offered , or prefaces his remarks by stating that he intends to offer /z/ one . Much greater latitude in this matter is usually allowed in a Town meeting than would be tolerated in a well regulated Society . It not unfrequently happens that gentlemen are really desirous of reaching a certain point , but are much at a loss as to the proper mode . In such cases a desultory debate , if permitted , will often elicit an idea that will serve as a starting point , and relieve the meeting from its embarrassment . 17 . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman , elicits no further resolutions or motions , it is usual to provide for the publication of the proceedings and then to adjourn. 18 . A motion to adjourn , or a motion to adjourn sine die , must be decided without debate . A motion to adjourn to a certain time , is debatable , and may be amended as regards the time named. * * The form of a resolution to adjourn to a day certain , is as follows : " Resolved , that when this meeting adjourns , it will adjourn to meet again , on , " naming the time and place . When this is considered and agreed to , it is usually followed by the simple motion to adjourn , which , having been put and carried , the Chairman will declare that " the meeting stands adjourned until , " naming the time . /z/ t /z/ In public meetings or anniversaries of a religious or a benevolent character , the custom in regard to resolutions is essentially different from that laid down in the foregoing . In these meetings it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present a report of the past year 's proceedings , which is read by the Secretary , or the chairman of the Executive Board . After this the resolutions are brought forward singly , by different gentlemen present . A gentleman will rise , address the Chair , offer his resolution , and proceed with his remarks . When he has concluded , another speaker will rise and say , " Mr. President , I second the resolution just offered , " and then go on with his address . On the conclusion of his remarks , the President will say , " The following resolution has been moved and seconded , it will be read by the Secretary , " and being so read , the Chairman , finding the meeting prepared for a vote , proceeds to put the question . This course is pursued with all the principal resolutions offered . /z/ This is a beautiful mode of doing business , and prevails , very generally , at all large anniversary meetings in England , as well as in this country . The plan affords an excellent opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and greatly adds to the interest of a meeting . To carry out this design in the most effective manner , it is necessary that all the business proposed to be acted upon , should be arranged some time before the meeting . Those expected to address the meeting , should be furnished , some time in advance , with a copy of the resolution upon which they are desired to speak . It is exceedingly improper to defer this matter until the speaker is upon the platform , as without some previous knowledge of the particular point assigned him , he may find himself almost wholly at a loss , the current of his thoughts having taken another direction . This caution is also necessary in order to prevent two speakers from falling into the same train of argument . Sometimes the committee of arrangement request speakers to prepare resolutions for themselves . /z/ When these matters are previously arranged , it is customary to have the order of exercises , resolutions , names of speakers , &c.,; printed on a slip , and distributed among the meeting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very much the same as that of a Town Meeting , excepting that the first organization is generally temporary . After this is effected , it is usual to appoint a committee to nominate permanent officers , and another to examine and report on the credentials of the members . In the appoint* ment of these committees , the Chairman will , of course , be particular to name no delegate whose seat is , or likely to be , contested . Such an appointment might lead to serious difficulty . The Convention being permanently organized , it may be expedient to appoint a " committee to report what business is proper to be brought before the delegates , " or " to prepare resolutions for the action of /z/ the convention . " Where , however , the object of the Convention is especially defined , as in the case of political delegations to nominate a ticket , this course is altogether unnecessary , and the members at once proceed to enter upon their duties , in the usual manner . In all large bodies of this character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless it comes through the hands of a committee . The general rules of order laid down in this work , will , it is believed , be found amply sufficient in the way of direction , to meet any contingency that may arise . When the seat of a delegate is disputed , it is usual , when the matter has been fairly brought before the convention by committee or otherwise , to allow him to be heard , in support of his right . After he has spoken he should immediately withdraw , until his claim is decided , or , if permitted by a vote of the convention to remain , he should take no part whatever in the deliberations or vote , until he is regularly declared a member . In State Conventions it is usual to adopt , /z/ as rules of order , those which govern our State Legislature . All the essential features of these rules will be found explained in this work . /z/ SOCIETY , BOARD OF MANAGERS , &c.; Promptly at the time named in the notice issued for the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of permitting a delay , or allowing " grace , " as it is called , is rapidly falling into disuse . No efficient Presiding officer will ever suffer it , unless , indeed , it is rendered unavoidable by the want of a sufficient number to form a quorum , but even in this case it is better to proceed with the preliminary steps necessary for an organization . In Town and Ward meetings , a delay of a few minutes , after the arrival of the time appointed , is sometimes * Most Societies have a Vice President , to act in the absence of the President , and who , for the time being , is clothed with the President 's authority . In all other cases he has no other privileges than those of any other member . /z/ rendered necessary , but it should never be suffered in a well-regulated Society . 1 . The President , on taking the chair , will say , " The meeting will please come to order . The Secretary will call the roll . " In small bodies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the members , and if a quorum* be present , to announce the fact , and proceed with business , dispensing with roll call . In other cases , the Secretary having called the roll , reports to the President the number present . Should there not be a quorum , proceedings are necessarily suspended . The most general usage is , to wait for half an hour , " ) " and then , if still deficient in the requisite number , to adjourn ; and in this case , unless a special meeting is regularly called in the mean time , the adjournment will be until the next stated meeting . * If there be no law on the subject , a majority of the whole number of the members is necessary to constitute a quorum . t This delay , however , is longer than should be allowed , in justice to the members who are punctual . In some corporations only five minutes are allowed . Perhaps fifteen minutes would be more reasonable . In all cases this matter should be clearly settled by a provision in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the President will say , " There is a quorum of members present the Secretary will read the minutes of the last meeting . " * 3 . The minutes of the previous meeting having been read , the President will say , " The members have heard read the minutes of the last meeting unless there be objection offered , they will be considered as approved . " If no objection be made , after pausing a moment or two , he will add , " the minutes are approved . " It is the custom of many presiding officers formally to take the question on the adoption of the minutes , but this is altogether unnecessary . The minutes being a fair transcript of the doings of the previous meeting , are supposed to be correct , and if so , must be approved , as a matter of course . It is only in case of error that a motion is necessary , and if any be detected , a member should rise and move that it be correct - * The absence of the Secretary from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not prevent those who are constitutionally assembled from transacting business , although what is done will necessarily be attended with some inconvenience . /z/ ed . Any dispute respecting the actual existence of an error , may be settled by a motion . After being corrected , the President will say , " Shall the minutes , as corrected , be approved ? " And if no further objections be made , he will declare the minutes approved. * Sometimes gentlemen who are dissatisfied with some action of the previous meeting , will move to amend by striking out the objectionable passages from the minutes , but all such motions are out of order . No motion to amend the minutes can be received , unless * With a good Secretary , errors in the minutes will rarely occur . Sometimes , however , on a press of motions , and the hurry of business , they are unavoidable . When clearly apparent , no Secretary should hesitate for a moment about yielding to the correction , even though at the expense of defacing his Record book . Accuracy in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the custom to have the minutes read , just previous to the adjournment of the meeting at which they are taken . The object is , that if any mistake has been recorded , it may be corrected while the matter is fresh in the minds of the members , and before the minutes are recorded on the Secretary 's book . This is a very excellent custom . When a Society has more than one Secretary , the first named is usually the acting officer . /z/ it have reference to the correction of an error in the minutes as recorded and read . 4 . The President will then say , " the first business in order is to receive letters , petitions , or communications have gentlemen any to present ? " Any member having a communication to offer , will then rise in his place , and say , " Mr. President , " and then pause until he secures the attention of the Presiding officer , who will say , as soon as he perceives the member on his feet , " Mr. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he should then proceed : " I have been requested to present a communication , relating to , &c.,"; giving a very brief and succinct statement of its character , after which he will hand the communication to the President . The Presiding * The order in which business is taken up , varies in different institutions . The arrangement here offered prevails in very many societies and institutions , and for various reasons is believed to be the most convenient . t In Congress and in our State Legislature , the Speaker , instead of naming the gentleman on the floor , says , " the member from " naming the state or county he represents . This plan may be pursued in all other bodies where the members appear in the capacity of representatives . /z/ officer , on receiving the paper , should say : " A communication is presented relating to , &c.,"; repeating its character . " It will be read , " and then hand it to the Secretary . The reading of communications is a matter of business never objected to by members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its language or character ; but such communications should never be presented , and it is unquestionably the duty of a member to guard himself and his associates on this point , by knowing something of the character of the paper he offers . The communication having been read , the President asks , " What order shall be taken on this communication ? " A motion from some member then becomes necessary . If the matter is one that requires deliberation , it may be referred to a committee , or postponed for the present , to be taken up in a subsequent part of the meeting for discussion . In this case , some member will rise and say , " I move that it be postponed for the present , " which motion being /z/ seconded , * the President says , " It is moved and seconded that the communication be postponed for the present as many as are in favor of that motion will please say 4 aye , ' those of the contrary opinion will please say ' no . ' " If the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ayes are in a majority , he will say " the ayes appear to have it , " and then pause for a moment or two , to give any who doubts , the privilege of calling for a division , or for the yeas and nays.f If no one objects , he will proceed ; u the ayes have it the motion is agreed to . " This is the ordinary mode of putting all questions , although in many cases , where the expression of opinion is pretty much all on one side of the question , the President * In small bodies it is not usual for the President to wait for a seconder , it being understood that he seconds all motions and resolutions himself . Such also is the usage in the Select Council of this city . The President , however , is not obliged , unless he sees proper so to do , to take any notice of a motion unless it be seconded . t A division may be taken on the call of one member , but to take the yeas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or made by two members . In Congress , the yeas and nays are not called unless the motion is seconded by onefifth of the members present . /z/ instead of saying , " the ayes appear to have it , " will say , " the ayes have it . " A division may be called for by any one member any time before the final result is declared by the President . In that case he will say : " A division is called for gentlemen in favor of the motion will please rise and remain standing until they are counted . " He will then direct the Secretary to count the number standing , and when that is ascertained and reported to him , ( or he may count them himself , ) request those up to take their seats , and pursue a similar course with those in the negative on the question . Whenever possible , it is undoubtedly the best course to make a final disposition of all communications at once , in order to prevent business from accumulating too rapidly on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is usual for him to annoirnra thp.m after frp. has received those a from the members 5 . The President will then say , " The next business in order is reports from Standing Committees has the Committee on /z/ , " naming the first committee on the list , " any report to offer ? " The Chairman of that committee , or in his absence , one of the members , will then rise and say : " Mr. President , the Committee on have instructed me to make the following report , " handing it to the President . The President , on receiving it , should say : " a report is received from the Committee on . The report will be read . " All reports should terminate with a resolution . This is the unvarying custom in Legislative bodies , and in all Societies and institutions of the higher class . If the report merely embraces matter for the information of the Society , and requires no special action , the resolution may be as follows /z/ " Resolved That the committee be discharged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report having been read , the President will say : " What order will the meeting take on the resolution attached to the report ? " Some member may then move that it be adopted , or that it be postponed for the /z/ present , and the resolution is thus brought up for the immediate action of the members . In some Societies , after a report has been read , it is usual to make a motion to accept or adopt it , but this is altogether unnecessary , unless the reception of the report is objected to . It is the recommendations of the committee , as embraced in their resolutions , rather than the report itself , that are the proper subjects for the action of the meeting . The report , however , if objectionable or unsatisfactory , may be recommited , by a motion to that effect , with or without instruction , or , on leave given , before action has been had upon it , it may be withdrawn by the committee . It has long been a subject of inquiry whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . General usage is unquestionably against the measure . After a close examination of the decisions in our State Legislature , I have been enabled to find but one instance in which it was exercised . Mr. Sutherland , however , is clearly of opinion that the House have as much right to amend a report , as a resolu- /z/ tion or a bill . Mr. Gushing also adopts this opinion . A more courteous plan , doubtless , is to recommit with instructions . If the Committee have no report to offer , the chairman should say : " Mr. President , the Committee on have no report to make at this time , " which announcement the President should repeat , and then pass to the committee next in order . Should a committee not be unanimous in opinion , and those in the minority be desirous of placing their views before the meeting , the matter should be introduced immediately after the majority report has been read . A member will then move that " the report and resolution thereto attached be postponed for the present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report . " If this motion prevails , as is almost always the case , the minority report will be immediately presented , received and read . It is then in order , on motion , to take up for consideration the resolution attached to either of the reports . If the minority are not prepared to report , a motion may be made to postpone the ma- /z/ jority report until the next meeting , in order to enable the minority to get their report ready. * 6 . When all the Standing Committees have been called over , the President will call for reports from Special Committees , which will be disposed of in like manner . If a Special Committee , previously instructed to report at a specified day , have not been able to complete their labors , the chairman should say , " Mr. President , the Special Committee on , not having had sufficient time to complete their investigations , report progress , and ask to be continued " This should be repeated by the President , who will ask , " Shall the Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will add , " The Committee will be continued . " When a Special Committee desires to be discharged without making a written report , the chairman , when that committee is called * Mr. Onslow , at one time speaker of the House of Commons , justly remarked , that a check on the actions of the majority , and protection to the minority against the attempts of power , can only be secured by close attention to the rules of proceeding . /z/ upon , should state the reasons verbally , and then move for its discharge himself . It is not usual to record upon the minutes , at length , the reports of committees . Such a course , in some Societies , would involve the Secretary in an immense amount of labor . The most general usage is simply to state that " the Committee on , through Mr. , chairman , made a report , accompanied with the following resolution , " and then to insert the resolution , and the action of the meeting upon it . All reports and documents should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of presentation , and filed among the Secretary 's papers . In some cases , however , a report may embrace very important matters , which the members may desire to have immediately before them . All such should , by a motion , be directed to be entered upon the minutes . 7 . The reports of committees being all received , the President will call for the Treasurer 's report , which , if presented , he will direct the Secretary to read . In some Societies which meet monthly , the Treasurer 's /z/ report is made quarterly or semi-annually . The President should be careful to remember the proper time , so that if the Treasurer has been neglectful , he may be reminded of his duty . When the report has been read , the President , without a motion , will direct it to be handed to the auditors , entered on the minutes , filed , or otherwise disposed of , as the by-laws may direct . Too much attention can not be paid to the financial affairs of a Society , and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business man . Frequent reports from this officer , so that the members may be kept constantly advised of the state of the Treasury , are not only desirable , but almost essential to the prosperity of any institution , no matter what its character . 8 . The next order to be announced by the President , is " to take up unfinished business , " which includes all resolutions left under consideration , and all reports and communications " postponed for the present , " or not finally disposed of at previous meetings . If the previous meeting adjourned while debat- /z/ ing a resolution , the President should declare that resolution to be first in order . The member speaking at the adjournment , if he gave way to a motion to adjourn , is again entitled to the floor , and should be so informed by the President 's saying , " Mr. is entitled to the floor . " If the previous meeting did not adjourn while debating a resolution , any item of unfinished business may be taken up , on motion . The proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all items of unfinished business , on a slip immediately before him , which he should read over , when this order in the business is reached . The President may then ask , " Is it the pleasure of the meeting to take up for consideration the first item ? " and if no objection be made , he will declare it to be before the members . If it is deemed preferable first to consider some other item , it is necessary to make a motion to postpone the first item , for the purpose of proceeding to the consideration of another , which may be named . 9 . Unfinished business having been gone /z/ through with , or continued over , the President will say , u New business is now in order . " This is the proper time for offering original resolutions , for moving for the appointment of committees , or increasing the number of members on any already existing , for proposing or electing new members to the Society , and for the transaction of any other business not elsewhere provided for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " Mr. President , I beg leave to offer the following resolution , " which , after reading , he will hand to the Chair . The resolution being seconded , the President will say , " The following resolution has been moved and seconded it will be read by the Secretary , " and being so read , he will continue , " the meeting has heard the resolution are gentlemen ready for the question ? " If no one rises to speak , the question will then be taken at once . * Resolutions are , in this state , almost invariably prefaced by the word " Resolved . " In the Eastern States the term is " Voted ? In many religious bodies the initiatory word is " Ordered . " Hatsell says : - " When the House commands , it is by ' an order . ' But facts , principles , their own opinions and purposes , are expressed in the form of resolutions . " /z/ Legislative bodies make a marked distinction between resolutions and motions . The former are presumed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the clerk , require a motion to " proceed to a second reading and consideration . " Motions are of minor character , and relate generally to order in taking up business , or to some preparatory movements necessary for business . These do not require a second reading . In Societies all resolutions must be put in writing , at the request of the President , or of any member , but this course is not necessary in regard to motions . Sometimes it is very desirable , at the commencement of a meeting , to change the order of business , in order speedily to reach a particular matter that requires prompt attention . This can always be effected by a majority , or by two-thirds , as may be laid down in the by-laws , concurring in opinion as to the expediency. 10 . When any cessation occurs in business , the President should say , " There is no business before the meeting . " This will /z/ elicit either new business or a motion to adjourn . A motion to adjourn , is , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few , that I shall notice them all in this place . 1 . A motion to adjourn can not be received while a member has the floor . The member , however , may be asked to give way , in order that the motion may be made , and if he complies , the motion can be received . 2 . A motion to adjourn can not be received while the yeas and nays are being called , or the members are voting on any question . 3 . A motion to adjourn can not be received if it immediately follows a similar motion just negatived . If a proposition be made , however , intervening , and any debate ensues upon it , the motion is in order , even though the proposition be not acted upon or withdrawn . A meeting is not adjourned , until so declared by the President . In the Senate of the United States , it is a breach of order for a member to leave his seat , until the ad- /z/ journment is formally announced by the Presiding officer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have gone somewhat into detail , yet I have noticed no proceedings that are not usual at almost every meeting . Observations on less familiar questions , and decisions on peculiar and interesting points of order , will be found under subsequent heads . /z/ An adjourned meeting is regarded simply as a continuation of a former meeting , and after roll call , * the business should be resumed , the same as if no adjournment had taken place . The President should , however , announce the business , and if it be the further consideration of a proposition or resolution , state it , or direct it to be read . At special meetings , the business for /z/ which the meeting was convened , is first in order , after roll call . After that business has been disposed of , any other matter may be taken up , a majority assenting . In all practicable cases the object of a special meeting should be stated in the call , and endorsed on the notice . /z/ The office of President is one of much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , application and energy , should accept it . The President is the master moving-spirit , and , by his zeal and efforts , may give animation and vigor to the whole Society , or by his supineness and neglect , thwart the most active exertions of his associates . His duties are of high importance , and should be well understood , and promptly and cheerfully discharged . 1 . It is not usually expected of the President to serve on committees , but this does not exonerate him from seeing that all the committees are attending to their duties . /z/ By virtue of his office , he is made , in many Societies , a member of all committees , and may attend their meetings , take part in their deliberations , ( without voting , however , ) and urge them to action . He should never omit to call over each committee at every stated meeting . 2 . The President should see that all the officers attend to their respective duties that financial and other reports are ready to be presented at the proper time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Constitution and Bylaws are properly enforced , and not allowed to remain a dead letter . 3 . He should carefully watch the state of the finances , see that proper efforts are made for the collection of the Society 's revenue , from dues , fines , and other sources , and caution the members , when necessary , against imprudence in expenditures. 4 . In meetings , he should take the chair punctually at the proper time ; announce all business ; receive and submit all proper motions , petitions , reports and communications ; put the vote as soon as the meeting /z/ is ready ; enforce order and decorum in debate ; decide promptly all questions of order ; decide promptly who is to speak , when two or more members rise at the same moment ; and be careful to see that all business is brought up in its proper order . 5 . He should familiarize himself with decisions on points of order , so as to be able to meet every case likely to arise , and thus avoid the necessity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for decision . The influence of a President is soon weakened , if he exhibits embarrassment in matters of this sort . 6 . Especially should the President carefully watch the members in debate . It is his duty to hear every word that is spoken , and every speaker should have his undivided attention . At the first word of personality or impropriety , he should promptly interfere , and call the speaker to order . Very often members are permitted to go to great lengths in personalities , before they are checked , and then the individual assailed claims the right to reply , so that crimination and recrimination are sure to follow . This /z/ evil should be carefully guarded against , by checking it at its commencement . 7 . The President should ever preserve a courteous and conciliating deportment to all , not overlooking the humblest member . In the appointment of committees , he has many opportunities for bringing humble merit into notice , and of testing and making available the capabilities of those around him . He should carefully avoid both petulance and favoritism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout , show himself deeply interested in the prosperity of the Society . 8 . While the President is thus , in a measure , the director of the Society , he is also its servant . It is his duty to carry out and obey the instructions of the Society ; to authenticate by his signature , when necessary , its proceedings , and to represent , and stand for the members , whenever and whereever the Society is required to appear as a unit . 9 . In small bodies it is not usual for the President to rise when he is putting a question ; but in large Societies or meetings , /z/ while he may read sitting , it is more dignified to stand while taking a vote . 10 . In all ballotings , and on questions upon which the yeas and nays are taken , the President is required to vote , but his name should be called last . In other cases it is not usual for the President to vote , unless the members be equally divided , or unless his vote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal and in case of such equal division , the motion is lost . 11 . Congressional and Legislative usage gives the presiding officer a right to call a member to the chair , in order that he may take the floor , in debate . The practice , how . ever , is not a matter of very frequent occurrence , as in these bodies the Speaker has opportunities for giving his views on every bill , in committee of the whole . /z/ The duties of a Secretary are more mechanical than those of a President , but they are scarcely less important . The office re-/z/ quires a ready writer , and a shrewd , sprightly and intelligent man . A dull , plodding , slow-moving Secretary , is a great drawback upon an efficient President , and a serious hinderance to business . I have known such an association so to distress the presiding officer , as to induce him to undertake , for the time being , the discharge of the duties of both offices at the same time . 1 . In this office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting with his books and papers in perfect order . Every paper likely to be called for , should be so arranged as to admit of being produced the moment it is wanted . He should keep on a loose sheet , or on a page of his memorandum book , a list of all the committees in full , so as to be able to call over the names of the members , without the trouble of searching through many pages of his minute book ; and so also , with items of unfinished business , which he should be able to call over in a moment . 2 . He should be quick in catching the import of motions , and verbal amendments , and prompt in reducing them to writing , in /z/ a proper shape for the action of the meeting . Attention to this particular greatly facilitates the progress of business . 3 . The Secretary 's duties require him to keep a correct account of the members in attendance ; to preserve a faithful record of the doings of the Society ; to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to call and record the yeas and nays , whenever they are required to be called ; and to notify the chairman of each committee of his appointment , giving him a list of his colleagues , and stating the business upon which the committee is to act . 4 . He should keep a list of each member 's address , and correct it from time to time , in case of change or removal , about which he should occasionally inquire ; and be attentive to the issuing of notices of meetings for the members , in seasonable time . 5 . The Secretary 's minute book should be both a journal and a record of proceedings ; although it is not required of that officer to take reports of speeches , or to make records of things merely moved or proposed , and which are subsequently with- /z/ drawn . Every matter of interest , however , and every proposition upon which a vote has been taken , should be carefully and accurately noted . 6 . The Secretary is charged with the custody of many important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's records . These should be carefully guarded , and no paper should be suffered to be taken from his table or his keeping , without a formal vote of the Society . 7 . The Secretary should write a legible hand , and understand punctuation , so as to be able properly to punctuate his records . All motions , resolutions , and items of business , should be in separate paragraphs , that they may be readily discovered and read . Every minute book should have a copious index , or , if this involves too much labor , brief side notes , indicating the subjects in the text , should be placed on every page of the record . 8 . The Secretary is not deprived of the privilege of taking part in the deliberations of a meeting , but , as a general rule , it will perhaps be found that he can serve the So- /z/ ciety quite as efficiently by a rigid attention to business , as by occupying much time on the floor . /z/ The duties appertaining to the office of Treasurer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in detail , according to the character and purposes of the Society . In some they will necessarily be more extended and laborious than in others . To avoid difficulty and misunderstanding , every duty expected of this officer should be specifically laid down in the by-laws. 1 . The Treasurer should be a man of business habits , accustomed to accounts , punctual and correct in his own dealings , and prompt and energetic in attending to the duties of his office . The slightest dereliction in this department produces doubt and mistrust , and is most pernicious to the interests of the institution ; and even a loose and careless mode of keeping accounts , is often almost as great a fault as positive dishonesty . /z/ 2 . The Treasurer is held responsible for all monies paid to him on account of the Society . He should charge himself , in a book kept for the purpose , with all monies so received , carefully noting the date , and the source whence they are derived . He is also entrusted with the custody of books , important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &c.,; which he should carefully preserve , allowing no one to remove them from his possession , without a formal order from the Society . 3 . All payments made by the Treasurer , should be under a resolution of the Society , or on a requisition signed by the President and Secretary . These resolutions and requisitions , together with his receipts for monies paid , are his vouchers , which he will file among his papers , and hand to the auditors , when his accounts are to be examined . The Treasurer should be careful to take receipts for all monies by him paid out , and also to require that the order for the money be endorsed by the person receiving it . 4 . The number and form of the Treasurer 's books will depend upon the nature and /z/ extent of his duties . In many Societies it is necessary to open a ledger account with every member ; such is the case in Beneficial Societies , where money is paid in regularly by each member , at short periods . 5 . The duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Treasurer , although in many instances he is instructed to employ a collector for the purpose , at a per centum allowance . Sometimes a collecting committee is appointed by the meeting . 6 . The Treasurer should strenuously endeavour to keep his books well posted up , so as to be able to exhibit , at any and every meeting , a succinct account of the state of the treasury . This is often a matter of the highest importance , and the information may frequently materially influence the action of a meeting . 7 As often as the by-laws require , the Treasurer should have his books and papers ready for the examination of the auditors , and when the accounts are gone over , the result should be reported to the Society by the auditors , and entered on the Secretary 's /z/ minutes . In many cases the certificate of the auditors is written in the Treasurer 's books . From the date of settlement the Treasurer , of course , commences a new account . 8 . In many Societies the Treasurer is required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These bonds should be deposited with the President . They should be renewed at every successive election , unless otherwise ordered by the Society . 9 . At the expiration of his term of office , the Treasurer should carefully settle up his books and accounts , and deliver over all the books , papers , documents , funds and other property belonging to the Society , to his successor in office , without unnecessary delay or hinderance . Neglect or inattention to this duty , under any pretence , is justly regarded as a serious breach of propriety . /z/ It is elsewhere stated that the usual custom is , to make the gentleman upon whose motion a committee is raised , chairman of /z/ that committee . In all Legislative bodies , when standing or special committees are appointed , the individual first named is considered as the chairman , although , according to Parliamentary usage , each committee has a right to elect its own chairman . This right , however , is seldom , if ever , exercised . In some Societies the by-laws provide for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in many instances the efficiency of a committee is thereby increased . In the Senate of the United States the members elect the standing committees , first balloting for a chairman of each , and afterwards for the balance of the requisite number . In the House of Representatives , committees are sometimes chosen by ballot , and in that case the rule is , that if a sufficient number are not chosen , by a majority of votes , on the first ballot , a second ballot is taken in which a plurality of votes prevail . In case a greater number than is required shall have an equal number of votes , the house proceeds to a further ballot or ballots . In Congress , any member may excuse /z/ himself from serving on any committee , at the time of his appointment , if he is then a member of two other committees . The object of committees is to consider some particular subject or subjects ; to gain information ; to digest certain business , and place it in a shape suitable for the action of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business in which the whole Society , as a body , can not conveniently act . Committees are required , by Parliamentary usage , to meet and attend to the matters assigned them with system and regularity , and not by separate consultation , or in a loose and indefinite manner. * Unless otherwise ordered by the Society , the President will appoint all committees . A majority of a committee is necessary to constitute a quorum . In appointing committees , those who take exceptions to some particulars in the matter * Should a committee not make report in due season , on any matter committed to them , they may be instructed to report at a certain time , or they muy , on motion , be discharged from the further consideration of the subject , and then the mailer may be taken up in the Society . /z/ proposed to be examined , may be of the committee , but none who speak directly against the whole matter . " For , " as Hatsell justly remarks , " he that would totally destroy will not amend it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse who cares not for it . " It is therefore a constant rule that no man is to be employed in any matter who has declared himself against it . And when any member who is against the bill , hears himself named , he ought to ask to be excused. * The rules of Parliament allow any member to be present at the sittings of a select committee , but he can not vote , and must give place to all the committee , and sit below them . Standing committees are those which continue from year to year ; Special committees are raised from time to time , and are discharged , on motion , when they have made a final report . /z/ All reports of committees should be signed by a majority of the members . Reports of committees are of two kinds . 1 . They may contain simply a statement of facts , reasoning or opinion , and without recommending definite action . Such reports usually conclude with a resolution to discharge the committee from the further consideration of the subject . 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recommend definite action . Such reports will conclude with resolutions , condensing the main facts or reasoning , and declaring distinct conclusions . In both cases , the resolutions are the proper objects for the action of the meeting , although with reports of the first class , it is not uncommon to adopt them formally , as embracing the views of the whole body . When a report which has been recommitted , is reported back to the meeting with amendments , the usual course is to read the amendments , and take the question on them separately . If an entire new draft is substi- /z/ tuted , it is customary to accept the new draft as a substitute for the original paper , and read it accordingly . The Secretary may deliver the communications and resolutions referred to a committee , to any member of the committee , but it is usual to deliver them to him who is first named . When a subject is referred to a committee , with particular instructions , the committee , of course , are required to obey the instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the committee have full power over the subject committed to their consideration , and can make such report as they think proper . From the Journal of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives , March 4 , 1843 . The House resumed the consideration of the motion to print one thousand copies of the report of the majority , in connection with the report of the minority of the committee , on the subject of preferring articles of impeachment against the Governor of this Commonwealth . And the question recurring " Will the /z/ House agree to the motion ? " A motion was made by Mr. Sherwood , to postpone the further consideration of the motion , together with the subject , indefinitely . And on the question " Will the House agree to the motion ? " Mr. James put the question to the chair , " Whether that part of the report which relates to Morrow B. Lowry , ' is in order ? " The Speaker decided that the minority of the committee , appointed to examine the subject of the impeachment of David R. Porter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , in alluding to a report made last session by the gentleman from Crawford , calls that gentleman by name , which part of the said report the Speaker decided is not in order , and is un . parliamentary ; and that it is a matter of no difference , whether the gentleman from Crawford was acting in the capacity of a legislator , either during the past or present session . From this decision Mr. Morris and Mr. Hinchman appealed to the House , and on the question , " Is the decision of the Speaker correct ? " the yeas and nays were required by Mr. Kennedy , of Beaver , and Mr. Sherwood , and were yeas f52 , nays 30 . So tho question was determined in the affirmative . /z/ Going into a committee of the whole is a matter of almost daily occurrence in all Legislative bodies . The leading advantages of so doing are , that the members may speak oftener than twice ; that the debate can not be stopped by the previous question ; and that much labor is saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insert the amendments offered in committee upon the journal . The mode is as follows . A motion is made and seconded , " that the Society resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole , for the purpose of considering the resolution relating to , " naming the subject . The President puts the question , and if it prevails , he will call some member to the chair , or the members may themselves appoint a Chairman . The President will then vacate the chair , which will be taken by the Chairman who will say , " the Committee of the whole have referred to them the resolution relating to ; it will be read . " And after being read /z/ by the Secretary , he will say , " the resolution is before the committee , " which announcement opens the subject for discussion . The rules and proceedings observed in the Society , are to be observed , as far as practicable , in committee of the whole . Neither the yeas and nays , nor the previous question , can , however , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair be taken the power of the Chairman , on points of order , being absolute . A quorum in committee is the same as a quorum in the Society , and if the Chairman finds , at any time , no quorum present , the committee must immediately rise , and report the fact to the Society . When the lower house of Congress is resolved into committee of the whole , no member is allowed to speak more than once , until every member choosing to speak shall have spoken . This rule does not prevail in the Legislature of this state , where a member may speak as often as he can obtain the floor . When the committee have gone through the resolution or resolutions referred to them , the Chairman will say , " the resolution is gone through ; the committee will /z/ rise , " whereupon the Chairman will leave the chair , and the President resume his seat . The Chairman should then proceed to his seat on the floor , and , addressing the President , say , " The committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , and have instructed me to report the same with certain amendments , " or " without amendment , " or " negatived , " as the case may be . The President repeats this report , and says : " the resolution is before the meeting . In case the resolution has been negatived in committee of the whole , he will say : " will the meeting agree to the report of the committee ? " When a committee wish to rise before they have gone through with their business , they can do so upon a motion to that effect being seconded and carried whereupon the Chairman will report " progress , and ask leave to sit again . " If leave is granted , the time is named ; and to kill a bill effectually , the members sometimes name a day beyond the session ; * if refused , the effect is to bring /z/ up the resolution at once before the Society . This course is very often pursued in our Legislature , when the friends of a bill are confident that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole , may be stricken out of the Society , and matters stricken out in committee , may be re-inserted when the subject is under discussion before the meeting . In committee of the whole , the President of the Society has a right to participate in the debate and proceedings , as if he were a private member . The amendments made in committee of the whole are to be incorporated with the resolution , and so reported . Suppose several resolutions are submitted to the committee of the whole , and the first is negatived . If the others are all dependant on the first , the committee must rise , and report the first resolution negatived . In a committee of the whole in Parliament , when a vote is once passed , it can not be altered by the committee , their votes being binding on themselves . This rule excludes the motion to reconsider from committee of /z/ the whole . On taking up a bill reported by a committee of the whole , with amendments , the practice in Parliament is , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then puts the question on the first amendment , and so until the whole are adopted or rejected . When the amendments of the committee are gone through with , other amendments may be proposed in the house . /z/ As a general rule , the question first moved and seconded , shall be put first . But this rule gives way to what are called privileged questions . The usage in our State Legislature on this subject is , that no business regularly before the house shall be interrupted except by a motion To adjourn , For the previous question , For postponement , For commitment , or For amendment . A motion for postponement precludes commitment ; a motion for commitment pre- /z/ eludes amendment , or decision on the original resolution . In Congress , the motion to lie on the table is also a privileged question , and takes precedence of the previous question . The rule is , that when a question is under discussion , no motion shall be received but to adjourn , to lie on the table , for the previous question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amend , to postpone indefinitely ; which several motions have precedence in the order in which they are arranged . No motion to postpone to a day certain , to commit , or to postpone indefinitely , being decided in the negative , is again allowed on the same day , and at the same stage in the bill or proposition . A motion to strike out the enacting words of a bill , has precedence of a motion to amend , and , if carried , is considered equivalent to its rejection . The operation of privileged questions is as follows . 1 . If a proposition before the meeting is deemed useless or inexpedient , the majority may get rid of it by the previous question , or by indefinite postponement . 2 . If the members desire further /z/ time to reflect on a resolution , or have more important matters requiring immediate attention , the usual motions are to postpone for the present , or to postpone to a day certain . 3 . When a proposition is regarded with favor , but is defective in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions , or if the defects can be reached by amendments , the simple motion to amend is usually resorted to . Besides these motions , which , for the time being , take the place of the main question , incidental questions frequently arise and delay a vote on the original proposition . These are questions concerning the presence of an individual not belonging to the meeting , a quarrel between two members , questions of order , motions for the reading of papers , suspending a rule , &c.; When these matters are settled , the question interrupted is resumed at the point where it was suspended. * * It sometimes happens that questions multiply and assume a complicated form . 1 , A resolution may be before the meeting , and 2 , a motion made to amend . 3 , A motion is made to commit . 4 , While these motions are pending , a question of order arises in debate , which gives /z/ The simple motion to adjourn , being a privilege question , can not be amended , and must be decided without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1 . When a member is speaking . 2 . When a vote is being taken on any question . 3 . A motion to adjourn being negatived , can not be renewed until some other proposition is made , or other business transacted . Hatseli says : " A motion to adjourn , simply , can not be amended , as by adding to a particular day , but must be put simply , that the House do now adjourn ; and if carried in the affirmative , it is adjourned to the next sitting day , unless it has previously agreed upon a resolution that at its rising it will adjourn to a particular day , and then the House is adjourned to that day . " occasion , 5 , to a question of privilege , and this leads , 6 , to a motion to lie on the table . In this state of affairs , Mr. Gushing remarks , that the course of proceeding in the Massachusetts Legislature , is to put the motion to lie on the table first ; if this is negatived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that comes the question of order ; then the question of commitment ; if that is negatived , the question of amendment is taken , and lastly the main question . /z/ A motion to adjourn to a day certain is debatable , and may be amended as regards the day named . If a question is put for adjournment , it is no adjournment until the President announces it , and from courtesy and respect , no member should leave his place until the adjournment is formally announced . It is entirely in order , according to Pariamentary usage , when desirous of suspending business , to adjourn for a short time , and then resume business , on a simple motion . Should a motion to adjourn be made and carried , during the consideration of a resolution or proposition , and before any vote is taken , the subject before the Society is thereby removed , and it will not stand before the next stated meeting , as a matter of course , as the first business of the meeting , but its place will be among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order . From the Journal of the U , S. House of Representatives , May 22 , 1834 . A motion was made by Mr. Clayton , that the House do adjourn , and the question being put , it was decided in the negative . /z/ A motion was then made by Mr. Miller , that the further consideration of the subject matter before the House be postponed until Tuesday , the 27th inst . And after debate thereon , and the yeas and nays being demanded , Mr. Miller withdrew the said motion . And thereupon moved that the said report do lie on the table . And the yeas and nays being again demanded on the question , Mr. Miller also withdrew that motion . Whereupon , it being half past 4 , P. M. , Mr. McKinley moved that the House do adjourn ; when an inquiry was made of the chair whether that motion was in order , as no question had been put or decided since the House had voted on a motion to adjourn . The speaker decided that the motion was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place on a motion to postpone , subsequent to the decision of the question on the motion made by Mr. Clayton to adjourn ; in which decision the House acquiesced . And the question was then put , " Will the House adjourn ? " and passed in the affirmative . From the Journal of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives , Feb. 11 , 1843 . A motion was made by Mr. James , that the House do adjourn ; and on the question " Will the House agree to the motion ? " the /z/ yeas and nays were required by Mr. Lowry and Mr. James , and were as follows : yeas 13 nays 71 . So the question was determined in the negative . A motion was then made by Mr. Goodwin that the House adjourn ; and on the question " Will the House agree to the motion ? " the yeas and nays were required by Mr. Goodwin and Mr. Elwell , and were as follows : yeas 19 nays 61 , so the question was determined in the negative . A motion was then made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaker refused to entertain the motion to adjourn there having been two consecutive motions to adjourn , and no business of the House intervening , nor had any other business intervened at the time the motion was made . In this case the Speaker was clearly wrong in entertaining the second motion to adjourn , such a course being directly contrary to Parliamentary and Congressional usage , as well as against the ordinary practice in all State Legislatures . If , however , there is no business which can be called up , as is the case sometimes in the commencement of a session , two consecutive motions to adjourn may be received as a matter of convenience . /z/ This motion is not recognised in our State Legislature , the equivalent motion being " to postpone for the present . " I insert it here , because it is used in Congress , and in the Legislative bodies in the Eastern States , and because its use may sometimes be attended with advantage . The motion to lie on the table is not debatable , and being a privileged one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used instead of calling the previous question , and sometimes in place of indefinite postponement . In Congress , this motion has precedence of all motions excepting a motion to adjourn . This is one of the modes of giving a deathblow to a proposition it is a sort of previous question . The subject , it is true , may be brought up again , but this seldom happens , as the same majority that adopts the motion to lie on the table , can prevent the matter from being again brought up . /z/ The motion to commit is sometimes made instead of the motion for indefinite postponement , because by referring a matter to a committee , or if it be a resolution from a committee , by re-committing it , the proposition may be so amended as to preclude the necessity of indefinite postponement . This motion , however , may be amended by substituting another committee for that named ; by enlarging or diminishing the number of the committee , as originally proposed ; or by particular instructions to the committee , requiring the introduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recommit , as the case may be , is decided affirmatively , the effect is to remove the whole business , for the time being , from before the Society . If decided negatively , the main question which it was proposed to commit , may be postponed or amended , or suppressed by calling the previous question . /z/ The fourth joint rule of the Senate and House of Representatives of this State , declares that no motion or proposition , on a subject different from that under consideration , shall be admitted under color of an amendment . The same regulation prevails in Congress , and should certainly be adopted in all Societies , although contrary to Parliamentary practice . In Parliament , amendments may be made so as totally to alter the nature of the original proposition , and , to get rid of a resolution , the expedient is frequently resorted to of making it bear , by amendments , a sense different from that intended by the movers , so that they vote against it themselves . This practice prevails also in the Legislature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is moved to amend , by striking out certain words , and inserting others , the manner of stating the question is first to read the whole passage to be amended , as it stands before the meeting , then the words proposed to be stricken out , next those to be inserted , /z/ and lastly the whole passage as it will be when amended . When a resolution is pending , it is entirely in order to move to strike out all after the word Resolved , and insert a phraseology entirely different , provided the matter proposed to be inserted relates to the same subject as that proposed to be stricken out . A suggestion to amend may be received as a modification by the mover , even after a resolution has been amended by the members , provided the modification does not affect the previous amendment . An amendment to an amendment may be moved , but it is not in order to amend an amendment to an amendment , as this would certainly lead to embarrassment . In this case the question is first taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amendment , and then on the resolution as amended . In our State Legislature , when a bill has passed second reading , it may be amended on third reading , by unanimous consent . Sometimes , however , it is moved to go into Committee of the Whole , for the purpose of /z/ general amendment , and if this motion prevails , the whole matter is open to amend ment . If the House , however , go into committee of the whole for a special purpose , that of striking out or amending a particular section , the moment that is done , the committee must rise . If it be desirable to amend a resolution , after it has finally passed , it may be done if the proposition be sanctioned by the unanimous consent of the members , or , if not , by effecting a reconsideration . The general usage in all Legislative bodies , is , that when an amendment is moved , a member who has spoken to the main question , may speak again to the amendment , and , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be superseded by a motion to postpone to a day certain , so that an amendment and postponement competing , the latter is to be put first . A motion to amend may also be superseded by a motion to commit . Parliamentary usage declares that " when it is proposed to amend by inserting a paragraph , or part of one , the friends of the pa- /z/ ragraph may make it as perfect as they can by amendments , before the question is put on inserting it . If it be received , it can not be amended afterwards , in the same stage , because the House has , on a vote , agreed to it in that form. * On the same point Mr. Gushing declares : " Whatever is agreed to by the assembly , on a vote , either adopting or rejecting a proposed amendment , can not be afterwards altered or amended . Thus , if a proposition consist of A B , and it is moved to insert C ; if the amendment prevail , C can not be afterwards amended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , so , if it is moved to strike out B , and the amendment is rejected , B can not afterwards be amended , because a vote against striking it out is equivalent to a vote agreeing to it as it stands . " In the House of Representatives of this * In like manner , if it is proposed to amend by striking Out a paragraph , the friends of the paragraph are first to make it as perfect as they can by amendments , before the question is put for striking it out . If on the question it be retained , it can not be amended afterwards : because a vote against striking out is equivalent to a vote agreeing to it in that form . JEFFERSON 'S MANUAL . /z/ State , April 10th , 1846 , during the pendency of the first section of the bill granting to the Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road Company the Right of Way to Pittsburg , a motion was made by Mr. McFarland , to amend by adding certain words as a proviso . Mr. Kunkle moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated , and inserting other words , which was agreed to . The question recurring on the amendment as amended , it was agreed to , and thus became incorporated as part of the section . Mr. Burrel then moved further to amend , by inserting certain words in the paragraph just adopted as Mr. Kunkle 's amendment , but the Speaker , ( Mr. Patterson , of Armstrong , ) decided the amendment out of order , declaring that under the rule above quoted it was not in the power of the House to amend words formally agreed to . From this decision an appeal was taken by Mr. Burrel and Mr. Edie , which was debated for some time and then withdrawn , so that the decision of the Speaker was concurred in . The usual forms of amendments , are to strike out certain words , to insert or add certain words , or , to strike out and insert . /z/ While the amendment is pending , that also is susceptible of amendment , but if the amendment to the amendment is objectionable , the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , by another proposition , endeavour to shape the amendment to the form desired . If it be proposed to amend , by striking out certain words , it may be moved as an amendment to this amendment , to strike out a part of the words proposed to be stricken out by the amendment , which is equivalent to retaining them in the resolution , should the amendment be agreed to . So , if an amendment proposes to strike out certain words , and it be moved as an amendment to the amendment to strike out certain words from among those proposed to be stricken out by the amendment , and the amendment to the amendment should prevail , and then the amendment itself be negatived , the effect of the vote is , that the words proposed to be stricken out by the amendment to the amendment , no longer remain as a part of the resolution . In the Pennsylvania House of Represen-/z/ tatives , March 19th , 1846 , during the pendency of one of the sections of the bill entitled " An Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to amend by striking out the latter half of the section . Mr. Cochran moved to amend the amendment by striking out certain words in that portion of the section proposed to be stricken out by Mr. Magehan , which amendment to the amendment was agreed to , and said words were stricken out . The question was then taken on the amendment proposed by Mr. Magehan , as amended , and decided in the negative . Whereupon a question of order was raised , whether the words stricken out by the amendment to the amendment , offered by Mr. Cochran , were still a part of the section , and the Speaker , ( Mr. Patterson , of Armstrong , ) decided they were not , and that the section stood before the House with those words stricken out . In this decision the House concurred , without an appeal . An amendment to strike out or to insert , or to strike out and insert certain words , being negatived , can not be renewed in the same form . If an amendment be proposed and agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ certain words , it can not be afterwards moved to insert or to strike out the same words , but it may be moved to strike out or insert the same words in connection with others , provided the proposed striking out or insertion makes a new proposition . From the Journal of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives , Feb. 11 , 1843 . Pending the consideration of the bill No. 97 , entitled " An Act to reduce the number and expenses of the Board of Canal Commissioners , " and during the consideration of an amendment , a motion was made by Mr. Lowry , to amend the amendment , by adding thereto the following words : " The board elected under this act shall not remove any officers appointed by the old board , without good and sufficient cause , a specification of which they shall enter upon the journal of their proceedings . " And the members of the present and future Senate and House of Representatives , shall receive but two dollars per day , for every day actually in the service of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree so to amend ? " a division of the question /z/ was called for by Mr. McDaniel , to end with the word " proceedings . " And on the question , " Will the House agree to the first division ? " the yeas and nays were required by Mr. Lowry and Mr. Hahn , and were as follow : yeas 31 , nays 60 ; so the question was determined in the negative . And on the question , " Will the House agree to the second division of the amendment ? " viz : " And the members of the present and future Senate and House of Representatives shall receive but two dollars per day , for every day actually in the service of the State , " A question arose , whether the said division of the amendment was in order , under the fourth joint rule of the Senate and House of Representatives . Whereupon the Speaker decided the second division of the said amendment " not in order . " From which decision Mr. Lowry appealed , and on the question , " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined in the affirmative . /z/ While the President is putting a question or addressing the meeting , * or while a member is speaking , none of the members should move from their seats , or entertain private discourse ; nor while a member is speaking should any pass between him and the President . If any member , in speaking , transgress the rules of the Society , wander from the subject under discussion , or indulge in personalities , the President should , or any member may , through the President , call him to order . The member so called to order must immediately cease speaking , unless per mitted to explain ; the meeting may , if ap* pealed to , decide in the case , but without debate . If there be no appeal , the decision of the President shall be submitted to , and * In regard to the right of a presiding officer to speak , Hatsell says : " But if the Speaker rises to speak , the member standing up , ought to sit down , that he may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right speak to matters of order , and be first heard , he is restrained from speaking on any other subject , except where the House have occasion for facts within his knowledge then he may , with their leave , state the matter of fact . /z/ if the case requires it , the member so called to order shall be liable to the censure of the meeting . A member called to order , if the decision of the President be that he is out of order , loses his right to the floor , unless the consent of the meeting is obtained for him In Congress , a member is allowed to speak but once , until every member wishing to speak on the subject , has spoken , when he may speak again . No member , when speaking , shall be interrupted , except by a call to order , or by a member to explain , * or by a motion for the previous question . A member who obtains the floor in order to explain , must confine himself to the explanation . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is out of order . * The practice in the Legislature of New York , and in that of Massachusetts , is different from this rule . Gushing says : " It is sometimes supposed that , because a member has a right to explain himself , he therefore has a right to interrupt another member , whilst speaking , in order to make the explanation . But this is a mistake ; he should wait until the member speaking has finished . And if a member , on being requested , yields the floor for an explanation , he relinquishes it altogether . " /z/ In Legislative bodies , a member , in debate , is not permitted to refer to another member by name ; but in case of a member transgressing the rules of the body , he may be named by the Speaker , and by him only . In Societies , it is usual for a member , when he wishes to refer to another member , to say , the gentleman on his right , or his left , or the gentleman last up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered the resolution or the amendment , or by using some other similar expression . This is decidedly the proper usage . No member , in speaking , should be allowed to indulge in language personally offensive to any member , or insulting to the meeting ; nor should he be allowed to question the motives of a member , or use disrespectful terms in referring to the proceedings of a former meeting . In Parliamentary practice , the consequences of a measure may be reprobated in strong terms , but to arraign the motives of those who propose or advocate it , is regarded as a personality , and against order . Hatsell says : " No one is to speak impertinently or beside the question , super fluously or tediously. " /z/ In Congress , when a member speaking is called to order by another member , for indulging in improper remarks , the exceptionable words are required to be taken down in writing , that the Speaker may be better enabled to judge of the matter . After being read , the member is asked if he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to conform to what the House believe to be the words spoken . No motion is open for debate until it has been stated from the chair . When a member wishes to make a statement to the meeting , not involving a motion , he should ask permission of the President who will put the question , " Shall the member have leave ? " If no objection be made , he will permit the member to proceed . So also when a member has spoken twice , and wishes to speak a third time . According to Parliamentary usage , no member may be present when a bill or any other business , concerning himself , is being debated ; nor is any member allowed to speak to the merits of it , until the member interested withdraws . It is also the practice in Parliament that /z/ no member can have a paper read , or be allowed to read it himself , without the consent of the House . A member has not the right even to read his own speech , committed to writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time ; and therefore is not refused , but where that is intended . Noisy and disorderly behaviour , coughing or stamping , while a member is speaking , are excessively rude , and should be promptly suppressed by the President . Every member has a right to be heard , while he speaks in order , and to the question , and if the President can preserve order in no other way , he should publicly name the offenders . " Nevertheless , " says Hatsell , " if a member finds that it is not the inclination of the House to hear him , and that , by conversation , or any other noise , they endeavour to drown his voice , it is his most prudent way to submit to the pleasure of the House , and sit down ; for it scarcely ever happens that they are guilty of this piece of ill manners , without a sufficient reason , or inattentive to a member who says any thing worth hearing . " /z/ The right to address the House while sitting , is conceded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Legislative and Parliamentary practice , the motions not debatable are A motion to adjourn . A motion to lie on the table , when a privileged motion . A motion for the previous question . A motion to read a paper or document , pending a question . A motion to reconsider . Speakers of Congress have decided , and the decisions have been sustained by the House , that inasmuch as the motion to lie on the table is not debatable , so the motion to reconsider must be taken without debate . 4 ? All motions to take up particular items of business , or relating to priority of business , must be decided without debate . This is an excellent rule . Without it the whole time of a meeting might be consumed /z/ by gentlemen in endeavouring to get up a particular item of business , to proceed to the consideration of which the majority may be averse . All incidental questions of order , arising after a motion is made for the previous question , and pending such motion , must be decided , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislative rule on this subject is , that any member may call for a division of a question , which shall be divided , if it comprehends questions so distinct , that one being taken away , the rest may stand entire , for the decision of the House . A motion to strike out and insert , are deemed indivisible ; but a motion to strike out being lost , precludes neither amendment , nor a motion to strike out and insert . In Parliament , a question can not be divided without the consent of the House , and this is doubtless the true rule . Hatsell , an able /z/ writer on Parliamentary precedents , observes " For who is to decide whether a question is complicated or not ? where it is complicated 1 into how many propositions it may be divided 1 The fact is , that the only mode of separating a complicated question , is by moving amendments to it ; and these must be decided by the House ; unless the House orders it to be divided . * * * Whenever there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided , and put one by one . " Mr. Sutherland favors the views of this author , and remarks that the usage in Congress , which is the same as that in our Legislature , leads to embarrassment . Cushing 's Manual says : " It is sometimes asserted that it is the right of every individual member to have a complicated question , ( provided it is susceptible of division , ) divided into its several parts , and a question put separately on each , on his mere demand , and without any motion or any vote of the assembly for that purpose . But this is a mistake ; there is no such rule of parliamentary proceeding ; a complicated question can only be separated by moving amend- /z/ ments to it in the usual manner , or by moving for a division of it in the manner above stated . " As the rule now is , in this state , when a division is called for , the Speaker must decide whether the question is susceptible of division from which decision there may be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that in all cases the Society should order the division , following the practice in Parliament . /z/ This motion was originally introduced in the House of Commons , in 1604 , by Sir Harry Vane , and was designed to suppress questions which , if discussed , might involve in censure the government , or persons high in authority . It has been incorporated in the rules of the lower house of Congress , and in those of our State Legislatures , but in this country it is generally used for the purpose of winding up a long debate , or an unprofitable discussion . Some /z/ times , in the midst of high party excitement , it is applied in order to arrest the arguments of political opponents , and when so used it is not unfrequently termed the gag-law . Formerly , in Congress , five members were sufficient to second the motion for the Previous Question , but now a majority of the members present is required . In our State Senate , four members are necessary ; in the House of Representatives , twelve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number will be greater or less according to the strength of the Society , ) and inserted in the by-laws. * When the Previous Question is moved and seconded by the requisite number , all further amendments , and all discussion are precluded at once . The President will rise and say , " The Previous Question has been moved and seconded the question before the meeting is , ' Shall the main question be now put V " And on this question it is * In the absence of any by-law on the subject , one-fifth of the whole number of members present should be required to second the call . The names of those who call , and second the call for , the Previous Question , should be inserted in the minutes . /z/ usual to take the yeas and nays . If decided in the affirmative , the vote will then be taken on the amendments pending , in their order , and then on the main question. * Formerly the rule in our Legislature was , that when the main question was ordered to be put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still the Parliamentary practice . The course now pursued , as laid down above , is a decided improvement over the old usage , and should certainly be adopted in Societies . In the Legislature of New York , as well as in that of Massachusetts , the effect of a negative , is to leave the main question and the pending amendments , under debate , as they were before the Previous Question was moved . On a motion for the Previous Question , no debate is allowable . All incidental questions of order , arising after the motion is made , ' must be decided without debate , whether on/ an appeal from the decision of the chair , orj otherwise . The Previous Question having * What the " Main Question " will be , will depend upon circumstances . If a resolution be under debate , with amendments pending , the " main question " will be on the adoption of the resolution . /z/ been moved and seconded , can not be withdrawn , except by consent of the majority , nor can it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjourn. /z/ Motions to postpone are of two kinds a motion to postpone for the present , and a motion to postpone indefinitely . A motion to postpone " for the present , " may be amended , by fixing a definite lime , or it may be amended so as to read indefinitely . Where different times are named , the Legislative rule is to put the question on the most distant day first . The motion to postpone indefinitely can not be amended , nor superseded by a motion to commit , or to amend the original proposition , but must first be decided . If decided affirmatively , the proposition is finally disposed of ; if negatively , the motion to commit , or to amend , may then be received . In the Senate of the United States , when /z/ a question is postponed indefinitely , it can not be acted upon again during the session . The usual effect of this motion , in all Legislative bodies , is to make a final disposition of the subject to which it is applied . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape . /z/ In Congress , motions to reconsider are in order on the same day , or the day after , the passage of a motion , proposition or bill . In our State Legislature the time is extended to the six following days , exclusive of Sabbath . In the U. S. Senate , one of the rules is , that " no motion for the reconsideration of any vote , shall be in order after a bill , resolution , message , report , amendment , or motion upon which the vote was taken , shall have gone out of the possession of the Senate . " In Societies it is not usual to extend the privilege of this motion beyond the next meeting , and this extension is , in some cases , too long . If the matter proposed to be re- /z/ considered , has passed from the meeting , the motion to reconsider should not be received . The Senate rule should be applied in all such cases . When the subject is still in possession of the Society , it may be allowable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that at which the proposition proposed to be reconsidered was adopted . This matter should , however , be provided for in the by-laws . In all cases the motion to reconsider must be made and seconded by gentlemen who voted in the majority ; or , in case of equal division , by those who voted in the negative . In Congress , it not unfrequently happens , that a member will vote for a proposition to which he is opposed , and which he finds is about to carry , merely for the purpose of making himself eligible to move a reconsideration , which , if carried , gives him another opportunity of making a thrust at the measure . During the limitation , a motion to reconsider takes precedence , in Congress , of all motions , excepting the motion to adjourn . The motion to reconsider is sometimes made , and then postponed , and the only way to avoid this /z/ inconvenience is to force a vote , by calling and sustaining the previous question. * In Parliament , the motion to reconsider is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be questioned again , and stands as the judgment of the House , and a bill once rejected , can not be brought in again , in the same shape , during the session.t English authors remark that various expedients , are resorted to , in order to correct the effects of this rule , such as passing an explanatory act , if any thing has been omitted or ill-expressed , or an act to enforce , and make more effectual an act , &c.,; or an act to rectify mistakes in an act , &c.; Or , the session may be closed for one , two , three , or more days , and a new one commenced ; or a part of a subject may be taken up by another bill , in a different manner , so as to change some of its prominent features . * In this case , the " main question " will be the motion to reconsider . f Hatsell states that a bill to tax leather being once defeated in the House of Commons , the same proposition was subsequently renewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be charged , ' ' &c.; /z/ The motion to rescind is a very common one in many Societies , and in too many cases is rendered necessary by hasty and illadvised action . The business of a Society should be so conducted as to render the necessity for its use of rare occurrence . No motion of the kind is employed in Parliament . The corresponding motion in our State Legislature and in Congress , is the motion to repeal , which may be carried by a simple majority . In our State Legislature , to expunge any matter from the Journal , requires the unanimous vote of all present , as appears by the subjoined precedent . From the Journal of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives , March 21 , 1832 . A motion was made by Mr. Waugh , that the amendments to the bill No. 458 , entitled 41 An Act to authorise the Governor to incorporate a company for making a turnpike road from the borough of Somerset , in Somerset county , to the canal basin at Johnstown , in /z/ Cambria county , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " made in the house on second reading yesterday , except those upon which the yeas and nays were required , be expunged from the Journal . The motion being opposed , the Speaker decided that under the constitution of the state , and the uniform practice of this house , the motion could riot prevail without the unanimous consent of the members present . Whereupon Mr. Waugh appealed from the decision of the Speaker , and on the question , " Is the Speaker right in his decision ? " it was decided in the affirmative yeas 67 , nays 22. /z/ When a decision is made by the President , which the members believe to be contrary to rule , or out of order , any two members may make an appeal , and the question may then be argued . It is not necessary that the President should leave the chair . He may do so , however , if he prefers , and may appoint a Chairman pro tempore , or ihe meeting may appoint . The /z/ President will g ; ive his reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member is allowed to speak more than once , unless by leave of the meeting . The same rule prevails , when a question of order is submitted to the meeting by the President . The member making the appeal , is required , in all cases , to reduce the appeal to writing , which will be stated from the Chair . The appeal , together with the vote upon it , should be entered on the minutes . On an appeal , the question before the meeting is , " Shall the decision of the Chair be sustained ? " On putting the question , if the vote be equal , and the President is in the chair , he may give the casting vote sustaining his decision . A precedent for this is found in Congressional proceedings . When two or more members are competing for the floor , and the President gives it to one who was not the first to rise , his decision may be appealed from , and overruled by the meeting . In Parliamentary practice any decision of the presiding officer may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to move that an /z/ appeal from the decision of the Speaker be laid upon the table . /z/ The rights of a minority are best protected by a rigid adherence to rule . As it is always in the power of the majority , by their numbers , to stop any improper measures proposed by their opponents , the only means by which the minority can defend themselves against similar attempts from those in power , are the forms and rules adopted by the Society by a strict adherence to which the weaker party can always be protected from those irregularities and abuses which the wantonness of power is but too often apt to suggest to large and successful majorities . So remarks Hatsell . The mode of introducing a report from the minority of a committee , is explained on page 38 . In the Legislature of this State , it not unfrequently happens that gentlemen who are favorable to the general tenor of a bill , are /z/ compelled to vote against it , in consequence of some objectionable amendment having been incorporated with it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the constituents of members may know the reasons which influence their votes , it is usual to state these reasons in writing , and the rules allow them to be inserted in the Journal . But when members protest against any action of the House , in the adoption of a resolution or proposition , the protest can not be inserted in the Journal without the consent of a majority . When the protest is couched in respectful language , this privilege is never denied , unless in some extraordinary cases . A subsisting order of the Society being neglected , any member has the right to insist on its being attended to without delay . /z/ It is usual for the President , after a motion has been made , seconded , and stated from the chair , to give the floor to the mover , in preference to others , if he rises to speak . /z/ This is no more than proper courtesy , and should always be extended . A motion or resolution may be withdrawn by the mover and seconder , at any time before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Legislature of this state , but in that of New York , and the Massachusetts Assembly , as well as in Parliament , when a motion is moved , seconded , and stated from the chair , it becomes the property of the House , and can not be withdrawn without the consent of the members . Our own rule on this subject is certainly the best , for sometimes motions are made which subsequent explanations render unnecessary . If the permission to withdraw is not allowed , the mover is mortified by finding himself the author of a motion which will certainly be negatived . A call for adjournment , or for any order in business , by members of the meeting from their seats , is not a motion , but a breach of order . No motion can be made without rising and addressing the chair . In Congress , no motion to postpone to a day certain , to commit , or to postpone in-/z/ definitely , being decided in the negative , is again allowable on the same day , in the same stage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress to refer a subject to a standing committee , and to a select committee , the question on reference to the standing committee is first in order . Motions and resolutions must be read by the Secretary , as often as the reading is called for by any member . A motion to take up a particular item of business , if negatived , can not be renewed before the intervention of other business . In Legislative bodies all business has its regular order , such as original resolutions , bills on first , second and third reading , &c.; Frequently , however , bills that are much desired are taken up and disposed of before their regular order is reached . This can sometimes be done , by a bare majority assenting , but if any one member calls for the " orders of the day , " the process is stopped unless a vote of two-thirds can be obtained in favor of a motion to suspend the rule . When the call for the reading of a paper /z/ is objected to , the call may be changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the meeting . From the Journal of the U. S. House of Representatives , Jan. llth , 1837 . A motion was made by Mr. Mann , of New York , that the House do proceed to the orders of the day ; when Mr. Bell rose to a question of order , which he stated to be , that a motion to proceed to the orders of the day , having been once made and decided in the negative , could not be again made the same day , and at the same stage of proceeding . The Speaker decided that the House having on motion once refused to proceed to the orders of the day , did not , after further debate , and at a different period of the day , preclude another motion from being made to proceed to the orders of the day . From this decision Mr. Bell took an appeal to the House , which he subsequently withdrew , and the decision therefore stood as the judgment of the House . From the Journal of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives , April llth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Armstrong , that the House proceed to the consideration of the amendments made by /z/ the Senate to the bill No. 48 , entitled " An Act to repeal certain acts in relation to the Philadelphia and Trenton Rail-Road Company . " Whereupon the Speaker submitted to the House for decision whether the motion could be entertained , inasmuch as the House had previously , on the same day , refused to consider said amendments , although other business had intervened . And on the question " Is the motion in order ? " it was decided in the affirmative , yeas 45 , nays 35. /z/ On questions of order no debate is allowable , excepting on an appeal from the decision of the President , or on a reference of a question by him to the meeting , when no member shall speak more than once , unless by consent of the meeting . All decisions on questions of order should be noticed in the minutes . The President is required to decide all questions of order , unless he prefers to submit the matter to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question has been put to vote , and the decision announced , that the question was not understood , the President may withdraw the decision , and put the question again . OF A QUORUM . Ill In Parliament , it is a breach of order for the Speaker to refuse to put a question which is in order . /z/ In our State Legislature and in Congress , a majority of the whole number of members is necessary to form a quorum , but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day . In the British House of Commons , forty members are sufficient to do business . Societies should always state in their by-laws , the number necessary to constitute a quorum . When , from counting the meeting , on a , division , it appears that there is not a quorum present , there is no decision , but the matter in question continues in the same state in which it was before the division ; and when afterwards resumed , it must be taken up at the precise point . When the President , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide that no member shall leave the meeting without permission of the President , and in many cases fines are imposed for a violation of the rule . Provision on this subject is necessary , in order to prevent a meeting from being left without a quorum . /z/ finds there is not a quorum present , business must be immediately suspended , and if a quorum is not speedily obtained , those present may adjourn. /z/ In announcing that the yeas and nays are ordered to be taken , the President should say ; " The yeas and nays are required by Mr. , and Mr. . The Secretary will call the names of the members . " When the roll has been gone through , the Secretary should read over first the names of those who have answered in the affirmative , and then the names of those who have answered in the negative , in order that if he has made any mistake , it may be corrected at once , and before the result is declared by the President . Every member is bound to vote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in the question at /z/ issue . Any member wishing to be excused from voting , may make a brief verbal statement of his reasons , and the question must then be taken without further debate . This is the usage in Congress . After the yeas and nays have been ordered to be called , and any one member has answered and voted , all further debate is excluded . It is not allowable for any member to change his vote , after the yeas and nays have been called , unless he avers that he voted in mistake . No member can be permitted to vote after the decision has been announced from the chair . If any question arises on a point of order , during a division , or while the yeas and nays are being called , for example , as to the right or the duty of a member to vote , the presiding officer must decide it peremptorily . In a case of this kind there can be no debate . The name of the President should always be called " last. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary , the Presi- /z/ dent will say ; " On agreeing to the motion the yeas are so many , ( naming the number ) the nays are so many it is agreed to , or not agreed to , " as the case may be . In the Legislative bodies of most of the New England States , the votes of the members are given by the members holding up their right hands those in the affirmative vote first , and then those in the negative . This is also the usage in some religious bodies . In Parliament every member is required to give his vote one way or the other . It is not permitted to any one to withdraw , who is in the house when the question is put , nor is any one to be counted in the division who was not in when the question was put . /z/ In Societies where an annual or semiannual election for officers is held , it is usual to provide in the by-laws that the old officers shall retain their places , until the new ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the President to announce , /z/ at the proper time , that the election for officers is the next business in order . Some member will then move that tellers be appointed to conduct the election . When the result is declared by the tellers , the President should repeat the statement , and request the newly elected officers to take their appropriate seats . If re-elected himself , he should make his acknowledgements , and then proceed with the regular business . In Boards of Managers , at the meeting to organize , it is usual to call some gentleman to the chair , for a temporary organization , whom it is not designed to elect as President . When tellers are appointed to count the votes , in an election by ballot , * they should , while counting off , read the votes aloud , so that all who desire may hear and count for themselves . In choosing officers , a majority of the whole number of votes is necessary to effect an election . In all cases where other than members of the House are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tate Legislature , to make a previous nomination . /z/ In our State Legislature , rules for the government of each body are adopted at the commencement of the session . On the day of meeting it is usual to adopt the old rules , for the present , and then to appoint a committee to prepare rules , which committee generally reports in three or four days . The same course may be pursued , with great propriety , in Executive Boards , or Boards of Managers , chosen annually by the members of a Society , by contributors or subscribers . Or , if the old by-laws are entirely satisfactory , they may be adopted by a vote and the appointment of a committee dispensed with . When the by-laws or rules are before the meeting for its action , a majority is sufficient to make an alteration or amendment , but when they have been formally adopted , and are in operation , it usually requires a vote of two-thirds to effect a change or procure a suspension . The joint rules of our State Senate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEMBERS . Ill majority vote , but they can not be altered or suspended without a vote of two-thirds . Societies may or may not renew their bylaws at each annual meeting . The general custom in regular bodies , is , however , to continue them in force without a formal vote . Provision for altering or amending the constitution and by-laws , and for the temporary suspension of a by-law , should be incorporated in the rules of all Societies , Boards of Managers , &c.; /z/ The rules of our State Legislature make no provision for punishing disorderly members , but usage has fully established the right . Disorderly or quarrelsome conduct in the House , contempt of the authority of ttie House , or improper conduct in debate , are punishable offences in the Legislature , as well as in Congress and the British Parliament . The usual punishments are , the exaction of an apology , a public reprimand , or expul- /z/ sion . In the latter case a vote of two-thirds is required . Societies generally make provision for this matter in their by-laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , April 9 , 1840 . A motion was made by Mr. Wilcox and Mr. Park , that the House reconsider the vote on the 7th inst. , on adopting a resolution to expel Thomas B. M ' Elwee , a member from Bedford county , from his seat in the House . Mr. M'E. had been expelled for spitting in the face of a member , on the floor of the House . When Mr. Watts , of Erie , objected to the reception of the motion , alleging that the subject matter was no longer in the power of the House . Whereupon the Speaker submitted to the House for its decision , the question whether the motion to reconsider the said vote is in order , and stated the following facts , viz : " On the 7th inst. , the House of Representatives adopted a resolution by the constitutional majority , two-thirds to expel from his seat in this House , Thomas B. M'Elwee , a member from Bedford county ; whereupon , the Speaker then announced that Thomas /z/ B. M'Elwee , a representative from Bedford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat declared vacated . " And on the question , " Is the motion to reconsider in order ? " it was decided in the affirmative , yeas 46 , nays 36. /z/ In Parliament , the bills are engrossed on one or more long rolls of parchment , sewed together . When a bill is amended on third reading , if a new clause is added , it is done by tacking a separate piece of parchment on the bill , which is called a rider . In the House of Commons , the members vote " aye " or " no . " In the House of Peers , they answer " content , " or " not content . " The king 's answer to the bills presented to him for his approbation , is announced to the House by the clerk in Norman-French . If the king consents to a public bill , the clerk says Le roy le veut ( the king wills it so /z/ to be ; ) if to a private bill , Soit fait comme il est desire ' , ( be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuses his consent , it is in the gentle language of Le roy s'avisera , ( the king will advise upon it . ) The title Speaker , is given to the presiding officer of the House of Commons , because he alone has the right to speak to , or address the king , in the name and in behalf of the House . His salary and perquisites amount to about 8000 per annum . When the House of Commons divides , in order to take a vote , one party goes out , and the other remains in the room . This has made it important which go forth first and which remain , because the latter secure the votes of all the indolent , the indifferent , and the inattentive . Their general rule , therefore , is that those who give their vote for the preservation of the orders of the House , stay in . The one party being gone forth , the Speaker names two tellers from the affirmative , and two from the negative side , who first count those sitting in the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then place themselves within the door , two on each /z/ side , and count those who went forth , as they come in , and report the number to the Speaker . /z/ The French Chamber of Deputies have a full system of rules , embracing ninety-four articles , which , in their leading features , are the same with the English and American . Some of the peculiarities are , that for preliminary investigations , the whole Chamber is divided , by lot , into nine committees , of which the chairmen in every case form a committee of nine members , ( a committee of chairmen , ) which appoints one of its number to make report to the Chamber . Private petitions are either wholly rejected , or delivered to the ministers for consideration . Motions must be put in writing , read , and a day fixed for discussion . All who wish to speak , give in their names to the clerk , and the speakers are heard in turn . The /z/ members do not speak in their places , but from a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but below it . No deputy can speak twice on the same subject . Most of the speeches are read . The Chamber commonly votes by the members on one side of a question rising , and the others remaining seated , and the secretary decides on which side is the majority . But on the passage of laws , the main vote is always taken by balls , in which all the members are called by name ; every one receives a black and a white ball , and votes by casting one of them in an urn . The Chamber of Peers , on the contrary , votes by written yeas and nays . The President keeps order by ringing a bell , and when the members get too disorderly , he puts on his hat . which act adjourns the Chamber for the time being .
