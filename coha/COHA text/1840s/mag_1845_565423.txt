txt Mn . WEBSTER is one of the great men of the age-of gigantic intellect-of deep and inexhaustible resources-a great statesman  --  a profound constitutional lawyer-an unrivalled logical and analogical reasoner-a mighty debater  --  a powerful writer and an eloquent orator . * Mr. Webster 's Plea in favor of the Christian Ministry and of the religious instruction of the young , before the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Stephen Girard 's Will , Feb. 10 , 1844 . It is hard to say which his forte is , because he has so many strong points-whether he shines most , in the senate , in the cabinet , at the bar , or in the popular assembly . To us , we confess , Daniel Webster seems to be about equally great at Plymouth , at the foot of Bunker Hill monument , in the cradle of Liberty at Boston , in the senate chamber , the department of state , and the Supreme court-room at Washington , and amid the deafening cheers of thronging multitudes , wherever // he chooses to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , take him all in all , the greatest man in the nation , we feel safe in saying that he is surpassed by no one ; and put him down where you might , on the other side of the Atlantic , he would stand with the very few , like Saul the Benjamite , who " from the shoulders upward , was higher than any of the people . " Let this tribute , however , which we could not refrain from rendering on so fitting an occasion , pass . Our main design in this article is not to eulogize Mr. Webster , nor to discuss any of the intricate legal questions , involved in the decision of the Supreme Court , confirming the will of the late Stephen Girard , for the establishment of an orphan college near the city of Philadelphia . As good citizens we bow to the decision of the highest judicial tribunal in the land , whose duty it is , not to make the laws , but to expound them . Nor do we enquire into the motives which prompted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , for the endowment of any public charity whatever . These motives we reverently leave with Him , who " trieth the heart and the reins . " Having set apart the enormous sum of two millions of dollars from his vast estate , to erect and endow a college , for the accommodation of at least three hundred orphan scholars , and the requisite number of teachers , he ordered the ground on which it was to be built , consisting of no less than forty-five acres , to be enclosed with a high solid stone wall , capped with marble and lined upon the top with long iron spikes . Mr. Girard , in providing for the government and instruction of his three hundred orphan boys , in all future time , thought proper to insert the following remarkable restrictive clause in his will " I enjoin and require that no ecclesiastic , missionary or minister of any sect whatever , shall ever hold or exercise any station , or duty whatever in said college ; nor shall any such person ever be admitted for any purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of said college . " The ground which Mr. Webster takes , and maintains with all his great abilities , against this extraordinary proscription is , that " in the eye of equitable jurisprudence the devise of Mr. Girard so restricted , is not a charity , entitled to the favor with which such bequests are received and upheld by the courts of Christian countries , but contemplates the establishment of a school on the plain and clear principles of infidelity , and therefore that the will ought to be set aside . " Other points adverse to its validity are taken , but this is the chief . In giving a synopsis of Mr. Webster 's masterly argument , we must of course study brevity , which will deprive our readers of much of the pleasure to be derived from the full report , in the pamphlet of sixty pages now before us . The lofty , moral , and Christian tone of the whole argument , which occupied the Court for nine hours on three successive days , was thrilling and delightful . We can not despair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to resound with such sentiments from the lips of our most illustrious statesmen and gifted advocates . And here let us say , that the decision of the Court , by which our great New England barrister was overruled , does not deduct in the slightest degree from his noble defense of the Christian religion , nor the vital importance of early Christian education , which he so powerfully advocates . Nor , again , does the decision prove that any member of the Supreme Court differed from Mr. Webster on either of these points . The laws of the land often extort judgments from the highest tribunals , which they // would gladly be excused from rendering ; and the only remedy lies , if remedy be necessary , in revised and better legislation . Mr. Webster 's first objection to Girard 's will , is that " it attempts to attach reproach and odium to the whole clergy of the country-to every individual of the profession , without any exception . No minister of the gospel , of any denomination , may ever set foot upon the grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Against every man of the sacred profession , the iron gates are to be closed and barred and bolted . " This exclusion Mr. Webster denounces , ( and how his dark eye flashed when he uttered it , ) " as the most opprobrious , the most insulting and the most unmerited stigma that was ever cast , or attempted to be cast upon the preachers of Christianity , in the whole history of the country. ** " When , where and how , " he indignantly demands , " have they deserved it ? I take it upon myself to say , that in no country in the world , upon either continent , can there be found a body of ministers of the gospel , who perform so much service to man in a full spirit of self-denial , under so little encouragement from government of any kind , and under circumstances always much straitened and often distressed , as the ministers of the gospel in the United States , of all denominations . They form no part of an established order of religion ; they constitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to depend entirely on the voluntary contributions of those who hear them . " And this body of clergymen have shown , to the honor of their own country , and to the astonishment of the hierarchies of the old world , that it is practicable , in free governments , to raise and sustain a body of clergymen , which , for devotedness to their sacred calling , for purity of life and character , for learning , intelligence , piety , and that wisdom which cometh from above , is inferior to none and superior to most others , by voluntary contributions alone . " How common was it in Mr. Jefferson 's palmy days , and how common is it even now , in some quarters , for men of high and commanding political consideration , to speak reproachfully of the clergy , as bigoted , narrow-minded , canting , nasal hypocrites , who are so far from doing any thing to promote the true interests of the country , that no class of men require to be more narrowly and jealously watched than they do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this great American politician and statesman an ignorant or canting eulogist , would be more than the reputation of the bitterest enemies of the Christian ministry , for intelligence and candor , is worth . Let us hear him . " I hope that our learned men have done something for the honor of our literature abroad . I hope that the courts of justice and members of the bar of this country have done something to elevate the character of the profession of the law . I hope the discussions in Congress have done something to meliorate the condition of the human race , to secure and extend the great charter of human rights , and to strengthen and advance the great principles of human liberty . But I contend that no literary efforts , no adjudications , no constitutional discussions , nothing that has been said or done in favor of universal man , has done this country more credit , at home and abroad , than the establishment of our body of clergymen , their support by voluntary contributions , and the general excellence of their character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them is , by Mr. Girard 's devise , denied the privileges which are open to the vilest of our race . Did the man ever live , // who had a respect for the Christian religion , and yet had no regard for any one of its ministers ? Did that system of instruction ever exist , which denounced the whole body of Christian teachers , and yet called itself Christianity ? " I maintain , " continues Mr. Webster , in a noble strain of manly , Christian eloquence , " that in every institution for the instruction of youth , where the authority of God is disowned , and the duties of Christianity derided and despised , and its ministers shut out from all participation in its proceedings , there can no more be charity , true charity , found to exist , than evil can spring out of the Bible , error out of truth , or hatred and animosity come forth from the bosom of perfect love . " No , sir-no , sir ! If charity denies its birth and parentage ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion ; if it turns unbeliever , it is no longer charity , for it separates itself from the fountain of its own creation ! " Mr. Webster then goes on to maintain , with climacteric force and eloquence , ( we give the sense , though not his exact language , ) that this unblest feature in the Girard College is a perfect anomaly . There is nothing like it in the whole history of the Christian religion . A great charity school , in a Christian land , where thousands are to be educated for the duties and trials of life , but which no minister of the gospel , of any denomination , can ever be allowed to enter ! It is monstrous ! It is an insult to high heaven , which the wealth of a kingdom , devoted to the purposes of education , could not atone for . Having proved , as he thinks , that the Girard bequest lacks the essential element of a Christian charity , and ought not to be sanctioned by any court in a Christian land , Mr. Webster proceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who may be so unfor tunate as to be placed in the proposed college . " Now let us look at the condition and prospects of these tender children , who are to be submitted to this experiment of instruction , without Christianity . In the first place , they are orphans-have no parents to guide and instruct them in the way they should go-no father , no religious mother , to lead them to the pure fount of Christianity ; they are orphans . If they were only poor , there might be somebody , bound by the ties of human affection , to look after their spiritual welfare , to see that they imbibed no erroneous opinions on the subject of religion ; the child would have its father or its mother to teach it to lisp the name of its Creator in prayer , or hymn his praise . " But in this experimental school of instruction , if the orphans have any friends or connections able to look after their welfare , it shuts them out . It is made the duty of the governors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it from any after interference on the part of guardians or relations , in any way whatever . " The school , or college , is to be surrounded with high walls , with two gates , and no more . They are to be of iron within , and iron-bound without-thus answering more the description of a castle , than a schoolhouse . The children are to be thus guarded for twelve years , in one great enclosure , and all that is done for their bodily or mental welfare , is to be done within this enclosure . It has been said , that they could attend public worship elsewhere . Where is the proof of this ? There is no provision in the devise , there is nothing said about it in any part of Mr. Girard 's will , and such a privilege would be just as adverse to his whole scheme , as it would be that the doctrines of Christianity should be preached within the walls of the college . // " These children then are taken , before they know the alphabet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then sent out into the world . By this time their character will have been stamped ; for , if there is any truth in the Bible , if there is any truth in those oracles which soar above all human authority , or if any thing be established by the experience of mankind , the character is formed in the first third of human life . And what sort of character is likely to be made by this process-this experimental system of instruction ? " Mr. Girard , as we have seen , enjoins that no ministers of religion of any sects shall be allowed to enter his college , on any pretense whatever . Now it is obvious , that by sects he means Christian sects . Any of the followers of Voltaire or D'Alembert may have admission into this school , whenever they please , because they are not usually spoken of as sects . ' The doors are to be opened to the opposers and revilers of Christianity in every form and shape , and shut to its supporters . While the voice of the upholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the voices of those who impugn Christianity may be raised high and loud , till they shake the marble roof of the building . " They say , on the other side , that infidel teachers will not be admitted into this school . How do they know that ? What is the inevitable tendency of such an education as is here prescribed ? The trustees , if they accept Mr. Girard 's bequest , must carry out the details of his plan . " Now what , " Mr. lATebster earnestly demands , " is likely to be the effect upon the minds of those children , left solely to its pernicious influence , with no one to care for their spiritual welfare , in this world or the next ? They are to be left entirely to the tender mercies of those who will try upon them this experiment of moral philosophy-morality without sentiment-benevolence towards man , without a sense of responsibility towards God . The duties of this life performed without any reference to the life which is to come-this is Mr. Girard 's theory of useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of their education expires . Still , those who survive must be brought up , imbued fully with the inevitable tendencies of the system . " In answer to a suggestion from the other side , that the deficiency might be supplied by lay preachers or teachers , Mr. Webster contends that this would be just as adverse to Mr. Girard 's original object and plan , as to admit professional preachersthat his manifest design was to keep the orphans free from all bias of any kind , in favor of any Christian creed , till they arrived at manhood , as the only effectual guard against sectarianism-that , accordingly , there is no provision in his will for any religious teaching whatever , and that if there were , laymen are just as likely to launch out into sectarian views , and to advance clashing doctrines , as professional preachers , and even more so ; and finally , that there is nothing original in the plan , it being borrowed from Paine 's Age of Reason , where he says , " Let us devise means to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the ancient regime of kings and priests have spread among the people . Let us propagate morality unfettered by superstition . " Here Mr. Webster might have dismissed this part of the subject ; but when he thought of the design of establishing an infidel college with great funds , just in the suburbs of one of our largest cities , for the education , or rather immolation as he regards it , of its orphan children , as long as the marble lasts , his soul was stirred within him , and he proceeded to expose this attack upon the Christian religion through its // ministers , in one of the finest and loftiest strains of Christian remonstrance , that ever was heard in our great national hail of justice , or any other . So just and scriptural are his views on this head , so cogent is the reasoning and so rarely have we an opportunity of enriching our pages with such truly Christian sentiments , from the lips of our most distinguished statesmen and jurists , that we can hardly resist the temptation of quoting much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are quite sure our readers will extend to us more than ordinary indulgence in this case , especially when they recollect how fitting it is , that the NEW ENGLANDEK should do what it can , to embalm the Christian thoughts and reasonings of her most gifted and illustrious men . They will not only bear with us , but we shall receive their thanks for letting Mr. Webster speak , where we might have spoken ourselves . He strongly objects to Mr. Girard 's scheme , as derogatory to Christianity on two grounds . " First , as rejecting it , by rejecting its teachers-by rejecting the ordinary agencies of instilling the Christian religion into the minds of the young . He who rejects the ordinary means of accomplishing an end , intends to defeat that end itself , or else he has no meaning . This is strictly true , where the end rests on divine authority , and human agency devises and uses the means . But if the means themselves be of divine authority also , then the rejection of them is direct rejection of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I suppose there is nothing in the New Testament more clearly established , than the appointment of the Christian ministry . The world was to be evangelized , was to be brought out of darkness into light , by the influences of the Christian religion , spread and propagated by the instrumentality of man . A Christian ministry was appointed by the author of the Christian religion himself , and it stands on the same authority , as any other part of his religion . When the lost sheep of the house of Israel were to be brought to the knowledge of Christianity , the disciples were commanded to go forth and preach , the kingdom of heaven is at hand . ' And after his resurrection , in the appointment of the great mission to the whole human race , he commanded his disciples to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature . ' This was one of his last commands , and one of his last promises was , Lo , I am with you alway , even to the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing set forth more authentically in the New Testament , than the appointment of a Christian ministry . And why should we shut our eyes to the whole history of Christianity ? Is it not the preaching of the ministers of the gospel , that has evangelized the more civilized parts of the world ? Why do we this day enjoy the lights and benefits of Christian . ity ourselves ? Do we not owe it to the instrumentality of the Christian ministry ? The ministers of Christianity , departing from Asia Minor , traversing Asia , Africa and through Europe , to Iceland , Greenland and the poles of the earth ; suffering all things , enduring all things , hoping all things , raising men every where from the ignorance of idol worship , to the knowledge of the true God , and every where bringing life and immortality to light through the gospel , have only been acting in obedience to the divine instruction . They were commanded to go forth ,  --  they have gone forth , and they still go forth . And descending from kingdoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we not all know , that wherever Christianity has been carried , and wherever it has been taught by human agency , that agency was the agency of ministers of the gos // pel ? It is all idle and mockery , to pretend , that any man has respect for the Christian religion , who yet derides , reproaches and stigmatizes all its ministers and teachers . It is all idle , it is a mockery and an insult to common sense , to maintain that a school for the instruction of youth , from which Christian instruction by Christian teachers is sedulously and rigorously shut out , is not deistical and infidel , both in its purpose and its tendency . ' * What a noble testimony by one of the most distinguished laymen in the country , to the divine origin of the Christian ministry and of Christian missions . Let who will sneer , whether they be avowed infidels or pseudo-Christians , at the great missionary enterprise now in progress for the conversion of the world , we have a pledge in this truly Christian plea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause in the most public and decided manner . Nor is he less clear and decided on another point , of which most of the great lawgivers and statesmen of Christian nations make but little account . lie maintains that Mr. Girard 's scheme of education is essentially wrong , because it proceeds upon the presumption , that the Christian religion is not the only true foundation , or any necessary foundation of morals . " The ground taken , " says Mr. Webster , " is , that religion is not necessary to morality ; that benevolence may be insured by habit , and that all the virtues may flourish , and be safely left to the chance of flourishing , without touching the waters of the living spring of human responsibility . Now it has been held by the Christian world throughout its broadest extent , and is held as a fundamental truth , that moral instruction not resting on this basis is only a building upon sand . And in what age of the Christian era , have those who professed to teach the Christian religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted on the absolute necessity of inculcating its principles and its precepts into the minds of the young ? In what age , by what sect , when , where , by whom has religious truth been excluded from the education of youth ? No wherenever . Every where and at all times , it has been and is regarded as essential . It is of the essence , of the vitality of useful instruction . From all this , Mr. Girard dissents . He dissents not only from all the sentiments of Christian mankind , from all common experience , and from the results of all experience , but he dissents also from still higher authority  --  the word of God itself . When the Decalogue was . given to the Jews , what said the inspired lawgiver ? - that it should be kept from children ? Far , far otherwise . And these words which I command thee this day , shall be in thine heart . And thou shalt teach them diligently to thy children , and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou liest down , and when thou risest up . ' " There is an authority , " continues Mr. Webster , " still more imposing and awful . When little children were brought into the presence of the Son of God , his disciples proposed to send them away ; but he said , suffer little children to come unto me-unto me . ' He did not send them first for lessons in morals to the schools of the Pharisees , but he opened at once to the youthful mind , the everlasting fountain of living waters , the only source of immortal truth . Suffer little children to come unto me . And that injunction is of perpetual obligation . It addresses itself to-day with the same earnestness , the same authority , which attended its first utterance to the Christian world . It extends to the ends of the earth . It will reach to the end of time , always and every where sounding in // the ears of men , with an emphasis which no repetition can weaken , and with an authority which nothing can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " And not only , " adds Mr. Webster , with thrilling and deep-toned earnestness , " not only my heart and my judgment , my belief and my conscience instruct me , that this great precept should be obeyed , but the idea is so sacred , the thoughts so crowd upon me , it is so utterly at variance with this system of philosophical morality which we have heard advocated , that I stand and speak here , in fear of being influenced by my feelings to exceed the proper line of my professional . duty . Go thy way at this time , ' is the language of philosophical morality , and I will send for thee at a more convenient season . ' This is the language of Mr. Girard in his wilL In this there is neither religion nor reason . Ever since the introduction of Christianity , it has been the effort of the great and the good , to sanctify human knowledge , to bring it to the fount , and to baptize learning into Christianity ; to gather up all its productions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fruits , and lay them all upon the altar of religion and virtue . " Never did this great man honor himself more , than when he gave utterance to these noble sentiments . Whatever other productions of his mighty intellect may perish and be forgotten , this plea for the Christian ministry and for Christian education , will go down to the true golden age of the world , when " the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord , as the waters cover the sea . " Nor does he reason less cogently and eloquently in favor of the Lord 's day and its appropriate instructions , as essential to Christian education . " The observance of the Sabbath , " he maintains , " is a part of Christianity in all its forms . All Christians admit that there is a Lord 's day ; but what becomes of it in Mr. Girard 's scheme ? Now , I say , that the ordinary observance of it could not take place , because the ordinary means of observing it are excluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for there are no means for attaining that end . It will be said , that the children would be permitted to go out . There is nothing seen of this permission in Mr. Girard 's will . And I say again , that it would be just as much opposed to his whole scheme , to allow them to go out and attend places of public worship on the Sabbath day , as it would be to have ministers of religion preach to them within the walls ; because if they go out to hear preaching , they will hear just as much about religious controversies and clashing doctrines , and more , than if appointed preachers officiated in the College . Where then are these little children to go , where can they go to learn the truth  --  to reverence the Sabbath ? They are far from their friends-they have none to accompany them to any place of worship-no one to show them the right from the wrong course-their minds must be kept clear from all bias on the subject , and they are just as far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no Sabbath day at all . And where there is no observance of the Christian Sabbath , there will of course be no public worship of God . " In summing up this part of the argument , Mr. Webster seriously and earnestly asks , " Are there or will there be any Christian parents , who would desire that their children should be placed in this school , to be for twelve years exposed to the pernicious influence which must be brought to bear on their minds ? I very much doubt if there be a Christian father who hears me this day , and I am quite sure there is // no Christian mother , who if called upon to lie down on the bed of death , although sure to leave their children as poor as children can be left , who would not rather trust them to the Christian charity of the world , however uncertain it has been said to be , than to place them where their physical wants and comforts would be abundantly attended to , but away from the solaces and consolations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , this school is not to be valned , because it has not the chastening influences of true religion-because it has no fragrance of the spirit of Christianity . It is not a charity , for it has not that which gives to a charity for education its chief value . It will soothe the heart of no Christian parent , dying in poverty and distress , that those who owe to him their being may be fed and clothed by Mr. Girard 's bounty , at the expense of being excluded from all the means of religious instruction afforded to other children , and shut up , through the most interesting period of their lives , without religion and with moral sentiments as cold as its own marble walls . " Mr. Webster next proceeds , through several pages of searching argument and appeal , to consider the reasons assigned by Mr. Girard , for excluding ministers of all denominations from his school . On p. 37 , he says , evidently with great emotion , " The consolations of religion can never be administered to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it is said , that a dying child may be carried out beyond the walls of the school . He can be carried out to a hostelry or hovel , and there receive those rites of the Christian religion which can not be performed within the walls , even in his dying hour ! Is not all this shocking ? What a stricture is it upon this whole scheme ! What an utter condemnation ! A dying youth can not receive religious solace within his seminary of learning ! " Mr. Girard 's grand argument for excluding all religious teachers and teaching from his college-that they should be left free from wrong bias and without any religious opinions at all till they come out of the school , so as to choose for themselves , Mr. Webster disposes of in the following masterly style . " We will suppose the case of a youth of eighteen who has just left this school , and has gone through an education of philosophical morality precisely in accordance with the views and expressed wishes of the donor . He comes then into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day perhaps , after leaving the school , he comes into a court of law to give testimony as a witness . Sir , I protest , that by such a system he would be disfranchised . He is asked , What is your religion ? ' His reply is , 0 , I have not yet chosen any ; I am going to look round and see which suits me best . ' He is asked , Are you a Christian ? ' He replies , That involves religious truths , and as yet I have not been allowed to entertain any . Again , Do you believe in a future state of rewards and punishments ? ' and he answers , That involves sectarian controversies which have carefully been kept from me . ' Do you believe in the existence of God ? ' He answers , that there are clashing doctrines involved in these things , which he has been taught to have nothing to do with ; that the belief in the existence of a God being one of the first questions in religion , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , it ' is vain to talk about the destructive tendency of such a system ; to argue upon it , is to insult the understanding of every man . It is mere , sheer low , ribald , vulgar deism and infidelity . " It opposes all that is in heaven // and all on earth , that is worth being on earth . It destroys the connecting link between the creature and the Creator . It opposes that great system of universal benevolence and goodness that binds man to his Maker . No religion till he is eighteen ! What would be the condition of all your families-of all our children-if religious fathers and religious mothers were to teach their sons and daughters no religious tenets till they were eighteen ? What would become of their morals , their excellence , their purity of heart and life , their hope for time and eternity ? What would become of all those thousand ties of sweetness , benevolence , love and Christian feeling , that now render our young men and young maidens like comely plants growing up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opening manhood-of blossoming womanhood ? What would become of all that now renders the social circle lovely and beloved ? What would become of society itself ? flow could it exist ? And is that to be a charity which strikes at the root of all this ; which subverts all the excellence and the charms of social life ; which tends to destroy the very foundation framework of society , both in its practices and in its opinions-that subverts the whole decency , the whole morality , as well as the whole Christianity and government of society . No , sir ; no , sir . " Having gone over other points in the case , Mr. Webster thus closes his argument . " I believe that men sometimes do mischief , not only beyond their intent , but beyond the ordinary scope of their talents and ability . In my opinion , if Mr. Girard had given years to the study of a mode by which he could dispose of his vast fortune , so that no good could arise to the general cause of charity-no good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which should be most productive of protracted struggles , troubles and difficulties in the popular councils of a great city , he could not so effectuaRy have attained that result , as he has by this devise now before the court . It is not the result of good fortunes , but of bad fortunes , which have overridden and cast down whatever of good might have been accomplished by a different disposition . I believe that this plan , this scheme was unblest in all its purposes . Unwise in all its frame and theory , while it lives it will lead an annoyed and troubled life , and leave an unblessed memory when it dies . If I could persuade myself that this court would come to such a decision , as in my opinion the public good and the law require , and if I could believe that any humble effort of my own , had contributed in the least to lead to such a result , I should deem it the crowning mercy of my professional life . " Nothing that Mr. Webster has ever done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer remembered than this noble defense of Christian education . Though the law , as we are bound to presume , was against him , and he lost his case with the court in its judicial capacity , quite sure we are , that he gained it with the brilliant throng which hung with breathless admiration upon his lips . No one of his many great efforts , no three days of his life , we confidently believe , will afford him more satisfaction in the review upon his death bed . May he then and there enjoy those rich consolations , which the hopes of the gospel alone can give , and which he so feelingly and eloquently pleads should be administered to the dying orphans in the contemplated college , but which by the will of its founder , must be forever withheld from their ears . The heartfelt approbation with which the plea before us has been read , by the wise and good in all parts of the land , is worth infinitely // more , silent though it be , than the plaudits of millions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his religion from all the high places of power and influence . And why is it that sentiments like those which we have quoted above , drop so seldom and so charily from the lips of our public men , the lawgivers and the law expounders of this great Christian republic ? It is not that legislation and legal practice offer no fitting occasions for the discussion of those great moral and religious principles , which lie at the foundation of individual and national security and happiness . Phis is not a heathen , nor a Mohammedan , nor an infidel nation . Christianity is the common law of the land . It was so infused and incorporated into all our institutions , by the great and good men who founded this republic , that they must stand or fall together . Every nation has some religion , either true or false ; and ( where letters are known at all ) has some hook , or books , which it counts sacred . Our sacred book is not the Koran , nor the Shasters , nor the miscalled Age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sectarian , but a national book . And why should our public men , our honored and gifted senators and representatives and lawyers  --  the sentinels upon the watchtowers of liberty  --  the constituted guardians of our glorious birthright -- why should they be afraid to name and stand by the Bible as the sheet-anchor , to save us from drifting upon the quicksands , which have swallowed up all other republics ? Mr. Webster is not afraid nor ashamed to defend the Christian religion , in the most public and emphatic manner . He is proud of standing side by side with the immortal Washington , and endorsing that memorable paragraph in his farewell address , which as much as any thing he ever wrote , will endear his memory to the latest posterity . " Of all the dispositions and hab its which lead to political prosperity , religion and morality are indispensable supports . In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism , who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happinessthese firmest props of the duties of men and citizens . The mere politician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to cherish them . A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity . Let it simply be asked , where is the security for property , for reputation , for life , if a sense of religious obligation desert the oaths , which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice ? And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion . Whatever may *e conceded to the influence of refined education , on minds of peculiar structure , reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail , in exclusion of religious principles . " In maintaining the importance of religious education , before the Supreme Court of the United States , Mr. Webster goes even farther than this . He incidentally alludes in no equivocal terms , to " life and immortality , as brought to light by the gospel , " and to those preparations for a happy future state , which can never he made without the aids of Christian instruction . And why , we ask again , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitate , when suitable opportunities offer , to speak out as fully and frankly as he did ? But how seldom does any thing drop from their lips , from which we can determine with certainty that they even believe in the divine origin of Christianity . The Bible indeed is not seldom quoted in the halls of legislation , at the bar and in popular harangues , but how much oftener to give point to a witticism , than to enforce a grave argument , or fortify // moral principle . What do we find in the annual executive message to both houses of Congress , beyond certain stereotyped recognitions of a beneficent Providence , under whose smiles we are growing up to a gigantic national manhood . How few men in our public councils dare to speak , or at any rate do speak out their Christian sentiments , on such great moral questions as robbing the poor Indians of their territory and their fathers ' sepulcherstransporting and opening the mails on the Lord 's day , and precipitating a vast foreign slave territory upon these United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the bottom of infamy and perdition . Now why this hesitancy , this shyness , on the part of so many Christian legislators ? What have the friends of the Bible , the friends of religion and morality , to fear from the honest advocacy of the immutable principles of right and wrong ? What need of reserve , what occamon for quaking , lest they should be branded as canting hypocrites , or dreamy fanatics ? Why not stand up fearlessly , and meet the opprobrium , and shake it off , if it must come ? Who sneered at Mr. Webster , for the avowal of his religious opinions in the crowded court-room ; or who ever respected Mr. Frelingbuysen the less , for standing forth boldly as a religious man , ( which he always did , ) in the senate chamber ? It is not by shrinking from religious responsibility , but by meeting it in a bold and dignified manner , that Christians in high and honorable stations are to secure the respect of the irreligious , who are never afraid to show their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as valiant for the truth , as many of the opposite stamp are against it ? It were possible , no doubt , for good men to err on the other side . They might obtrude their religious scruples and opinions upon courts and senates , without regard to times and cir cumstances . They might cast down their pearls , with the certainty of seeing them " trampled under foot . " They might use cant phrases , or fall into homilitic exhortations . Thus might the lawyer or the senator expose himself to the profane merriment of vulgar skepticism , and bring dishonor upon religion itself . We plead for no such license . But we must insist , that in legislating for a Christian people , occasions will often arise , when the sanctions of the Bible ought to he brought in , as paramount to all human wisdom and policy ; and when no Christian in public life should hesitate to speak , as well as act , in agreement with the principles of the Gospel . That day , so fervently to be prayed for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ruling in the fear of God , " we may not live to behold ; but it will come , and may the Lord hasten it in his time . Here we might close the present article , having accomplished our main design , which was to recommend Mr. Webster 's earnest and eloquent plea for Christian education , in God 's appointed way , and to lay before our readers the longest extracts that our limits would allow . We can not dismiss the subject , however , without offering some of the reflections which it has suggested to our minds . The building and liberal endowment of a seminary of learning , on a large scale , is a noble act . We hardly know how a man of princely fortune could do better , than by appropriating a portion of it to so meritorious an object . And especially is such a devise as that of Mr. Girard to be commended , when the children of the poor are to receive the benefits of it , provided , always , that it be not hedged about with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every man has a right to do what he will with his own property , it is not morally , nor even legally true . Were a notori // ous gambler to build a splendid marble palace , avowedly for gambling purposes , in the city of New York or Philadelphia , and to appropriate half a million of dollars , to initiate young clerks and apprentices into all the diabolical mysteries of the art , it would not be tolerated for an hour . The city authorities would shut it up at once . And were the proprietor to insist , ever so loudly , " I have a right to do what I will with my own , " they would quickly settle the question with this answer : " Your establishment is a public nuisance . It is directly calculated to corrupt the morals of the rising generation , which you have no right to do . The property is yours to sell , or give away , or , if you retain it , to use it for lawful purposes , but for no other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bostoa or Cincinnati , to leave a million of dollars to build and endow a college , for teaching poor orphan boys the art of picking locks , or making counterfeit money , would the civil authorities allow such a seminary to go into operation ? Most certainly they would not . In these , and a thousand other supposable cases , the law would interfere to prevent any man from doing what he pleased with his own money . On the other hand , no earthly power may thwart or embarrass a man in the disposal of his property , so long as it neither corrupts the morals nor invades the rights of others . If you think he is wickedly or foolishly wasting " his Lord 's goods , " you may reason with him , you may advise , you may remonstrate . But when you have exhausted your moral suasion , you have done . You can go no further . If a rich banker , for example , should choose to build a palace for the bats and the spiders to inhabit , or to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would he a great waste , to be sure , and it would be recorded against him in the book of God 's remembrance . But it would be an offense of which no human tribunal can take cognizance . A man of fortune has an undoubted legal right to direct , that after his decease , a part or the whole of his estate shall be appropriated for the erection and endowment of a public seminary , upon the most liberal scale of expenditure . Under this right , Mr. Girard thought proper to set apart two millions of dollars , for the purposes just mentioned ; the college to be built in or near the city of Philadelphia . The work was commenced , upon a magnificent plan , soon after his death . Various causes have retarded the enterprise ; but we understand the buildings are to be finished and the college is to be organized as soon as the state of the funds will allow . The great question is settled . The Supreme Court has decided that it is a " charity , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently , can hinder its going into full operation . We can not retard the work a moment , if we would , and we ought not , if we could , provided that it promises to be made a useful institution . But we think , that if it was Mr. Girard 's design to benefit the city of Philadelphia to the full value of that part of his vast estate , which he devoted to the purposes of education , he committed a great mistake , in ordering the erection of a college for the exclusive benefit of orphan boys . There are thousands of other poor boys , in every great city , quite as destitute as the orphans . Had he appropriated his two millions of dollars for the support of five or ten free schools , somewhat after the pattern of the free schools of Boston , who can help seeing , that infinitely more good might have been done ? His heart , however , was set upon building one great charitable seminary ; and he chose to restrict its privileges to one class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to do . Whether his trustees have been as economical as he intended they // should be , in the plan and finish of the buildings , is a question which we have not the means of answering . All we know is , that they have been charged by some with great extravagance . In point of fact , the main edifice , when finished , will be the most costly structure , for educational purposes , in the United States . When , despite our clerical garb , we some time ago crossed its ample threshold , and traversed its magnificent apartments , we could not help asking ourselves , Is this the palace in which orphan boys are to be educated , to prepare them for the hard service and humble stations to which they are destined in future life ? Is it wise , is it benevolent , to take homeless and parentless children from the lanes and cellars of a populous city , to feed and clothe and educate them under the ablest masters , from eight to twelve years , in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will they insensibly form here ? How will they feel when they come to bid adieu to these lofty colonnades-these shady and graveled walks-these enchanted grounds , and to find their homes under lowly roofs , with hard toil and coarse fare ? What sort of apprentices will these boys make , going directly , as it is expected they will , from this marble palace into the humble workshops of the city ? Will they be contented ? Will they submit to all the toil and confinement by which their respective trades are to be acquired ? Will they make sober , industrious and useful members of society , or will they , in disgust , break away from their masters , and recklessly " seek their fortunes , " in roving idleness and dissipation ? We confess , that the more we reflect upon the subject , the stronger is our conviction that Mr. Girard 's College must and will prove a splendid failure . We ask our readers to look for one moment at the condition of his will . He requires , that when the boys " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , they shall then be bound out by the mayor , aldermen and citizens of Philadelphia , or under their directions , to suitable occupations , as those of agriculture , navigation , arts , mechanical trades and manufactures , according to their capacities and acquirements . " Now we do not believe it possible to carry out such a scheme , permanently and usefully , any where . It will be found , we are confident , that when the poor orphan boys of the Girard College are old enough to leave it and be apprenticed , as he directs , they will , with very few exceptions , feel quite above their condition and prospects in life . Bind them out at eighteen , or fourteen , you may , but you can not keep them . You have brought them up in a pal . ace . Every want has been supplied , without a thought or effort of their own . They are as entirely unaccustomed to labor , as if they were the sons of noblemen , and they will never brook it . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and geography , and figures , than other poor boys of their age , they will not succeed half so well in the world . They will never be half so industrious , happy , or respectable . It will take some years for the system to work out its natural results ; but they will begin to be developed , as soon as any considerable number of the boys are bound out , and we put it down as a moral certainty , that in less than a quarter of a century , there will be a general and settled conviction on the public mind , that the Girard College can not answer the great end for which it was professedly established . It may be kept up a great while ; for what else can the trustees do with the funds  --  but in our soberest judgment , experience will ultimately convince all candid minds , that it had been better for the poor orphan boys of Philadelphia , if it had never been thought of . Strenuous advocates // as we are and ever have been for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as of the rich , we should be very sorry to have the wealthy men of other cities follow Mr. Girard 's example , hy founding colleges exclusively for the education of poor children , whether orphans , or others . They are not the institutions which the lower class of a city population want . Free schools , open to all and of so high a character as to attract all , are the seminaries which should be cherished by public and private munificence . Nothing could be more anti-republican than a general separation of the rich from the poor , or the poor from the rich , in our schools and colleges . With regard to that remarkable clause in the twenty first section of Mr. Girard 's will , which peremptorily " enjoins and requires , that no ecclesiastic , missionary , or minister of any sect whatsoever , shall ever hold or exercise any station or duty whatever , in the said college , nor shall any such person ever he admitted , for any purpose , or as a visitor , within the premises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of his meaning and motives . But it does strike us very much as it did Mr. Webster . It betrays a jealousy of the whole body of Christian ministers , which goes beyond any thing we ever met with . No missionary or minister of any sect , shall ever be admitted for any purpose ! Laymen of all religions and of no religion , may be employed as teachers ; may hold the office of visitors ; may come and go at their pleasure ; but no minister of the gospel may ever pass the threshold ! Against all such the iron gates are to be closed forever . No minister may ever pray there , or utter a word of consolation , or even enter there , though half the orphans were on their death-beds . Whatever Mr. Girard 's motives might be , it is difficult for us to imagine , how he could more cruelly have aspersed the characters of the public teachers of Christianity . And we should be glad to know , what confidence his orphans , after they leave the college , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be likely to have in the men , who during the whole period of their education , were peremptorily excluded from the premises . And again ; we are curious to learn , how Mr. Girard expected to keep out every minister of the gospel , who might chance , like any other stranger , to visit Philadelphia and the public institutions in its immediate vicinity . It always requires means to accomplish ends . Mr. Girard was not the man to amuse himself , by making people stare at startling provisions in his last will and testament , which were never to be enforced . He meant what he said . He meant that no clergyman should ever darken the door of his college . The whole body of ecclesiastics of every name , were to be forever shut out . But how was this to be done ? Did he expect , that all the ministers of this and every future age , who might wish to visit his college , would first read through the twenty six sections of his will , and having the fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own accord ? Or is Procul , procul , pro . fani , to be chiselled into the everlasting marble over the vestibule , to warn off every missionary or minister , who might otherwise unwittingly ask for admittance to view the premises ? If not , then may we be pardoned for asking , in our extreme simplicity , what sort of janitor is to guard the door , and what kind of ordeal , every stranger is to pass through before he can be admitted ? It is a great deal truer that " a man is known by the company he keeps , " than by the cloth which he wears . If all ministers , therefore , are to be excluded , it must be in one of these two ways . Either a door-keeper must be found , who can distinguish a minister from all other men , as soon as he sees him , or every visitor // must undergo a formal examination before he can be allowed to pass . " Sir , are you an ecclesiastic , missionary , or minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then you may come in . " In another the same question. - Answer , " Yes , it is my privilege to preach the everlasting gospel . " " It is my duty then to inform you , that you can not he admitted . This college is full of poor orphan boys who have not yet chosen their religious tenets and we are afraid of you . " " But I wish merely to look at the halls and galleries and lecture rooms and library and cabinet and whatever else is most interesting to a passing stranger . The boys I do not know , nor have I the slightest design of obtruding my religious opinions upon them . " " All this may be very true , " replies Mr. Girard 's incorruptible janitor , " hut my orders are peremptoryyou are by your own confession , a minister , of some religious tenets or other , and you can not be adrnitted . " Do any of our readers smile at the ludicrous absurdity of such an examination , through the wicket gate of Girard College ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , if it means any thing . And this we will venture to say , is the first time since " the worlds were made , " that such a restriction was ever imposed . What ! build a great college for the education of the young immortals of a thronged city , and shut all the ministers of religion forever out of it ! It is monstrous ! Did Mr. Girard consider what he was doing ? How could he expect to rest quietly in his grave after leaving such a clause as that which we have quoted from his will ? Why was he not afraid , that some of his orphans , in distress for their souls , would one day knock at the door of his sepulcher so loud as to make all his bones quake , and demand of him to take off the restriction ? The question has forced itself upon us more than ten times since we began this article-How is Mr. Girard 's unconquerable prejudice against the whole Christian ministry to be accounted for ? And the most charitable explanation we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , a native of France and bred a Catholic . He probably formed his judgment of the whole clerical profession , by what he knew of Romish priests and jesuits . Had be taken the trouble to acquaint himself with the character of Protestant ministers in this country , we can not believe that he would have shut them all out of his college . Though they have had free access to every public institution , for the education of youth , from the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers to this day , their bitterest enemies may be challenged to adduce a single case in which ministers of different sects have gone into a seminary and urged their conflicting views upon the students , for the purposes of proselytism . Verily , it would be " a new thing under the sun , " to find first a Presbyterian preacher , and then a Baptist , and then a Methodist going into an orphan asylum or school , to see how many of the boys they could bring over to their distinctive tenets . Nothing is more common than for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternately , in the various public institutions of our large cities ; but when and where have they ever set up " altar against altar , " in these pious and benevolent labors ? Mr. Girard did not know them . They are not the narrow-minded bigots and fiery zealots , who can not enter an orphan school without infecting its inmates with their own bad spirit , and who must therefore be kept out by high walls , iron gates , and sleepless sentinels . What a strange anomaly , in a Christian country and Christian city , is this Girard College . There it stands , the most attractive object in all the neighborhood . As soon as it is opened it is to be filled with // three hundred poor orphan boys ; but they are never to hear the voice of a preacher ; never to see the face of a minister within its marble walls . If it should stand a thousand years , as it may , and hundreds of orphans should die in the sick room , no whisper of consolation is ever to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no prayer ever to be offered by a minister of our holy religion ! Will God smile upon such a scheme as this ? Who can believe it ? It was said indeed , in answer to Mr. Webster , by the able counsel , Mr. Binney and Mr. Sergeant on the other side , that the place of regularly authorized ministers may be supplied by " lay teachers , " and that the trustees of the college , will no doubt provide for the moral and religious instruction of the scholars , with a conscientious regard to their high trust . God graut that they may . Rarely has a more responsible trust been devolved upon a city corporation ; and let us believe that they will do what they can , to avert the evils , which Mr. Webster so vividly predicts and deplores . If Mr. Girard 's plan is carried out and his college becomes permanently established , it will prove a blessing or a curse to the community ; and this will depend greatly on the policy of its legal governors and guardians . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide for the moral and Christian instruction of the boys , through the agency of pious laymen ; and let them know that fhe eyes of thousands , who anxiously await the result of the experiment , are upon them . If in organizing their faculty they select able and good men to fill the several departments , who will conscientiously lay down the great principles of Christianity as the bases of all their instructions-if the poor orphans under their guardianship are faithfully instructed in the all important truths of natural and revealed religion-if they are taught Vel . III . 14 to read the Bible and keep the Sabbath ; to " do justly , love mercy and walk humbly with God , " the fears which now disquiet so many of the most enlightened and benevolent minds will be allayed , and the wise and good of all Christian denominations will rejoice , though their ministers are forbidden to have any part or lot in the instruction . But if the mayor , aldermen and citizens of Philadelphia should ever become recreant to their high trust ; if men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offices of government and instruction , or if , according to Mr. Girard 's plan , the students should he virtually hindered from adopting any religious tenets till they go out , in the headstrong maturity of their passions , to meet the temptations of a wicked world ; why then , we say , if such should ever be the moral delinquencies of the governors and teachers of Girard College , let its doors forever be closed-let no poor orphan child ever enter the great moral sepulcher . If the college through neglect or design , is to be the handmaid and nursery of infidelity , in any of its seductive forms , let it " become like Babylon , an utter desolation . " " Let it never be inhabited nor dwelt in , from generation to generation . " Rather than it should stand to curse the city , and to curse the country , by nurturing up and sending out its malign agencies to sow the land with worse than dragon 's teeth , let every human being flee from it , " let wild beasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " full of doleful creatures , " " let owls dwell there and satyrs dance there , let the wild beasts of the island cry in the desolate houses , and dragons in the pleasant palaces . Do we speak too strongly ? Who will say it , when the far reaching results of Christian education on the one hand , and the neglect of it on the other , come to be disclosed at the last day ?
