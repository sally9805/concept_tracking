txt Thus the hope thaUlie ghost 's tale may e false , and the fear that it may be true , unite to send him in quest of other proofs . The probability seems at once too strong to justify the abandonment , and too weak to justify the execution of the deed . The truth is , the ghost develops Hamlet , and the development it works within him is at war with the injunction it lays upon him . Its supernatural revelations bring forth into clearer apprehension some moral ideas which before were but dim presentimeats within him ; and its requisitions are thwarted by the very truths which it suggests and unfolds to him , and by the train of reflections which it sets a-going in his mind . Under the disclosures made to him from beyond the grave , his mind attaias a kind or degree of development not ordinarily vouchsafed to our earthly being . It is as if he were born into the other world before dying out of this . But the words from that other world must be confirmed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust in them ; and therefore " The play 's the thing Wherein he 'll catch the conscience of he king . " When , however , he has caught the king 's conscience ; when , by holding the mirror up to his soul , he has forced " his occulted guilt " to " unkennel itself ; " along with certainty of the crime , he gains food for still further reflection . The demonstration of his uncle 's guilt arrests the very purpose for which that demonstration was sought . His own conscience is but startled into a dread of the retribution he has disclosed in the conscience of another . He has sought grounds of punishment in the manifestations of remorse ; and the very proofs which , to his mind , justify the inVOL . I. NO . II . *Ew SERIES . 9 flicting of death , themselves spring from a worse death than he has power to inflict . It is thus that Hamlet is distracted with a purpose which he is at once too good a son to dismiss , and too good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows not what to do , he casts about , now for excuses , now for censures , of his non-performance ; and religion prevents him from doing what filial piety reproves him for omitting . While he dare not abandon the design of killing the king , he is at the same time morally incapable of forming any plan for doing it . He can only do it , and he does only attempt it , under a sudden frenzy of excitement , caused by some immediate provocation ; not so much acting as being acted upon ; as an instrument of Providence , rather than as a self-determining agent . And this view of Hamlet is rather confirmed than otherwise by the motives which he assigns for sparing the king , when he finds him praying . That these motives , too horrible even for a fiend to entertain , are not his real motives , is evident from their extravagance ; for if such motives would keep him from doing the deed then , assuredly no motives could have kept him from doing it before . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings without violating his conscience . He thus effects a compromise between his religion and his affection , by adjourning a purpose which the one will not suffer him to execute , nor the other to abandon . The question , " Is it not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm ? " which he afterwards puts to Horatio , while relating the king 's plot against his own life , proves that he had not even then overcome his moral repugnance to the deed . Properly speaking , therefore , Hamlet lacks not force of will , as some have argued , but only force of self-will ; that is , his will is strictly subjecjed to his reason and conscience , and is of course powerless when it comes in conflict with them ; where they impede not his volitions , he seems , as 1848. 121 // Hamlet . hath been said , all will . We are apt to es*timate men 's force of will according to what they do ; but we ought often to estimate it according to what they do not do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of will , than to go ahead ; and the peculiarity of this representation consists in the hero 's being so placed , that his will has its proper exercise not so much in acting as in thinking . in this way the working of his whole mind is rendered as anomalous as his situation ; and this is just what the subject demands . Moreover , in the perfect harmony of the will and the reason , force of will would naturally disappear altogether ; for in that case , the will being entirely subject to the law , nothing but the law would be visible in our conduct . And yet , to preserve or restore this harmony of will and reason , is undoubtedly the greatest achievement in human power . Thus the highest possible exercise of will is in renouncing itself , and taking the law instead ; so that , paradoxical as it may seem , he may be justly said to have most strength of will , who has , or rather shows , none at all . Hamlet is equal to the performance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and he can not act for the simple reason , that he has equal " respect unto all " the duties of his situation . In a *word , his inability is purely of a moral , not of a complexional kind ; and this inability is only another name for the highest sort of power . Hence , doubtless , as some one has remarked , Hamlet would seem greater , were he not so great . In his thoughts , and feelings , and principles , he soars so far above our ordinary standards of greatness , as to dwarfhimself by the distance . He who ruleth his spirit is greater than he who taketh a city , but he who taketh a city seems greater than he who ruleth his spirit . We , in our littleness , estimate greatness by the noise it makes : true greatness moves in harmony , false greatness in conflict , with the moral order of things ; the conflict is loud , but the harmony is still . Why , Christianity , when first published , made infinitely less noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven , the latter came from nowhere , or from a worse place ; that has re'rolutionized the world , this has done Feb. , and can do nothing but kill time , or rather , kill mind awhile , and then die itself . Who strives only to do what he ought , is silent even in his achievements ; he whose only strife is to do what he *can , is noisy even in his failures : his noise indeed is a sign he is failing ; if he were going to succeed , he would be sure to keep still about it , because , in order to succeed , he must work in depths where the ear can not penetrate . It is what acts on the surface that makes a noise ; it is what works in the centre that . does something . Who has ever heard the sun shine ? who has not heard a straw-fire blaze ? " Rightly to be great , Is , not to stir without great argument ; But greatly to find quarrel in a straw , When honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us , is Hamlet 's greatness , and not the less truly his , because he disclaims it . Hamlet , indeed , is emphatically greater than he knows . The man that is not greater than he knows is a very small affair ! Hamlet , itis true , is continually charging the fault of his situation on himself . Herein is involved one of the finest strokes in the whole delineation . True virtue never publishes itself ; it does not even know itself . Radiating from the heart through all the functions of life , its transpirations are so free , and smooth , and deep , as to escape the ear of consciousness . Hence people are generally aware of their virtue in proportion as they have it not . We are apt to estimate the merit of our good deeds according to the struggles we make in doing them ; whereas , the greater our virtue , the less we shall have to struggle in order to do them , and it is purely the weakness and imperfection of our virtue that makes it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he who does no duty without being goaded up to it , is conscious of much more virtue than he has ; while he who does eve.ry duty as a thing of course and a matter of delight , is unconscious of his virtue simply because he has so much of it . Moreover , in his co*nflict of duties , Hamlet naturally thinks he is taking the wrong one ; for the calls of the claim he meets are hushed by satisfaction , While the calls of // Hamkt. the claim he neglects are increased by disappointment . Thus the motives which he resists out-tongue those which he obeys , so that he hears nothing but the voice of the duty he omits . We are of course insensible of the current with which we move ; but we are made sensible of the current against which we move by the very struggle it costs . In this way Hamlet comes to mistake his scruples of conscience for want of conscience , and from his very sensitiveness of principle , tries to reason himself into a conviction of guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he accuses himself , he would be trying to find or make excuses wherewith to opiate his conscience . For the bad naturally try to hide their badness , the good their goodness , from themselves ; for which cause the former seek narcotics , the latter stimulants , for their consciences . The good man is apt to think he has not conscience enough , because it does not trouble him ; the bad man naturally thinks he has more conscience than he needs , because it troubles him all the while ; which accounts for the well-knQwn readiness of bad men to supply their neighbors with conscience . Of this sort were those men we read of , whose tenderness of conscience was such that they could not bear to take civil oaths , though they did not scruple to break those they had already taken . And yet Hamlet " thinks meet to put an antic disposition on . " This , if , indeed , it be not rather the anticipation of a real than the pre-announcement of a feigned insanity , seems to us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle , and disdains to conciliate him ; and *pparent madness is the only practicable outlet of thoughts awl feelings which he scorns to hide . Towards the king as a fratricide , a regicide , and a usurper , as the thief of his father 's life , and crown , and queen , he feels the deepest abhorrence . The Lord Chamberlain , as a skillful but unprincipled tool of sovereignty , reckless whom , anTd caring only for what , he serves , Hamlet regards with the contempt which a man of noble qualities naturally feels for a man of merely useful qualities . To express his sentiments to these in his real character , would be but to defeat his purpose and endanger his life . Since , therefore , in his true character he can only express false 123 feelings , he assumes a false character to express his true feelings . Thus his apparent mental insanity becomes the triumph of his moral sanity . Such , then , appears the true moral aspect and explanation of Hamlet 's madness . It is the spontaneous effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resorts to formal hypocrisy as the only available refuge from essential hypocrisy . Moreover , Hamlet sees that in this way he can tent the king 's conscience to the quick with impunity . Accordingly it is not till pierced by the shaft , that the king discovers Hamlet 's aim ; and this discovery is a perfect denionstration of his own guilt . Thus Hamlet turns the very disturbance with which his soul is struggling into a means at once of safety to himself and of punishment to the king . In the uneasy suspicions and remorses which his antics awaken in the king , Hamlet has at the same time proof of his guilt and revenge for his crime ; and the setting a wicked man 's conscience to biting and stinging him , is always a lawful and even a laudable kind of revenge . Herein Hamlet shows his profound cunning , when he will stoop to cunning . He so lays his plan , that the king can not possibly detect him , without betraying himself . From the nature of the case , the moment the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment Hamlet knows infallibly what the king has been about . Of all the perplexities , however , involved in this play , the question of Hamlet 's madness is perhaps the hardest of solution . Whether his insanity be real or feigned , or whether it be a species of intermittent insanity , or whether it be sometimes real , sometimes feigned , are questions which , like many that arise on similar points in actual life , can *never be fully and finally settled one way or the other . Aside from the ordinary impossibility of deciding precisely where sanity ends and insanii&amp;y begins , there are , as there naturally must be , peculiarities in Hamlet 's character and conduct , resulting from the minglings of the preternatural in his situation , which , as they lie beyond the compass of our common experience , so they can never be reduced to anything more than probable conjecture . If sanity consists in a certain harmony and sympathy between a man 's actions and his circumstances , it must be // Hamlet . difficult indeed to say what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course our own view in this matter will pass for just what it is worth . Many of us , no doubt , have experienced in ourselves or observed in others an almost irrepressible tendency , in times of great depression , to fly off into extravagant humors and eccentricities . We have ourselves known people , in hours of extreme despondency , to throw their most intimate friends into consternation by their prodigious extravagances ; their minds being in a very paroxysm of fr6lic , when they almost felt like hanging themselves . Such symptoms of wildness and insanity are often but the natural , though perhaps spasmodic , reaction of the mind against the weight that oppresses it . The mind thus spontaneously becomes eccentric , in crder to recover or preserve its centre ; voluntarily departs from its orbit , to escape what might-else throw it from its orbit . This is especially apt to be the case with minds which , like Hamlet 's , unite great intellectual power with exceeding fineness and fullness of sensibility . The truth is , almost all extreme emotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utters itself in laughter ; extreme joy , in tears ; utter despair sometimes breaks out in a voice of mirth ; a wounded spirit , in gushes of humor . Heace *hakspeare , with a depth of nature which has oftei* puzzled both readers and critics , has heightened the effect of some of his awfullest catastrophes by making the persons indulge in flashes of raerrimeat : for there is nothing so appalling as a person laughing in distress ; it shows that the spirit is loaded to the utmost extent of its endurance . And the same thing often occurs in actual life . Sir Thomas More 's wit upon the scaffold , " than the bare axe more luminous and keen , " is an instance of this kind , familiar perhaps to us alL It is not to be presumed , we take it , that More 's playfulness on this awful occasion sprung from merry feelings ; on the contrary , it must have sprung , one would think , from the other extreme of feeling  --  a man smiling and playing from excess of anguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to spring , not from deficiency , but from excess of intellectual strength ; . the conscious , half-voluntary Feb. , bendings and swayings of his faculties beneath an overload of thought , to keep I/tern from breaking . Amid overpowering excitements of his reason and his blood , his intellect is neither crippled by disease nor enthralled by illusion , but distracted with conflicting duties , and hurried away into antics and eccentricities . His mind being deeply disturbed , agitated to its centre , but not disorganized , those irregularities are rather a throwing off of that disturbance than a giving way to it . Goethe 's celebrated illustration , therefore , though almost too beautiful not to be true , seems entirely irrelevant and inadmissible . " Here , " says he , " is an oak planted in a china vase , proper to receive only the most delicate flowers ; the roots strike out , and the vessel flies to pieces . " If Hamlet 's mind were really disorganized , broken in fragments , as this expression implies , we do not see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity and unsoundness ; between the most exquisite harmony and the most jarring dissonance . Now the expressions of mirth which come from extreme depression , are obviously neither the reality nor the affectation of mirth . People , when overwhelmed by despair , certainly are not in a condition to feel merry , and they are as little in a condition to feign mirth ; yet , though neither feeling nor feigning it , they do , nevertheless , sometimes express it . fhe truth is , such extremes naturally and spontaneously express themselves by their opposites ; the very contradiction between the passion and expression best revealing the unutterable intensity of the passion . In like manner Hamlet 's madness , paradoxical and contradictory as the statement may appear , is , it seems to us , neither real nor affected , but a sort of natural and spontaneous imitation of madness , resulting from the successful , though convulsive , efforts of an overburdened mind to brace and stay itself under the burden . The triumphs of his reason over his passion naturally express themselves in the tokens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vent themselves in flashes of merriment . It is not so correct , therefore , to say that Hamlet puts an antic on , as that he lets it on ; and his pre-announcement of it seems to spring rather from foresight of // Hamlet . a contingency , than from an intention to deceive . He foresees , apparently , that such eccentricities and aberrations will be the natural result of his condition ; that , though he can avoid them if he will , it will require an effort to do so ; that though repressible , it will not be easy , perhaps not safe , to repress them . Foreseeing , moreover , that by giving nature free course and indulging these aberrations as they rise , he can turn them to a useful purpose , he therefore determines neither to seek nor shun them , but to let them come when they will , and use them when they come . The*character of Hamlet seems designed to exemplify , among other things , the rare but not unnatural contradiction between the inward and the outward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem precisely the reverse of what they are . For , as bad men are generally compelled to appear good , notwithstanding and even because they are bad , so good men are sometimes compelled to appear bad , even because they are good . Thus in Hamlet we have apparent weakness springing from real strength ; apparent badness , from real goodness ; apparent insanity , from real sanity . In like manner , his unkind treatment of Ophelia , in the famous eaves-dropping scene , appears to spring from his exceeding tenderness of feeling . An arrangement has been made whereby Hamlet and Ophelia are to have an interview , the king and Polonius being behind the curtains meanwhile to overhear what passes between them , with a view to ascertain , if possible , the cause of his supposed insanity ; which cause Polonius thinks , and the king hopes , to be disappointed love . Hamlet encounters her there : " Nymph , in thy onsons be all my sins remembered ; " perfectly kind and gentle towards her . Presently , however , his deportment changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , why this so sudden and violent change ? Now Ophelia is here thrown into a position where she is forced to tell , or act , a falsehood . In her perfect innocence and artlessness , having probably never told , much less acted , a lie in her life , she is of course unable to go smoothly through the part assigned her ; she falters , hesitates , becomes embarrassed , and thus betrays by her manner the very secret she is trying to hide . From this involuntary i2* embarrassment Hamlet doubtless instantaneously perceives that something is wrong , and suspects himself to be watched ; and his subsequent remarks , though addressed to Ophelia , are rather intended for those who arc watching him . To clear up this difficulty on the stage , the king and Polonius are sometimes made to come forward where Hamlet can see them . This , we beg leave to say with all due deference , precludes the chief beauty of the scene , which is , that Ophelia should be so innocent as to betray by her manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is going on . But , though Hamlet 's uncivil speeches on this occasion be rather intended for the eaves-droppers than for Ophelia , still he can not but know she will take them as meant for herself , and accordingly be hurt by them ; so that , without other grounds than this , we can not reconcile his conduct with the assurance , that " Forty thousand brothers Could not , with all this quantity of love , Make up his sum . " The discovery of the trick attempted upon him may be a sufficient reason for resurning his antic disposition , but not for using unkind and iincourteous expressions to her . What , then , can be Hamlet 's motive in using them ? Few circumstances in the play have been so perplexing to critics as this . It seems never to have occurred to them , to seek for the motives of Hamlet 's conduct in the result . Now Ophelia comes out of the interview fully convinced that his mind is hopelessly wrecked . Is it not fair to presume , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her heart is entirely his own , and fearing the effects of his unexplainable desertion of her , he therefore wishes to detach and alienate her feelings gradually , and so prevent the danger of a too sudden and violent rupture . In a word , he treats her , rudely and unkindly in order to save her . Thus we have apparent harshness springing from real tenderness ; and Hamlet 's conduct becomes reconcilable with his professions , on the ground of its being , in the words of Lamb , " an ingenious device of love , gradually to prepare her mind , by affected discour // Hamlet . tesies under the guise of insanity , for the breaking up of an attachment which he 1*nows can never be consummated . " After all , however , it must be confessed , as was intimated in the outset , that there is a mystery about Hamlet , which baffles the utmost efforts of criticism . The deepest and subtilest analysis has hitherto proved unable to clear up the apparent inconsistencies of his character . The central principle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reconciled , lies perhaps beyond any insight less piercing than Shakspeare 's . We can not see , Hamlet himself can not see , the why and wherefore of his b ? ing and doing thus and so . He is subject to impulses below our penetration , and even below his own consciousness . We feel the truth and consistency of the character , but the ground8 of this feeling reach beyond our depth ; for in such matters the heart always feels much deeper than the head sees . In the words of another , " Hamlet is a being with springs of thought , and feeling , and action , deeper than we can search . These springs rise up from an unknown depth ; a depth in which we feel and know there is a unity of being , though we can not distinctly perceive it ; so that the superficial contradictions of his character have no power to make us doubt its perfect truth . " And the character undoubtedly cleaves to us the closer for that , while it includes much of our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being . We can neither see through Hamlet nor yet away from him , and the same is the case with ourselves ; indeed , this is about all that we know of ourselves . The idea of Hamlet , which we have been trying to unfold , is , conscious plenitude of intellect , united with exceeding fineness and fullness of sensibility , and guided by a predominant sentiment of moral rectitude . In spite of himself his mind is a perennial spring of " thoughts that wander through eternity ; " , he is perpetually losing the present in the eternal , the particular in the universal , as genius is apt to do ; for genius is , in some sort , intuition of universal truth . His mind , however , is by no means in a healthy state ; indeed , no healthy mind could well retain its health in his circumstances . When all was joyous and promising before him , he had sufficient resources Feb. , without , and his faculties were genially occupied with external objects ; but amid his later trials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the world can not furnish , and his faculties are thrown back upon themselves . Thus his great genius becomes intensely self-conscious , and introspection settles into a sort* of chronic disease . " By abstruse research to steal From his own nature all the natural manThis was his sole resource , his only plan ; Till that which suits a part infects the whole , And now is grown the very habit of his soul . " It is in this morbid consciousness of his own powers , that he exclaims : " What a piece of work is a man ! How noble in reason , how infin*te in faculties ! in form and motion how express and admirable ! in action how like an angel , in apprehension how like a god ! " Haunted with a sense of the supernatural in his experience ; persecuted with duties which he can neither forget nor perform ; with all the natural issues of his being closed up , so thag he can neither act nor let it alone ; and mistaking his outward difficulties for inward deficiency ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and absorbed in itself ; he can do nothing but think , and think , and " eat his own heart ; " his self-contemplation causing him to marvel the more at his inactivity , and his inactivity plunging him still deeper in self-contemplation . And perhaps his consciousness of " genius given and knowledge won in vain , " is one source of his overwrought distress . Educated with the noble prospect , and inspired with the noble ambition of blessing others , everything he now meets but stings him with remembrance of the precious opportunity whereof another 's crimes have deprived him . In his calmer moments , when his energies are not engrossed in controlling his emotions , he revels amid the very regalities of poetry and philosophy ; his mind , rich with the spoils of nature and of art , smiles forth its treasures with the gentleness of a child and the composure of a god ; unbending itself in the labors of a giant ! In the happiness of youthful confidence , his genius has plucked the flowers which carpet the fields of antiquity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Hamlet . beautiful bride ; and the melodies of Eden seem stealing upon us , when , escaping for a moment from the tempest which hath overtaken him , he unclasps to the ear of friendship the record of his intellectual triumph . Polonius is , in nearly all respects , the antithesis of Hamlet , though Hamlet doubtless includes him , as the heavens include the earth . He is a sort of political ossification or petrifaction , whose soul , if he ever had one , has got wholly absorbed in his understanding . A man of but one method , that of intrigue , and of but one motive , that of interest ; wholly given up to the arts of management ; with his fingers always itching to pull the wires of some intricate plot ; and without any sense or perception of the fitness of times and occasions ; he is called to act in a matter where such arts and methods are especially inappropriate and unavailing , and therefore he only succeeds , of course , in overreaching and circumventing himself . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally sprung , lies the explanation , not only of his character , but of a class of characters , which is as immortal as human folly . Thus in Polonius we have the type of a politician in his dotage ; and all his follies and blunders arise from his undertaking to act the politician where he is especially required to be a man . This , we are aware , is making him out a caricature , rather than a character , for a man of but one motive or one feature is a caricature ; but it is such a caricature as is occasionally to be met with in actual life . True to the principles and practices of his order , Polonius studies and deals with men , not to make them wiser or better , but only to make himself better off out of them ; and has therefore acquired , in the greatest perfection and greatest abundance , just such a knowledge of human nature as degrades himself , and enables him to degrade others ;  --  the same knowledge , for all the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and use too . His very trade , indeed , brings him to know men only in onditions where the springs and causes of their actions lie out of themselves , For there is a mechanical as well as a dynamical part in our nature , and few things are more common than for men to get so engrossed in one of these parts , as to lose sight of the other ; as , on the one , hand , certain physicians , absorbed in the study of our material frame , have come to the conclusion that we had no souls ; and , on the other hand , certain metaphysicians , absorbed in studying our spiritual being , have concluded we had no bodies . In certain spheres of action , in the court , the cabinet , the counting-room , and the exchange , among the arts , the games , the interests and the ambitions of life , men are but a sort of machines , to be moved by certain outward , definite , tangible forces : dispose those forces after a certain manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in certnin other spheres of action , at the fireside and the altar , where the affections , the religions , the dynamics of our nature , are called into play-here men are something far better and nobler than machines ; and as they are moved by certain inward , vital , self-determining powers , so we can not possibly anticipate or control their movements . Now , it is only in the former spheres of life that Polonius has any real acquaintance with men . Of those innate and original springs of action , which originate and shape the movements of men in spheres of disinterestedness , he has no insight , or even conception . Always looking through his politician 's spectacles , he sees men only where , and when , and so far , as the*r ar0 machines , capable of being played into a given set of motions by a given set of motives ; and a long course of observation and experiment has taught him how to adjust and apply , with wonderful precision , the forces and influences which will set them agoing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human nature , he has come to regard men as nothing but machines ; for what is itself divine , is not to be discerned but by divine faculties ; and he presumes men to be nothing but accountants , because , forsooth , he has none but countiug*house faculties to view them with . In matters of calculation , therefore , Polonius is a sage ; in ' matters of sentiment and imagination he is a dunce . lie always succeeds in arts of policy , because he never tries to rise above them ; like the dema* gogue who leads the people by first watch . ing their course , and then adroitly rushing ahead of them ; a thing that requires but // Hamlet . long legs , a short head , and little or no heart . Polonius , accordingly , has made success his test of merit , and success has made him self-conceited . For such is apt to be the ease with artful , intriguing men ; generally succeeding , as the world counts success , they naturally estimate merit by success , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be conceited ! From books , also , Polonius has gleaned maxims , but not gained development ; can repeat , but not reproduce , their contents ; equips , not feeds his mind out of them ; uses them , in short , not as spectacles to read nature with , but only as blinds or goggles to protect his own eyes with . He has , therefore , made books his idols , and books have made him pedantic . For he is a conceited old pedant . An exceedingly practical man , he is too fond of the dirt to be in any danger of getting up into the clouds . Craving truth only for the stomach 's sake , of course he always has food enough , and his understanding is too enpeptic to think of living by faith ; he believes in living on realities : there is no romance about him ; no , indeed , he cultivates solider things than that ! To such a mind , or rather , half-mind , the character of Hamlet must needs be a profound enigma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Hamlet ; and Polonius is but the attic story of a man ! Of course he can not find a heart or a soul in Hamlet , because he has none himself to md them with : for it always takes a heart to find a heart , a soul to find a soul ; those who have them not always thiak , and deserve to think , that others are without them . As , in Polonius 's mind , the calculative faculties have eaten out the perceptive faculties , so , of course , his premises are seldom right , and his inferences seldom wrong . Assuming Hamlet to be thus and thus , he reasons and acts most admirably in regard to him ; but the fact is , he has no eye for the true premises of the case ; he can not see Hamlet , can not understand him ; and his premises being wrong , the very correctness of his logic makes him seem but the more ridiculous . Wherefore , knowing the prince can hope to make nothing by marrying his daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless from dishonorable intentions . Feb. , And he falls into a similar mistake in regard to Ophelia . He thinks she is in danger from Hamlet 's addresses to her , that she will fall a victim to some ijihuman arts , because he is insensible to her real power : to him she appears all weakness and exposure , because he has no eye to discern her true strength . But , to such a man as Hamlet , a man of heart , of soul , of honor , of religion , of manhood , she is the concentration of whatever is most powerful and most formidable : her virgin innocence , her gentleness , her maiden honor , her sweet , sacred defencelessness , " create an awe about her as a guard angelic placed ; " all Heaven , in short , is set for the protection of such a being ; but Heaven , alas ! is n protection against a brute , much less , against a *selfish , heartless , soulless man ! Coleridge has very happily remarked , that " good terrestrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it is only by the aid of the stars that men can direct their course securely and profitably over the earth , so some men observe the stars only for the sake of profit and security ; they look upwards , not , indeed , to learn what is above them , but only that they may the better avail themselves of what is around or beneath them . Such appears to be the case with Polonius in the few precepts with which he accompanies the farewell blessing upon Laertes . Coming from another man , these precepts , it must be confessed , would seem the very perfection of prudential morality , containing here and there a trace of manly , generous sentiment . Coming from Polonius , they seem but the extraction and quintessence of Chesterfieldism , of which the first and great commandment is , act and speak to conceal , not to express , thy thoughts , and avoid to do anything that may injur thyself ; for on this commandment undoubtedly hang all the law and the prophets of his morality ; and if in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements of manly honor and generosity , it is only to make the compound mere palatable to a young mind , that has not so far desiccated itself of heart and soul as to take up with mere policy . T*he precept , " To thine own self be true , And it must follow , as the night the day , Thou canat not then be false to any man " // 1848. means , in his mouth , be true to thine own interest , and but expresses the common notion , that injustice to others is injurious to one 's self . This precept , indeed , has sometimes been urged as redeeming the author from that utter baseness and selfishness which the rest of his conduct so plainly indicates ; but to us it seems rather to confirm the view we have taken of him ; for it must obviously mean one of two things : either , be true to thine own heart , which is , perhaps , the best morality , or , be true to thine own interest , which is the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to warrant , if not to require , the latter construction . What does such a man naturally mean by self ? his heart ? he do n't know that he has one ; perhaps he has not ; interest bein*g all the heart he has or deserves to have . It has been suggested , that Polonius here forgets himself , and , speaking from memory , unwittingly drops a better sentiment than he is aware of . To which we can only reply , such men as he are seldom guilty of anything so good as forgetting themselves ; indeed , their chief misery and meanness is , that they seldom think of anything but themselves . Polonius would , doubtless , have his son strain at a gnat of indiscretion , and swallow a camel of insincerity ; sit up nights to make himself a gentleman , but take no pains to make himself a man . Of nourse we mean a fashionable gentleman ; for a true gentleman is , w* take it , the finest piece of work that God has yet shown us - except a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles , nor kindle noble passions , but only to lodge shrewd practical maxims in his son . The whole gist of his instructions to Laertes is , to study and discipline all spontaneousness out of himself ; and for those involuntary and unconscious transpirations of character , which reveal that one has a heart , though perhaps with some flaws in it , he would leave no room whatever , in his view " the dictates of an inward sense , whose voice outweighs the world , " are but bugbears to frighten children withal ; and a virtue which can not prate about itself , which , moved by secret , vital forces , goes so smoothly , and sweetly , and silently , as not to hear itself , or be conscious of its workings , is not to be thought of or trusted in , much less sought after or approved , In a word , his mo rality and religion spring altogether from the understanding , not from the conscience nor the heart , and therefore are , in reality and in effect , but two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one for the next . And yet Polonius is a great man in his way ; many of the world 's parasites are but diminutives of him ; several modem politicians might , we suspect , be cut out of him . He has the lower faculties , the calculative , in the highest degree ; the higher faculties , the imaginative , he has not at all . He is virtuous inasmuch as he keeps below vice , ( for there is a place down there , and some people in it ; ) is honesty because he thinks honesty to be the best policy  --  a maxim which , by the way , is far from being universally true : for honesty sometimes carries people to the stake , ( queer policy that ! ) and perhaps it would carry more of us to the stake , if we had it ; and if it did not carry us to the stake , it might carry us to poverty , and that , some people think , is the next thing to the stake . Polonius , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that he goes straight ahead , merely from want of susceptibilities for temptation to lay hold of , and keeps himself transparent , because he has got so crystallized , that no dust can stick to him . - Shakspeare 's matchless skill , in revealing a character through its most characteristic transpirations , is nowhere more finely displayed than in the instructions Polonius gives his servant , Reynaldo , for detecting the - habits and practices of his absent son . In framing plans to " get at truth , though it lie hid within the centre ; " how , " with the bait of falsehood , he may take the carp of truth ; " and how , " of wisdom and of reach , with windlasses and with assays of bias , " he may " by mdirections find directions out ; " here the old politician is perfectly at home ; his mind seems to revel in the mysteries of wirepulling and trap-setting ; and schemes fly together in his head and troll out of his mouth as if they could not help it . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here all his strategy and sagacity are effectually nonplussed ; and the trap with which he essays to catch the truth only springs on himself . The mere torch of policy , nature , or Hamlet , who is // Hamlet . an imbodiment of nature , blows him out , so that he rays out nothing but darkness and smoke whenever he attempts to throw light on the prince . The sport of circumstances , it was only by a chance of circumstances that Hamlet came , to know him . Once the honored minister of his royal father , now the despised tool of his father 's murderer , Hamlet sees in him only a mean and supple time-server , ready at any time to " crook the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning ; " and the ease with which be baffles , and puzzles , and plagues the old fox , shows how much craftier one can be , who scorns craft , than one who courts it . Habits of intrigue having extinguished in Polonius the powers of insight and adaptation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his usual meth. ods to the new exigency ; while at the same time his faith in the craft which he has hitherto found so successful betrays him into the most overweening assurance . Hence , also , that singular but most characteristic specimen of unconscious grannyism , namely , his pedantic , unseasonable and impertinent trifling and dallying with artful forms and turns of thought and speech , amidst the most serious business , though conceiving and swearing the while that he is using no art at all ; where , mindless of the occasion , and absorbed in his frivolous fancies , he appears not unlike the learned dunce in Hudibras , who " could speak no sense in several languages ; " and shows what a tedious old fool he is , the moment he leaves to " hunt the train of policy , " and forsakes the habitual routine of intrigue and management . Superannuated politicians , indeed , like Polonius , seldom appear wise but in proportion as they fall back upon the resources of memory ; for out of these resources , the ashes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may seem wise after the fountains of wisdom are dried up within them ; as a man who has lost his sight may seem to distinguish colors perfectly so long as he does not undertake to speak of the colors about him . On the whole , Polonius is a fine exemplification of the truth , that , while wisdom grows more bright and beautiful as it waxes older , aged cunning relapses into garrulous dotage ; and that amid the decays of sense , Feb. , nothing can retain the soul in its dignity* but a faith in the truth , and a child-like simplicity of heart which reposes meekly and gently upon a wisdom above its own . There is one relation , however , in which , from whatsoever motives , Polonius wishes to do his entire duty . He sincerely aims and endeavors to be a good father , and evidently has the welfare , or rather , the interest of his Shildren truly at heart . But here , as elsewhere , the politician is visibly uppermost , perverting his endeavors and thwarting his aims ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather in spite of her father 's instructions , than in consequence of them . The truth is , he has practiced the arts of intrigue until they have grown into second nature ; the craft which he adopted as his servant , has become his master ; so that in spite of himself the wily magician looks out upon us through the face of the father . It is thus that a principle of action , when once taken home to the bosom , insinua*tes itself throughout the character , shaping and coloring the whole life into its likeness . The mean and wicked arts which we call in as friends and auxiliaries generally remain as our conquerors and lords ; and Satan , invited to a corner of the mind , seldom fails to usurp the whole . Of all Shakspeare 's heroines the impression of Ophelia is perhaps the most difficult of analysis , partly because she is so intensely real , and partly because she is so undeveloped . A perfect rose-bud of womanhood , just ready to burst into development from its own fullness , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguish the peculiarities that are to characterize the flower . Nipt , too , on the promise of the blossom , the bud perishes " before its buttons be disclosed , " leaving us nothing but smiles for its beauty , and tears for its fate . Ophelia is brought forward but little in the play , and yet the whole play seems pervaded with her presence . Her very absence reveals her ; her very silence utters her ; we think of her the more for that we miss her society . We see her and Hamlet together scarcely any , yet we can hardly separate them in our thoughts . Of their sweet hours of courtship , when Ophelia " sucked the honey of his music vows , " we hear nothing whatever ; yet we // Hamlet . know them all , we read their whole history in the impression they have left upon her , subduing her entire being , heart , soul and sense , to the sweet sovereignty of love . Perhaps the reason why Ophelia , though seen so little in the play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her owe their best development to her influence . Amid the court circle , she is like a voice of music issuing from the bosom of Chaos . Whatever harmony comes from Polonius and the queen , is of her eliciting ; all that redeems them from our hatred or scorn , is of her inspiring . Laertes is interesting to us , chiefly for the interest he takes in his sister ; he had little hold on our regard , but for the feelings she has awakened within him . Of Hamlet 's soul , too , she is the sunrise and the morning hymn , bathing in brightness the birth of a day so awful in its beauty and so pitiable in its woe . The soul of innocence and gentleness , wisdom seems to radiate from her insensibly , as fragrance is exhaled from flowers . It is in such forms that Heaven most frequently visits us . Ophelia 's situation very much resembles that of Imogen ; their characters are in perfect contrast . Both appear amidst the corruptions of a wicked court : Ophelia escapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm , steady resistance . The former is unassailahle in her innocence ; the latter is unconquerable in her strength . Ignorance protects Ophelia ; knowledge protects Imogen . The conception of vice has hardly found its way into Ophelia 's mind ; in Imogen the daily perception of vice has but called forth the power to repel it . Ophelia dreams not but she is surrounded by angels ; Imogen knows she is surrounded by devils : knowledge of her - situation would ruin the former ; ignorance of her situation would ruin the latter . Ophelia 's utter ignorance of her father 's character begets perfect confidence in him , and therefore requires implicit obedience to his orders ; Imogen 's perfect knowledge of her father 's character begets utter distrust of him , and therefore requires unyielding resistance , to - his orders . In Ophelia again , as in Desdemona , the comparative want of intelligence , or rather , of intellectuality , is never felt as a deficiency . She fills up the idea of excellence just as completely as if she were all inteUect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the absent elements , because there is no vacancy left for them to supply ; and high intellect would rather strike us as a superfluity than as a supplement ; its voice would rather drown than complete the harmony of the other tones . Ophelia is exhibited in the utmost ripeness and mellowness , both of soul and of sense , to impressions from without . With her susceptibilities just opening to external objects , her thoughts are so completely engrossed with those objects as to leave no room for self-contemplation . This exceeding impressibility is the source at once of her beauty and her danger . From the lips and eyes of Hamlet she has drunk in assurances of his love , but she has never heard the voice of her ' own ; and she knows not how full heT heart is of Hamlet , because she has not a single thought or feeling there at strife with him ; the current of her feelings runs so deep that it does not admit of tumult enough to make her conscious of them . In the words of Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved than of loving , and yet loving in the depth of her young heart far more than she is loved . " For it is a singular fact , that though Hamlet gives many disclosures , and Ophelia gives only concealments , many have doubted the reality of his love , while no one has ever thought of doubting the reality of hers . Critics generally have construed Opheha 's silence respecting her own passion into a wish to hide it from others ; but the truth is , she seems not to be aware of it herself ; and she unconsciously betrays it in the modest reluctance with which she yields up the secret of Hamlet 's addresses to her . The extorted confession of what she has received reveals how much she has given . The soft movements of her b ) som are made the plainer by the delicate lawn of silence thrown over it . To the warnings of her brother and the orders of her father she promises and intends implicit obedience , ignorant her-self of the fearful truth , and yet betraying it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders have come too late . Alas ! she knows not that the love which she thus consents to shut out of her heart has already entwined itself inextricably with the innermost thread of her life . llven // Hamlet . when despair is wringing and crii7shing her innocent young soul into an utter wreck , she seems not to know the source of her affliction ; and the dreadful truth comes forth only when her sweet mind , which , stringed and tuned in heaven , once breathed such enchanting harmony , lies broken in fragments before us , and the secrets of her maiden heart are hovering on her soul-deserted tongue . One of the bitterest ingredients in poor Ophelia 's cup of sorrow , is the belief that by her repulse of Hamlet she has scared away the music of his mind ; and when , forgetting the wounds with which her own pure spirit is bleeding , over the heartrending spectacle of that " unmatched form and feature of blown youth , blasted with ecstacy , " she meets his fatal " I loved you not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more deceived , " we see that she feels not the sundering of the ties that bind her sweetly-tempered faculties in harmony . The singing of this innocent sweet bird has but betrayed her to the hunter 's aim ; and she feels not the fatal shot because it strikes to the very source of her spirit 's life . And yet we blame not Hamlet , for he is himself but a victim of the same relentless , inexorable power which is spreading its ravages through him over another life as pure andTheavenly as his own . Standing on the verge of an abyss which he sees is yawning to ingulf himself , his very effort to frighten her back from it , only hurries her in before him . To snatch a jewel from Mrs. Jameson 's casket , " he knows he can neither marry her nor reveal to her the terrific influences which have changed the whole current of his life and purposes ; and in his agony he overacts the painful part with which he has tasked himself ; like the judge of Athens who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird which had sought refuge in his bosom with such violence that he unwittingly killed it . " Ophelia 's insanity absolutely exhausts the fountains of human pity . The breaking of her virgin heart lets loose the secrets which have hitherto enriched it , and their escape reveals the utter ruin of their own sweet dwelling-place . It is one of those pictures surcharged with unuttered and unutterable woe , over which the mind Feb. , can only brood in silent sympathy and awe ; which Heaven alone has a heart adequately to pity , and a hand effectually to heal . Its pathos were too much for our hearts to bear , but for the sweet incense that rises from her crushed spirit , as " she turns thought and affliction , passion , hell itself , to favor and to prettiness . " The victim of crimes in which she has no share but as a sufferer , we hail with joy the event which snatches her from the rack of this world ; and , in our speechless pity for such helpless innocence , we seek the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the death of this gentle creature there is a divine depth of sorrow which strikes expression dumb . In their solemn playfulness , the songs with which she chants , as it were , her own burial service , are like smiles gushing from the very heart of woe . Over this picture so awful in its beauty , we can but repeat the sighs of its most gifted commentator : " Ophelia ! poor Ophelia ! 0 , far too soft , too good , too fair , to be cast among the briars of this working-day world , and fall and bleed upon the thorns of life . What shall be said of her ! for eloquence is mute before her . So exquisitely delicate is her character , it seems as if a touch would profane it ; so sanctified in our thoughts by the last and worst of human woes , that we dare not consider it too deeply . Her love , which she never once confesses , is like a secret which we have stolen from her , and which ought to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her sorrow asks not words but tears ; and from the spectacle of her insanity we feel inclined to turn away , and veil our eyes in reverential pity , and too painful sympathy . " The queen 's affection for this lovely being is one of those unexpected strokes of character so frequent in Shakspeare , which surprise us into reflection by their very naturalness . Mrs. Jameson compares it to the nightingale of Sophocles singing in the groves of the Furies . That Opheha should disclose a vein of goodness in the wicked queen , was necessary , perhaps , to keep us both from underrating the influence of the one , and from overrating the wickedness of the other . The love , too , which she thus awakens in one so depraved goes to prevent the pity which her condition moves from lessening the respect // Hamlet . which her character deserves . It tells us that Ophelia 's helplessness springs from innocence , not from weakness , and thus serves at once to heighten our impression in favor of her , and to soften our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ophelia thus does affords some compensation to our minds for the evil which she suffers , and tends to deepen and prolong our pity by calling in other feelings to its relief and support . Almost any other author would have depicted Gertrude without a single alleviating trait in her character . Beaumont and Fletcher would probably have made her simply frightful or loathsome , capable of exciting no feeling but disgust or abhorrence ; if , indeed , in her monstrous depravity , she had not rather failed to excite any feeling whatsoever . From their anxiety to produce effect in such delineations , most authors would strike so hard and so often as to stun the feelings they wished to arouse . Shakspeare , with far more effect as well as far more truth , exhibits her with that mixture of good and bad which neither disarms censure nor precludes pity . Herself dragged along in the terrible train of consequences which her own guilt had a hand in starting , she is hurried away into the same dreadful abyss along with those whom she loves and against whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ophelia , we recognize the virtues of the mother without palliating in the least the guilt of the wife ; while the crime in which she is an accomplice almost disappears in the crimes of which she is the victim . Corrupted by the seductions which swarm about her station , her criminal pas*ions blind her to the designs of her wicked but wily associate ; and she stops not to consider the nature of her conduct* until its fearful results come in to stab her affections and murder her peace . To speak of this play as a whole , is a task which we dare not attempt . Nearly all the events of the play seem the work of an inscrutable Providence , or rather they are the work of an inscrutable Providence , and seem the work of an inexorable destiny . The plan of the drama seems to be , to represent persons acting without any plan : in the words of Goethe , " the hero is without any plan , but the play itself is full of plan . " The characters , accordingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims of what is done and the authors of what is said . The play forms a complete class by itself ; it is emphatically a tragedy of thought ; and of all Shakspeare 's , this undoubtedly combines the greatest strength and widest diversity of faculties . Sweeping round the whole circle of human thought and passion , its alternations of amazement and terror ; ofdust , and ambition , and remorse ; of hope , and love , and friendship , and anguish , and madness , and despair ; of wit , and humor* and pathos , and poetry , and philosophy ; now , congealing the blood with horror ; now , melting the heart with pity ; now , launching the mind into eternity ; now , shaking the soul to its centre with thoughts too deep for mortal reach ; now , startling conscience from her lonely seat with supernatural visitings ; - it unfolds a world of truth , and beauty , and sublimity , which our thoughts may indeed aspire to traverse , but which our tongues must despair to utter . Of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mentioned . For picturesque effect the platform scenes have nowhere-been surpassed . The chills of a northern winter midnight seem creeping over us as the heart-sick sentinels pass before us , and , steeped in moonlight and in drowsiness , exchange their meeting and parting salutations . The train of thoughts and sentiments , which arises in their minds , is just such as the anticipation of preternatural visions would be likely to inspire . As the- bitter cold stupefles their senses , an indescribable feeling of dread and awe steals over them , preparing the mind to realize its own superstitious imaginings . The feeling one has in reading these scenes is not unlike that of a child passing a graveyard by moonlight . Out of the dim and drowsy moonbeams apprehension creates its own confirmations ; our fancies imbody themselves in the facts around us ; our fears give shape to outward objects , while those objects give outwardness to our fears . The heterogeneous elements which are brought together in the graveyard scene , with its strange mixture of songs , and witticisms , and dead men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave , the sprightly , the meditative , the solemn , the playful , and the grotesque , make it one of the most wonderful yet most natural // Hamlet . scenes the poet has given us . Of various other scenes the excellencies are too obvious to need remark . The overpowering intensity of interest in the miniature scene , with its Niagara of thoughts , and images , and emotions , can have escaped no mind that has not escaped it . The catastrophe of this play is a frightful abyss of moral confusion over which the mind shudders with horror and awe . As we gaze into its dark chaotic bosom , where the guilty and the guiltless have been relentlessly swept away and overwhelmed in indistinguishable ruin , as if by some furious tornado of destiny , our thoughts , aifrighted at the awful confusion before us , fly for refuge to the heaven above us . Most truly hath a wise man Feb. , said , in view of this terrible catastrophe , " It is the tendency of crime to spread its evils over innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over many who deserve them not ; while , frequently , the author of the one or of the othe*r is not punished or rewarded here at all . " But there is a heaven above ; and though " In the corrupted currents of this world , Offence 's gilded hand may shove by justice ; And oft t is seen , the wicked prize itself Buys out the law ; yet t is not so above : There is no shuffling , there the action lies In its true nature ; and we ourselves corn-pell 'd , Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults , To give in evidence . "
