txt NEARLY five years have passed since the death of Mason . His short and brilliant career was closed on the 26th of December , 1840 , at the age of twenty two years . The fact was duly announced by the journals of the day , in terms expressive of unusual sorrow for the departure of one so promising and so much beloved . But whatever the impression made by this melancholy event within the circle of relatives and a numerous band of college and scientific friends , it could not he expected that the world should long remember a passing notice . Obituaries are generally deemed the tribute of private friendship , rather than the expression of the public judgment , unless a wide reputation has previously existed ; and besides , the candidates for honorable mention after death have become numerous in these days , so that almost every attentive Sunday school pupil is thought a fit subject for newspaper eulogy . The distinction which Mason had acquired at the time of his death , * Life and Writings of Ehenezer Porter Nason , interspersed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed. ucation of a child of Genius .

The impression he left behind him of his genius and worth will long remain in the university where he graduated , and where he spent the greater part of his short subsequent life . A general desire was expressed , soon after his death , by those who had known him , that he might not pass away without some permanent memorial . Persons of mature judgment , and of the highest reputation in those departments of learning in which he had excelled , united in the opinion that a memoir should be prepared , as a tribute due to his merits , and as a means of prolonging the influence of a noble example . Classmates and other intimate personal friends urged strongly in behalf of the deceased the claims of justice and affection . In accordance with these suggestions , Prof. Olmsted undertook to write the biography of his favorite pupil , and to prepare for the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work he was qualified to perform by a long personal acquaintance , and by the fullest knowledge of his scientific attainments. rpo aid him in his undertaking , relatives and intimate friends confidcd to his inspection a corres // pondence extending through the greater part of Mason 's life . This correspondence would of itself , by a simple chronological arrangement , form a most interesting piece of autobiography . It contains a full and frank disclosure of the motives and rewards of a student ambitious of a noble reputation and successful in gaining his end . It was written only for the eyes of friends , but containing not an unworthy line or sentiment . They violated no pledges in giving it for publication when the grave had closed over the remains of the writer . On the contrary , there was brought to light what will form a lasting monument of a manly sensibility and the most amiable virtues . This biography by Prof. Olmsted is the repository of most of the facts which we present to illustrate and confirm the truthfulness of this representation . That a faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be attested by all who ever had the good fortune of a personal acquaintance with him , and those who knew him most intimately will give their heartiest approval . We are surprised , indeed , that so interesting a volume of biography should have excited so little attention . It is said that the demand for it hitherto has been limited chiefly to personal friends and men of kindred pursuits . Few others seem to be aware of the existence of one of the most interesting biographies the American press has furnished . There is a peculiar difficulty in interesting the public at large in the memoirs of a young person for whom is claimed the possession of uncommon talents . Whatever is said in the way of praise will be attributed to partiality , and although the regard of the biographer for the reputation of one deservedly esteemed by friends will be pardoned , yet in general the greater his apparent sympathy and admiration , the greater will be the incredulity of the world . The number is extremely small who have won an enduring reputation before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is oftener the case , great projects were planned and in good part accomplished in early life , still there is demanded the supervision of a ripened judgment . There may be instances like that of the son of Augustus , who was immortalized by the fortunate lines of the poet . " lieu reiserande puer ! si qua fata aspera rumpas Tn Marcellus ens . " But generally an enduring reputation rests not alone upon promise , not even that which is unequivocal in the estimation of the learned . There must be actual performances . This irreversible law is not to be called in question by village Hampdens or mute inglorious Miltons . The world will be incredulous of mere testimonials . To prove the existence of uncommon talent by such evidence , is the next hardest thing to proving a miracle . Men will not believe unless they see the wonders wrought . No exemption is claimed from this law in favor of Mason . lie gained a reputation on the conditions it prescribes , and it will remain secure by the same unalterable law . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most competent to judge as to what he was ; but we rest his claims to remembrance mainly on what he did , what he actually wrought out with his own hands . It is true , indeed , that just when he had begun to reap the rich rewards of the closest mental and practical training , and while his friends were exulting in the fullest realization of their hopes , the destroyer came . The laurel was inwreathed with the cyprus ,  --  Science crowned her votary and then mingled her tears with Friendship over his grave . // But when the gifted fall , thus prematurely-yet if their purposes are so far accomplished as to prove their aspirations to he horn of a genuine inspiration , and not the offspring of day dreams , excited hy self-conceit or injudicious praise , their memory will not perish . On such grounds it is that the fame of Henry Kirke XVhite rests secure . It is for this reason that the tomb of Henry Martyn has become a " Mecca of the mind " to the whole Christian world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bradford Homer will always be referred to as bright ornaments of their profession . For the same reason the memory of Mason will be cherished . That only a small part of his magnificent plans were actually executed , will not prevent this ; for he gave abundant assurance that he would have completed his designs , had his life been spared . In science and in letters he has left permanent memorials . Lie lived long enough to win the admiration of the first astronomers of his time , as an accurate observer and an original discoverer , to display artistic talents of a high order , to attain a superior rank as a classical student , and in his various writings , whether in prose or verse , to give proof of qualities which must have ensured him , had he lived , as high distinction in literature as in science . He had the genius of Horrox , his prototype in his favorite science , and his early fate  --  to this day the triste desiderium of English astronomers-and he had , besides , the poetic gifts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronomy , to the cultivation of which he devoted his life , we find him early engaged in the most abstruse departments of the science , eagerly attempting the most difficult problems , repeating the observations of his predecessors , and entering upon a career of original discovery . Without patronage , and stinted by the smallest pecuniary means , he undertakes , while pursuing the regular studies of the college course , a survey of the heavens by instruments constructed in good part by his own hand . By means of an apparatus cheaply contrived , but of exquisite workmanship in all parts essential to his design , fields of observation were open to his view , hitherto accessible only to the best European observatories . With an eye naturally short-sighted , but of the keenest vision , and educated for his work by long and patient practice , he entered fearlessly upon the chosen field of exploration . He essayed the difficult path first trod by the elder Herschel , and his nice perception traced the footsteps of that prince of modern astronomers among the remotest nebulm . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results which had not as yet been realized from the observations of his predecessors . It was the glory of Herschel , that he first disclosed the boundless extent of the nebulous system . But in his unwearied search for new and multiplied objects , the minute accuracy of observation , measurement and description which has achieved such signal discoveries among the double stars , was of course out of the question . Yet such precision is necessary , if we would know any thing of these bodies beyond the mere fact of their existence . This accuracy Mason sought to introduce into the observation of the nebulae . He brought to his task not only an acuteness and patience of vision that permitted nothing to escape unnoticed , but powers of delineation and de . sen ption probably never surpassed . Adapting with remarkable judgment his method of observation to the end in view , he selected a few of the most interesting objects , and confining his attention exclusively to these , exercised upon them a long and severe scrutiny , till he had determined with the utmost possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of delineation entirely his own , of exceeding beauty and ingenuity , he was enabled to present to his readers mappings , numerically exact , of those faintly glimmering worlds just as they appeared to his own eye , and to tratismit to subsequent observers a permanent and accurate record of all his observations and discoveries . Thus were the data established by which future changes , if there be any , in those distant and mysterious bodies , may be recognized and detected , and the great question as to their nature and condition perhaps ultimately solved . The ancients fabled the presumption and fate of youthful genius , by the story of Icarus . His wings were waxen pinions . But though in this instance genius early perished , yet presumption was not horn of folly , and the curiously wrought pinions were equal to the most adventurous flights , until the life-energy which animated them was spent . The article of Muson on " the Nebul* , " published in the American Philosophical Transactions for 1840 , was his most elaborate work , occupying about fifty pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said by S. C. Walker , Esq. , well known as an astronomer of the first class in this country , to be the most complete works of the kind extant . this article " forms the first considerable contribution to astronomy in the way of original observation and discovery on this side of the Atlantic . " It contains a description of the large telescope constructed by the joint skill and labor of himself and his classmate Mr. H. L. Smith , his own observations on four remarkable nebulm , " two of them in part or altogether his own discoveries , " an account of his method of reo'istry by lines of equal brightness , and a particular review and comparison of Herschel 's observations with his own on the same nebulte . To show the impression produced by this paper and the other scientific works of Mason , we give the following remarks of Mr. Walker . " I know of no American who at the age of twenty one had done so much for the advancement of science as Mason . In the discovery of nebula , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our Mason was the first American whose efforts have been crowned with success . With talents of the first order , with a perseverance that surmounted every obstacle , with a devotion to science not to be surpassed , the path to the highest distinction both in theoretical and practical astronomy was open before him . " His treatise on " Practical Astronomy " was intended as a manual for college students and others who wish for instruction in the use of astronomical instruments . It is a record of his own experience as to the best methods of constructing and using them , and of reducing the data furnished by their aid . It is a notebook of his own celestial " pencilings by the way , " and not at all like too many " travellers ' guides , " compiled by authors who describe regions they never saw . Mr. Walker says- " it is a precious gem for the practical astronomer , " and Mr. E. E. Blunt , whose name is well known , pronounces it " superior to any thing of the kind he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage from his description of the telescope , in which he notices the effect of the atmosphere upon its magnifying power . if we mistake not , it will be admired by the rhetorician for its elegance , as well as by the astronomer for its singular precision in the statement of a troublesome difficulty . " But the chief bar to magnifying power is in the atmosphere . The air is seldom so well balanced as to be without contrary currents and motions , which produce sli ht transitory undulations and variations of density . In a section of the bro* d beam of light which is to enter the telescope , there is room for considerable // momentary differences of density , and consequently of refraction . When the rays before incidence are thus irregularly deflected from perfect parallelism with each other , and quivering or vibrating about a mean state , the point of light which they form after reflection must be troubled and confused . The star in the field of vie is in constant and rapid agitation , like an object seen through smoke or heated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rippling water . According to di&amp; ferent circumstances of atmospheric disturbance , the appearances of the star to an attentive observer are very different . Sometimes the individuals of a close double star twirl round each other , altering much their angle of position ; sometimes it appears like a drop of agitated mercury ; - very frequently *vritliirig arid convulsed , breaking in pieces and meuniting , occasionally heaving gently like the sun reflected on a calm swell ; and the rarest ofall states is that of perfect rest . These motions are minute , but are excessivelv troublesome , and in the majority of evenings prevent the application of very high powers , or the separation of very close and difficult stars . Au excellent telescope might very easily be condemned for supposed want of optical capacity on an unfavorable evening . Its merits therefore should not be judged of too hastily , nor until several evenings ' patient trial . And unless the star is free from any rapid quivering or agitation , it can not be judged whether the atmosphere or the telescope is most in fault . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author 's life , forming however but a comparatively small part of his labors for that period . When it was nearly ready for the press , it was delayed by the appointment of Mason to a place under the boundary commission , organized by the government of the United States , for exploring the disputed boundary between Maine and New Brunswick . The scientific corps had been completed according to the original design , when in view of the well known ability of Mason fot- the most important services of the expedition , he was honored with a special appointment . When he returned from the expedition , his disorder , the consumption , had made fearful ravages , and he was barely able to finish his treatise ; the last page of which was written but a few days before his death . Prof. Olmsted has given a striking account of the circumstances under which the last paragraph was penned . It is made up of reflections befitting the close of his work , and strikingly appropriate as the last literary effort of the author . It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a bri ht moment suddenly came with an unusual impulse . He seized his pen , completed the only remaining mathematical problem , and then wrote the concluding section . are now arrived at the conclusion of our work . With this partial review of the terrestrial contrivances and means by which astronomers have acquired their knowledge of the celestial bodies , we shall turn with increased pleasure to the consideration of the results of their labors , which constitute the departments of descriptive and physical astronomy . * * The observer who has the means of deriving results of his own from the heavens , needs no stimulus to prosecute a stud*r which few who thoroughly engage in t will easily relinquish . Every failure of agreement in his conclusions will but urge him patiently to solve the difficulty ; every instance of success will inspire him with flesh ardor and enterprise ; and he will find no pursuit more constantly bearing him forward to what lies beyond him , more absorbing in its prosecution , more elevating to his mind , or impressing him with a deeper sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It might be supposed by those who know nothing of Mason , except as an astronomer , that his memoirs would interest only such persons as are engaged in similar pursuits . It would be natural to think that his genius , though of the highest order , would in his case take an exclusive direction . Because he was a student secluded within the walls of the university , and had hardly entered upon the stirring scenes of the world , and never gained that notoriety which eminence in a public station confers , it may be thought his story is not rich and varied enough to waken a general sympathy . Such impressions are without foundation in the case of Mason . lie was by // rio means limited to one department of learning . His biographer designed to write a popular , rather than a scientific memoir . We can easily conceive of strong inducements to write a memoir , limited mainly to the elucidation of his passion for astronomy . In the preparation for such a work , the author might have drawn largely from materials yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mathematical papers of rare curiosity . He mi*ht have inserted an extensive and interesting astronomical correspondence , the whole of which has been excluded . In the present memoir we have hut little more than the results , which Mason accomplished in the way of original effort and discovery , and which raised him to the first rank among the astronomers of his time . It was the design of the author to benefit the community , while he reared a monument to his friend , and especially was it his object to waken among the young an enthusiasm for elevated studies , by the encouragement of a shining example . To do this , it was indeed necessary to unfold the causes which kindled and nourished the master passion , to mark the course of training in childhood and in subsequent years , and especially to give that system of rigid self-control and selfeducation to which Mason was more indebted for success than to any natural aptitude for excellence . Now though such a narration must be especially interesting to the lover of science and the man of literary pursuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as it is known , awaken a general sympathy . A master passion in any pursuit is always and every where sympathetic , let the subject of the narration be engaged in what pursuit or profession he may . The world is liberal enough to leave to him the working out his own destiny , according to the bent of his genius , and as his own indomitable will directs . The only inquiry is , how does he execute his purpose , and does he come forth as a victor from the battle-field of life ? He may have a passion to explore unknown regions , like Ledyard and Murigo Park , and his story will find eager listeners . A thousand hearts will accompany him through Siberian snows or the marshes of the Ni*er , in sympathy with the man rather thaw with his object . Few have any special fondness for the science of ornithology , yet who that has heard of Audubon , breathes not a benediction with his name ? We wish that God would send safe deliverance to a man of such right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that which has led him to traverse a continent on foot , to light his camp fire and take his meals among savages , a thousand leagues from the home of his childhood . So if Mason were presented to us simply as an astronomer , earnestly devoted to that one pursuit , it would seem that a general interest would not be wanting . If with a heart warm with generous affections , and a stranger to the least tinge of misanthropy , he had withdrawn himself , in the spring-time of life , from friends that he loved , that he might explore the profoundest mysteries of his favorite science , we should not fail to think of him in his seclusion . We should esteem it a favor to be admitted to his retreat , and readily listen to the detail of his discoveries and the artless confessional of his high aims and hopes . We should be pleased to see him constructing his apparatus , polishing his specula with exquisite finish , and when the day had been spent in tireless industry , it would delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours the " holy stars by night . " XVe should glow in the raptures he has himself expressed in his " Night Musings. " // " It is a joy as wild and deep As ever thrilled in pulse and eye , In the lone hour of mortal sleep To look upon your majesty , With you your solemn vigils keep , As your vast depths before me lie . " Mason had not only a passion for astronomy , but he could excel in the higher departments of literature . He had many of the qualities also , which go to form the finished artist . He had an exquisite delicacy of hand . He could readily portray his own conceptions , and copy with wonderful accuracy the real forms of nature and art . His astronomical drawings have been already referred to . His clear and searching intellectual vision , his quick and delicate sense of the beautiful , his ready and playful wit , his rich fancy , his imagination pure and truthful , were all in beautiful proportion and harmony , and would have made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not voluntarily relinquished those pursuits in which he displayed uncommon powers , before he gained celebrity as an astronomer . All his compositions show that , he had formed a fine ideal of a good style , and his latest efforts display a high degree of excellence , considering the fact that he seldom wrote pieces of a strictly literary character , except as a relaxation from his severer toils , or as the spontaneous expression of feelings wakened by some interesting incident , or personal association . In every thing he wrote , his love for what is fit in thought and expression is very observable . No one had a truer relish for what is attractive in natural scenery , in works of art , or in elegant composition ; but with him nothing was beautiful that was not appropriate to the general design . In a young writer occupied with his favorite themes , some of them the loftiest of human contemplation , we should expect and could pardon , a less subdued manner . But we are gratified to meet with a style at once simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet free from extravagant hyperbole , and that affected dignity with which writers of real talent sometimes invest their thoughts . He labored for a pure medium of thought , as the perfection of style , just as he labored for a perfect medium of light in the construction of his telescopes . The prismatic hues are very beautiful , but the slightest tinge is a sad defect in an achromatic lens . He made frequent use of trope and metaphor , but never to bedeck or conceal a truly noble idea . XVe have already referred to Mason 's poetic talent , which was early developed . His memoirs contain some of his juvenile pieces , certainly creditable for one so young at the time they were composed . After he entered college , he ceased to write verse , devoting his time to other pursuits , until the latter part of Senior year , when he wrote several pieces , some of them choice productions . The character of Mason as a man , is not less unworthy of remark , than his intellectual eminence . indeed , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellence , that renders his name deserving of especial remembrance . His disposition was social and generous . He had a hopeful temperament , and a heart formed for friendship . His intense zeal in his favorite studies did indeed necessarily narrow the circle of intimate acquaintance , but within that circle he was loved for his virtues , more than he was admired for his talents . The ground of this partiality , is disclosed in his published correspondence , and it xviii be fully justified by every one who reads these records of confiding friendship . No higher tribute could be paid to his memory , than the publication of these letters , revealing the ardent aspirations of one who loved learning for its rich rewards , and loved his friends better than the delights of learning . // " I am ill-satisfied , " said he , " with the newspaper , business style of an epistle , with which an hour or two snatched from my studies would furnish me ; but rather delight to sit down and gradually estrange myself awhile from books and mathematical lore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I can leave the painful straining of the mind at what it with difficulty comprehends , to enjoy the unrestrained intercourse which long associations teach it at once to understand and feel . Then I can write to you as I would ; nor at such times am I apt to believe that the highest flights of science in the firmament or elsewhere , can inspire thoughts worth the simple , kind word , with which one fellow mortal can cheer another on , in their common pilgrimage . " 1-us correspondence is throughout a realization of this , his ideal of letter-writing  --  and the benefit he derived to himself , could not have been less than the happiness he conferred . Under the impulse imparted in writing one of these letters , at a time of severe trial , he says ,  --  " I will fill all my future with hope , with bright undimmed hope . " The constant habit of communion with faithful and judicious friends , did much to afford that stimulus so needful to nerve him to the endurance of many trials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons , in early obtaining a clear idea of the worth of a liberal education , and the distinct advantages to be secured by it . He was fortunate in being always under the influence of urgent and healthful incentives to gain what he sought . But his path was obstructed with unusual difficulties . From the time of entering college , his family friends could afford him but little pecuniary aid , though their sympathy might animate him to the noblest undertakings . Yet lie aimed to secure all the advantages of the ordinary course of studies , while making at the same time most of his acquisitions in astronomy . To accomplish this , there was need often of great self-denial and fortitude in his constant struggle with penury . She invaded the solitude of his study with her unwelcome presence , to perplex a mind devoted to the noblest intellectual toil , to disturb his repose after long wakefulness and weariness , to dampen the joy of new born discoveries , and darken the prospects of better days , to threaten him even with banishment from the university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means did " Chill penury repress his noble rage , " or corrode his fine sensibilities , or blight his gentle affections . Mason was blessed not only with a happy disposition and superior natural abilities , but he was fortunate in having received a home education fitted to his temperament and talents . His own relations were , some of them , judicious and accomplished teachers . Consequently his childhood must have been a period of uniform sunshine . His love for books was cherished , and his ambition was excited by proper motives . Hence in after life he was not disturbed by the meaner passions . lie was an enthusiast in his pursuits , open and artless in unfolding his projects , but never ostentatious . He was doubtless anxious for fame , and desired that his name might not be forgotten in the grave , but he wished to be remembered only for wise and worthy deeds . " If vanity ever formed an ingredient in his character , " says one who knew him long and well , " he must have very early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : for he had studied himself with too close a scrutiny to be turned aside by the hasty remarks of others from the station his better judgment had awarded to him . It was an incense , too mean to find favor in the sight of one , who had weighed all his powers in the balance of sober reason . Like every man of lofty aim , he was never able to rest satisfied with past // attainments , but kept his eye always turned towards the future , too little satisfied with the present growth and station of his faculties , to cast a self-complacent stare in the mirror of the passing scene . " The writer of this beautiful tribute , was a native of the town where Mason was horn , and had been the companion of his childhood . After a long separation , they were brought together again on college ground , where their former intimacy was renexved , during the latter part of Mason 's Senior year . The earliest as well as the latest recollections of this friend , are published in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portions . We shall give his description of Mason 's visit to his birth-place , Washington , Ct. , a nd to the grave of his mother , who died when he was three years old . His father , the iRev . Stephen Mason , had been the pastor of the parish , formerly the residence of the late Dr. Porter , president of the Theological Seminary , at Andover , after whom his son was named . He removed from Washington , while his son was yet a child , but not before his memory had received deep impressions of the scenery and many of the inhabitants of his native place . During his absence , he had resided in different places , remote from each other , having found successively a home in the city of Richmond , at the island of Nantucket , then at Ellington , and finally at New Haven , where he had nearly completed his college course and *von much notice as an astronomer . In the full flush of honors and hope , he left Yale at the finest season of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural village where he was horn , and to which he was returning , after years of absence . But we must let the companion of this journey describe some of the impressions and incidents of this romantic visit . " The first opportunity that pre sented itself to me of renewing my acquaintance with Mason , was in the spring vacation of 1839 , when he visited Washington to see again faces once familiar to him , and renew those associations which formed some of the brightest links in the chain of his existence . I have never been more happily disappointed , than in discovering and correcting the mistaken opinion I had formed of his character . I had looked for the philosopher  --  the man of theories and calculation , and found only the child of nature , with an intellect clear and strong enough to pry into her deepest works , and a soul to feel their beauty . He showed a taste of the most refined order , and feelings of the most exquisite texture , while his simplicity , and I may say meekness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He delighted to linger about the house where he was born , and to stroll through the garden and orchard ; and he pointed out to me , with much emotion , the very room where his own mother first told him of the way to heaven . Almost the first thing I can remember , ' he observed , is the smile with which she swung me backward and forward upon her foot , and the kiss with which she bade me good night ! ' The love that he cherished for this amiable parent was one of the strongest ties that bound him to the past . His native village needed no other hold upon his affections , while it contained the ashes of one so dear to his remembrance . He was often heard to say that if he cherished any one feeling more than another , it was that her spirit still hovered around him to keep him from temptation by day , and to watch over his pillow by night . " " I remember well his first visit to her grave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappearing from the hill-tops . He stood a moment by the monument , and then reclining against the mound that // was heaped above her , he dropped his head upon his breast and wept with the sorrow and simplicity of a child . It was the grave of his mother : of that mother who first soothed his rest , from whose lips he had learned to lisp the first accents of an infant 's prayer . How little did we think , as he bent over her tomb , that he too in the short space of a year and a half , was to sleep with slumbers as unbroken as hers ! " A record of his own feelings during this visit was made in the following lines : ON RE ISITING THE SCENES OF MY CHILDHOOD . At last I tread once more the wonted haunts Where woke my infancy to life and light , Each everlasting hill its outline slants As recollection imaged to my sight , And time flows back ; and my stirred bosom pants Once more with early boyhood , to unite And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the echoes mock its sounds of mirth . On each remembered spot the dizzy flight Of by-gone ream is ruthlessly engraven ; And this is life ! still onward , in despite Of human power ; - perchance of that of heaven ; Like a raised wave before the tempest 's might , it may not breast the power by which t is driven , But etill borne ssn*el:y to the fatal shore , To break , and fall , and perish in its roar . is life no more ? - Oh ! never yet where dwelt rfhe image of the Almighty hath the breath Of Time 's defied and fruitless power been felt ; All else shall quail before the blast of death ; The sun shall be as blood ; the earth shall melt ; But the immortal soul shall tread beneath Her disembodied might , the chain of rime That dare not so near God 's own glory climb . " The temperament of Mason was naturally cheerful , and yet he had most serious and truthful views of life . His seriousness was not that of a morbid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimentalism , for Providence had given him success in his projects , and no one ever sought more anxiously than he for what is real in life , and its relations , or was less disturbed by imaginary evils . The vanity of human life was deeply impressed on his mind at a time when he was in the midst of pressing engagements and full of plans for the future . But this impression served not to dampen in the least his zeal in his undertakings , while it produced its proper effect in unfolding the importance of religious trulh , and turning his mind often and earnestly to a future life . The folloxving extracts from his correspondence during the last year of his life , will furnish favorable specimens of his talent in this species of composition , while they disclose his moral views of life and the state of his religious impressions during that period . In February , 1840 , he writes as follows to his aunt , Mrs. rrurner of Richmond . " I have not found my fellow beings more selfish or faithless or flinty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found some warm hearts ; and I am accustomed to believe that friendship , in many cases at least , is something more than a name . I have found no promises fail me , and as I rely somewhat snore upon my own resources than upon the promises of others , I am not likely to die of disappointed hope , if they should in future prove worthless and faithless . " " Whatever slight misanthropic symptoms may have appeared in my case , they have been engendered within myself , and have not arisen from any coldness or neglect on the part of others . I have no where placed confidence and been betrayed , no where cherished anticipations that were delusive . My weakness has rather arisen from a dissatisfaction with the wise order of things : a wish for existence in a world where the objects of human toil may he somewhat nobler than they are here ; where c 4om does not impede the affections of the heart and throw a cold formality over the intercourse of society . Yet this was not it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatne and distinction as fair as I can wish or expect . But they please me less than they did six months ago . it seems to me a poor recompense for the strife , the tossing to and fro . the harassing of life with objects of ambition and fame , to be rewarded after death with the empty coldness with which men are wont to pronounce the names of their predecessors who have made some little figure in the world , if indeed they ever happen luckily to have a name and being in the memory of the future . " I doubt whether I have been wise to meditate so soon on the text , all is vanity , ' // and whether it were not better to find it out by successive experiences later in life . Perhaps this moody season of self-contemplation has bestowed on me two advantages-an early conviction that the motives which generally actuate men are scarcely worth much consideration or esteem , and that the only sure anchor of the spirit is religious principle ; and further , a belief that with this stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the troubles which untoward circumstances , baffled hopes , homeless love , or a world 's coldness might bring upon me , as a man  |p05-sessed  of an ordinary stock of sensibility can care . At least at present 1 fancy I could school myself to a hearty contempt of them generally , however they might immoderately affect me with a passing pang . But the world is before me ,  --  1 must be up and doing while the day lasts . I have thought much and am more deeply read in the philosophy of life than I should have been had I not struggled with its adversities . I rise from my dreams with the vigor of the morning , yet with the soberness of one that has seen the evening .

For I look upon ambition as a motive very little worthy of an immortal soul ; and indeed , many of the other motives to which mankind in general , and with them doubtless myself , bow down . I do not now and really never did ask shelter of any vain philosophy ; nor do I care very much for or appreciate highly any other stimulus of thought or action , than that which considers a longer period than the swift frail moment for which our earthly existence lasts . " These quotations show that he was not only learned in the wisdom of the schools , but that he had deeply reflected upon the great moral lessons of life . They account for his deep yet rational seriousness at this period , though at the same time he was constantly tranquil and even cheerful . He evidently understood the admonition given him by the frequent attacks of that disease which at last proved fatal-though it would seem that few persons afflicted with his flattering though fatal malady , were ever more sanguine in hoping for a recovery from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the story of Mason , than his devotion to his earnest purposes , if so be he might accomplish them before his race should be run . To meet the pecuniary liabilities incurred for his education , and at the same time to do something which should live after him and be of permanent value , and deserve the remembrance of the wise and good , were objects he quickened his pace to gain , even when the wing of the death-angel was casting its dark , chilling shadows on his path . His intense labors doubtless shortened his days ; though , with the utmost care , it is not probable that so frail a constitution could have endured a long life . Still , his exposure of health and life was doubtless great , and his biographer has taken no pains to conceal this great fault . The only poor apology for his habitual neglect of health , is , that physical weakness , and even alarming symptoms , were overlooked , under the strong impulses of favorite and multiplied engagements , and when the danger became immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no doubt that Mason 's intense zeal in his exciting and pressing occupation , also prevented that development of a religious character which was so peculiarly congenial to a mind like his . In the quotations from his letters , we have given his intellectual convictions , and on all points of practical doctrine and duty , they were , so far as we know , correct . But his personal feelings and hopes were referred to by himself but seldom , and with extreme reserve . To the world he was not known as a religious man , by a public profession of his faith . // Yet his conduct was uniformly exemplary , however much his too earnest devotioa to objects of worldly ambition might lead him to neglect his spiritual interests . During the last few months of his life , he sincerely regretted this neglect , and gave the whole weight of his testimony in opposition to his own course of life in this respect . " I have been wrong , " he exclaimed , with earnestness ; " I should have met the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find . " To a few confidential friends , his hope of heaven was revealed with many fears , with deep self-distrust , perhaps with more confidence , on the bed of death . The friend who had accowpanied him to his birth-place and his mother 's grave , seems to have been made a confident of his religious feelings . He has informed us , that Mason " sought , with a care and diligence truly surprising , not only the Scriptures , but the works of some of the most eminent theological writers , among which , Butler 's Analogy was his favorite . This book he read again and again , and wished , in our morning walks , to be constantly conversing upon the sublime topics of which it treats . The wonderful disposition of Providence in causing us to pass through a state of trial , in oriier to purify and exalt us for a better sphere , and the goodness of God manifested in the care he bestows on his children , exerted upon his mind a powerful influence . To die without a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave , was a bitter cup for a soul like his to drink ; but he at last seemed to be reconciled to the order of Providence , and said , more than once , that if it was the will of Heaven , he could give up all his fond anticipations of knowledge and fain e , and consent to be forgotten . " A public commemoration is not called for , to ensure , on the part of the acquaintances of Mason , a recollection of his talents or his virtues , and to such as were admitted to his intimate confidence , public praise would be but a poor consolation for the loss of so dear a friendship . They already understand , better than can be described to them , the moral beauty of that life which has passed away . They only can adequately estimate the loss , to the cause of learning , of so much genius , so passionately wedded to the noblest of the sciences . But the duty of public remembrance rests on other and higher grounds . Though Mason perished iii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may remain a fixed and guiding star to many who never heard of his name while he lived . The influence of distinguished excellence can be made immortal among men . The names of such as have left behind them enduring memorials of their wisdom and virtue , their nobleness of heart and devotion to truth , are always well employed , when they can be made to allure others by the rewards of well-doing , and nerve them with fortitude in times of trial . On this ground , the brilliant though brief career of Mason should be held in everlasting remembrance by his countrymen . The story of his life will inspire in the young a high appreciation of the value of liberal studies . It will quicken the members of our high schools and colleges with generous impulses and noble aims . It will promote , wherever it is known , a zeal among the friends of our universities for their increased prosperity . It will ever be an honor to the most popular , and one of the oldest American universities , that the genius of Mason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so efficient , and awakened so much promise.
