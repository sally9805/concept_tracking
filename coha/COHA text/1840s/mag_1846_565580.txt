txt IT is not often that the Reviewer has an opportunity to assemble on one subject , three works so valuable as the Treatises of Whately , Mill and Tappan , on Logic . When we say , however , that these writers treat upon one subject , we must acknowledge we use a considerable latitude of expression ; for , to the Logic of Aristotle , which Whately reproduced , Mill has added the Baconian Induction , while , besides both of these , Tappan embraces the wide field of Transcendental Intuition . It would be impossible to examine all these various topics within a sufficiently short compass , if we were bold enough to undertake the adventurous task at all . We propose merely to give our opinion upon the merits of these works , and to make some few and condensed observations upon the Syllogism , Induction and Intuition . And we trust it will not be thought foreign to the object of our Journ I , to introduce to the notice of our renders a subject , the practice of which gave to Edwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has giv en to the divines of New England generally , the high character which they sustain as sound reasoners . We assert some things ; we prove others . What we prove , we know in consequence of our knowing something else : what we assert , we know directly . To prove a proposition , is to connect it with another proposition which is ultimately asserted . Thus , Assertion is the starting point from which every thing that is proved must proceed . We prove in two ways . We prove , Inductively , when that which we know to be true of certain individual things , we infer is true of certain like things which we have not examined . We prove , Syllogistically , when from a general truth we authenticate an individual truth which is embraced within it . Assertion , Induction and Ratiocination , furnish us with all that we know . The terms , Reasoning , Induction and Logic , are used in different senses by good writers . From this circumstance have arisen many controversies which are merely verbal . How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Syllogism ,  - -  or whether all Reasoning can be reduced to the form of the Syllogism , Whately 's Logic . Logic , by J. S. Mill . London , 1843 . Elements of Logic , by Henry P. Tappan . New York and London , 1844. // are questions which depend entirely upon the sense in which the terms are used . But we shall not discuss these points . Real precision of thought is gained less by an attempt at uniformity , than it is by each writer accurately defining his own use of terms . We commence with Ratiocination ; arid we mean by it , the process by which we deduce a less general from a more general proposition . It is important to consider the order in which knowledge is acquired . If philosophers could have their way in the matter , the mind would first furnish itself with all the individual sensations , thoughts , emotions and intuitions , which it might ever have occasion to use ; then , it would be set to the task of forming general truths from the stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first principles , the person would be sent forth into life , with rules , all fresh and all self-obtained , to guide his judgment in all the real occurrences which might meet him . But the actual order of knowledge is far different . While the mind is early becoming acquainted with individual facts as they occur within its sphere ; while it early affirms those intuitive truths which are necessarily brought to light by the occasions of actual experience ; while it early generalizes in some degree for itself from what it observes , it is more frequently and more extensively receiving general truths without investigation , and on mere authority . Most of the words in language are general terms , which have a meaning for the most part correspondent to the reality . Most of the truths which are universally believed among men , are general propositions which have been handed down from age to age , and from generation to generation . What are proverbs and maxims but general propositions universally received ? What the principles of human con duct , but the same ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The sciences and the various departments of human instruction contain a series of general propositions , which are proposed for the acceptance of those who are taught . What else are the axioms of pure mathematics ? or the laws of Natural Philosophy ? What else the principles of Political Economy ? What else are civil laws and the decisions of the courts ? No man forms for himself even a tithe of the generalizations which he believes . Now in the instruction of the young and in the common affairs of life , all these general propositions are taken as truths . They are not proved-they are assumed . They are used by every body . The orator uses them in convincing men ; the statesman uses them in defending his measures ; the man of business uses them in the judgment which he makes upon individual cases which demand his action . These general truths or propositions are common stock . It was in this view of them , that the ancient rhetoricians , in their attempt . to teach the orator how to speak convincingly on any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more general truths , which they called Topics ; for the ancient Topics are nothing but very general propositions applicable to a great variety of individual things , and which would be generally accepted as true . And with the orator the question is , what are the propositions which the audience will admit , and from which the particular proposition can be de-duced ? We have said that the general propositions embraced in language and handed down from generation to generation , are almost innumerable , and that they are a common stock of admitted truths to be used by every body . But how used ? There is a strong tendency in the mind , posses*ed of general // truths , to refer individual propositions to some general one ; and the mind rests with much more satisfaction in propositions relating to individual things , when they are viewed as instances of a general law or principle . This is what we mean when we speak of referring things to principles ; that is , individual things to general propositions . The greater part of what is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists in this process-the reference of the individual to the general class , law or principle ; or , as it is more usually expressed , and what is the same thing , the deduction of the particular from the general proposition . Now we have these two facts before us : First , that every man is in possession of a large number of general propositions , which he and every other person holds to be true . Secondly , that all men do naturally refer propositions respecting individuals to these general propositions , and do feel a greater confidence in them when it can be done . It only remains to inquire , whether the particular can always be referred to the general with absolute certainty ; or , in other words , whether the deduction of a particular proposition from a more general and admitted proposition , can always be made with entire accuracy and without the possibility of error ? The answer is-it can be done , and the syllogism is the formula hy which it is done . We have here arrived at the precise object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Whately . Logic both gives the rules of art or the formula by which all error is avoided in the process of deducing the particular from the general , and demonstrates the necessary accuracy of the rules . it is , therefore , both science and art . We thus see , that logic has a precise and limited field . It begins where investigation leaves off . It contemplates general principles as already established , and shows how the particular and individual propositions may he deduced from them , or referred to them with absolute certainty . This is called the Aristotelian or School Logic . But whatever it may be called , it has all the characteristics of science . Its fundamental axiom is intuitively certain-its definitions precise -- its technical terms accurate and well chosen , and its rules comprehensive and complete . The view which we have thus given , is substantially the view of Aristotle in the Organon . Aristotle makes a broad distinction between science and the materials of science . He seems  --  to regard the philosopher as a teacher laying before his pupils a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary truths , which , though unproved , the pupil is to receive as known . With him , science is doctrine and discipline ; something to be taught and something to be learned . But to teach is to communicate to another that which he does not know , and in order to communicate what is not known we must begin with what is known . So with learning . But that which is known is not strictly a part of that which is taught* Science may be regarded as a series of propositions connected together and mutually dependent , of which the primary are to be taken as known immediately , and the others are shown to be true from their connection with the former . Now , in one sense , the primary truths may be regarded as within the province of science ; that is , in the sense of being used within it , and being the mediurn by which the ultimate conclusions of science are arrived at ; but in the sense of having been produced by science , they are not a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or first principles , as being prior to science , and merely brought within science for its starting points . Aris. // totle teaches the same doctrine with respect to opinion or contingent truths . Science and opinion agree , according to him , in that they are both proved from that which is not proved but is known immediately . They are both deduced with equal certainty , but the truths themselves are certain in the one case , and contingent in the other . The distinct mark of science and opinion is , that they are proved by means of something else which is known and granted , but not proved . Every proven proposition , therefore , implies others from which it is deduced and which are themselves unproved . The form in which these propositions are arranged , so that the concluded proposition shall follow with certainty from the foreknown propositions , is the syllogism . The syllogism is of course coi*xtensive with science and opinion , and Aristotle divided it , according to its matter , into the demonstrative or scientific syllogism , and the dialectic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either certain or probable , the syllogism is-in the view of Aristotle-coi*xtensive with proof , or rather with the deduction of particular from universal propositions . In support of this representation we take the liberty of quoting a few brief passages . In the opening paragraph of the Posterior Analytics , he says , " All doctrine and all discipline or learning of the discursive kind is from for&amp;. existing knowledge . " " It is necessary that demonstrative science be from premises true and first and immediate and more known and prior , and the cause of the conclusion . They must be true , otherwise the conclusion would not be true . They must be causes , for we only know absolutely when we know the cause  --  and if causes , then prior and foreknown , not only as being apprehended but as being true . " He then says , that by first truths he means " the same as the beginning --  ( &amp;*xiiv , ) and that the beginning of demonstration is a proposition , immediate , and that an immediate proposition is one , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to matters of opinion , he says , in the Topics , ( 1.1 ) " the primary truths are those which appear to be true to all or the greater part , or to wise men , the whole or a part . " Aristotle , by drawing this broad distinction between doctrine or deduced truths and direct knowledge , gave a clear and definite boundary to the field of his labors . He knew precisely the kind of material with which he was to work , and the work itself which was to be done . This definiteness of view enabled him to proceed in his labors in an order which seems of all others to be the most convenient and the best adapted to the end he proposed . It enabled him , at the outset , to form a clear apprehension of the nature of the materials , and to take a comprehensive view of the whole . The materials are universal notions . He therefore , in the first place , treats of terms , or the single words by which universal notions are expressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten categories . Having thus a clear conception of the elements of propositions , he is prepared to treat next of propositions themselves . These are the subjects of the two Treatises , entitled Kar4'o*tw , and FIe*L *E*o1veta5 . But the contemplation of the work to be done  --  the arrangement of the truths through the proposition in the order of mutual dependence , so that the unknown shall certainly follow from the known-would lead him , as the second step , to the consideration of the formula , by which truths could be thus arranged , and by which in every case , that which is concluded shall be certainly deduced from the primary unproved truth . This formula is the syllogism , and he treats of it-so far forth as it is a mere // form-in the treatise called the Prior Analytics . But , again , the contemplation of the materials to he deduced to the syllogisms , would disclose the important distinction , that some of the primary truths are necessary and some are probable , which would lead him , as the third step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of truth should be deduced to the syllogism . This he does in the Treatises , called the Posterior Analytics , or on the Demonstrative Syllogism ; and the Topics , or on the Dialectic Syllogism . The treatises , which we have thus enumerated , form the Organon of Aristotle . They furnish the instrument with which , and embrace the materials on which , the intellect is to work . It is obvious that the Old Organon and the Novum Organum occupy distinct provinces . But Aristotle and Bacon , so far from being in conflict , are in peaceful possession of almost the entire domain of knowledge . Aristotle recognized the office of induction , and no where underrates its merits , though he did not write a formal treatise on it , and indeed did not consider it capable of a strict science . Bacon , though he speaks with contempt of the trifles of logic in vogue in his day , formally acknowledges the mode of judging by the syllogism . " It is manifest , " he says , " that this way of judging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propositions to principles by means of middle terms . " ( Manifestum est igitur , artem hanc judicandi per syllogismum aihil aliud quam reductionem propositionum ad principia per medios terminos . De Aug . Sci. , Lib . V. Cap . iv . ) Bacon derived his knowledge of Aristotle from Latin translations and the scholastic logic ; and , as a matter of course , subsequent scholars have discovered many mistakes-but , yet , with his usual sagacity , he perceived and has frequently expressed in his work , the real and precise office of the syllogism . Aristotle , though he clearly saw that the premises of the syllogism were derived from the induction of singular or individual things , did not give to this subject the full power of his mind , and it must be confessed no where is he so little satisfactory . These great masters of thought have divided between them the intellectual world , and each is supreme within his own dominion . Aristotle reared a superstructure of the finest proportions upon the foundations then existing , but yet leaving it possible to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be laid . Bacon labored at the foundations **25;62;TOOLONG and building anew . Their fortune has been various* Bacon , from the first , has received the homage of the human mind ; - his fame has never suffered even a partial eclipse . What may befall it during the nineteen hundred years which must elapse before Bacon shall be where Aristotle now is , it would be presumptuous to say ; but w emay say thus far , that every new portion of space which has been brought within the vision of man , every new revelation which has been made of the mighty changes this earth has undergone in the illimitable past , every new analysis , every new combination , every new fact , all the astonishing discoveries of science , have only served to make our thoughts of his great name co-extensive with the known bounds of the universe . Aristotle , on the contrary , has suffered equally from the zeal of his followers , and the ignorance of his adversaries , at one time buried beneath the accumulation of friendly commentaries , and at another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We say ignorance without hesitation , for Doct . Reid ingenuously confesses that he had studied only a portion of the writings which he so severely condemned , and had not fully understood // what he had studied . But the great merits of Aristotle have overcome both of these obstacles , and he must ever be regarded as one , at least , " of the masters of them that know . " It must be admitted , that the Aristotelian Logic was at one period very much perverted ; nor is it difficult to explain the rea*en . We have seen that in every language there is a large body of ' generally received truths or propositions , and that there is a very strong tendency in the mind to refer individual cases to these acknowledged principles . Now logic , as guiding the mind in this universal process , may easily overstep its appropriate bounds . It may come to be taken for granted , that these generally admitted propositions are to be received by the philosopher without question , as absolute truths ; and moreover that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of which new truths can be derived . This was , as we apprehend , the great error of the schoolmen , that they regarded the general terms of language as always corresponding to the reality of things , and as containing the elements of all truth . With them language , instead of being a record , continually to register new truths among those already ascertained , was a repository already holding the materials of all truth ; so that the office of the investigator was to combine and re-combine , compose and re-compose the existing terms , with new expressions . Of course no real progress was made-there was a continual revolution in the same circle . At the same time , a contempt for physical truths compared with intellectual and revealed truths , kept them from finding the path which alone leads to new discoveries . This was reserved for Bacon , and we apprehend it was a higher appreciation of the value of physical facts , and a less transcendental view of what is really useful in a material sense , that led him to re-assert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . And when we consider that all the learning of the age , and not only of one age but of a long antiquity , together with the whole influence of the church , was against the innovation , and that there was no help from any other source , we can not overpraise the wonderful sagacity that detected the obscured and hidden entrance to the way of true investigation , and the not less wonderful perseverance , that would not let him once falter in the course which be had marked out for himself . He saw , when the whole world was blind , and it should detract little from his praise that he saw some things obscurely . It is true , as we have already said , that Aristotle did recognize the necessity of induction  --  but still the fact remains , that that truth was buried under the accumulated rubbish of ages ; and it is to the glory of Bacon , not that he disinterred it , but that he gave to it , as it were , an original creation . He proclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , he assigned to it an importance which neither Aristotle nor any other philosopher had ever done , and the result has shown , that it was the prediction of a true prophet . The age of the schoolmen will never return . We need not fear a new perversion of the school logic . We must renounce the claims which were once made in its favor . It can not invent-it can not discover . But the inference which was drawn , and which was so long in vogue , that , therefore , it can do nothing useful , must also be renounced . What , then , are its advantages ? What would be a fair statement of its claims ? 1 . It furnishes , both in its acquisition and application , a good exercise of mind for the student . It would be regarded as a sufficient reason for the study of geometry , that it strengthens the powers of attention // and forms the habit of accurate thought , even if there were no application of its truths to other things . The culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the important reasons for the study of the ancient languages . Logic , as a strict science , having exact definitions , an excellent terminology and certainty in its laws , is a study well adapted in itself to strengthen habits of close attention and accurate thinkingwhile the application of it , in the study of argumentative works , is a continual exercise of the reasoning powers . Besides , we think it very desirable in education , that the student should study works in the English language besides mathematical treatises , which require attentive and deliberate reading , in order to prepare for a recitation from them . Every one knows from his own experience , how much more difficult it is to fix the mind in reading a work in English than in a foreign language . The facility with which we can catch some meaning from the sentences as xve run over them , indisposes us to a close study of the reasoning . The student should be accustomed in early life , we think , to the careful and deliberate study of argumentative works in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when necessary , with the requisite care . Now , logic requires close attention in its acquisition , and tends to form a habit of mind favorable to a rigid examination of the meaning of language , and the dependence of sentence upon sentence . Indeed , we would say , looking at the discipline of mind and not at mere information , that no study should be pursued in education which does not require c , lose attention to be mastered . And we believe every teacher would be gladly excused from hearing recitations from treatises , which are so written that a question can not be asked which a student of fair talents could not answer at once without study , or if he be required to recite without question , where there will be nothing but a mere exercise of memory . The difficulty here referred to is peculiarly great in English studies . Every teacher who hears recitations in Archhishop Whately 's masterly Treatises on Logic and Rhetoric , will feel a warm gratitude to their distinguished author . 2 . Logic traces particular facts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although we fully admit that these acknowledged general principles are not to be implicitly adopted by the philosophical inquirer , and although there must be continual additions made to the body of absolute truths , still we would guard against the fallacious inference , either that , therefore , they are not to be received by any body , or that there is not already in existence and recorded in language , a vast amount of truths . Indeed , when we consider that the words of language are not mere sounds , but stand for actual thought , feelings , and almost every intellectual operation we are conscious of , and that these words have been admitted hy a long series of generations and by different nations over the world , to represent subsfrtntinlly the same realities , we can not well believe that any subsequent investigations can overthrow what has been thus received . Law , Justice , Right , Virtue , are in one sense hut so much articulate sound , but these sounds stand for realities , admitted by all men and all ages . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is too often overlooked , that language contains the realities  --  and authenticated in the most satisfactory manner -- which furnish the materials of nearly all the propositions which men believe . The same course of remarks may be made with respect to the acknowledged principles of human conduct , and the great body of generally admitted opinions among men . // They are truths upon which men act and have acted for ages and in every diversity of circumstances , and it is not probable that very many will be proved to be erroneous . We may therefore take for granted that there is in existence a great amount of general principles , which constitute the mass of opinions among men . But these general principles are the tests by which is tried the validity of all particular assertions concerning individual things . Let any one consider how continually he himself refers to principles for the justification of opinions , and how constantly in discussions among men the reference is made from principle to principle , until at last some one is reached so general as to he admitted on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the reasoning process which is actually most used by men , at the bar , in the pulpit , by the physician , in political controversv and in the business concerns of life-is that of referring individual things to acknowledged principles , or deducing them the one from the other . But this is the very process of which logic gives both the theory and the rule- If writers and disputants would oftener look at the doctrines which they advance , in the light of first principles , they would avoid many errors . It is skill in drawing inferences from what is admitted , or in stating the particulars that are involved in universally acknowledged truths , which is the chnracteristic of a good reasoner . But it is this skill which the study of logic and the practice of its rules , is adapted to give . True it is , here are many good reasoners who never studied logic ; and so there is a still larger number who use the English language grammatically , who never studied grammar ; and a larger still , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never studied arithmetic . It is not the sole object of education , to teach those things only which can not he acquired in any other way . Another object is , to abridge the labor of acquiring what might be acquired by the individual himself , though probably in most cases it would not be so . 3 . Logic arranges a series of truths in the appropriate order , and states single arguments with clearness and precision . The syllogism may be regarded as a mode of arranging connected truths , so that the dependence shall he unavoidably perceived . We need not dwell upon the importarree of the habit of clear arrangement and distinct statement . 4 . We may perhaps add that the technicalities of the scholastic logic were so interwoven into works written previously to the time of Locke , that some acquaintance with it is necessary to the full understanding of the literature of our languagenet to say that it afterwards afforded a prominent topic to the satirist -- so that it may fairly he considered as a part of a general education . We will only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be and ought to he compressed within a small compass , and that it can he mastered in a very short time . We think that Whately 's treatise contains every thing that is needed on the subject . It is well known that Dr. Whately devoted much time and care to this work . He says himself , that he had been more or less occupied with it for eighteen years , enjoying at the same time the advantages of frequent suggestions and corrections from several judicious friends , and we have been informed , on what we suppose to be good authority , that the work was written over and over a great many times . Besides , he has carefully made changes in each successive edition , as they were required . Some of these are quite interesting . In the first edition , the definition of // 465 Simple Apprehension- " that it is the notion of any object in the mind , " does not agree with the definitions of Judgment and Reasoning , which are defined as the act of comparing-the act of proceeding from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acting . We find this oversight corrected in the fourth edition , where Simple Apprehension is defined , " the act of the mind in which it receives " ( would not conceives or forms be better ? ) " the notion of any object . " In a learn *d paper on several Logical Works , in the Edinburgh Review , ( vol. lvii , 1833 , ) Dr. XVhately is convicted of having overlooked the technical meaning of Argument , as that term was employed by the ancient logicians . We find by his fourth edition , that he had read that paper , for in defining the middle term he inserts a parenthesis which is not in the first edition , thus- " the middle term ( called by the old logicians , argumentum ) . " In this same edition also he has inserted a short paragraph , as if to answer the objections of Mr. Mill as to the nature of induction . But the work is too well known to need any farther notice . The Treatise of Mr. Mill is chiefly devoted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best systematic work on that subject in the language . We differ , indeed , from Mr. Mill upon several important points ; upon the nature of general terms , upon the import of propositions and the syllogism , and upon the fundamental principle of Induction : besides , we have no sympathy with his philosophy : and yet , we think he has been eminently successful , in his attempt to reduce to system the various principles of investigation which have been employed in modern science . We shall , however , confine our controversy with him , to the si*gle question of the nature or foundation of inductive reasoning , though this will involve all the other logical questions . Mr. Mill defines induction to be , " that operation of the mind by which we infer , that what we know to be true , in a particular case or cases , will be true in all cases , which resemble the former in certain assignable respects : " or , in a slightly different form of expression , " that process by which we conclude that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true of the whole class , or what is true at certain times will be true , under similar circumstances , at all times . " Induction begins with individual facts , and proceeds to general conclusions . When we discover by direct examination , something to be true of an individual , we infer that the same thing is true of other individuals , which we have not examined , provided they resemble it in the material circumstances . Induction , therefore , includes two distinct processes , the Examination and the Inference . Now with regard to the inferential part of the process , there arises a very difficult question , and one about which philosophers have entertained very diverse opinions : it is , how do we know that the inference is true ? If we start with the supposition that all we know is what we know of an individual , how can we from that make an inference about individuals of which we know nothing ? Nor would it make any difference if we should find , by direct examination , the same thing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any number short of the whole , for we have still a knowledge of those individuals only . But if we start with the supposition that we already know some general truths , and then affirm that it is by means of these we pass from the individual facts , to assertions concerning facts which we do not know , we only remove the point of difficulty . For , these general truths were themselves obtained , either from the examination of the individuals or from inferences still pre // 466 Logic . vious . If the former , it is the case just considered ; if the latter , that inference may be traced still farther back , until at length we reach the primary inference from the examination of individuals . The question still remains , if in every case of inference , ultimately all that we know is the knowledge of the individual facts ,  --  how do we get from the known individuals to the general conclusion , concerning individuals which we do not know ? As already intimated , various answers have been given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whately has given an explanation , which , however , is not satisfactory to Mr. Mill , whose own explanation will , perhaps , be as little satisfactory to others . Mr. Mill , after giving the definition above quoted , adds ; " we must first observe that there is a principle implied in the very statement of what induction is ; an assumption with regard to the course of nature and the order of the universe ; namely , that there are such things in nature as parallel eases ; that what happens once will , under a sufficient degree of similarity of circumstances , happen again , and not only again but always . " " The proposition , that the course of nature is uniform , is the fundamental principle or general axiom of induction ; " - " unless it were true , all other inductions , " as he says in another place , " would be fallacious . " He here admits , that from the knowledge of individual facts alone , we could not pass to the general inference , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know something in addition , namely , the general proposition that the course of nature is uniform-which is only another way of stating , in the words of the definition , that what is true in a particular case or cases , will be true in all cases which resemble the former in certain assignable respects . But how do we know this ? How have we ascertained that this uniformity prevails in the universe ? Mr. Mill replies-after identifying the uniformity of nature with the law of universal causation-by induction ; " We arrive at this universal law , " he says , " by generalization from laws of inferior generality . " But how are these laws of inferior generality obtained ? The propositions affirming these laws must have been derived either from an examination of individual facts , or from propositions previously ascertained . If the former , he has already admitted that a general inference can not be drawn from individual facts alone , without the assumption of the very principle of the uniformity of nature ; if the latter , the propositions may be ultimately traced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of individual facts . how , then , in these primary inductions , are we authorized to draw the inferences by which Mr. M. would prove the universal maxim of induction . Indeed , after admitting , as he does , " that every induction may be stated in the form of the syllogism , " and that " a proposition asserting the uniformity of nature will be the ultimate major premise in all inductions , " it surprises us that he did not see the incongruity of saying , that the major premise necessary to the first induction , is still obtamed by another and , of course , previous induction . Archbishop Whately 's analysis of induction is as follows . " in the process of reasoning by which we deduce , from the observation of certain known cases , an inference with respect to unknown ones , we are employing a syllogism in Barbara with the major premises suppressed ; " thus , " what belongs to the individual or individuals we have examined , belongs to the whole class under which they come ; this or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , it belongs // to the whole class . " But Mr. Mill well asks , " How do we get this major premise ? Not by a previous induction , for it is necessary to every induction ; nor by the syllogism , for that would require a previous premise . " It does indeed seem to be a plain case of " begging the question . " But is Mr. Mill 's statement any better ? He himself expressly admits " that the whole field of induction may be laid out in syllogism , and every instance of experience may be exhibited as the conclusion of a Ratiocination , except one ; but that one unhappily includes all the rest . Whence came the universal major ? what proves to us that nature is governed by general laws ? Where are the premises of the syllogism of which this is the conclusion ? Here at least is a case of induction which can not be resolved into a syllogism . " Dr. XVhately did not indeed attempt to answer this question and Mr. Mill has done it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt , for he says -- it is obtained by induction . But we retort his question -- how is the general principle of the uniformity of nature -- without which , not the examination of the individual cases . but the inference from them as to other cases not examined , is impossible -- how is this obtained for the first inference in induction ? Mr. Mill begs the question as much as Dr. Whately . The truth seems to be , that the inferential part of the inductive process , has not that certainty which belongs to intuition and ratiocination . We may doubt as to what are intuitive truths , but when we have settled that , there arc no more questions to be asked . We may doubt as to the truth of the premises , but we can not deny the conclusion from admitted premises in a legitimate syllogism . But the primary inductions , in every department of knowledge , must be more or less uncertain . If we might venture to mingle in this contest , we would propose as the foundation of the inference in induction , the following principles : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is merely an assumption . The major premise is in reality hypothetical , and the syllogism of induction might be stated in the form of a conditional syllogism , thus ; if it be true that whatever belongs to the individual , belongs to the whole class , then , the property in question which has been found in certain individuals that have been examined , belongs to all other like individuals that have not been examined ; it is true ; therefore , the conclusion follows . But at first , to say the least , the affirmation of the condition must be an assumption . Indeed Mr. Mill acknowledges this ; for , after saying that the conviction of the uniformity of nature is gradually obtained , he adds , that " the various methods of induction which took the principle for granted could only afford results which were admissible conditionally , " ( 2.1 15 . ) We differ from Mr. Mill only in this point , that we claim in these primary and conditional inferences of induction there must have been an assumed major premise-so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whately says , syllogistic . Secondly , the verification of this primary assumption in actual experience , would , as the cases increased in frequency , make it more and more probable that the course of nature is uniform . In this position , also , we do not differ from Mr. Mill ; for he says , " every successful induction has the effect of extending the acknowledged dominion of general laws and bringing an additional portion of the experience of mankind to strengthen the evidence of the universality of the law of causation , " ( 2.115 . ) But we contend that Mr. Mill does not show in what manner it is possible , if all that we know is the knowledge of the individual case , to strengthen the evi // 468 Logic . dence by increasing the number of the cases . If each individual case is nothing but a matter of direct observation , if all our knowledge is nothing but a number of such observations , we see not how a connection can be proved to exist among them so as to authorize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of causes and effects- The observed facts may be links , but a mere accumulation of links will not make a chain- It is here we differ most materially from our author . We claim that in addition to the observed facts , there are Intuitions which connect the facts together and enable us to assert , not a mere multipli6ation of like facts , but a causal uniformity . That there is such a thing as cause , andthe mind knows it as soon as experience furnishes an example ; it knows that besides the consciousness of the sensations produced by the two material phenomena , which we call cause and effect , there is the assertion of a connection and of an ultimate power of production . It is the idea of cause , design , system and the like , which can alone authorize the inductive inference from what we know to what we do not know . Sensations can not draw an inference , and sensations are all the knowledge Mr. Mill 's system makes provision for . In the preceding explanation , we have followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intuition underlying , as it were , the inductive inferences , but that it is brought out fully , and distinctly recognized only by occasion of lengthened experience . It is this deficiency in his doctrine of the ground of general truths in induction , which has given rise to what is peculiar in his view of the syllogism . We have purposely reserved our remarks upon this topic for the present place . Mr. Mill contends that " in every syllogism considered as an argument ment to prove the conclusion , there is a petitio principii ; for , no reasoning from generals to particulars can prove any thing , since from a general principle you can not infer any particulars but those which the principle itself assumes as foreknown . " But the question is not whether you can infer any other particulars , but whether the inference you do draw concerning the particulars is not made more evident-whether the conviction of the mind , affirming or denying the concluded proposition , is not rendered stronger . And in proof that this is so , we alledge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind to refer things to principles , and that they particular proposition is more confidently received from the circumstance of its being so referred . We may not be able perhaps to account for the fact ; and yet the admitted fact itself will account for another-that the conviction of the mind concerning particular propositions drawn from general ones , is different from what it would be without the intellectual process of reference ; - which process , when expressed in words , is the formula of the syllogism . Aristotle recognizes this fact . He says , " the syllogism by the middle is prior and more known in nature , but the syllogism of induction is more known to us , " ( An . Pr . 2. 23 . ) " I call those things prior and more known to us , which are nearer to sense , and those things absolutely prior and more known which are more removed from sense . These latter are universals , the former singulars . " ( An . Post . 1 . 2 ) We rely upon the fact itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least in one very extensive class of cases . We refer to the numerous class of causal propositions . For if the general proposition asserts *oore , as we think we have shown , than any included particular proposition by itself could do , namely , that there is a cause securing the uniform existence of // that which is asserted , and if we could not affirm this in any single case , without an assumption having less probability than if there had been more instances examined , then we claim that the reference of the particular to the general proposition , invests the former with the increased evidence of the latter . Indeed , Mr. Mill himself admits , in saying that enlarged experience strengthens the evidence of the universal law of causation , that the general proposition assertino ' universal uniformity has more evidence in its favor than a particular proposition included under it , which should assert uniformity only in a single instance . " The universal is valuable , " says Aristotle , " because it declares the cause . " Besides , with respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cases of individual experience to universally admitted principles , and which are for the most part cases of causation-it is obvious that the general principle has more evidence in its favor than the particular case . We know by itself the general proposition to be true , on the ground of universal belief ; we know by itself the particular proposition to be true , on the ground of our own direct observation ; we bring them together , and in this view the mind predicates of the subject of the conclusion , what it could not assert with an equal degree of evidence , without the general principle . Thus , for example , we admit the legal principle , that the testimony of a witness in his own behalf is not to he received ; we know directly that the testimony of a particular witness , ma given case , isof this kind , and we acquiesce more readily in its rejection , because we can bring it under this generally received maxim . But to all this Mr. Mill is ready with a reply . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have deduced the general propositions from the particular instances . The conclusion of the syllogism is not an inference drawn from the general proposition , but according to it . The major premise is a record of previous deductions from particular cases ; and the rules of the syllogism enable us to read the record correctly , " ( 1.259 . ) But how are these general propositions , these major premises , gained , so far forth as they are inferences , except by the intellectual process of reference - going from the less to the more general , until at last you arrive at a pure intuition ? Has not Mr. Mill admitted that unless the proposition asserting the uniformity of nature were true , all other inductions would be fallacious ? And , therefore , must not every one of these major premises be conclusions of a syllogism , the major premise of which is a proposition asserting the uniformity of nature ? And , by Mr. Mill 's own showing , are we not more certain o* ' the conclusions by connecting them with the major premise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature itself to be the conclusion of a syllogism . But take his own illustration . Lie says , ( 1 . 250 , ) " the proposition that the Duke of Wellington is mortal , ' is not concluded from the proposition , All men are mortal ; ' the inference is finished when we have asserted that all men are mortal from the observation of particular cases of mortality . " But in the first place , we deny that the general proposition could be drawn either without some primary assumption as to the course of nature , or an assertion of intuition as to causal uniformity ; and in the next place , we claim that mortality is predicated of the Duke of Wellington with greater evidence than it could be , by deducing it from the mortality of a less number than the whole race . " If , from our experience of John , Thomas , &amp;c. we are entitled to conclude that all human beings are mortal , we might surely without any logical inconse // quence , have concluded at once from these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means , unless on the assumption of the whole race being so . Besides , we think the supposition , upon which the denial of the power of proof to the Syllogism is founded , does not give the actual state of the case . It is , that the same man proceeds from the individual cases to the general proposition , and then turns round and deduces from the general proposition the same individual cases . Now , not to say that he might be supposed sometimes to deduce other not known cases , we claim that the actual facts are far different-that men do not prove for themselves hut a small portion of the general truths which they holdthat these truths come to them with the sanction of past ages and universal consent , and that as a matter of fact , the reference of particular - cases to these general truths does in the mind of every one give them new evidence . There is one case to which we acknowledge this explanation will not fully apply ; we mean the case in which the major premise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure mathematics . But upon this point we can only give an opinion . It may pass for whatever it is worth . We hold , then , that there are intuitive truths , not formed from sensations , but purely intellectual ; that , though these truths are first asserted by the mind by occasion of sensible experience , they can , after they have made themselves known , be directly contemplated ; that there are individual existences both intellectual and material , which are particular instances of realities correspondent to the intuitions ; that the state of mind with which we know the intuition is different from that with which we know the individual instances , and is invested by us with more authority ; so that it is natural for us-we are so made  --  to refer the individual , real existence to the idea for the satisfaction of our minds . The formula of reference is the Syllogism . But it is time to escape from this field of once violent controversy . We seem to see the Venerable Crackenthorpus , Doctor of Theology , belaboring Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majestic energy of the Latin language , ( " pessime omnium , imo ineptissime , Momus insolentissimus , vere talpa , " ) and finally illustrating the topic of bland* with a formal vituperation of his victim , sending him to the infernals for his abuse of Aristotle not without a miserable pun about the worthless branch , ( de ramo ) -  --  and we hasten to return to the subject of Induction . We have already given our own views as to the principle upon which the inference in induction is founded ,  --  that it rests upon intuitions or pure ideas of the mind . We have dwelt at length upon this question , and we acknowledge that it is the result to which we have come that has given to the inquiry its chief interest . We see that sense , even in the world of sense , is not competent to answer all the questions that must be answered . We see that the very conclusions we draw about material things imply the necessity , and develop the reality of pure ideas . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of principles ( **25;89;TOOLONG ) as the starting points in science and opinion , he could not very well evade the question , how do we come by these principles . He fluctuates in his doctrines upon the subject . But one thing he saw clearly , that they could not be derived from sense alone . Let us compare this ancient philosopher with the modern , remembering that Aristotle regards the universal as containing the cause . In the opening chapter of the Metaphysics , he says , " The knowledge of individual things is by sense , but sensations do not // pronounce of any thing why it is , but only that it is . " Again , " It is not possible to have science by sense , for it is necessary to have the sensation of a particular thing , at a definite place and time . But the universal and that which is in all , it is not possible to perceive by sense : for , it is not an individual nor in time ; since we say that the universal is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal , but universals can not be known by sense , it is not possible to have science by sense . It is manifest if we should see by sense any individual triangle to have the angles equal to two right angles , we should still need a demonstration ; and we should not , as some say , have a scientific knowledge , for it is necessary to perceive the individual by sense , but science is in knowing the universal . " ( An . Post . L 31 . ) But this is sufficient upon the point of the distinction between sense and science . Again , Aristotle holds that Universals , though different from individual things , are formed from them , and he has a formula for the process which he calls the syllogism of Induction . But he expressly states that it is necessary to understand that what is true of one individual is true of all , for Induction is of all the particulars . ( An . Post . 2. 23 . ) Aristotle evidently saw that in order to authorize the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major premise asserting the uniformity of nature . But what it is that enables us to make this assumption-how we get from the known individuals to a universal including individuals which are not known , are questions upon which his opinions seem to fluctuate . He sometimes apparently attributes it to an inventive power in the soul to search out and find universal truths . Thus , he says , " if being above the moon , we should see the earth opposite , we should not 9 know the cause of the eclipse , for we only see that it is now eclipsed , not absolutely why , for sense does not give a knowledge of universals , but from seeing this frequently happen , hunting the universal , we should have a demonstration , for from many individuals the universal is manifest . " ( An . Post . 2. 31 . ) Again , he seems to attribute it to ideas in the mind , thus approaching the doctrine of Plato . But before translating the passage , we would explain that Aristotle held that sensation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continuance of the motion , after the sensible object is removed , is a phantasm , or as we might say a conception , while memory is such a state of the phantasms as makes them memorials of the sensible objects . The sensations were viewed by the ancient philosophers generally as being in a perpetual flow , while those which remained as conceptions and memorials , and from which experience and thence universals arose , were regardcd as standing , stopping , remaining at rest , in the soul . Aristotle says , " intellection is more like a certain rest and standing than motion . " ( DeAn . 1 . 13 . ) Hence arises the etymology of the word in Greek **25;116;TOOLONG we give from an author quoted by Harris in the hermes . " Science is so called from its leading to a 5top-*7 ( tUTCcUtl '  --  and boundary of things , taking us away from the boundlessness of particulars and from change , to universals , for science is conversant about universals and what is unchangable . " We now proceed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent memory of the same sort of things , experience , and from experience , or from some universal at rest in the soul , the one beside the many which in all is one and the same , is the first principle , the immediate primary proposition of science and art . " Ai* . Post . 2. 19. // Again , he is contented with stating the fact . The congruity of the following statement as to the manner in which general terms are formed , with the modern doctrine will be obvious . " When some one individual of things not unlike stands , or stops , ( ur*vTo ; ) there is first in the soul a universal-for though an individual is perceived , the sense is of a universal , as of a man and not of Callias . In these , or this kind of universals , ( that is , those of a less general kind , ) there is a restinglJTaTat-until there stands the universal more general , as this particular sort of animals , until there is in the soul the universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till another more general is in the soul , and soon . Whence it is manifest that it is necessary for us to acquire a knowledge of first principles by induction , because sense in this way brings in the universal ; " or as he says in another place , " the soul is such a thing as to be able to be in this state . " Though expressed in the language of a theory , it is obvious that this explanation of the formation of universal propositions is a mere statement of fact . Sense brings individual things into the soul , and , they remaining , there is in the soul a universal . We will quote no farther . We acknowledge this is not altogether satisfactory . We admit that while he broadly distinguis*ies between the individual things and universal terms and propositions , while he clearly states that sensations though furnishing the materials of universals are very different from them , he does not grasp with firmness the office of the intellect in producing them . He cautiously adheres to realities but does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which furnishes primary truths . He lays it down without hesitation that we proceed from particulars to universals , but the difficult point is , as Ritter says , " how cut of the lower knowledge of sense , the higher scientific knowledge is formed . " We perhaps need to apologize to our readers for these frequent references to Aristotle , but to omit Aristotle in speaking of logic seemed to us like leaving Hamlet out of the play . We will now proceed with our own train of thought . The inductive process is two fold , the examination of the individual cases and the inference . We have thus far dwelt at length upon the ground of the inference , more , however , from th' bearing of the question upon philosophy in general , than from its own intrinsic importance . For that the mind draws its conclusions which rest upon the uniformity of nature with unwaving confidencethat the fundamental principle of the inference in induction is universally received , are facts which , without being explained , are sufficient for all the purposes of the inductive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be explained right ly . The inference , too , after the premises are obtained , is a very simple matter . It would be the simplest form of the syllogism , having always the same major premise - that the course of nature is uniform . Hence induction-as Dr. Whately uses the term , that is , the inductive inference , properly makes but an insignificant figure in the school logic . But induction , in the sense of Mr. Mill , that is  --  the examination of the facts and the determination of the condition under which an inference may be drawn - is the most important and the most difficult of any investigation . We will , then , turn our attention now to this part of induction . Individual things arid facts in nature furnish the subject matter of the inductive investigation . The results of the investigation are general propositions . The science which lays down the methods by which the investigation is to be conducted // so as to secure certainty in the resuiting proposition-is induction as Mr. Mill uses the term , and as we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the school logic , has decided incautiously as we think , against its belonging " to any one distinct science . " We are not prepared to say indeed , that the contrary has been proved ; we have ourselves strong doubts ; but we think that the attempt to establish a uniform and general system of principles for conducting the process of deducing general propositions from individual facts and on all subjects , ought not to be given up . With respect to investigations in the material world relating to causal uniformity , we are of opinion that Mr. Mill has proved by actual experience that there are methods common to all subjects . And it is with reference to this part of the work alone , that we have called his treatise the best systematic work on the inductive Logic in the language . Facts ,  --  What is to be found out about them ,  --  and the Ways of doing it-are the three subjects of inquiry in Induction . We ask , first , what is a fact ? or an individual existence ? - What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enumeration of all the kinds of things which are capable of being made predicates or of having anything predicated of them . " We shall merely quote from our author his summary , ( 1 . 100 , ) but somewhat condensed . " Our enumeration commenced with feelings . These we scrupulously distinguished from the objects which excite them and from the organs by which they are or may be supposed to be conveyed . Feelings are of four sorts ; sensations , thoughts , emotions and volitions . What are called perceptions are merely a particular case of belief , and belief is a kind of thought ; actions are mere*y volitions followed by an effect . " After feelings we proceeded to substances . These are bodies or minds . All we can know of matter is the sensations which it gives us , and the order of occurrence of those sensations ; and so of the mind , all we know is the states of consciousness . " " The only remaining class is attributes ; and these are of three kinds ; quality , relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sensations or other states of consciousness which they excite . Relations , except the simple cases of likeness and unlikeness , succession and simultaneity , are similarly founded upon some fact or phenomenon , that is , upon some series of sensations or states of consciousness more or less complicated . Quantity is , also , manifestly founded upon something in our sensations or states of feelings , since there is an indubitable difference in the sensations excited by a larger and smaller bulk , or by a greater or less degree of intensity in any object of sense or of consciousness . All attributes therefore are nothing but either our sensations and other states of feeling , or something inextricably involved therein . " " We thus have , 1st , feelings or states of consciousness ; 2d , the minds which experience thosefeelings ; 3d , the bodies or external objects which excite certain of those feelings , together with the powers or properties whereby they excite them ; 4th , the successions and co*xistences , the likenesses and unlikenesses between feelings or states of consciousness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone are the subject matter of induction . XVe come now to inquire , what does induction propose to find out about these slates of mind . Whatever it does find out about them , may be stated in propositions . If then we can discover and classify the kinds of assertions made in the propositions-we shall see what we // are to establish about these states of mind . Mr. Mill has entered carefully into the analysis ; and according to him , every proposition asserts either1 , the mere existence of a state or states of mind , or 2 , that one follows another , or 3 , coexists with it , or 4 , is the cause of it , or 5 , is like it . " Existence , co6xistence , sequence , causation , resemblance , one or the other of these is asserted or denied in every proposition without exception . This five-fold division is an exhaustive classification of matters of fact ; of all things that can be believed or tendered for belief ; of all questions that can be propoundned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The remaining topic relates to the ma*ner in which it is proved of any states of mind , that they stand in some one of the above relations to each other . It is impossible to follow the author here , without occupying too much room . He lays down four methods , which he calls the Method of Agreement , the Method of Difference , the Method of Residues , and the Method of Concomitant Variations . Such is the plan , in outline , of the foundation which the author has laid down to build upon . But the superstructure does not cover the whole foundation . The author confines the application of his methods almost entirely to the single class of causal propositions . He has very little to say of his other four classes . And in regard to the proof of causation , it is only within the province of physical investigations , that he gives us entire satisfaction . But here we accord to him great merit , for reducing to a systematic form the canons of investigation , which have been adopted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the author as to the doctrine of cause and ef fect ; yet we will concede that his view , namely , that cause and effect are merely invariable , unconditional antecedence and consequence , is correct as far as it goes , and that this incomplete notion may be adequate to all the purposes of merely physical inquiries . A complete view is important in its bearings upon other inquiries . With this exception , including our dissent from the theoretical views already examined , together with such other difference of opinion as would be allowed on all subjects , we do not hesitate to pronounce that portion of the i'rcatise contained in Book III , Chapters 1 to 23 inclusive , to be a most valuable addition to the Baconian Logic . And this is the portion of the Treatise which is peculiar to the author . We know nothing on the subject to be compared with it as a system . It was also much needed . For while the deduction of general laws of nature from individual facts had been carried forward with satisfactory results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from facts , as it is sometimes most fallaciously called , has been applied without discrimination . Mr. Mill 's canons , strictly followed , would sweep away the whole tribe of pretended sciences , Phrenology , Animal Magnetism , several recent medical theories , and almost every other scientific hobby rode by itinerant lecturers . They would show that what are called common sense observers are often the worst reasoners . They would show that truly to eliminate a law of nature , requires the most comprehensive survey of facts , the clearest insight and the most far-reaching comparison and subtlest discrimination of resemblance and difference . In dwelling upon this portion of the work , we do not mean to withhold praise from other portions . We think Book V , on Fallacies , well drawn up , and so of some other parts ; but this merit Mr. Mill has in common // with others . But here our praise must stop . We think the chapter on the nature of mathematical reasoning , as unsatisfactory as it is possible for any thing to be , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we think much better of what he has to say of the logic of the Moral Sciences ; not that it is impossible to deduce some general laws from particular facts in the moral sciences , and that canons of investigation are therefore impossible here ; not that the author does not state many important truths  --  but the views are very defective . We have seen that Mr. Mill 's philoso*hy is not sufficient to carry him safely through all the inquiries which may be raised in material things , for its want of the recognition of purely intuitive truths ; much more is this insufficiency felt , in a subject where the pure intuitions are both more numerous and more important . And it is his general philosophy which has made this portion of the work so defective . We said at the outset of our remarks , that we had no sympathy with his philosophy , which limits our knowledge to states of mind merely . But we enter not upon that controversy here . Indeed we think that every reader of the work must feel that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We shall , moreover , give the opposing , and what we regard as the true , doctrine , in our remarks upon Mr. Tappan 's work . In conclusion we would say , that Mr. Mill every where evinces a truly philosophical spirit , and that his work is written with great perspicuity , and if not with the condensed energy of Whately , with far greater elegance . " All which we are aware of , even in our own minds , " says Mr. Mill , " is a certain thread of consciousness ; a series of feelings , that is , of sensations , thoughts , emotions and volitions , more or less numerous and complicated . " We never meet with an expression of this kind , without a strong desire to ask what is that We , who ( or which ) knows so little . An answer to our inquiry would show , we are satisfied , that there is a fundamental error concealed under such an assertion . There must be at least some one thing which we know , without our asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we know with immediate certainty , but in order to attain to the knowledge , it is necessary for us to have some preparatory explanation . In regard to the first , philosophy has performed its office , when it has laid down the point this side of which we become inquisitive . In regard to the latter , its office is , starting from the first , to lead the inquirer into a position where he can si*ie , but not to see for him . Now we contend , it is not the thought , but the 1 think , which is the starting point in philosophy . We do not separate the I from the Thinking . We do not raise a question here ; it is this side of our existence as thinking beings that we ask questions ; and philosophy begins its office of explanation , where we begin to inquire . It is precisely here ,  --  in that they begin with the Thought , and not with the integral , I Think ,  --  that Reid and Stewart and Brown , seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , if not rather in doctrine . Mr. Stewart says , " We are not immediately conscious of the existence of mind , but we are conscious of sensation , thought and volition ; operations which imply the existence of something which feels , thinks and wills . " ri*hus we begin with the act of mind , along with which but distinct from it , is an act of consciousness , assuring us of our own act , and this information which is given to us , implies that we are . But in the act , we do not separate Ourselves from our Thinking , nor , though we may do it for other purposes , yet , in respect to the certainty of knowledge , do we look at them apart . Or , if we should do it , do we not know the // I with as much certainty as we are conscious of its acts ? These philosophers do , indeed , hold to the existence of mind ; what we complain of is , that their language seems to attribute certainty to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our own existence . We confine our assertion to the mere existence of ourself  --  and we claim that it is not imptied , nor known , as Mr. Stewart says in another place , " through the operations of sensation , thought and volition . " We know we are  --  and that is the whole of it . We begin our philosophy , then , not with an assumption , not with taking any thing for granted , but with knowledge , and that knowledge is , I Think ,  --  I Am . We do not , with Des Cartes , infer lAni from 1 Think . If one can understandingly say , I Think , he has in so doing asserted , I Am . The first exercise of thought , is only the occasion on which we know our own existence , not the premise from which we infer it . Nor do we , with Reid and Stewart , insert an act between the agent and the thought . There is no necessity for it . If we might suppose a case - of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus not forced to reflect upon its own acts , would the question ever arise , do I act ? We hold not . When you have a mind , thinking , feeling , acting , so to speak , within itself-you have the whole . The mind in thinking-and while thus engaged , never asks , Am I thinking . P he question is not one that would ever he started . But are we asked-how do you know you know you are thinking ? We reply , there is no how in the case-there is nothing to explain - you have got to the point where there is nothing between the agent and the act , and where , of course , the question of explanation ceases . You might as well ask , with respect to the original act of creation-how does God create ? You have infi nite power , immediately acting , with nothing intervening between the power and the act , and there is nothing to be explained . Besides , the assumption of the necessity of an act , to prove to me that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act without such proof , leads to the absurdity of an infinite series of acts , each of which requires a previous act to prove it . We do not , then , admit there is a distinct act of consciousness , proving or asserting to each individual mind , that it acts while it acts . There is no need of an interposed act , giving notice to myself of what I am doing . But yet , consciousness has a meaning . To deny that the mind puts forth a distinct act , giving notice to itself that it is now thinking , is not to deny that the mind knows its own acts . The mind is such a thing that it identifies- ( to use an expression , inadequate indeed , but nearer to the thing than any other )  --  the thought and the knowledge of it . If we are asked , how a mind can know without a distinct act , we reply , that there is no explanation to be demanded of an ultimate fact , and that in this case , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such is the nature of a knowing agent . Consciousness , then , we hold to be knowledge , not merely along with , but as it were one with the acts of the mind . We acknowledge this language may fail to set forth our doctrine , but so must language often fail , unless the reader will reproduce the thought in his own mind . We agree with Brown in rejecting consciousness as a distinct faculty , putting forth its own appropriate acts , but we dissent from the opinion that consciousness " is only a general term for all our feelings , sensations , thoughts , desires . " We think , moreover , that it can be explained how consciousness came to be considered as a distinct faculty , exercising distinct acts . We will suppose that the current of thought // is checked-that while thinking , I am interrupted , and in such a way , that I think of myself and my acts . Then myself and my acts become the object of my present thought . J-Iere is a distinct act  --  but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I see the paper on which I am writing , but if , for any reason , I raise the question whether I have the sensation of sight , the sensation itself becomes an object of my present activity  --  a thing to be looked atof which act of looking itself I am conscious . There is a continual play of the mind between thinking , and thinking of the fact that we are thinking ; and these transient and repeated acts of giving objectivity to states of the mind , are confounded with consciousness ; and hence consciousness comes itself to be considered as an act . Again , we will suppose the case of mind not merely acting within itself , but making itself and its acts known to others . In this process are involved three steps . Let us look at them carefully . First , I think , and in the act know it-am conscious . Secondly , I think of myself and my acts , but this is an act of thought , not of consciousness -I am only conscious that I am thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think , but the affirmation is an act of thought , not of consciousness-I am only conscious that I make it . Now these acts of contemplation and affirmation are often confounded with consciousness , and hence consciousness comes to be regarded as an act . But consciousness , we claim , is not an act , but is involved in I Thinic , and is one with it and co*%xtensive with it . We have dwelt the longer upon this point , because we are obliged to differ from Mr. Tappan in respect to the doctrine of Consciousness . lie says , " Sensations , emotions , &amp;c. are the immediate objects of consciousness . " " Indeed my own being as a substance endowed with faculties of feeling , knowing and willing , is not immediately presented to my consciousness ; I am conscious only of certain phenomena , and of acts of judgment connecting the phenomena with external objects and internal faculties . " But we deny the validity of the analysis which separates the I from the act , for the purpose of placing them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself , whether his conviction as to the certainty of his own existence is not the very same as his conviction of the reality of his thoughts . Mr. Tappan says , " We know them ( states of mind , which are the only objects of consciousness ) in their going on , and we know ourselves as the subjects of them . " But if we know the acts , and if we know ourselves as the subjects of them , is there any difference in kind or degree as to this knowledge ? If consciousness can say , " I know I think , " it can also say and must say , " I know there is an I which thinks . " If it should be said , the usage of language limits the term , we reply that usage can not nullify the fact that we have the same knowledge of the I in " I Think " as we have of the thought . Our disagreement with Mr. Tappan upon this point , involves another . He says , " The subjective simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the objective general , ( that is , the not I , ) attempts also to reach itself . This it can do only by making itself an object to itself . Hence arises a new and unique form of knowledge , through the power of reflection or self-consciousness ; and thus we have the problem  --  to determine the faculties and laws of the simple subjective . " But we deny that any one ever attempts to prove to himself or others that he is . We deny that the knowledge of self-existence necessarily comes from thinking of one 's selfit // is involved in the exercise of our being , whatever that may be . And more than all , we deny that this knowledge is gained through reflection or self-consciousness . According to Mr. Tappan 's own doctrine , we do not know self immediately through consciousness ; if then we know self through consciousness at all , it must be by inference . But we deny that we know our own existence , as Des Cartes supposed , by an inference from our acts . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculties and a determination of their laws , which may constitute a portion of philosophy , but we protest against making our own existence , a philosophical problem . Indeed generally speaking , we think the neglect to distinguish between what we know immediately and without question , from what we know medially by proof-or , if the distinction is made , the neglect to carry it rigidly through all our knowledge , is the occasion of great confusion in philosophy . We begin our philosophy with knowledge , immediate and unquestioned , and that is " I Think , I Am . " If we are asked for proof , we make but one reply-we know it-we are satisfied for ourselves-we are willing to run our own risk on that point ; and we would respectfully propose , that each one should do the same , asking no questions-leaving to others to believe or not as they please . The FIRST question in philosophy is-as it seems to usdo we know anything else ? But before coming to this , we make a remark upon two distinctions-the Phenomenal and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Phenomenal includes all acts and states of mindthe Metaphenomenal all objects besides . We do not object to the distinction , though we have not ourselves found it of much use ; but when Mr. Tappan says , the reality uf the Metaphenornenal has been denied , and then proceeds to discuss it , we must repeat that we doubt whether the reality of one 's own existence is ever made a question . Indeed he himself confines his remarks to the question of the reality of matter . The Subjective and Objective can be easily explained . While thinking of myself and my acts , I can make a distinction between I Myself as now thinking , and Myself as thought of . The former I may call the subject which acts , and the latter the object about which the action is . Now every other being who can appropriate that personality , viewed as acting , is Subject-  --  and viewed as the thing about which the action is , is Object . We think this distinction very convenient , but we must not omit to distinguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts , are unquestioned realities , not within the problems of philosophy . We come now to our first question in philosophy . In order to state it , we will take for granted , first , that there are other subjects besides I Myself , which may become objects of thought ; and secondly , that there are other things , which though not subjects , may be objects of thought . In accordance with the view already given , we raise no question about the reality of our own existence and thoughts ; nor when we think of other personalities , and objects not personalities , do we doubt as to the reality of our thinking about them ; but the question is , is that true which we think ? We do not doubt the fact of our asserting that there are other minds-that there is a material world  --  but whether the assertions are true . We do not question but that we make the propositions , but are the propositions true ? Can we get out from our own minds to other existences to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our reader , every man for himself . There are some things we might do for you ; we might carry you , if you could not walk ; but in the matter of knowing , // we can only assist . We can place you in the right position to see ; nay , we will lend you our glasses , if they may suit you , but you must do the seeing for yourself . Let us place you right . Put your hand on that table . You do not doubt the table is there ; but perhaps it is not . But you know it ? We sometimes know less than we think for . Does your hand know that it touches the table ? To be sure not , but I feel a change of condition in my hand . That is to say , you feel , you have the sensation . If you say that , ycu of course do not question it , nor do we disbelieve you . But suppose you yourself should have the power to produce within yourself such sensations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you-where then is the table ? None of your suppositions . I know not only that I think , but that I think of other objects than myself . I know other personalities like myseif ; I know other objects unlike myself . I am such a being that I can and do know other things than myself . At any rate I will run my risk upon it , and leave others to do as they please . Now we claim that no philosopher-be he commonsense or transcendental-can do more than assert the existence of matter or other minds . Dr. Reid did a great service in removing those fictions which had been interposed between the mind and the immediate intuition of things out of itself , though perhaps he did not always express himself with sufficient precision . We agree with Mr. Mill , that this belief ( of Body ) is intuitive- " as intuitive as our knowledge of our sensations themselves , is inttiitive , " ( 1 . 78 . ) We think , however , there is confirmatory proof as to the existence of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or at least we are or ought to be more ready to receive the fact . We would now distinguish Intuition from Consciousness . We know ourselves and our acts by Consciousness-we know things out of ourselves immediately , by Intuition ; at least we would prefer to distinguish these things , and to mark them by distinct names . We must here suspend the train of our thoughts , to defend the common-sense philosophy from the contempt of the transcendentalist . Mr. Tappan says , " there is a class of philosophers , and Reid may be placed at their head , who endeavor to dissipate the dogmas of both idealism and materialism , by the stern voice of common sense . Every man believes in the metaphenomenal ; in objective reality and truth : therefore , it exists for every man . Here common sense pauses , but the philosophic iml ) ulse still urges to the enquiry , is there not reality in opposition to idealism and materialism ? Is there not reality independent of a mere subjective persuasion ? Shall the united efforts of the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both occupying absurd positions ; the one affirming , I prove although I do not believe ; ' and the other , I believe though I can not prove ? ' May we not prove and believe , and believe and prove ? " But common sense pauses only where every other philosophy must pause-at the assertion of objective reality . The expression , Common Sense may not be well chosen , but fairly interpreted , it embraces , as we think , two things , an intuition , and an inference or proof from the universality of the intuition . Now it is only the latter which can properly be called a belief or persuasion , while the former is equivalent in this matter to the Reason of transcendentalism . It is that in us which affirms immediately objective truth . Moreover we can see no absurdity in the expression , " I believe though Jean not prove " - for it only means I know immediately and therefore need no proof . But to return . Consciousness gives the subjective , and intuition the // objective realities , and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the whole subject matter of philosophy . Mr. Tappan has gone over the entire field , though of course in so small a work , with great rapidity . We do not propose to follow him , for it would be impossible to discuss the various subjects-we shall only explain certain distinctions of the Transcendental philosophy , which he has employed , namely , Reason and Sense , Sensualism and Transcendentalism , Ideas and Laws . We know ourselves and our own acts . We know things out of and besides ourselves . We know that there is a difference between these objective realities . We find that of these objects , some are like ourselves and others unlike , having nothing in common . We recognize and affirm an essential difference , and we distinguish these two great classes , by distinctive names , Mind and Matter . Now these acts of ourselves , the objects of which are matter and its changes , are sensation , and the power by which we affirm the reality of their objects , is Sense . That power by which we affirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of which is purely spiritual , may be called Reason , while there is no distinct name in common use for the acts themselves of this power . We remark upon this statement , first , that the acts of the mind - whether they have for their objects mind or matter-are , in each case , upon the same footing as to certainty . We are absolutely certain as to both . Again , we know both classes of objective realities in the same way -- by intuition . We are no more certain of the objective reality of matter and its phenomena than we are of mind and the truths relating to it . If we know the one , we know the other , and both in the same way . It is obvious that if we make a distinction between reason and sense , it can not be that one af firms what is true with more certainty than the other . The distinction is a matter of classification , the mind affirming the existence ofdifferent classes of things . There may be convenience in the distinction , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance has been attached to it . We think the chief advantage of attributing to the mind a two-fold power of intuition on the ground of its asserting truths about two distinct classes of things , is , that it tends to counteract the prejudice that we are more certain of truths relating to matter than of those relating to mind . Mr. Tappan appears to use the word reason as synonyrnous with mind , for , in speaking of the functions of the reason , he enumerates " intuition , sensuous perception , abstraction and generalization , judgment , invention , mediate perception , induction , memory , recollection and imagination . " We do not see any advantage which this use of the term has over the common one of mind . In accordance with the views already given , we may define the philosophy of sense , to be a systematic view of that knowledge , the subject matter of which is gained by sense . As a portion of universal philosophy , no one can doubt its reality -- it is only when it claims to be the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its claims . It is true as a portion , but false viewed as the whole of philosophy . Transcendentalism is primarily , a systematic view of purely spiritual truths , or , according to the above distinction , of truths asserted by reason ; lut secondarily , through its ideas and laws , it embraces the philosophy of sense . Finally , and also in accordance with the views already given , we may state the distinction between ideas and laws . We know not only that there are objective realities and that there is a difference in kind among them , but we know , moreover , // that mind is the original , creative power-we know that it possesses principles-  --  and that the isolated facts both of matter and mind are in accordance with these universal principles . Shall we call the principles Ideas , and the uniformities of the accordant facts , Laws ? We have not scrupled to employ the terms of the transcendental philosophy as we find them in Mr. Tappan 's work , because we think they express realities . But we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , we are not aware of having departed materially from the commonly recognized doctrines of the English philosophy . We suppose it would be generally held that there is a distinction between mind and matterthat we have immediate knowledge , and that there are purely spiritual in distinction from material truths . Perhaps , however , the *English school has made it too much the business of philosophy merely to trace out the origin of the idea instead of contemplating the idea itself , and in doing this has sometimes confounded the sensible experience which is the occasion of the first assertion of the spiritual truth with the truth itself -- thus making it merely material . In this point of view it may be that the attention which has been given to German philosophy will turn out to be of important use to English philosophy , by giving to purely spiritual truths , or the intuitions of the reason , the prominence which is due to them . It is obvious that the system of transcendental philosophy , since the subject matter of it is intuitions , must consist in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propose to go into this subject . Mr. Tappan has given the best systematic account of ideas which we have seen in our language . Mr. Tappan divides his work into four parts . The first contains an introductory view of philosophy in VOL LV. 61 general ; the second , a preliminary view of the reason ; the third , logic proper ; and the fourth , the doctrine of evidence . the part treating of logic proper , is divided into three books , the first containing primordial logic ; the second , inductive logic , and the third , deductive logic . XVe question the propriety of giving so great an extension to the term logic ; but we have not time to discuss the point . We shall speak principally of the book on primordial logic . We think that this portion of the treatise is of great value , so much so that we wish the author had confined himself to this important department . In order to give our readers a clear view of this subject , we remark , that according to Mr. Tappan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or functions , and causes or forces ; and secondly , laws , or that which determines and regulates the manifestations and movements of the first . The first part he calls metaphysics , and the second nomology . Primordial logic treats of the evolution of metaphysical and nomological ideas . Under the former the author treats of subjective and objective exteriority ; of time and space ; of the infinite and finite ; of quantity ; of quality ; of relation ; of modality ; and under the latter , of law ; of matter and spirit ; of perfection ; of right and wrong ; of freedom and responsibility ; of personal identity ; of immortality ; of the beautiful and the like . These are all important subjects , and the author has given additional interest to them by the attempt to prove that the ideas expressed by these terms can not be gained from mere sensations -- that they are pure ideas . We may not agree with all he advances , but we do not hesitate to commend without reserve this portion of his work . The book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it can not take the place of // Mill 's more elaborate work . Deductive logic is ingeniously treated , but we think , at least for purposes of instruction , we must prefer the treatise of Whately . Indeed , deductive logic is so much of a pure science , that we do riot anticipate much improvement in the mode of treating it . We notice one slight oversight. * We would say in conclusion , that although we disagree with Mr. Tappan on several subjects , both in this work and in his other works , still we regard his productions as valuable contributions to our philosophical literature . We hope to meet with him again in the same field ; and it is because we have such an expectation , that we venture , though with some reluctance , to make a few remarks upon the style of his writings . We are disposed to demand of the philosophical writer , an approximation to mathematical precision of language . We like to see the thought firmly grasped , and the fir word deliberately chosen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of all the books ever * In illustrating the application of the rules of the syllogistic logic to one of the demonstrations in Euclid , the author has the following syllogism . All sIte , natc angles are equal , hut the angles BCD and EBC are alternate angles , and are , therefore , equal . Lie calls this a syltogism in Darii  --  but the minor premise being a singular proposition , is a universal , and the syllogism is in Barhara. itit were not so , the next syllogism DCI ) is equal to ACD - EBC is equal to BCD , and therefore EBC is equal to ACD , would he in an unlawful mood , ItI . We think , besides , that the proposition EBC is equal to BCD is not the same as the l ) ropositiou EBC is BCD , so that there would be four terms in the syllogism . These of course are mere oversights . It is a little remarkable that Mr. Mill has made a far worse mistake , in the same way . For , in attempting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Euclid , he has been guilty of that most disgraceful of Logical Fallacies , the Petitio Principii ; as any mathematician may see , who will turn to it . written , the most perspicuous , and , by the attentive student , the easiest to be understood , is , as we think , Butler 's Analogy ; and this excellence is attributable in great part , to precision of language . In studying Mr. Tappan 's work carefully as we have done , we have found a great deficiency in this respect . We have not room to prove this ; but we refer to two examples , as specimens . The author speaks " of sensations , perceptions , &amp;c. as being immediate knowledge and consciousness . " ( p. 116 . ) Is there any difference ? And again ; " Hence arises a new and unique form of knowledge , through the power of reflection or selJLcon* sciousness. " ( p. 27 . ) Which ? for there is a difference .

Mr. Tappan has very little of it ,  --  we would have him entirely free . " h is a kindly doctrine , and to he heartily received . " ( p. 40 . ) Philosophically speaking , it is to be received , if true ; and , if false , to be rejected . We find some instances of gross carele*sness ; though we know not whether to attribute them to the author or the printer ; for we have rarely seen an important work worse printed , though it is published by the respectable firm of Wiley &amp; Putnam .

We have not made these Yale College . criticisms , for the sake of finding fault ; but because it would have given us a real satisfaction , to see this work written with the precision , elegance and purity , which characterize the Treatises with which we have associated it.
