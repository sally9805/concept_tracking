txt THE bold application of this first principle of agricultural economy to the entire economy of a nation , was first made , if we mistake not , by Carey , in his Treatise entitled , Past , Present , and Future . To illustrate its value and extent of application , a few striking examples may be adduced . The shreds and tatters of worn out garments , of cotton and of linen , laid up by thrifty housewives , and exchanged for tinware and pedlars ' articles , together with such as rags , are picked up in the streets , and amid the fifth of cities , when collected into bales and sold to the manufacturer of paper , have an annual value of about $*5 , OOO , OOO . Five millions of property are thus annually created by the saving up of shreds and tatters , an example of economy which resembles the saving up of litter by a thrifty ajiculturist , who gathers together the manure , weeds , and refuse straw of his farm , and lays it inaheap , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres . Let us suppose that the farmer , instead of an economical saving of this otherwise worthless material , sold off his hay , his milk , and his cattle , to purchase manure for his farm . The result would be that he would find himself gradually impoverished by the process ; and so it would be with this nation , were they to allow the shreds and tatters of their garments to perish unregarded in the earth ; and , in place of converting them into paper , were to purchase that useful and elegant result of industry and economy from other nations , more saving and economical than themselves . By a tariff upon paper and rags , which yields but a very small return to the revenue , five millions of actual , tangible property , has been annually created out of nothing . Let us now suppose that an old and experienced agriculturist , understanding the maxim , that the products of the land , should be consumed upon the l* nd , was about establishing his son , or some person over whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicinity , and observing the unthrifty habits of the young farmer , and especially not.ieing this neglect in him , that he allowed the refuse of his land to waste upon the land ; and instead of converting this into useful compost for the fattening of his acres , laid out the little ready money he possessed , in the purchase of straw and manure from the neighboring farmers . Let us suppose , we say , that the elder and wiser father or guardian should absolutely forbid this proceeding ; or , for every shilling thus foolishly expended by his ward , ' should deduct a six-pence from his income , in order to compel him by mere necessity , into a more judicious application of his means , and a better course of industry ; this procedure of the old man in the treatment of the youiiger and more ignorant person , would resemble very strongly the conduct of a Whig majority , compelling a rout of thriftless free-traders , to allow the national industry to operate for the benefit of the national wealth . The analogy however is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the one side , represents a thrifty old farmer , endeavoring to bring his ward to reason ; and the rout of free-traders on the other side , represents sonic scheming store-keeper or barterer in the village , who finds means to procure large quantities of manure , and wishes to convert it into ready money , at the expense of his inexperienced neighbor . But even then the analogy is not perfect ; and to make it so , we must suppose AOV. // that the young farmer employs laborers upon his farm rather than work himself ; that he prefers the easy life of what is called a gentleman farmer , and that he finds , on calculating the wages of his laborers employed in collecting litter and manure , and making compost , that they seem to cost him as much in making , as he would lay out in purchasing manure . He therefore wishes to dismiss some of his laborers , and turn their wa*es to the purchase of material for the fattening of his land . These laborers , thrown out of employment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to do their own work , with their own hands , and by industry and ingenuity to make the compost which their more luxurious neighbor buys , while he is paying money they are making it , and as he grows poorer , they are growing richer , and undersellin* him in the market . Thus it is with the free-trader ; finding it cheaper to buy the manufactured articles of foreign countries , he allows the refuse and raw material of his own to rot upon the land , or to be sold for unremunerative prices to foreigners : he is perhaps a rich man , and the owner of large estates , a gentleman farmer ; he refuses to allow the necessary protection which gives employment to the poor about him ; they consequently move off upon new lands , and working them with their own hands , are soon able to undersell and to ruin the once wealthy proprietor of the old lands ; and this is the history of agriculture in the Atlantic States . Denied that nec*ssary protection which they required for their industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they moved off into new territories , and established new farms and plantations , from which a deluge of cheap production has been poured down upon the markets of the Atlantic States . Had it not been for a certain modicum of protection , wrested by main force from the rich landholders and proprietarics , the condition of these states would have been truly deplorable ; they would have supported , at this time , a pauper population sparsely inhabiting an ill cultivated and ungrateful soil . Such is indeed the present condition of a very large part of those states . The policy and economy of New England has saved , however , at least herself from degradation . That policy has been to consume the products of the country , within the limits of the country , by a thrifty industry which converts the coarsest and commonest materials , even ice and granite , into a source of wealth  --  a pertinacious industry , which gathers up the shreds and fragments of every art and trade , and converts them into riches-a jealous industry , which refuses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its hands until the last degree of value has been imparted to it by labor-an industry , saving of time ; which brings the anvil near to the spade and pick axe , and the loom near to the plough ; which builds the furnace near the mine , the ford e near the furnace ; which places the factory amid farn*s , in order that the two may cheaply feed and clothe each other . It is this industry which has saved New England from the consequences of a ruined agriculture , the worst consequences that can befal a nation . V. INCREA5E OF NATIONAL WEALTH . THE profits of industry begin with gathering , reaping , mining , fishing , hunting , &amp;c . Previous to the gathering of any product , a certain amount of labor is required to be expended , either in preparing the earth for the reception of seed , or , as in fishin* , in a preparation of nets , tackle , or in mining , by making excavations in the earth . If the products of these first labors serve only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is no profit , but it almost always happens that the labor of one man , applied to one object , will procure more than is necessary for his immediate subsistence and that of his family . The surplus , exchanged for the surplus of other producers , constitutes profit or gain : but // a surplus unexehangeable , lying on the hands of the laborer , is not , in any sense , profit or gain . It is , moreover , necessary that the process of exchange should not be too difficult ; that is to say that there should be a market within reach , or there will be no profit . If the market is remote and uncertain , the surplus will not yield as large and certain a profit , as when the market is near at band and sure ; and thus will rise a second profit , or rather share of profit , to be reaped by a second class of laborers , whose business it is to convey these surpluses from point to point , and to make the means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The business of exchanging and conveying the surpluses of the first class of laborers , constitutes trade and commercecommerce between nations , managed by ship owners , commission merchants , importers and exporters , and secondarily , by railroad com* ? anies , and all other capitalists engaged in facilitating and cheapening the means of inter-communication . Now , as it is evident , that this second class of laborers produce nothing , there must ensue , in order to their support , a division of profit , o* rather of the surplus products , between themselves and the original producers ; and , other things being equal , the original producer is a loser by the exact amount of their gain . The object of the producer will therefore be to become , as far as possible , himself the conveyer of his own surpluses , in order that the entire profit may come to himself and his family . The farmer who sends vegetables to market , sends his son with them instead of any hired person , in order that the profit of transportation may come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people as one family  --  and is it not just and patriotic to think so ? - We very naturally desire that the carriage , the trade and commerce of our surpluses , may fall into the hands of our own friends and fellow citizens , in order that the nation , as one family , may reap both the first and second profits of labor ; the profits of production and the profits of transportation . Prom the mine to the furnace , from the stack and the press house , to the factory , may be a long distance ; it may be half the circuit of the world , and it may be a stone 's throw . If the distance be a short one , the farmer himself becomes the conveyer of his products , and whatever small profit is in that way to be gained , falls into his purse ; but the profit of transportation being in proportion to the distance , th edangers and the difficulties to be overcome on the way , it will be the earnest desire of the miner , the farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory as near to them as possible , in order to save to themselves , the second profits of industry , the profits of transportation ; or of trade and commerce . When the iron is brought to the forge and the rolling mill , and passes through the various processes of steel making , and is then converted into instruments of utility-into ploughs , knives , scythes , &amp;c. , a third profit accrues th facture. , c profit of manu The processes for converting a lump of ore into a scythe or a razor , are very numerous . Let us suppose that for this purpose , a lump of ore , mined in Pennsylvania , is carried to New Jersey , and there converted into cast iron ; that thence it is taken to some foreign country , to England , perhaps , and the cast iron converted into steel ; let the steel , in bars , be taken to Damascus , and there converted into sword blades ; let the sword blades be taken to Marseilles , and sold at wholesale . From Marseilles let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American merchant ; let the American merchant bring the sword blades to New York , where they shall be furnished with scabbards and mounted in a style to please an American fancy ; let them then , or let one of them , be sold by a pedler at an enormous price to the original producer of the lump of ore in Pennsylvania , and let the cunning salesman , a free trader , describe in glowing language to the astonished miner , the numerous transformations , the many and perilous voyages , and the strange countries and strange hands through which his lump of ore had passed before it came to him , a glittering Damascus blade ; what visions of commercial prosperity , and of the glory and enterprise of his nation would float before the imagination of the miner ! with what confidence would he not at the next election , vote for the free trade candidate ! Nov. // The miner , a man of some consequence in his country , is a militia captain of horse guards , and has paid sixty dollars for a sabre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made , were precisely two shillings to himself , and three to the man who carried it to the forge ; a small additional profit was reaped from it by the exporting merchant ; it was conveyed away in a foreign vessel , worth perhaps eight shillings at the moment of its leaving the country ; the remaining fifty nine dollars were fixed upon it by the navigators and the workmen of foreign countries . In that particular instance , although we can not say with perfect truth , that the production of the original lump of ore instead of profiting the miner two shillings actually cost him fifty-nine dollars and six shillings , yet we can say that had the ore been converted into iron , the iron into steel , and the steel into sword blades , by practised artisans working under the direction of the miner himself , the profits of all these processes , would have fallen in very large proportion to himself and his workmen , avoiding too , the costs of transportation of the heavy material , by five long voyages from place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface of the rounded globe . Let us now suppose , farther , that not only the third profit , or of manufacture , the first profit , or of production , and the second profit , or of conveyance , ( trade and commerce , ) but also the profit of agriculture , in the feeding of the workmen engaged in all these processes , and the profit of cloth manufacture , in clothing the same , and the second profit of both of these , and the third of both of these-that all these nine different profits , together concentrated in the exquisitely modelled utensil of steel , made serviceable for the scabbard of the Turk , were together and jointly retained by the industry of a single village in the state of Pennsylvania , and that this too , was wholly a surplus of industry , over and above the labor necessary for the maintainance of the village , would not that community thrive , which , retaining to itself the right of imparting all values to commodities of steel , food and clothing , left nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soil to their very last account , and striking out of their list of expenses the accumulated losses of transportation and commerce , would not that community , concentrating its energies and its intelligence , reap for itself , after a time , a profit fully equivalent , far more than equivalent to the labor expended ? Other things being eqital , such would undoubtedly be the fact : but now what is the condition of that village ? Without capital , they can not build the mills and furnaces : the foreign capitalist has the mills and furnaces already built , and the village must content itself with a single profit , and that a contingent profit , namely , the first profit on the production of food , transported across the ocean to feed the laborers who work in the mills and factories of the foreign capitalist  --  the English capitalist , who has built the furnace near the mine and the coal field ; who has but a little way to send his iron to be converted into steel ; whose brother , perhaps converts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , transports these ploughshares and scythe blades across the water , to be sold there to the first producer of the food ; whose nephew , a wealthy agriculturist , is able , in England itself , to keep down the price of that food , *nd to enhance the value of the scythes and ploughshiares by the skilful management of farms , so that , in times of plenty , that very first profit is reduced to nothing for him who sits in his log-house , on a rough hill-side in Pennsylvania , reading the costly page of the Free Trade Union newspaper  --  the organ of that party which has wrested from him , his neighbors and his children , half the profits of production , all the profits of transportation , all the profits of manufacture , all the profits of mining , all the profits on the supply of coal , all the profis on the supply of cloth , and all the profits of that foreign capital which , vainly seeking investment in England , would flow in upon his village , were he justly protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the factories , which are necessary to enable him , his neighbors and his children after him , to reap all the profits of Industry . // VI . TRADE , COMMERCE , NAVIGATION , AND TRANSPORTATION . UNDER the head of Trade , Commerce , and Transportation is included every species of exchange of products of the surpluses of industry . Trade , as the generic teru* , includes all kind of barter and exchange in lesser as well as in larger transactions commerce , the intercourse of trade between nations , or between states , or between remote parts of the same nation : navigation , the general system of means by rivers , lakes , harbors , and the open seas , of the transportation by water , for the purposes of commerce : transportation , on the other hand , includes every method of conveyance by land and sea . It has been sometimes claimed by political economists that the conveyance of goods from place to place for the purposes of commerce , confers a certain value upon them ; that a loaf of bread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen , than it is at the mouth of the bakery ; but if it were true , that transportation in itself considered conferred value upon articles an indefinite amount of value might be communicated to a loaf of bread by transporting it several times through the city before presenting it at the door of the kitchen . The actual value of a loaf of bread is to be measured by its importance in sustaining life ,  --  by its quantity , quality , and durability , applied to that purpose . It is less valuable as it is more perishable when compared with other kinds of food equally nutritious and less perishable . It has a value as food merely , taken together with all other kinds of sustenance ; and a relative value , as bread , compared with other kinds of food . But the value of a commodity is actually diminished , and not increased by transportation : and the reason is , that the agent employed in transporting it , derives subsistence from it . The baker would sell bread cheaper to his customers if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bread itself , measured by its power of sustaining life , has to be divided between three persons , the baker who produces it , the pur chaser who is to use it , and the carrier who conveys it ; whereas if there were no carrier , the same amount of value , represented by the loaf , would be divided between two persons instead of among three : thus , for example , the baker charges for his loaf twelve cents , two of which are given by him to the carrier for the conveyance of the bread : one half of this loss falls upon himself , the other half upon his customer . The actual value of the loaf including a just profit to himself , is eleven cents , he , however , paying one cent to the carrier , and charging the customer one cent for the same , is a loser to the same amount with his customer . The loss , in this particular instance , is divided between the producer and consumer ; had there been no necessity for carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaf instead of twelve , the customer would have been saved a loss of one cent to the carrier , and the baker would have been saved the loss of on* cent to the maine . The additional one cent , paid as the value of the bread by the customer , is not a value communicated to the bread , but is simply a loss to the consumer , as the other cent is a loss to the producer . In the instance cited , the loss was divided between the consumer and the producer : it sometimes , however , falls wholly upon the consumer , and sometimes wholly on the producer , according to the circumstances and necessities of trade ; if we take however the entire system of commerce , trade , and transpZrtation , both by land and water , it may be said without fear of contradiction that as every man is by turns a producer and consumer , losses by transportation are equally distributed over the entire community . Whatever may be argued in favor of the moral advantages of commerce , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division of loss between producer and consumer , and that all that is saved in transportation , by the improveNov. // ments in navigation , and by canals , turnpikes , and railroads , is a diminution of loss both to producer and consumer . We consider it , therefore , to be a false and mischeivous maxim in political economy , that transportation adds to the value of a product , and that therefore commerce and transportation are in themselves advanta* eons . On the contrary , it is the duty of the economist to look upon them as obstructions of so formidable a character , and involving such an enormous waste of life and energy , as to make their diminution and facilitation the first object of private enterprise and legislative enactment . This object is to be accomplished in two different ways ; 1st , by bringing the furnace and smith-shop as near as possible to the mine ; and the anvil and the loom as near as possible to the plough ; and , 2d , when they are brought as near together as nature and circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheapest , safest , and freest modes of inter-communication . As the object of the political economist is to give the labor of man a right direction ) and to make it yield the greatest possible return , and by no means to stir up an aimless and wasteful commercial activity , he will look upon what are called the interests of commerce and trade with a jealous eye , keeping guard lest the carrier employ himself in the unnatural and unjust enlargement of his function , absorbing more than his due share of the surpluses of industry . Strictly speaking , the most odious and injurious of all monopolies are those which complicate , and render difficult and expensive , the commercial intercourse between cities of the same nation . The loss on the transportation of raw materials to the manufacturer , being far greater than the loss by the transportation of manufactured articles , it is a necessary point of national , as it is of private economy , that the product of the field and the mine should not have to be conveyed over long distances , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be wrought up . It may be safely conjectured , in the absence of exact statistical proof , that the losses and expenses of transportation of the raw material fall , in great part , upon the producers . The producer of cotton depends entirely upon the sale of cotton , not only for the return of his labor and capital invested , but for his surplus or profit . Now as it is a much easier process to extend the production of the raw material , and to overflow the market with a particular agricultural commodity , such as cotton , than it is to overstock the market of the world with manufactures , the cotton planter lies , in a great measure , at the mercy of the mannfacterer . The cotton planter has but one purchaser , namely , the manufacturer ; and that one purchaser , with capital at his disposal , and the whole world for his market , is the absolute master of the planter , especially when the latter by over production , has lost the power of retention , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the market . But this is not the only disadvantage suffered by the planter : the only profit which comes to him is the first profit of production on the raw material , and out of this must be deducted part of the loss by transportation . As freights fall , the price of cotton rises , and at the same time the price of manufactured articles , received in exchange for cotton , is diminished , but not in the same proportion . Equal weights of manufactured and of raw cotton , may pay equal freights , although one be a thousand times more valuable than the other ; and where the manufacturer pays ten cents to have his goods borne across the water , the seller of the raw material will pay a hundred ; for it is just as difficult and as expensive for the navigator to carry a bale of raw cotton , from New York to Liverpool , as to carry an equal weight of manufactured cotton from Liverpool to New York : it is therefore absolutely certain that the disadvantage of a rise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of cotton , is far greater than the simultaneous disadvantage of the same rise to the English manufacturer . If , therefore , it be true that the losses and expenses of transportation affect the producer more than the manufacturer , it is greatly for the interest of the producer to bring the manufacturer as near as possible to himself . Let us take the cotton planters together as a community of interest , and consider the contingencies to which , as a body , they // are subjected by their dependence upon distant manufacturers . The first of these contingencies , is in the liability to failure and stoppage of the manufacturers themselves , occasioning a perpetual fluctuation in the demand for raw material . The second contingency , is that of over production by the planters ; a contingency so well understood and so much feared , as to be a subject of consultation among public conventions of planters . The third contingency , resulting from the dependence of the planters upon one set of manufacturers , is that of sufferin* by extortionate prices ; a circumstance very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contingency , is that of being flooded , through the competition of foreign manufacturers themselves , with an excessive abundance of cheap and worthless manufactures ; those of better quality not being to he had , for any reasonable price . A fifth contingency , is that of being obliged sometimes , if not always , to pay the freightage both of the raw and the mannfactured materials , through the private or legislative management of the foreigner . The sixth contingency , and by no means a remote one , results from the general colonial dependence , into which producers of the raw material , in a remote and half civilized community , depending on the one profit of production for their wealth , and without manufacturing resources , must necessarily fall , producing , at once , a moral , an intellectual and a pecuniary subordination . The seventh contingency , is in the event of war ; an embargo , or a blockade cutting off their sole communication with the more civilized world . The eighth contingency , is in the rivalry of other colonial dependencies producing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually come to pass in retard to the South ; the greatest efforts being now made by England , to make herself and her Asiatic colonies independent of the American cotton growers . The ninth contingency , is from the absence of an armed artisan population in time of war , to maintain a voluntary and efficient defence of the country . The tenth contingency , is in the absence of capital ,  --  thc sinews of war ; - for the accumulation of capital by a colony dependent upon a single foreign market , and producing only one material  --  a material valueless until passed throughimachinery , is a thing unheard of and impossible . The planter extends his plantations , but he does not increase the ratio of his profits ; these , on the contrary , diminish regularly as plantations extend ; nor can that property be considered a safe or a desirable one , which enslaves its owner by a dependence upon so many and so formidable contingencies . We have enumerated the disadvantages which attend the Southern system : equal and even far greater disadvantages , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the system of the Northern free trade economists , which proposes to make the Northern corn-grower , like the Southern planter , dependent on the remote manufacturer . But the reader will not need to have the application of the principles detailed to him , after what has been already said in regard to the South . VII . CURRENCY , BALANCE OF TRADE . Ir the entire currency of the world consisted of gold and silver coin , if its quantity were , on a sudden , increased two-fold , for every ounce of coin a second ounce being called into existence and put in circulation , there would be , as a consequence , a very considerable rise in the price of all purchaseable commodities . The abundance of coin would depreciate the value of coin , and this depreciation would be the same with an apparent rise in the value of purchaseable commodities . The value of the precious metals is given to them by their uses in chemistry , and in the arts . A few only are employed as currency : the others , known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iridium , Platinum and some others , have not 452 Nov. // been employed as currency , with the exception of Platinum , the great demand for which metal in the arts , occasioned such very large supplies of it to be procured from the ores , as to depreciate the value of this metal as specie . The values affixed to the Platinuin coins of Russia , are much above the actual market value of the metal itself . If it should happen at any time , that by the discovery of some new uses for the precious metals , in chemistry and the arts , a very layc quantity of them should be withdrawn from circulation and consumed in manufacture , a proportionate rise would be felt in the value of specie , and a relative depreciation in the value of purchaseable commodities . Thus it appears , that the value of gold and silver depends , other things being equal , on its abundance or scarcity in the market . But there are other causes of variation in the value of gold and silver . For the purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at retail , a certain amount of exchan*eable property in a convenient form is needed , that can be passed readily from hand to hand . The precious metals are preferred for this purpose , and the relative value which they bear to each other is ascertained and stamped upon equal pieces of them by the government . A certain weight of silver represents one hundred pieces of a certain weight of copper . A certain weight of gold represents ten pieces of a certain weieht of silver ; that is to say , so much gold will purchase so much silver or copper , and so much silver will purchase so much gold or copper . The adjustment of the coinage consists chiefly in ascertaining the relative values of the three metals in use , and giving to the coined pieces of each metal , a decimal relationship to those of other metals . If , for example , copper , through great abundance , should fall to half its present value , and it was considered necessary still to make the copper coin represent one hundredth part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of copper , either doubling the size of the present cent , or making it , with its present size , represent a half cent ; and so of the other metals used as specie . But there are still other causes of fluctuation in the value of the metals used for currency . Let us suppose that by an act of all the governments of the states , it was forbidden to use bank notes under the denomination of ten dollars ; it would then follow that the multifarious businesses , which are now carried on by the medium of a paper currency of small notes , would be transacted in coin ; and a much larger quantity of coin would be needed than is at present in use ; the need would increase the value of that coin which happened to be available at the time , and the value of gold , silver and copper coins would have a sensible rise in all parts of the country . Thus we see that the value of metals , used as currency , is given to them by several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arts , and 2 . Their relative abundance or scarcity , as a medium of exchange . Again . Their values fluctuate 1 . Relatively to each other , and 2 . Relatively to purchaseabie commodities . When it becomes necessary , in consequence of a balance of trade against us , to remit large amounts of specie to Europe , the precious metals experience a rise in value , in consequence of the insufficiency of what is left to meet the ordinary necessities of the market . When on the contrary , the balance of trade is in our favor , and foreigners purchase largely of us with specie , the precious metals experience a fall , because there is more than enough for all the purposes of life . When there is a great abundance of the precious metals in this country , and a relative scarcity in . Europe or Asia , they are sent abroad for the purchase of foreign commodities ; because at such times , a dollar will buy more in foreign countries , than it will at liQme ; and thus , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exportation of specie , will make a balance of trade against us , greatly to our advantage ; it is therefore necessary to make due allowance for this circumstance , in judging whether the state of our trade with foreigners is favorable or unfavorable to ourselves . Let us suppose for example , that by the creation of a great number of new banks , a vast quantity of paper currency was thrown out upon the markets , composed of small bills ; and that these // were accepted by the people , instead of gold and silver ; a momentary consequence of this would be a depreciation of gold and silver , and its consequent exportation , and an increase of the appearance of an unfavorable balance of trade . And now let us imagine the failure of all these newly created banks ; their notes becoming valueless ; then , all over the country there would be a rise in the relative value of gold and silver , and a consequent re-importation of the precious metals , and a diminution of the appearance of an unfavorable balance of trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specie to merchandise , in the comparison of exports and imports , can not be taken , other things considered , as a perfect measure of commercial prosperity ; but it is always necessary to ascertain by what other causes in the country itself , and in foreign countries , the value of specie has been affected , before we pronounce favorably or unfavorably for ourselves in regard to the Balance of Trade . VIII . ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY . As it is the object both of the producer and the consumer , to secure for themselves the largest possible share of the surpluses of industry , which , by the intervention of trade and commerce , are greatly diminished , it is equally for their interest to deal justly with eaeh other , without the intervention of brokers , tradesmen , and speculators . This idea has given rise to combinations of artisans , who abandoning the old plan of forcing the master to pay them higher wages , and of persecuting those workmen who would allow themselves to be employed for insufficient wages , have discovered that by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the master workman , and bring themselves in a direct contact with the purchasing public , in other words , with the consumers . If the journeyman artisan can supply the market , without the intervention of a merchant or employer , he saves to himself a portion of that profit which would come to the employer . If the employer makes ten per cent . by selling the labor of his journeyman , that loss is divided between the buyer and the journeyman ; but if the journeyman is able to supply the customer directly , and without the intervention of a third party , the purchaser will obtain the goods at a lower rate , and the journeyman will obtain a higher wage ; and so both parties are the gainers by dispensing with the dealer or master workman . Suppose that a suit of clothes costs twenty-five dollars , five of which go to the profit of the merchant tailor ; a combination of journeymen working and selling in a shop of their own , can divide this profit between themselves and the buyer ; selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reaping two dollars and a half advantage to themselves . If a combination of miners can establish a furnace , smelt their own ores , and sell their own products , they are enabled to divide the profits which would otherwise go to the capitalist , between themselves and the purchasers . If an hundred artisans can combine for the erection of a village of their own , or of a dwelling house in the city large enough to contain them all , they save to themselves all the profits of rent , and are thus enabled to purchase more of the comforts of life , and escape the dangers of ejeetment from inability to pay rent . If several farmers can combine for the cultivation of a single great farm , the same stock and labor can b* employed upon the whole , and with such a saving of time , and such an economical distribution of labor and capital , as to insure a much larger profit , and subject to fewer contingencies and losses . Such is the new principle of the organization of industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed to discover any fallacy in the reasoning which they employ to establish it . Combinations of this kind require to be undertaken with caution , and to be conducted with extreme economy and integri 454 Nov. // depend entirely upon the intelligence , prudence and honesty of those who engage in them , and not upon any inherent difficulty in the system itself . Let us suppose , for example , that a number of farmers agree to establish for themselves a store in their vicinity , which shall also be a place of deposit for the sale of the products of their farms : the manager of the store will require indeed to be supported out of their joint surpluses , and the prices paid by purchasers ; the goods deposited in his care , being no property of his , the temptation to fraud on his part will be infinitely less than if he were , at once , the buyer and seller of all that pass through his hands . As it mi*ht not be advantageous to maintain such a person by a salary , let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the profits ; this per percentage being regulated by an agreement between himself and the parties who employ him . Every farmer in the neighborhood would leave with the person an account of the products which he had to dispose of . This would be a necessary function of the agent in this labor and profit saving scheme , and constitute him a commission merchant , a person whose duties are already thoroughly understood and defined ; nor is it probable that any improvement could be theoretically suggested for the better management of commission . All that is advanced by the new theory , is a reduction of those enormous profits of the commission merchant , by subjecting him to the immediate supervision of a combination of producers . A wealthy combination of producers making large profits themselves , a circumstance which would happen of course , would , however , willingly allow their commissioner to make large profits : indeed , were he ever so much under their direction and influence , the superior knowledge which he would soon acquire , would make them dependent upon him in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service which he rendered them . On the other hand , it would be his duty , under the new theory , to purchase for them either with their capital , or by the barter of their commodities , those luxuries and comforts for which their surplus is to be exchanged ; and here again the superior knowledge and keenness of the agent gives him an unavoidable advantage over his employers , and his salary must be increased or his per percentage augmented in proportion to the wealth and the profits of those for whom he acts . We see , therefore , that the inequality of gain is a circumstance unavoidable under the present system , however exactly and judiciously organized . In fact , we are driven to the conclusion , that the new theorists are not indeed theorists , but only reformers , who , accepting the established modes and processes of commerce , desire only to give them a better shape , excluding what is irregular and mischievous , extending what is permanent and valuable , and in fine , perfecting the economical arrangements of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompaniment of metaphysics and false science , with which it has been invested by Fourier and his followers , the organization of labor seems to be an effort merely to insure to industry and ability their just reward . There is indeed a science of business , and that science is economy  --  the law of the household ; and its principles are one and the same for families , villages , towns , cities , states , and nations , i*nder the regulation of that mind which is undefinable , that universal reason which distinguishes men above the brutes . The first principle of economy , is doubtless , the simple necessity that the individual shall exist , that he shall sustain himself : The second , that he shall not injure , but benefit his neighbor . Justice only forbids an injury , and restrains the individual to the limits assigned him by reason and circumstance . Economy commands a benefit , and extends the activity of the individual for the good of others . Nothing serves to ill4strate the objects and principles of public economy more perfectly than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The proposition , first , that the consumer and producer should be near together , to escape the losses and delays of transportation ; and proposition , second , that the exchange of surpluses , between consumer and producer , should be through the fewest possible hands . It is the fashion of a certain school of miscalled economists to look upon the // movements of commodities in the market , as they do upon the motions of the heavenly bodies , and to regard the fluctuations of supply and demand , and the incomings and out , oings of specie , as they do the the rush of a cataract , or the flow of a mighty river , with a childish awe . These awe-stricken theorists are content with observation and a theory ; and their conclusions , like those of Pyrrho of old , end always in a doubt , and forbid all action . These are our free traders , our men of laissezfaire , whose unfruitful science ends only in negation , and forbids advance . How unlike that science of the moderns , which ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; whose lamp is reason , and whose pioneer is experiment ; whose spirit is beneficence , and its aim , the increase , the union , and the happiness of mankind . Justly might we say of skeptical free trade science , that it is a science of despair ; it is doubt applied , - Pyrrhonism made a principle of legislation ,  --  jcalousy put up for justice . It is a mysterious working of human conceit that men should glory in their own incapacity ; and yet none are more conceited than those who make i*norance a point of merit . These are your practical men , as they fondly style themselves , in whom there is no practice , and who fancy they have ascended to the summit of knowledge , when they have calculated the probabilities of an excess of population , or a dearth of corn : their activity ends with their theory ; they are a kind of Haruspices , whose business it is to peep into the entrails of the state , and thence to predict disaster . Their ravens fly ever on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people . With these false economists , the functions of a government are reduced to the regulation of army , navy , and police ; and to the collection of taxes ; while the true economist endeavors to impart to government a beneficent and protecting , as well as a coercive power . As the acts of government necessarily have a powerful effect upon the business of the country , and the government , by necessity , employs larger sums , and transacts more business than an hundred of the wealthiest corporations , the direction of its conduct is of vast moment , as it affects the agricultural , commercial , and manufacturing interests . The policy of free trade is wholly to neglect these effects , and to drive the great engine of the state through the private domains of industry with a perfect scorn of consequences . Government , established for the benefit of the people , is made wholly to disregard them , and to think only of itself : it is made to perform its duty , like some inferior functionary of the law , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral person . But on such a topic figures of rhetoric are in vain . It is necessary for the true economist to use the language of economy , and by the management of the farm and the workshop to illustrate the management of the state . Hitherto the state has been exemplified by the image of a man clad in armor , with weapons of offence in his hand : but as the spirit of christianity gradually softens and tempers the spirit of the people , those old heathenish rules of conquest and vidlence have to give way to wiser and gentler maxims . Justice is but the left hand of government , industrial polity its right . The people arc not now , as formerly , to be looked upon as a herd of serfs , whom to govern and keep down is the prime duty of legislation . Armies now are for defence and not for conquest . As society advances the citizen lays aside his weapons and attends to his affairs in peace . He has leisure for industry and economy , and as the free state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it should be made to resemble him in all particulars , except that of a selfish individuality.
