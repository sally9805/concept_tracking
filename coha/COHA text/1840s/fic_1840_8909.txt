Scene .  --  The Appenines , and Forests , once in an Hotel in Florence , and a Cottage . Main text ACT I. SCENE I.  --  Inside of a Cottage . Fernando discovered , seated in a melancholy posture . Fernando . Fernando Alas ! fortune ! what a fickle and unfavoured minister of happiness and misery art thou ? Thou art as unsteady in thy course , as the inconstant Cynthia , that nightly changes in her form . With thy glittering and delusive bait , thou holdest to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow thy fairy and wanton form , through all thy intricate and obscure windings , from day to day , until thou hast worn our energy and patience , to the lowest ebb , and brought upon us the sear and despised part of life .  --  We then sink to the earth , unable to pursue thee farther ; and call upon thee to aid us in our helplessness , and decayed situation ; but in vain ! thou hast sped from us like the winds , ne'er to return .  --  ( He rises . ) Complain , why do I ? thou eyeless goddess , was once within my touch ; and gave me all thy stream of pleasure and delight ; but my weak affection for unkind Julio , wrenched thee from me , and left me nothing ! and what have I for it ? has he left his devilish ways ? no ! He is now e'en trying to unstring the tie of virtue , in yon poor cottager 's daughter ! oh hellish ! but he will ne'er meet it as he wishes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep within another night ; but Ginevra knows it not , and hither she comes , and in tears . Heaven help me to dilate it unto her . Enter Ginevra , in tears . My daughter ! why those tears ? what 's the matter ? what leans upon thy heart ? Ginevra . Ginevra Nothing , dear Fernando . Fernando . Fernando Nothing , Ginevra ; thou wouldst not weep for nothing ! Something of import must have taken , or thou wouldst not weep . Ginevra . Ginevra No , father , it was only a weak impress for a moment , which will soon vanish , and leave me quiet . Fernando . Fernando No , my child , that weak and impotent nature of thine , will ne'er allow thy sensitive heart , to cast off the oppression , I see that weighs it down , and lifts unhappiness to thy face . Come , give freedom to thy heart , and unfold to me the cause , and I will give it quiet if within my potent . Ginevra . Ginevra It seems then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read when looked upon ; I will tell you , but do not laugh at my quick grief . Fernando . Fernando I 'll not laugh at it . Ginevra . Ginevra It was this beauteous rose that empierced my heart , and caused the o'erhanging of my tears . Fernando . Fernando Ah ! Ginevra . Ginevra Yes , the light drops of rain , that fell upon its vermil head , raised it to such a striking and lovely form , I could not resist the temptation , of taking it from its mother sprig and contemplating on its short lived beauty ; and oh , when I but look at it , it strains to my heart , the quick and untimely entrances and exits of man . They cross . Fernando , Fernando ( aside . ) Now is the time , to break the secret of Julio 's departure . Yes , Ginevra , the rise and end of man is sudden , to-day he buds in helpless infancy , to-morrow he breaks forth to the full blown man ; hope , courage , valour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry him through this quick world of pleasure . The third day comes , and with it the scythe of old age , and second helplessness , his manly strength is gone , and with it , all his powers , he then withers and decays like the rose . Ginevra . Ginevra Ah ! ' t is so , indeed . Fernando . Fernando But Ginevra , the death of life were nought , to the living death of shame in female virtuous ; in punishment , what would ye inflict on villains that did shackle them ? Ginevra . Ginevra Oh , that the heavens would strip from off their hearts , the sheath of pretended virtue , and the power nine . I would torture them with all the conjurations of pain , that heaven and Erebus could yield . Fernando . Fernando The eye of mortal is not allowed to peep behind their screen of virtue . Nor find we out their detested hearts , till their sting of utterable shame has launched upon our heads . God ! O , God ! that such a horrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ginevra Julio , didst thou say ? Julio , one of these ? Fernando . Fernando Yes , Ginevra , Julio , thy brother . Ginevra . Ginevra Sure , father , you jest ! thy heart does not mean what thy words impart ! Fernando . Fernando Jest , I jest not , I meant the words I uttered . Ginevra . Ginevra Is then my brother , that was coupled in the same embrace of contraction that I was ? that has played to me a friend ? is he the villain ? Oh , Julio , how am I deceived ! Weeps . Fernando . Fernando The hypocrite to thee , has he played indeed . Ginevra . Ginevra But why , dear father , didst thou not make me an hearer afore ? Fernando . Fernando No , my heart was too kind , to broach thine with his too filthy ways ; the couch of affluence which you fell from was enough without his base infirmity ; but I 'll hold no longer from thee , Julio parts from here this night . Ginevra . Ginevra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does . Ginevra . Ginevra Why this quick turn from love to hate ? thy brain is mixed with the light talk of madness , or thou wouldst not converse so ? Fernando . Fernando No , my brain is firm , reason yet is mine . Ginevra . Ginevra Then why this sudden fit of hate against Julio ? Fernando . Fernando ' T is not sudden , it hath been hid for years , and it now must forth ! Julio , has been a viper hid too long from the bastinade , and see how it hath done me , ( pointing around . ) Why should I hold my arm o'er the head of the recoiled serpent , that emits sans intermission forth his fangs of poison , and merits the pain his victim would inflict , if within his grasp ! No , ' t is done , he goes . Ginevra . Ginevra ( x. to him . ) No dear father , thy words are hard , his duty unto you is not forgot . Fernando . Fernando Hold , Ginevra , extenuate not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know'st him not ; but hear of him , then know him . The past Monday eve , the encountering of Julio 's voice I had , in passing through your bower , and in its sound I thought it had a partner ; there was , and it was Eliza . The whispers in her ear , were libidinous from him , and therefore I parted them ; and with a vow , I told him my house should not hold him tenant more , and took he it so . I knew him , and so we part . Therefore , dear daughter ' t is sad I know ; but must be done , and since his stay can not be stretched suppose we give him timely parting , for the sun fast sets . Then haste  --  I know and see thee grieved ; but ' t is for rest I have him so . Ginevra . Ginevra I know thou art good and do best ; I go , my feet perform their office with a sad motion , and my heart goes corresponding . Exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would forgive him ; but must not , for the vow to ye above , O help me through it for have I much to do . They are here . Re-enter Ginevra , with Julio . She retires up weeping . Fernando comes to Julio . Well , my son  --  my heart moves and almost sur feits my speech ; but thou knowest the counsel thou was called for ? Julio . Julio I do . Fernando . Fernando Well , Julio , since absence is to draw her dark and curtained distance betwixt us ; and throws athwart as the time uncertain , when she will bring us to each other 's view again , let us call to our hearts an assemblage of harmonious thoughts , and let the words of anger that thou hadst from me , though given with a hard and meaning front , be vaporish considered : and since I forgive all ills in you , hold no unkindness towards me ; for hardness would it be indeed to touch me with unfeeling thoughts , when age and me hug close each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thy inclining . Fernando . Fernando Now since I have your words for peace ; let me give you counsel for your success , and let the precepts that I give you , be the characters , highest in your mind . Thou art now , my son , going to tread on fortune 's viterous and slippery path ; a path that is often trod , let not the slights she chooses to fling before thee , at all despair thee , for ' t is her liking ; thou hadst her once and run to nought upon her golden fleece ; and now thou must content thyself with paying her humble and patient fealty . Brief not thy course at that either , for thou hast often seen the son of clouded prospect , leap to the highest seat that power yields , carry thine eye unsealed and wary to scan mankind , for it will be a convoy for thy relief : let not the glib and stealthy tongued prater , with his o'erfull breast of friendship circling nothing , spear thy heart to that condition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy husbandry , for often do such fellows , show unwary man his end , and to such would I have you hold a grudge . Let thy havior be always light and mild , for then will men of tetchy stamp ne'er seek thee in their quarrels ; but pass thee by , and say he has not aspiring acerbity . In entertainment let thy thoughts pass from thee with close circumference ; for superfluous breath offends the ear , and is often thought the inhabitant of vacant and listless minds ; to that I 'd have you hook close with , for thou and I have oft seen pitable ignorance clothed with honours from standing mute . Thy habit , together with all other expenditures , let it be leashed in servant like office to thy purse ; for if it outstrip its comings in , thou wilt forever tread the rut and furrowed road that poverty 's companions always step . Let this advice upon thy heart that it may deepen still with time . For hear you , my son , thou hast not advice from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interim let me not forget omniscience , for that will lull and gorge to sleep , the feverish and sultry evils , that crispy man is set upon . I 'll stay it now , and give you parcels for your journey . Here are papers , ( gives him papers. ) to carry you to the Count Manarto ; when read by him , he 'll take you as his own , which I know from our close knit friendship of yore ; no more can I say , and pray , think of Ginevra  --  and me  --  when gone it comes to the short word , farewell , and I must use it . Farewell , my Julio , heaven rest you , farewell . Julio . Julio Adieu , my father , heaven bless thee , too . Fernando goes up the stage . Ginevra , Ginevra ( comes down , and leans on Julio 's shoulder , exclaims . ) O , Julio , must thou go and leave me ? ' t is so ! Oh heavens ! Exeunt Ginevra and Julio . Fernando @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! when thou dost ignite , how wilt thou snap and bite thy dearest flesh ; turn the cave of harmonious speech , to discord most befitting hell ; let the orbs of vision catch the furious aspect of infernal fiends , and by thy side , let unheeded stand cooling advice that would give thee tearful pleasure , if only moved towards ! O , simple man , that thinks he counterfeits the lion when most he apes the ass . Ah , repent I now for him ? he will no more good , he is too much i'the basely , heavens right him row , for I have done my all . Exit . SCENE II .  --  The Brigands ' cavern . Elvira and child asleep . Ramanzo standing by . Time , sunrise . Ramanzo . Ramanzo ' T is morn , and bright hyperion has at length thrust his form through the dark and cloggy curtain of the night , and drives in to us once more the jocose day ; he branches forth with his spiral robes , pure and unalloyed , and pushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who glad to see his face , doth virgin-like retire ; O , such divinity , heaven and earth will ring thy fame etcrne . O , bright god , how all doth joy to see thee , poor crippled earth that drinks within her womb thy genial heat , and spits sweet odors forth to glad and joy thy ruler , how would she keep without thee ? Dark loathsome hell would stand a paradise to it . The poor mute brute that can not wag his tongue to varied speech , gives demonstrations of delight , by throwing himself to anticks most ridiculous ; and then poor rheumy decreptitude , rising from his kneel of thanks , and hobbles to his archway , to bid thee good morn . The prancing youth that holds his eye upon thy evening exit , and laughs within himself , to see thee make a goodly set , for on that , doth he regulate and place his little holiday . The simple hind that hums the aged tune , and keeps strong heart , whilst thou dost hold thy face , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under archers favourite . Thus all , all , doth joy in thee ; all I say except Ramanzo . I stand and ponder untouched from sweets that others glut on , from nothing have I relief . O Ramanzo , thou art a phantom to thy former self , ah , how gladly would I coop myself to death 's short pace were it not for heaven 's frowns upon untimely exits ; or yon sleeping innocence and spray : ' t is them , and them alone that makes me stay with feelings of the damned . He crosses to the cavern entrance . Elvira awakes . Elvira . Elvira ' T is sunrise ; but where is Ramanzo ? perhaps he 's up , and catching heaven 's newest breath . O , thou pretty imprint of him I love , sleep on , I 'll not awake thee ; but up and follow my Ramanzo  --  ( sees him . ) But there he is and seems lost in contemplation . Ramanzo ! He hears me not .  --  ( goes to him . ) Ramanzo ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What makes thy speech so ill ! art thou sick ? or what matters thee ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo ' T is a strange sickness reigns in me ? Elvira . Elvira What is it dear Ramanzo ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo Dost thou see yonder bright form ? Elvira , Elvira What meanest thou ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo Dost thou see the sun ? Elvira . Elvira I do . Ramanzo . Ramanzo But canst thou look upon his face unharmed ? Elvira . Elvira No ; for his light doth rheum my eyes . But why dost thou ask ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo The same as that affects thine eyes ; so will I by and by abuse it . Elvira . Elvira Ramanzo , how strange thou speakest ! what meanest thou ? how shall I tune my words to answer such strange givings ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo Hear you , Elvira , I will speak them for you and save you yearning . That yonder lamp of day that lights all heaven and earth , that sends the floating cherubim chaunting their morning air , and all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverging turns ; hear me say it , I hate it , for it hath the same face always , and lights all nature up in happiness , whilst it leaves me the figure of Ate , hated and contemned by all . Elvira . Elvira Ramanzo , who hates ? who dislikes thee ? if thou dost abuse thyself with simple grief , thou makest use of thy philosophy most egregious . Why , oh why , art thou so downcast ? do not droop for simpleness . Ramanzo . Ramanzo I can bear the catches of common men , but those that can bear more are gods . Elvira . Elvira I ask again what has harmed thee ? what unheard of ills disturb thee ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo ' T is the life I lead , ' t is that distracts me ; heaven has at length peirced me with a dart , and set thousand pronged conscience on its throne , which will ne'er leave me till it hath eaten me dead . The supernatural dreams I have whene'er I close my eyes in sleep , fright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creep in musty caverns , or live upon the fetid air that dead men 's vaults exhale , or suck the rancid wounds of diseased eaten brute , till it hath made me mad , than diet on the horrors which I always have . Oh , wretched , wretched fool . Crosses . Elvira . Elvira Oh , Ramanzo , why art thou so fallen from thy former state ? thou once did look cheerly , and as I thought happy ; but no , ' t is not so now ; thou art full of false images ; the night and morn are the same to you , in day thy walk is like the cripple that halts , sighs at heaven for his pain with mind most agonised , then passes on again ; at night thou pauseth at the moon till her wavy face hath inspired thee with her watery beads ; dries them again , bursts out in fearful acclamation , then run to tearful childishness again . If thou dost follow long this bent , by and by shall I pity thee for thy reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anodyne will ne'er be mine , time has been mine too long , I must not look for comfort now ; ' t is late , but must run my hellish course , till justice hath drawn her sword and galloped me to compt . Elvira . Elvira There again , ' t were useless to speak thee ; thou wouldst rather run thyself to death than stay and comfort poor Elvira . She weeps . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Elvira , thy melting eyes could once assuage and move me from my object , but now the weight of them are lost . Elvira . Elvira Has then poor Elvira gone so far ? that she has lost her seat within Ramanzo 's heart ? then am I wretched , I am no more thy wife nor friend , I am no more to hear thy counsel ; nor take pleasure from thy tongue ; but live upon the foundless turning of thy temper ; if that is then the part I have to hold , I am no more thy wife , but Ramanzo 's malkin . He goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doth hold thy place as near my heart ; but for all , thou canst not dull the painted fiend that holds my breast within his gripe , for it will show in all affairs let them be what'er they may , and now to fret it worse . There is Lamato that struck an aged sire to the ground , and pinched from him his mite , when the pack did hear it , they all behowed forth the common cry revenge . They sans their own crimes of robbing men , though on a little steadier push , swore that he should die ; and heaped on me the mighty office of suspending of his breath ; they fine fellows peirce with eyes of hawks the tricks of others , but slubber o'er their own most nicely . O , most honorable men stand I with . Elvira . Elvira But thou needst not do it . Ramanzo . Ramanzo But I must follow it , by the oath bound rules . Elvira . Elvira Then since ' t is so cast , give not thy thought but rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leap from pending danger ; and such a one shalt thou have , if thou canst only call thy patience to the level . Come , come , let us cheer and not frown always ; what say you ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo By the gods , sweet prattler , you almost turn me happy ; but if the fit takes again I leave it . Well , I will my best to please thee . Elvira . Elvira Those words were sweet . Better I could not take . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Well , I 'll to it . ( takes his child from the couch . ) Come my little godling , arise , and with me to view the proud heavens afore thou dost sup thy little mess . But hist , I hear steps , Lapazo , I think ! Lapazo , Lapazo ( without . ) What ho , Ramanzo ! Ramanzo . Ramanzo ' T is he . Enter Lapazo , Lapazo How art thou ? Elvira . Elvira What , friendly Lapazo ! Lapazo . Lapazo Well , thank Heaven . Ramanzo . Ramanzo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long stay ; where have you staid ? Lapazo . Lapazo To note to thee the paths that I have trod were a tedious matter to tell . Then let my shortness suffice . When I bade adieu for a short time to you , my mind was not for roving far , but game not coming to my sight , it made me gasp for action . Florence struck on my mind and I pushed for that . We happened to arrive when they were at glee for the duke 's consort bringing him an heir . We with all one step fell in with their great joy , and sped ourselves to pleasure , thus was our absence long . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Didst thou enter it without fear ? Lapazo . Lapazo Fear ! that ne'er came near us ; we e'en had so much of the devil within us , as to gripe him by the hand , and say great seignor , for this your work , great joy ; and such of us as looked most comely run through his halls with his fair guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ramanzo Thy face , Lapazo doth brush thee anywhere ; but hast thou seen Bantio or Gratio in your way ? Lapazo . Lapazo No ; why ask you ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo This is the fourth day that they have been absent in search of you , and not returning , I thought they were with you , I hope no ill to them is come . Lapazo . Lapazo I have not seen them . ( noise without . ) . But here are the men . Enter Rato , Larreto , and the rest of the Brigands . Rato . Rato Come on my fellows . Cheer for Ramanzo , Lapazo , and our return . They shout . Lapazo . Lapazo That was a pretty ring for the empty cave ; but rest ye while I speak , Ramanzo . Ramanzo and Lapazo converse apart . Rato , Rato ( brings out dice and box . ) Here , Larreto , you and I to our morning 's exercise , a ducat on my throw . Throws . Larreto . Larreto Done ! ( throws. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With all my heart , and doubled . Larreto . Larreto ' T is mine again , thou canst not win always . Again ? Rato . Rato Yes . Lapazo comes forward and speaks . Lapazo . Lapazo Rato , and all , hear ye . Are ye resolved , and hold ye your minds the same upon Lamato 's fate ? All . All We do . Lapazo . Lapazo You see Ramanzo , ' t is the same . Ramanzo . Ramanzo But all are not here ; Bantio and Gratio yet remain . Lapazo . Lapazo No matter , here are enough for one man 's death . I go to bring him . Ramanzo . Ramanzo But stay Lapazo , I pray you let me pass this , ' t is a string that I can not force to its height , in passing death 's words upon him . Lapazo . Lapazo As you are captain your words must do it . I bring him  --  ( whistle without  --  Lapazo returns it . ) ' T is Bantio . Enter Bantio , Gratio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Bantio ! ( shakes hands . ) But whom bring you here ? Bantio . Bantio A man that fortunes kick to nothing ; and o'ercome by our entreaties , he came with us to rest , as we name it . Exit , Lapazo . Ramanzo . Ramanzo He comes to restless harbour then ; for we are arranged now , for Lamato 's death . Bantio . Bantio I had thought he had been forgiven and all passed to nought ; why start you it again . Ramanzo . Ramanzo I do not ; the men have brought it so . ' T is an act I like not ; but see he 's brought . Lamato is brought in chained , and placed in C. they all stand around . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Well , Lamato , the time is come , you see , for thy departure ; all wish for it , and think it just . For my part I hold you nought but pity , and gladly would I pass the word of condemnation , but that the rules and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that , run through the sentence , I am ready for it . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Hath thou no token to give to friend or kin , to think of you when gone ? Lamato . Lamato Kin , I have none , and for a friend if heaven knows I know not ; none have I unless ' t were one would cut my heart in twain , then he were one . Bantio . Bantio ( comes forward . ) Lamato , thou dost hurt thyself , if you do plant the ring around my name to include it with thine enemies . No , no , I 'll here speak for thee , and if they will not forgive , then the same stroke that smites thee has me also under it . Most humbly , Ramanzo , and ye all ; I throw my speech before you to beg of you the freedom of Lamato 's person ; let it not enter thine ears with soundless bottom , for I do speak most heartily . Lamato , stands before you a traitor to our forms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that God hath set his seal of pity on , a hoary sire , that ages past have bent the head respectful too ; a crime I know most brutish , but for all he may be forgiven . Let not your feverish tempers rule your good hearts , for rulers of great heat have been made to bear the words of mercy to greater crimes than his ; then why not ye ? doom him not , he feels most penitent for his offence . I know ill thoughts may rise in ye , but I will speak until his fate is wafted to a stand right safety . Lamato , Lamato Bantio ! cease , have done ; it were useless , to speak them , no more . I have done you hurt , in speaking you not my friend ; but forgive , think not of the words , for hell will singe me for my works , and yield you satisfaction . Come , do your execution ; ( To Ramanzo. ) and farewell , Bantio . Bantio . Bantio And must it be farewell like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hold , Bantio , dost thou not see their stiffened and crimped forms ? judge by their outside , and then you have their hearts . Bantio . Bantio No , I can not take their forms as showing out their hearts ; I 'll try , then judge . Ramanzo , dost thou wish Lamato 's death ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo No ; I want it not , my mind is illy formed to be a witness at his death , much more to pass the words that bind him to his end . Bantio . Bantio As your voice is mine , Ramanzo , I will not fear the rest . What say you , Lapazo ? Lapazo . Lapazo Nothing , but he should have it . Elvira . Elvira O , Lapazo , say not so , but let Lamato pass , it will not damage our decree for once , and if friendship to me you hold , join with Ramanzo . Ramanzo . Ramanzo I pray you , let her speech affect you all ; and I will speak the pain that he shall suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep cut heart . Lapazo . Lapazo Speak it , Ramanzo . Ramanzo . Ramanzo ' T is thus : Lamato , thou art no more to be one of Ramanzo 's band , but one that shall kneel to receive the kicks and scoffs of thy companions : a mark for all to grin at , and receive the spits of all ignorance ; to cast thy strength on all burdens that slaves would reach against , to watch when others sleep , and to be watched thyself , to bend to every fantasy which the meanest of them shall take ; and all of this shalt thou with menial bend receive . Lapazo . Lapazo Enough , Ramanzo , what say ye Rato , and the rest ? Rato . Rato I like it well ; suppose he fills it now ? and bring us forth our meal ? Lapazo . Lapazo No , let him not enter his office without great care upon his mind , our service now is clean ; when ' t is dirty then comes he , let 's to our meal now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art forgiven . Bantio and Lamato part . Lapazo , Bantio , and the rest of the Brigands Exeunt . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Come , Elvira , let us follow , and Lamato , wear thou those chains till they do call you . Come , Elvira . Exeunt . Lamato . Lamato Wear those chains till they do call you ? yes , till they do sore thy head : for nought but revenge on thee and them will I think of . I will pause now and see how I 'm to bring the circle around my undertaking . I think among the troop when I was brought before them , there was a face that I had not seen afore , he looked not like a brigand , but had a form most courteous , and face not smeared with villany , and had the look where man might make an casy entrance . But how to use him ? ( pauses . ) I have it again . When man doth set himself for evil , how hell doth place thoughts afore him . My thoughts do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will catch and send them to their ears , so loud am I for revenge . He hath the look of trimness , which will glut him with a pleasure , and me my favorite revenge . I 'll shove him for the fair Elvira , and cause him to woo her in lustful form ; if she do turn from it , he must use her harshly , for that will cause Ramanzo 's leaping down ; and then the rest must follow . Then , Lamato , look up for thy sun by and by will shine effulgent , all friendship forget , and all acts of goodness sink into hell , even if it were thy brothers . I am at it now , I go to place aright , and bring forth my revenge . Exit . END OF ACT I. ACT II . SCENE I.  --  The Cavern , Ramanzo in restless sleep , and Elvira sitting by sewing  --  she rises and goes to him . Elvira . Elvira What , Ramanzo , didst thou call ? ( he moans . ) Alas ! poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always in anguish ; sleep , that oblivious balm , the only time when man disowns himself , the balm and healer of all minds in ecstacy , is to thee the curtain , where on the light of day throws its show of rubbing troubles ( he throws about in great agitation ) Alas , what struggles he with ? Ramanzo , Ramanzo , awake ! He springs up . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Strike me not . With violent trembling . Elvira . Elvira For the love of the holy prophet , what matters thee ? Speak , or L shall die with horror . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Where am I ? in hell , I think . Elvira . Elvira Dost thou not know ? thou art with Elvira . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Elvira , art thou with me in hell ? Elvira . Elvira What sound is that , in hell ! we are in the cave , and thou hast been sleeping . Ramanzo , Ramanzo ( recovering . ) In the cave ; ah , the worse then for me ; methought I were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not encompass I thought did close me in , and now I see ' t was nothing . Elvira . Elvira ' T was nothing , Ramanzo , you laid asleep . Ramanzo . Ramanzo But yet ' t was horrid ! I thought that I were in strong smelling Erebus , and devils , fiends , and imps , as I passed them by did hurl their tail of points at me to pull me to their sulphurous bodies , when I did try to scape them , then would they point their fangs of sharpness , and turn their eyes sepulchral at me and with such horrid noises laugh me into madness , when each had thus glutted on me his yells , they placed me on their pointed lances and with a balanced inspiration shouted and run me through their flumes of blueness ; thus from all I received their torture , and then played they pitch with me. ( sits , ) O ! Elvira if fiends are allowed to cast such torture in man 's mind , better that I had ne'er breathed . Elvira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the broad light day , while Hyperion races through his course , while Cynthia with her sideral imitators , are all drawn to darkness , while the yawning hillock of the dead hath shut its mouth against its natural vision , till night hath spread her cloth of murky hue ; while all sights of shapeless monsters have their cue to hold their perjured bodies in confinement , you with a conjuring imagination draw these sights of sadness in your mind to make me wretched and thyself . Oh , Ramanzo , thou hast no pity for me . Weeps . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Pity , ' t is a word I know , but its action I have forgot . It seems that heaven has run me from its guide and left fiends to sway me into madness ; who can think of pity ? or any of the thousand phrases that the world hath set up ? when his repose is grafted with hellish forms ? if you can sleep untortured , my lot is not so cast . Elvira . Elvira Thy sleep may be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind on every whiz that inhabits this great globe ; you may forever play the madman 's game . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Elvira , thou art hardness to touch thy speech with , such roughness toward me ; but enough , I will no more , speak on it , I 'll leave thee and let thee whistle thy song of comfort to other ears than mine ; come , then , farewell . Elvira . Elvira For the love of heaven reach up that heated part of thee that makes thee talk like this ; and in its place stand happy reason . O , Ramanzo , what dost thou mean ? if you do keep like this you will make me mad ; What did'st thou see in thy dream ? perhaps no more than babes would laugh at . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Babes were not susceptible of it , and graves heads than mine would quake at it ; but no more , Elvira , we are to part for a while ; I will look for a habitation of more case than this , and then return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever woman did have such show of troubles played forever before her sight I do pity her ; but I will away with all strangeness , and ask thee in a mood of mildness which thou wilt answer , I know . Ramanzo , did my speech declamatory offend thee ? that thou dost wish thy leave from me ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo Not so ; thy speech was nothing though I looked at it , ' t was not that ; I think we would be happier were we from this , I know it , and therefore I will away from it . Elvira . Elvira The undertaking thou art not fit for now . Pause for awhile till thy mind is strung for it . Ramanzo . Ramanzo My mind is poised for it , and I could not vantage better on the time . Elvira . Elvira If the separation from this place must have its time and will bring you ease , take me with you , for thee alone , I could not see . Ramanzo . Ramanzo No , Elvira , for if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rout us out and speed us home to tortures . Elvira . Elvira Then shalt thou not go ; for in thy present mind you know not what you do . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Wouldst thou , Elvira , place thy voice o'er the vantage whereby I might ' scape to comfort ? if thou dost , then will I my leave take from thee untutored with respect . Going . Elvira . Elvira Hear my speech for a moment . Ramanzo . Ramanzo I will not hear it , if it be the same that you do always speak upon : think not that my life shall pass so always ; I had rather carry heavens thoughts flash upon my head , than live here . The crimes that I have seen and done , arise before me faster than the merry thunder leaps and leaps again , to make a noise .  --  ( she weeps . ) Crimes , I talk of , ah , such crimes have I seen , that the god of hell would stand with stiffened limbs and exclaim , What is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn its furies and add it to your tortures , it sets my mind upon the whirl . I will away . Elvira . Elvira Oh , Ramanzo ! Holds him . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Stay , one word and then the last : if you do still persist in this your will , here is my only friend , ( draws a dagger. ) this only . This shall bring forth the liquid that keeps my life , hell shall have me , and devils that I do nightly see in dreams , shall play companions to me . Elvira . Elvira Ramanzo , pull forth twenty falchions from their shields , yet shall you hear me . If thou dost go now , perhaps you will no more see me . Leave me not , leave not thy boy , have temper for awhile , well will come , if you will not go I 'll play the humble part that Habe played to the thunder king .

Farewell ! farewell ! I will return , kiss my child for me , kiss it , and tell him I will come again . Exit . Elvira , Elvira ( looks after him . ) O , Gods , where am I ? is it lightness runs through my brain ? no , ' t is not , ' t is reason , Ramanzo flies me ! why , why , does he go ? O , Ramanzo , come back , come back  --  where is my child , that I may throw it at him , to stay him to the ground ; murky hell send forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I may catch its lifting spirit to waft me to him .

Lamato Ha , ha , ha ! I have it now most sure ; I can now bear my slavery with joy . Great devil I must thank you for your work ; some would say thank heaven ; but no , for when men of evil bend doth sail for evil work the goodly saints all stand with musing rage , to see man bend to them , to work him to such unseemly incantations : therefore , say I , thank devil . Ramanzo has fled , and Elvira alone , looks like a statue tinged with sorrowful madness ; this did I catch by eaves dropping . If my work goes not when all for it is right , it shall not tax for not pushing , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Julio , my man is not yet fixed within my train secure , Elvira he must for in lusty form , and her fall must I hear him say afore I leave him ; a man of simpleness is he , and catching to all the flying ills of youth . I 'll work him to it . He advances and in some meditative mood , I 'll withdraw awhile and mark . Goes behind the trees . Enter Julio . Julio , Julio ( stands musing ) ' T is strange , life has great heaves and strains , it bath pitched me on strange ground . To drive me amongst a string of robbers ; ' t is ever so , that when the silly fool doth fly his sire wish , the God denounces and the devil pricks him riotous ; no sooner am I here , than one for revenge doth seek me to help him o'er it , I will ponder on the undertaking . Going , Lamato comes forward . Lamato . Lamato Well , Julio , how now ? how stands your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Julio I know not ; the crimes that you wish for me to put in execution is more than man can undertake . Lamato . Lamato Why that ? Julio . Julio Why , what cause have I to strike those men ? what thing have I to prick my heart to that condition that I may send them unto death ? none doth show itself , none but hearts that devils take could strike man unoffending  --  at our meeting they held me kindly ; I know not how to do it , unless ' t was named a parricide . Lamato . Lamato I know not those terms , they are words my heart ne'er give me time to learn . Julio . Julio If you have cause to strike them , go then , I have not , nor will I. Lamato . Lamato But didst thou not say that thou wouldst fill thy heart 's wish with lustful playfulness on Elvira ? Julio . Julio I did , for that is my calling , ' t is elysium , but murder is not , ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the difference ' twixt a killer and a libertine , I know not which stands in the palm . In a sneering manner . Julio . Julio Sneer , rave , or hold hate , I care not . Lamato . Lamato I wish not raving , nor hold hate against you , for we have not known each other long ; and therefore it would seem unnatural for us to vaunt on one another on so slight a knowing . Come , will you not follow as I wish ? if you do , it shall spin thee money and myself . Julio . Julio Money , for lacking it , gave me o'er to Bantio 's persuation , and I followed to this depot . Lamato . Lamato Then , why not unchain thy heart and follow to gain ? ( Julio pauses . ) How simple of me not to think of it sooner , Ramanzo , the captain of our band , the one that you have spoken has fled . Julio . Julio Fled and left us ? Lamato . Lamato Yes , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigh the cavern 's mouth ; but time short gone . I there heard him curse the life he led ; Elvira was trying to suppress his heated head , all stood useless , he was on leaving ; and such a leave taking , Vulcan 's leave from Heaven was more steady than his . Julio . Julio In what manner left he ? Lamato . Lamato In the strangest that e'er I see , there was no tearful embraces , no deep sobs , no words to heaven to bring them to each other again ; but like a maniac and a yell , telling her he would come again and so departed . What now can stop our blow , if we can lure her to our toils ? it makes us wealth , but if the gang do catch scent of this , their own bodies will know the weight they carry , for they will take from her the treasure of long years holding , which we will have by steps of quickness , now what say you for it ?

Lamato My own mind I say again . Bantio . Bantio Your mind , I understand thee not . Pray you let me have your thoughts , that I may find answer for this outbreak ? Lamato . Lamato When man with front firm , doth think his form appeasing to minds that are engaged in contemplating , he very oft offends to severing favors ever . Bantio . Bantio Why , Lamato , is this ? what mean you ? Lamato . Lamato Nothing more than that . Bantio . Bantio What am I to work from that ? is this the answer that I draw from it ? is Bantio 's friendship no more wished by Lamato ? Lamato . Lamato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! why are you like this to me ? what cause hast thou to speak like this ? did e'er I flout thee ? speak contumelious words against thee ? or done e'er so short a thing that thou couldst with an air turn and enforce thyself to anger with me ? No , thou canst not speak it , nor done it have I. Lamato . Lamato Fair sir , thou knowest not to whom thy speech is turned , dost thou hold converse with thy slave ? I am your slave , one that picks nicely for thy stomach 's wish , a menial that doth carry hat i'the hand to thee ; I will away , I fear thy speech is evil ; for lords do often turn their tongue most fulsome when they would have them do things they themselves do fear . Going . Bantio . Bantio Stay , what is this ? why look you like this ? surely thy mind is not gone ? why stand off like this ? I once knew you to be Lamato , the  --  Lamato .

Bantio . Bantio If not a fool , have done with thy simple speech , to hell hurl it , talk not like that to me . Come , come , you have been jesting , come along you with me , we will be friends again . Lamato . Lamato Great master , I know my station would be gone were I to follow . Bantio . Bantio Thou art an idiot , my heated head raises to its old pitch and chastisement would come forward were we not friends , fool it not . Come with me . Lamato . Lamato Then since you will not hear ; know this , I will not with thee , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am the lackey , I am alone , now , and despised , and therefore all friendship I damn . Bantio . Bantio If then you are so firm bound in thy will , I would have you care how you mind it , for short time past they had a rouse , and not finding you to serve then , they were forced to fill it themselves , and when done , they raised the cry to bring you to the scorge ; I left them at the time to find you to put you on the look , then I would have you mind their whims , for they are strange masters this may be lacked , have and take note , farewell , ' t is from a friend . Exit . Lamato . Lamato And when lacked it may be used . ( Julio comes forward . ) Well , Julio , I am in haste . Is your mind for the enterprise  --  Julio . Julio ' T is the same fixed for Elvira . Lamato . Lamato Well , as you will ; but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear help us and hold close . Julio .

Elvira Well , I 'll weep no more , I 'll try like the olden matrons , to stop the oozing grief when e'er a fell did meet them , who now does care for me like him ? none , like hyperiou , were he to draw his form from out his course , how all his thievish neighbours would lack for light ; so lack I his care when gone ; but I must cease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enter Julio , reading the bible .

Elvira ' T is the bible , away , it makes me cold . Julio . Julio Dost thou hate that book ? Elvira . Elvira Nay , I am not fit for it , take it and may it pleasure thee . Julio , Julio ( takes it . ) Ah , great book , how I do love thee , come like the little nestler to his crooked bill sire and I will nestle thee . Elvira .

Julio Then , ' t was this , the love of this good book between my father and myself did cause disjointing , and cast he me on the world portionless , and in my grief my praying I could compass not . Nor e'en cared . Elvira . Elvira Poor wretch I pity thee , that Ramanzo had had thee for a tutor . Julio . Julio If my speech had been heard afore he parted , he had been happy . Elvira .

Elvira Was there others that did see ? Julio . Julio None , I was alone , nor have I spoke it to any , nor ever meant I. Elvira . Elvira Heavens tenant and holy penitent , were it yours I would not name my thanks ; but I do loathe the fall which you have come to . Julio . Julio Ne'er mind for me , I am content when that I can read this book , and meditate upon my love . Elvira . Elvira How must that being pain , to have the thoughts run through her mind of having her cherished form torn from her and he so kind , alas ! I pity her . Julio .

Elvira . Elvira It ' t is by thy description , and doth this fair being return love reciprocal ? Julio . Julio I have never put my lips in form to ask her . Elvira . Elvira Not ! sure she would not refuse it , for she could see it , though thy voice uttered no sound towards it .

I 'll say ' t was Wrong ; but forgive it , and breathe on me thy soft passion . Elvira . Elvira What mean you ? breathe on thee my soft passion , I stagger into forgetfulness at thy carriage ! Julio . Julio Dost thou hate me ? Elvira . Elvira Hate you ! I know not what to say ! thou knowest me not ; time is but short that I have known you , and why are you like this ? Julio .

Lamato Hast thou offered up thy speech in sanctified form to ease thy soul through the narrow way which it must pass ? Elvira . Elvira No , my life e'er since I moved upon the ground in pueril shape , has been like an unshot arrow , void of stir or move , but for evil ; Ramanzo was I true to , and butchered now am I , I want no life , strike , and then carry my blessing to my child ; curse ye villains .

Am I not merciful ? Elvira . Elvira Merciful ! O , gods , did ye ever form a man like this ? if ye have , single them out that I may see them , for none I think are made like him . O , wretched Elvira , where are you now ?  --  great god , if ' t is thy will that I should pain like this , I will not murmur ; but if not give me strength to fell this horrid wretch , and walk a maniac o'er the earth , for I would rather do it than swear my entrance out from thee .

Nay , weep not freshly for those words , or is it for him that left thee ? is it for Fernando ? if ' t is , I pity thee , my pity ! what comfort gives it you ? none , all must leave this form as he has done , then weep no more . Ginevra . Ginevra Eliza , thou art a friend that my memory shall ne'er let encroach upon its surface oblivious thought towards thee ; but hold as near to me shall you as my most susceptible part . Thou art kind to me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treachery from my brother . Eliza . Eliza Touch not his name , I have forgot all ! Ginevra . Ginevra I know thou art of gentle mind , and would o'erlook thy hurts were it death to thee , and I 'll try no more to grieve thee by weeping for my father : it is now Eliza that I feel time paining , for all are gone that were of kindred to me ; Julio , the one I looked for peace , in his reckless fits as you do know , left Fernando ; the time is lengthy now since that I have heard of him , and it makes me hunger after knowledge of him , which if I get not in some short days , I will put a thing in motion which I have sometime thought of . Eliza . Eliza And pray , Ginevra , what have thy thoughts been ? tell me , and I will action it if I can . Ginevra . Ginevra Nay , thou canst not move it ; but this it is : were he not here shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he forgot , I could inwrap myself within , and trace him unto Florence where he did go , I know thy censure will arise upon it for a simple doing ; but I have worked it in my thoughts so well , that I will step upon it , let me fall ere I have reached its centre . Eliza . Eliza Thou couldst not undergo that mighty undertaking ; think but as long as the quick motion of the eye , and thou wouldst treat it as a simple doing . Ginevra . Ginevra As I thought , so have you spoken . Eliza . Eliza And who would not speak so , that form of thine , face , eyes , and all , doth indicate so strongly against the dress that thou dost wish to harbour in , that eyes would pierce thee , aye , so closely , that you would wish thy body in such habiliment again , never . Ginevra . Ginevra For a brother , tho ' e'er so heartless thou wouldst venture to the antipodes : and my poinard in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then no fear need I have . Eliza . Eliza But the trial , and one so green as thou art , it makes me tremble . Knocking at the door . Ginevra . Ginevra To the door , and see who asks for attention . Exit Eliza , Ginevra . Ginevra O , Julio , where art thou ? Enter Eliza . Ginevra . Ginevra Who is it ? Eliza . Eliza ' T is a traveller that seeks to break his fasting after long journeying . Ginevra . Ginevra Let him enter . Eliza brings in Ramanzo . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Fair lady , a benison on you for your kindness , ' t is refreshment I seek , and gold is at you wish if wanted . Eliza brings refreshments and places it on the table . Ginevra . Ginevra None will I ask from thee ; but sit and take thy wish . Ramanzo , Ramanzo ( sits . ) I will , and my thanks if not my money you must have .  --  ( drinks . ) Here 's to the kind hostess of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converse apart , and retire . ) O , sweet contentment , here is thy dwelling , here doth the smooth face goddess dwell ; this is a spot on earth ordained for heavenly elysium to reign o'er , all here have what angels always know , and what the troubled never heard or touched , ' t is peace . Ramanzo , your habitation which you have sought , can be named with this , you can now be happy , the gold which I have gained dishonourable , shall fly with a merry hand , the eye of old age when that I do meet it shall lose its watery look and turn to laughing glee , like those well stored for age ; the orphan shall not go untaught for his lacking purse while mine doth hold , my wife shall no more be called a robber 's mate ; but like those ne'er tainted with deep poverty , shall have and think of comfort . ( rises . ) I will leave , now , and once more on my march . Enter Ginevra and Eliza . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it here is gold . Ginevra . Ginevra Nay , I will have none . Noise without , exit Eliza . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Take it , I know that it will do thee good , ' t is hateful to many eyes ; but those of mindful hearts know how to quell its weighty powers , and therefore speeds them good , if you take it , ' t is there for you on your hospitable board . Throws it on the table . Re-enter Eliza . Eliza . Eliza Dear mistress , on the road rides unto our door , a great array of horsemen , their bent I know not . Oh , heavens , that ' t is no harm . Looking off . Ginevra . Ginevra I know not ; and see , they dismount . Ramanzo , Ramanzo ( aside . ) I will close myself up , and carry the look of easy man , and learn their intent . Enter Two Officers , with horsemen . First Officer . First Officer Hail , to the inhabitants of this pleasant retirement . We come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the robber Ramanzo 's haunt , we hear ' t is but a short length from here . Know ye where ' t is ? Ginevea . Ginevea We know not for surety ; but have heard ' t is o'er the mountains which are within sight . First Officer . First Officer We have a rooting party with us , to hunt the villain out , ordered by the Duke of Florence , which if we find him , it will make us all glad for the weighty price that is on his head , will send us home most joyous rich . Second Officer . Second Officer That we but had the wretch , we would be rich . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Hast thou , young man , e'er seen this fellow ? Second Officer . Second Officer No ; but gladly would I. First Officer . First Officer And so would I , that I might have my portion of the gain to help my aged sponsers ; I would not set myself in trim for it , were it not for them . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First Officer And why not ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo Why ! his men I will tell you , are as blithesome as devils , they are like a bird that breaks the air with chirping in the northern clime , when summer is spread o'er it , then leaves it again when boreas starts his shrill whistle , for the genial ever warmed south . Thus , are they from point to point , never in the way of finding . First Officer . First Officer Hast thou ever seen him ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo I have . First Officer . First Officer And in reach to seize him ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo I was . First Officer . First Officer And why not have had him ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo I pitied him . First Officer . First Officer Pitied him ! Ramanzo . Ramanzo I did , for he is not the man they cry about , he is not the bloody villain which they name him ; but as capable of peace as any in this collection . First Officer . First Officer What , a captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how looks he ? that I might know whether this fellow can hold such nicely trimmed honesty . Ramanzo . Ramanzo You are not angered for my speech . First Officer . First Officer Nay , nay ; but against the villain , we hold our converse on , you say that you have seen him , and pity him . Ramanzo . Ramanzo I do ; ' t is now but a moon past since that I met the wretched fool , I knew him but by his face , I drew near and spoke him ; for awhile he seemed bent on heavy thought , at last with a body stretching sigh , he drew some words of strange muttering from his shakey body , and told me ere I asked him , that he did live unhappy , his gone life he cursed , for it had raised him a name of horror , he wished for death , and then left me weeping , such short conference was ours , and from it picked I his mind . First Officer . First Officer But where did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some miles that way Points off . First Officer . First Officer Know you his haunt ? and will you with us , and show him ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo ' T is rest I want that makes me here , and for his haunt , I know not . First Officer . First Officer Come away , my brave fellows , and after this downeast robber , we 'll have him , and then our reward . Exeunt all , but Ramanzo . Ramanzo . Ramanzo ( looking after them . ) Thus easy have I'scaped them ; but they take the road unto the cavern . Oh , Gods , what shall my doing be ? no horse have I to foot it onwards to put my wife on watchful steps ! then must they come with high water force and fell both wife and child . Ramanzo , thou art again on wretchedness ! Ah ! ( Pauses. ) a thought I hold , there is a mountain pass right near , which will bring me there as swiftly near as horse foot , which if I pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , God , ' t is strength I ask to do it , and for reward sweet duty ever after will I pay you . Exit . SCENE III .  --  The Cavern . Elvira , Julio , and Lamato discovered . Julio . Julio Beshrew me if I mean thee false , and for my crime , forgive it . Elvira . Elvira You see me now but a poor detested wretch , one that would gladly be a friend with dark death , were it not for this unfledged sapling . Pointing to her child . Julio . Julio Take not hold of melancholy thus , nor make a Niobe of thyself , for if you do it , you will bring to head strange feelings within my breast . Elvira . Elvira Bear with me , till I can take Ramanzo 's deep hold from out my breast . Julio . Julio I can hear no more , ' t is time for leave taking , dare you trust us ? Elvira . Elvira I will , take my child and heaven see the most unhallowed act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go ? Julio . Julio Lamato tells us , I know not . Lamato . Lamato To Florence , I think were best . Julio . Julio I would say no . Lamato . Lamato If you can give a dearer reason , why then must you gain it ; but if not mine must have the van . Julio . Julio I would not near it for our close ranging with this haunt ; for , the men are always on the pull for that city , when mischief makes a front against their band . Lamato . Lamato That were nothing , we buy disguises for ourselves when we have reached the place , that no eye howe'er so well knowing our forms , could pick a mark or point , whereby they might ken us ; then will it be shorter to fetch Elvira , when we have stowed what we shall take and bring her safely from the haunt ; how like you it ? Elvira retires up with child . Julio . Julio I care not , as long as time and fortune steps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the secret out upon us , and make those know it , that it is dearer to far than us . Lamato . Lamato Well , then to it , I will go make things more ready for our going , and in an instant back . Exit . Elvira , Elvira ( coming forward . ) Here are the keys that loose the treasures to you , and in them are some tokens of love givings , which look but slightly at , for I can not yield all yet ; for friendship , none have I to catch from but you , and ( looks at him reproachful . ) I 'll say no more ; but meet me at the mountain where thou saidst . Julio . Julio I will ; but methinks you look but sadly , why are you so lowly ? Elvira .

Come , arm with carbines , and fight to save ourselves from servile death , for they do show a warlike head ; guard you the door with hands of nerve , I will out and fix the men with vantage . Exit Bantio . Julio . Julio We are lost , I know not what to do . They bear down , and have bound one of our skirt men . Lamate . Lamate We are not lost , if you have a heart .

First Officer Ramanzo 's ; then she must with us as you shall , for I am bid to bring that I can find that follows this great robber . So yield , fair donna , to my men , while I go see how works the game . Exit . They take her . Bantio . Bantio Away and leave her , touch not a woman of feeble strength , make not thy hands so guilty as to harm her , take all but her . Alarums . Elvira .

Ramanzo Stay , I ask you for her enfranchisement ; men I ask again for respite , if ye do hold up for that title . First Officer . First Officer You hold strong look to a fellow we left upon the road , are you the same ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo I am . First Officer . First Officer You bear a conscience tinge most strongly . Ramanzo .

What men upon our side were lost ? Lapazo . Lapazo No more than some six or seven . Ramanzo . Ramanzo That is but light ; but poor fellows , I do pity them , and let my men be done upon their body some solemn words , for robbers may e'en be prayed for . Lapazo , Lapazo ( sees First Officer 's body . ) But what body have we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's make ; though dead . Lapazo . Lapazo But who is he ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo He is one that had secured Elvira as I entered . I bade him loose her ; but a fit ambitious , had he got within him , which made me run him unto death ; but fools you know do always live on folly . Bantio , Bantio ( without . ) Bring her in , ' t is her child 's absence that hath wrought this . Enter Bantio with Brigands , bringing in Elvira , senseless . Ramanzo . Ramanzo What is this ye bring before me ? my Elvira ! dead ! speak ? Bantio .

Ramanzo The pretty lisping cherub with its close step patting on the earth , exhaling little words , of one which was father , mother , and there she lies , gone for its loss , fools do ye bid me lean on patience when I think of this ? Go bid me run races with the shaft of outgoing eagles ' fleetness , as bid me patient , damn thee for falseheartedness . ( Goes to Elvira . ) O , Elvira , thou dost take the loss the same ; but largely apart are the effects , you with as much stir as a death struck form doth grieve for the barren sight . Lapazo . Lapazo Do you agree ? Goes to him after conversing together . Bantio . Bantio I do , and so will all , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah ! Lapazo .

Ramanzo Ah , how stilly liest thou , my Elvira ! but Ramanzo , thou hast a faint star glimmering through the vista of uncertain time , and bids me live , though but a speck , I 'll not disturn from you with despairing heart , though it hath not been done for time not known , my knee I 'll crook to thee , heaven for patience , and for mercy , which thou wilt give as thou didst unto thy usurper , life .

Gratio None , but the wind through the trees , to accompany me to morning ; but how with you , news bring you ? Bantio . Bantio None  --  what of the child , hath ought arrived of it . Gratio . Gratio No , and if there is ships hereafter will wreck in calms , Hyperion will stand on the verge of Aurora , and see Cynthia reign queen of day , heaven will loose its martyrs again on earth , and all will be contrariety ; that child deals not with life . Bantio . Bantio How know you that ? Gratio . Gratio By a peeping nature that I own : for its death I lay it not against surety , but by a mind that once upon the meve , gives place to the worst of suppositions . Bantio . Bantio You speak , Gratio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aright . Gratio . Gratio Aye , murder doth make a tongue itself , and will not let its owner rest , the sky sometimes doth give most strangely boding , and discerning eyes do guess there 's wrongly doings on earth . Bantio . Bantio And is there now ? Gratio . Gratio There is , and wert thou to live the time the olden man did breathe , thou wouldst not know . Bantio . Bantio Tell me then , that I may be partner in your wonder . Gratio . Gratio The secret lays bound within my breast , and from me must it ooze , a friend I thinkst thou to me ? and a fitter one to give publicity to the rightful fountain , could I not think than you . That child 's life doth lie upon a string of magic horror , which once touched , would give the hearer melancholy . Bantio . Bantio Ah ! Gratio . Gratio ' T is murder as thou thought . Bantio . Bantio It ' t is ? Gratio . Gratio And leans athwart a parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gratio . Gratio Elvira . Bantio , Bantio A mother , and killed she her child ? Gratio .

Gratio Speak so , but I have that which the most wary would hear to . Bantio . Bantio I would not take it unless reality did gleam . Gratio . Gratio Then hear ; I had it from herself . Bantio . Bantio Tell you of the murder ! Gratio . Gratio Yes , but in her sleep ,  --  ' t was on the cavern watch last night , I heard a sound of moaning ; by and by the sound came nearer to my ears , and by the pitch I knew ' t was Elvira 's , with slumber on her lids , these tokens caught I from her : O Julio , and Lamato , ye are false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . Then change : come , my pretty child , I will not put my power on thee for thy little heed . Ah , where art thou ? thou hast devils for thy tutors now . This is what I heard , and for thy answer what may I have ? Heavy winds with lightning and thunder . Bantio . Bantio Such a completion , ' t is very strange ; but hist , a storm comes on , we 'll to shelter , and talk o'er this . Gratio . Gratio They were not seen after the battle , if you do think . Bantio . Bantio Ah ! ' t was so . Gratio . Gratio And a lusty part she 's played . Bantio . Bantio Right lusty ; but I 'll steady with this to Ramanzo 's ear . Hark , there 's feet doth pace this ground . Ho ! there . Ramanzo , Ramanzo ( without . ) Gratio ! ' T is he , if he partakes of this unfruitful grief , be wary . Loud thunder , and rain .

Gratio He looks gloomy , and as if he had but lately from the never laughing cavern . Speak him . Bantio . Bantio What meditate you on , Ramanzo ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo On the melancholy heavens , ' t is a desert aspect now ; but ' t is sublimity , the starless heaven , and a storm , are thought to moor on , they can be shaped to the world when it hath a villain on it ; the storm is the villain , it drives the heavenly bodies from our view , and drives us from viewing them , thus , it reigns unbound , and on both sides fly they unseen ; man when he doth take the villains hide , all goodness leaves him , he stands cribbed from all good , none seek or sanction him ; but beings of his sameness . Bantio . Bantio What ! mean you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot , not so , friend Bantio . Bantio . Bantio Then away with that , and have your wits . ( aside ) For that speech of his , I 'll bring out his Elvira bluntly . Ramanzo . Ramanzo I hope I have yet my wits . Bantio . Bantio You have them not , or your child you had found . Ramanzo , Ramanzo ( starts . ) My child ! have you got it ? Bantio . Bantio No , we have it not . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Where is it then ? Bantio . Bantio We know not . Ramanzo . Ramanzo You know not ? why tell you me of it then ? you have a jest with you now , pray , dilate . Bantio . Bantio We know not ; but you might have heard from nearer heads than ours , the child 's gone . Ramanzo . Ramanzo I knew that with anguish . Bantio . Bantio And the keener cuts it , the more that you do know . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Ah ! Bantio . Bantio Yes . Ramanzo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Ramanzo Hell , what tell you ? Bantio . Bantio A truth ! Lie I , Gratio ? Gratio . Gratio ' T is truer than the sun 's heat . Ramanzo . Ramanzo ( in great agitation . ) I do fear the question . May I ask who  --  who is my kindred ? Bantio &; Gratio . Bantio , Gratio Elvira ! Ramanzo . Ramanzo The blue fires of hell ! Elvira ! Bantio . Bantio Yes , Elvira , she . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Damn fabula , have ye courted hell 's thieves ? my Elvira , where ? your words doth say the word ! stamped liars , how face ye me with that ? Bantio . Bantio ' T is truth , and we have proof uncovered . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Have ye no weapons hell to grant me to strike them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

Bantio We will not , till our reasoning you have heard ; and for your weapon it shall not stir . Ramanzo . Ramanzo I think ye hold to me ? and prate damnation to my ears ? away loose grappling . ( he frees himself . ) I am free , free . Now bend your knees to prayer . Bantio . Bantio Our prayers are not so ready as our weapons for defence ; ( they draw ) and I will speak to thee , and listen you . Ramanzo . Ramanzo To hear you call her whore again ? the quick flash doth peer through the dingy gloom , and shews me glaring goblins arising from their holes , and standing to hear ye call her harlot , I will at ye , and burst in howling hell if I do lag . He rushes , but stops in a phrenzied posture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes not at us ? Bantio . Bantio His knife down , and how he glares , what hath seized him ? Gratio . Gratio Passion , I think doth hold him . The brittle reason doth branch from man , when passion hath a reign , so have I heard it said ; take his knife and see if it moves him . Bantio takes up the knife . Bantio . Bantio He stirs not at that . Gratio . Gratio What shall we do ? Bantio . Bantio He will reach himself again , and of Elvira shall he hear , for that speech touched with insult . Gratio . Gratio O , forget and let us away with him for the storm runs on . Bantio . Bantio But see , moves he . Gratio . Gratio Yes , and slowly , as they all do when so taken . Bantio . Bantio I will hold his dagger that he may not see it ; you call him , unarmed now he is and a prey to our enforcements . Gratio . Gratio Ramanzo , hear you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gratio No more of that , but hear the words which if you despise , my life have you , ' t was on the last night 's cavern watch , I heard Elvira speaking , I took convenient stand , when these words I heard : O Julio , and Lamato , ye are false , and no more will ye let me see my child . Then with playful voice she would utter , come my pretty child , I will not put my power on thee for thy little heed  --  come , ah , where are you now ? thou hast devils for thy tutors now . This I heard and more , but to this I stood attent and learnt . Ramanzo . Ramanzo O broad heavens is it true ? O misery have you a name ? no . Thy pains are legions ; and is it true ? O god , Elvira , my wife , ' t is bearing O too hard . ( weeps . ) Heavy thunder . Gratio . Gratio The storm comes on , let 's away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , and if she does , then have you proof . Ramanzo . Ramanzo And if she speaks it  --  O I love her yet  --  I could rend her apart . I have a name now that hell did make  --  a cuckold . Pardon Gratio , and Bantio , me , for my passion to ye  --  I will to my desolate hole , and there note her  --  I will not doubt ye , O Elvira , my wife , my wife . Exit . Bantio . Bantio Alas , I must yield him pity : Gratio . Gratio Let us go and encave , and we will by the morning learn the end . Exeunt . SCENE II .  --  The Cavern  --  Elvira asleep . Enter Ramanzo ,  --  goes to her . Ramanzo . Ramanzo So false I could not think it ; she sleeps , now , and looks so baby innocent that I can not believe it .

Ah , my little cherub , now you look happy , come hither , we will part no more ; but Ramanzo comes , I think , yes , we will to cover while he passes , my pretty one nestle thyself to warmth . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Elvira , cease , enough , ' t is true . O , devil ! ( she wakes and sees him , shrieks and faints . ) Great heaven , awake , and send me anodyne , I want it .

( goes to her . ) Ah , what a cast have you upon your visage , ' t is a feeling that I have about me , and would call itself myself , ' t is pity for thy step . O , Elvira , to allow thyself to swelter in unsightly heat , O , infamous . ( she revives . ) But arise , I 'll not curse thee though it were oathable ; ( she weeps. ) thou art gone now . Why didst thou do it ? I should die , now , for why should I stay creeping here when others creep more cleanly ? a wall I stand now to receive , and hold a line of scoffs and slurs , damn epithets of rankness ; among the heap cuckold holds his station , and makes me a stranger to the earth , a place my feet doth want to hold me on ; O , Ramanzo , go make thyself a hasty hole and there bestow thyself no more to breathe . Elvira . Elvira My life take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own  --  my heart doth shake at , and thine ' t is o ' ermuch . Elvira . Elvira Culpable I am ; but not so foul but what others are more rank .

Elvira I am bound by horrid oath , not to unlatch the story of my pains , and silence must I farther till my end . Ramanzo . Ramanzo What , hath wrong been done you , and an unrevealing oath been set upon thee . Elvira . Elvira I am bound . Heavy storm . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Does my thought strike it ? was it not wished by thee ? ( moves her in consent. ) and done by them that 's fled ? ( she signs . ) Damn wretches , why not have spoke it to me ? Elvira . Elvira I dared not . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Infernal bastards , take away the joy of mother , but stay , what do my curses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a Jove to ride on nothing and fell millions at a move . It stops my tongue and makes me ponder , to work so horridly awry  --  O Elvira , after thy downfall to carry such a falsely cover , doth take the pity off thy wrongs and sets a cloud of shame wreathed with frowns and curses o'er thy head . I will no more , the beaded rain and screeching wind now bite for conquest ; I will go and see the issue , it may perhaps take out the sharp entangled string that hath my heart untwisted . Ramanzo , thou art the motley jeck , a thing that all doth show his wit most gaudy on . exit . Elvira . Elvira He will not see me now , I have but from off that kind tree , the branch that keeps him in with life ; ought I to live and see him agonized by me ? O , blasted , no.

Then to pull that ladder from under him , when he doth play her rightly , pains not yet felt ought she to feel . Ramanzo , diet foully hast thou been fed upon , and for mitigation I am for death , the world adieu , my child , I no more will see thee ; Ramanzo , I can not hear thy breath more , we both are wronged , adieu , I will not stop to ache thee . exit .

Bantio . Bantio ' T is so ; but the cold wind it keeps not out , and from us takes almost our thoughts ; ' t is now a picture for Ramanzo . Gratio . Gratio Sarcastic wit on falling man , ought from every breast suffer evomition ; if he had given me wrongs , sufficient to engage a herald to cry us to a combat , I after his great fall , would erase and rub it , sans a meeting .

Bantio Nay , for he comes , stay , he will here . Gratio . Gratio I will halloo him . Enter Ramanzo , very dirty . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Yield black hell from thy foul womb , a line of devils to rake this quelling earth , the roaring God now works , and the watery goddess , unseen , throws out their howls of wind and brine , to stop me from Elvira .

Black king of murder , send this wet and fiery storm to their rotten race , give them no minutes for remorse , their eyes no closing , their hands if they do use them to tear them out ; their food their mothers ' hearts trimmed with their offsprings ' entrails ; and for scenes to relish them in their bloody works , their own hearts in feast for the sharp bill birds , and they with feelings to see it .

Bantio And no other place have you been . Ramanzo . Ramanzo I have been to other worlds , where murder is a living .

Lamato Come Julio , here is a goodly board , feast from there is wine from the grape , that torpid age would gamed for and afterwards lecher . The banished nymph of aven , ne'er took a cup unto her lusty lord , more fine than this . Here 's thy health , like you it not ? or no stomach have you ? Julio . Julio I have , and disperse as much could I as you , but now think it not fit . Lamato , Lamato ( fills and sings . ) My cup shall have it to the brim , And cheefully I 'll pledge it unto him , That drinks and calls himself a jolly fellow , And is not shamed to be right mellow . Come , will you at it now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditating . Lamato . Lamato Come , be merry o'er the dinner , and for digestion then call melancholy . Julio .

Julio . Julio No , I have a heart that ne'er forgets . As our arrival to the city has fallen with success , I will part the unlawful pelf , and each take ways as we may like . Lamato . Lamato Part the money ? and each leave ? Julio . Julio Yes , the money . Lamato . Lamato You get no money . Julio . Julio What ! none ? Lamato . Lamato No , for Mammon I love him , and I will pin him tightly to me ; why should not I run through a change ? a poor devil that has always run with thieves ! till time has cut my black hair for white ones ; ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me : and wondrous simple must I be to let her slip .

Lamato Boy , you shall have money to clear you away from Florence , but no more . Julio . Julio Damned old villain , I will have more , I am a robber now , and have learnt crimes , and care not . Come , draw , you are a murderer of deliberation . Lamato . Lamato So was Brutus . Landlord looks in at the door . Julio .

Lapazo Yes , didst thou ever see a finer youth ? his hand like a belle of the fancy room , who makes man humble his form . Rato . Rato He hath a rare make , but no money , for one by his looks would think him loaded . He must have been a rich man 's make . Lapazo . Lapazo ' T is not them that lie on favoured beds , or walk the burnished pave , that court the halls of light , and walk with ignorance o'er the down trod genius of lesser scale ; for these oft beget a crooked shape offspring made sometimes of hellish mind , that hot Ate could not bear it always , but cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you must look for form .

Bantio And love for the wretch .

Lapazo , Lapazo ( comes forward . ) Hounds most fithy , and is it so , Bantio ? Bantio . Bantio What ? Lapazo . Lapazo That of Ramanzo , which Gratio speaks ? Bantio . Bantio It is , he is now a maniac , a man that questions and finds answers in himself ; he speaks the world most closely , ' t is the loss that hath so made him . Lapazo . Lapazo Is he furious ? Bantio . Bantio No he is as the bleating mother of the simple lamb who trouble 's none when that her lambkin is gone ; but with beating heart goes o'er the plain grieving to leanness ; so is he . But come , let us homeward , and we will see him , and give to care this fair being if life holds her . Going . Ramanzo without , laughing . Bantio . Bantio Hither he comes ; but speak him not , and let us all withdraw . They all go up the stage . Enter Ramanzo , laughing , in strange attire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha , ' t is laughable , when the great king kicked the black devil from heaven , and he passed earth how it must have trembled . I should e'en have laughed myself to sickness , to have seen it , to see such ambition kicked to nothingness ; he did imagine that he were greater than he that came before him . O , imagination , were , or who can compass you ? none , make but a mould figure and give it imagination , and where stops it ? not within the earth 's circle , he sees himself within his thoughts , a man of strength , he strikes down giants by the legion though each armed with pikes outnumbering IIydra 's mouths , let him think of revenge , the king within walls amidst his flocks of guards , ' t were simple to bar him out , he cleaves him i'the midst them . He scours the welkin 's womb , the stately spread wing 'd bird can not overtake him . Hyperion damns he for his light , and for not suiting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kick him from his station ; so boundless is thy imagination . O , clay man ! I must to the feast ; but this is a shaggy dress to ride in ; but where is my horse ? O , there he is feeding ; come my pretty black , kneel to take me , damn thee , dost run from thy master ? go , I 'll walk , ' t is so , man and beast are the same Cover them from the shattering tempest of ill , and they 'll bite ye for so hovering o'er them . Come  --  for Jupiter . ( seeing them . ) What are ye there ? damn thieves ? but come , I want an honest man . ( To Lapazo . ) Ye have the make of one , come hither ; let 's see thy hand , damn that hand , away with it . Lapazo . Lapazo What , is it not a good hand ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo ' T is a good make ; but it hath not the honest man 's sign , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , begone , thou art a thief . ( looks at his own hand . ) But stay , I have not it myself , and why find I fault with you ? that is devil 's way , I crave pardon , great thief , we are all thieves from our first move . The making of us is stolen , we would as soon writhe in lechery 's grasp seen , as to tear our hearts for pleasure , therefore , how can we be honest ? but I will tell you , and if honesty can reign through man when he passes the way of life , he is not man , but a god . First , the little dainty robber with its toothless gums , robbing the mother of its strength ; then the arch eyed boy with his sly and stealthy step , creeping to the candied dish ; then the youth robbing his master , to deck the false wanton that hath burnt his honour ; then the master cutting and consigning from his neighbor dues : then the mammon loving ruler , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him making justice , and filching poverty of the air , that God hath granted . The next is the old grey headed hypocrite , with his white eyed orison 's droping from his mouth like oil ; set fire to the words and pierce them with an eye of scrutiny ; and there you will see thievishness and lust ; the last great robber of all is death , he robs us of our all , and takes us from our pelf , we know not wither in his pack of oblivion . There you have it , and from it chew mankind . Come , wilt thou with me ? I go to charm the Gods ; but see , there is a devil to hurt our hearts , your crutch to strike him from the earth . ( snatches his gun . ) Man drew breath for liberty , he is a tyrant , we 'll not be bondmen , come bring on your guards . Exit . Bantio . Bantio You now see him , Lapazo . Lapazo . Lapazo I do ; it makes me droop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuked the common faults of man ; but passed them o'er with gentle chiding . He has fallen mighty low , e'en almost to the brute . O , that he were the same mild man . Lapazo . Lapazo And I too ; but gone he is , and we can not fetch him . Gratio . Gratio I think there is a way . Bantio . Bantio How ? Gratio . Gratio I have heard that madmen in their gloomy cells , have reached to man again , when over them they have had a favoured master ; and so might Ramanzo , if he were used the same . Bantio . Bantio Then he shall be ; come , men , let us home , and we will do all good , to bring Ramanzo from this wretched mood . Exeunt . END OF ACT IV . ACT V. SCENE I.  --  A Landscape . Enter Duke , Officers , Soldiers , with Julio and Lamato , Music . Duke . Duke of Florence Halt ! ( without , " Halt ! " ) We , by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robber 's haunt ; therefore , silence those pipes that breaks the air 's peace and leaders of war , for they will send the enemy sound of approach , which we must do stilly . First Officer . First Officer Great Duke , you must , for I know that ; for when we made a former head against them , it seemed but as a noiseless place ; but afore our thoughts were turned for it ; we were in one another 's ranks right thickly ; hilt and hilt the game , and death the stakes ; and by chance , I saved myself from the sacrifice . Duke . Duke of Florence We go now armed with strong lots , and if the heavens do wish for good to reign ; they will arm us impregnable . First Officer . First Officer But yet , ' t is not fit to grace thine honour with such a suit as this ; to do the work of meaner creatures , for we should bring this robber to thy presence for the law 's disposal . Not make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge . Duke . Duke of Florence Fear not my person , ' t was my wish to see this robber in station , and I will see him . ' T is said that he is gloomy , and with a fiend wrenching him to horrid thoughts and sights , which they call conscience . First Officer . First Officer Pish , for his conscience , I would not have boot a tiger ' gainst his conscience , were he to meet me lonely . To Lamato . Duke . Duke of Florence Hath he his conscience so worn as you do say ? hates his band ? Lamato . Lamato He has it worn . First Officer . First Officer He showed it not when we met him , for he played the man of honour , and as if he struck for liberty , so wildly fought he . Lamato . Lamato You need not think upon it for a truth ; but for a tale his wife heard from him , would start the sickly bound man from off his flock , though he lay half in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other sounds ; but this would glare him , nothing excepting . Duke . Duke of Florence What was it ? Lamato . Lamato Though I do lead against him , yet I will speak it . His wife loved he right honourable ; and child ne'er knew its father 's life ; but like the holy minded man , he taught it heavenly , for though a man that split your laws with rapine , he yet did hold a heart , that o'errack it as you would , nature yet had he . His wife did hold him to it , for she did love sorely , and could not fill his absence . One morn , I saw him agonized , his gone life he cursed , and to his wife he said , that he would leap for renovation , and so left her seeking another habitation ; were he got it I know not , for in the interim I left . Duke . Duke of Florence Has he laws within his band ? Lamato . Lamato He has . Duke . Duke of Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamato No ; he would sooner let a wronger scape if not wronged deeply than hurt him with revenge . ( aside ) I know not how my wrong may be taken . Duke . Duke of Florence And pray what are some of his laws ? Lamato . Lamato Why , the first was to rob a man learning towards gentility . Duke . Duke of Florence And prythee , how was that ? Lamato . Lamato Why , carbine in hand , voice severe , bidding them stand , your money or your length upon the ground . Duke . Duke of Florence And that was genteel ; severe gentility . How done ye when numbers met ye ? Lamato . Lamato The same , though larger in our party , and coolly done we it . Duke . Duke of Florence Aye , most coolly : for well the records I keep do show it . There is not a page but where your work doth show ; but fear not , you have my word of mercy . Come , let us follow once more our stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCENE II .  --  The Forest . Enter Ramanzo , Bantio , Gratio , and Others . Bantio . Bantio Ramanzo , throw off your sickly thoughts and look rightly happy once more ; forget what 's done , and we 'll no more speak of your ills or weakness , as thou hast thyself regained . Gratio . Gratio Take it from him , Ramanzo , and we 'll sleep o'er all thoughts of ill towards thee if thou sayst so , for quiet will stay thy mind . Ramanzo . Ramanzo I have done , I care not what is done . Bantio . Bantio Hold up yet , you are not down so far but what you can : didst thou ever feel ? or see me play the several faced man ? have not I with sponsor 's love forever looked upon you ? thy Elvira , child , when I have seen thee overdone with pain , have not I raised them from falling in with you the same mind corresponding ? and rubbed them into merriment ? I was the candy on which you dieted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp words from you , and to be laughed at . To others , I was the man that I was born , ever nice with words that were not nicely spoken , for out of them however good a fault I 'd have , but you had a pass from my scruting and went unlashed . Ramanzo . Ramanzo And what am I now ? and avails it what ? nothing ! I am now like the surge driven fish that is cast to worms , to birds , or to filthy man , in latitude most hard unknown ; that forget , or will not know the sportive turns he 's had , but pick him dead unfeeling . I stand like the towering latched vane , catching and turning with every sour wind coming from diverging man ; I must hold it all unsown with breath , for I am one of the world 's bastards that must take all . Gratio talks with Brigands and Exeunt . Bantio . Bantio No , thy enemies are gone , and none are left but friends and them that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I will be a captain more ? nay , nay , it made me a sporting maniac you have said , that knew no other words but random sounds , that hung to life and man only by shape ; no words to utter but what simplicity would weep at , the earth and all one mass so fixed , that promontorys however well known in reason distinguish could I not when the fit reigned o'er me , for man to stop at horrible abyss . Bantio . Bantio The attire of Brigands is not for you , Ramanzo , your spirit is opposite , thou art too mild . Ramanzo . Ramanzo O , Bantio , you have strung your voice to a tune that is sad and mournful to the car ; I was not formed for robbing : the lips that hung upon my mother and kissed me to my bed when I was a tiny height , could she have thought when our breath entwined , that I was to be a robber . O , Bantio , you have struck her length within my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet and godlike chord till it hath broke to discord on thine cars , take from me revenge . Ramanzo . Ramanzo No , Bantio , no , I am a foolish thing , ' T is thoughts of her that makes me eling to the image of man . O , she was heavenly , her tongue to me was sweeter than lisping cherubs ; and then so kind : when I nestled in her for refuge from ruder hands , from her eyes sprang words , back hounds touch not my offspring ; one could have read it , and when I bent for grace to him that gave me her , O , then she was another mother . Her eyes of vestal cast turned on me to hear my bless her idol , would raise my little heart as if ! spoke in Elysium , the room floated with Cherubim , but one i'the midst , sparkling all the rest to darkness , goddess queen of all  --  O , ' t was my mother . Bantio . Bantio Curse me , Ramanzo , and heartfelt will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ramanzo When I stepped higher in life she was my quadrant . her eye lost not its watch for me , but brought me level with all ; my heart though so kindly watched could not wind always in one turn , but took another . Elvira rode not on such golden waves as I did , but on a less bright course ; but yet she had an honest heart and beat as high favored ones , she met not my father 's eye , and therefor cast he me . She is lost now , and the boon of our honorable flame gone too , all , all sped . Bantio . Bantio But come , Ramanzo , let 's walk and give despondency the kick for we 'll be merry . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Not so , no more merry am I ; all is gone but life , and what is that ? nought ; no more than the airy gossamer that lives upon Hyperion 's heat , and will not hold the downy trappings of the dove ; but yet thou life art mighty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when heaven makes us friends , honor that roomy sound though nought , placed on tower height we grapple at thy thorny head unknown to hurts , to have a look and cheer from friends . The war 's that rank us with the dust , and set hovering o'er us decrepitude , e'er we sup of wisdom 's age merely for a friend 's approval . ' T is this that makes man love life , expunge these friends , and then how blank lone man doth creep this rise and falling life , as wretches writhe on torture . I am this lonely picture , and none to pick me from the wreck I am . Re-enter Gratio . Bantio . Bantio Give philosophers this reasoning that live on ink and paper , and let us to the cavern . What want you , the same , Gratio ? Gratio . Gratio I do , for my heart is low , it beats for alteration . Bantio . Bantio Come , Ramanzo , time is not one point always , it hath many impressions , and it stamps man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know , then let us cheer , come . Ramanzo . Ramanzo On then , I will not damp ye if revenge would let a scope for me , life should go , and no more would I be a let to ye , come , then , we 'll home . Exeunt . SCENE III .  --  Another part of the Forest . Enter Duke , and the rest . Duke . Duke of Florence ( pointing off . ) That ? Lamato . Lamato Yes , that mountain at its foot on the farther side , lies his home . Duke . Duke of Florence How oft hath my sight run o'er these hills ? and yet no look upon Ramanzo have I had . I have met men here , yet no token of robbers had they , all seemed like a peace trod ground . Lamato . Lamato Nor never would see any ; and for your grace we knew you , and therefore carried we the face hypocritical . Duke . Duke of Florence How knew you me ? Lamato . Lamato Your person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great feasts . Duke . Duke of Florence How saw me they there ? where none but friends and honesty came ? Lamato . Lamato When fame 's favourites give entertainments unto friends , they are not numbered , and from their lighted boards they know not who quaffs the villain in the courtly dress , sip words of honour from his fair guests , and oft do bring them unto dotestation . Some of Ramanzo 's band have stepped musically through your well figured house , times two or three . Duke . Duke of Florence When did they this ? Lamato . Lamato At thy child 's birth , ' T was then they last entered , and lively they talked of it . Duke . Duke of Florence The rascals , they may well talk it merrily , for it my eye had known them , they had not ' scaped . Lamato . Lamato I doubt it not . Duke . Duke of Florence Did Ramanzo ever partake of the same ? Lamato . Lamato No , he was too much for home ; but see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enter Soldier . Duke . Duke of Florence Have you found these follows ? and what news bring you of them ? Soldier . Soldier That mountain that stops our eyes from farther view , I walked , and neared its head with caution ; from its summit I there saw some large body of robbers , with merriment before them , I looked not long ; but came in haste to tell you that we by their situation may run a making game . Duke . Duke of Florence How many , think you ? Soldier . Soldier Their number stood near sixty . Duke . Duke of Florence Doth his complement stand at that ? Lamato . Lamato More he has ; but perhaps are dispersed . Duke . Duke of Florence But ' T is near his number ? Lamato . Lamato ' T is very near it . Duke . Duke of Florence Come , then , my friends with stirring hearts , unto the resue of our laws , the enemy are steeped in lassitude , and easier will the battle be that we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , at them with lion hearts for commanding heaven tells us , on , on ! Exeunt . SCENE IV .  --  The Cavern , with the entrance in the rear . Enter Ramanzo , Bantio , and Gratio . Bantio . Bantio Come , Ramanzo , you are not in state to follow for revenge , his sister 's exit too , will season a little I should think . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Poor fool , to follow such a reptile ; him , and that grey thief that 's fled . The world ne'er grew food for such a brace ; singe , and blast for me such lepors , great devil , and I will be thy servant most unique . Bantio . Bantio Well , Ramanzo , rush aside the gloom that is fixed upon you , and all may ride well , come , Gratio , let us unto Lapazo , and we will shortly back . Going . Enter a Brigand with an Old Monk . Gratio . Gratio But who is this ? Brigand . Brigand An old man creeping homeward , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set him down and by the door stand you guard . Let us begone . Exit Bantio and Gratio . Brigand mounts guard . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Old man , you look holy by thy dress ? no daggers under ? to strike the captain of these robbers dead ? formed by plot ? you know me ? Monk . Monk I do , your man there has told me ; but daggers have I none , my cloth speaks my heart . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Thy words I think I may accept ; you have no villan 's cast ; but sit old man and take this cheer . ( gives him wine . ) You may vacate your post , no harm is here . To Brigand who leaves . Monk . Monk You are the brigand chief . Ramanzo . Ramanzo I am ; and lazily I fill the name . Monk . Monk I should think not , for thy exploits are loudly cried . Ramanzo . Ramanzo They are , and I would they were not . Monk . Monk In Rome , Florence , aye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have your name , even in hamlets hedged around . Ramanzo . Ramanzo And thought they of the man that they did utter , encompassed cowardice , they would no more think on him . Monk . Monk Cowardice ! nay , I have heard it said , that thy whole band would tremble for thee . Ramanzo . Ramanzo ' T is not for fear then , perhaps ' T is pity for my simple heart . Monk . Monk You seem melancholy ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo I am , and tired of my life . Your cloistered station I would fill , rather than my noised infamous life . Monk , Monk ( offers him a bible . ) Take you this little book , and it will give you balmy rest . ' T is my friend through all things , it feeds and gives courage . Ramanzo . Ramanzo ' T is not for me , ' T is for the happy ; I am a creeping monster , the tenants of the air , and the ground furrowing beasts would expand at it more than I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ' T is the pass that makes man step cheerly into oblivion . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Friend , away with it , for it would not cleave me to its perusal , nay , for a glance . Monk . Monk If you take it not , then have its counsel . For it says here , that all shall have an easy leave taking , that hears it . Ramanzo . Ramanzo No more , no more , ' T is useless . Monk . Monk Nay , but here , the guilty murderer will have it easy too . Ramanzo . Ramanzo I tell thee friend no more ; it doth lance me . Monk . Monk The adultress with true heart repenting , sins freely , the villain parricide if with repentance is struck . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Stay , you murder me . Monk . Monk His crime is swept over . Ramanzo . Ramanzo ( seizes him . ) Old wretch , what mean you you place a string of horrid crimes to thread my heart , and tear it as they pass , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a murderer , a robber , and near a parricide : eagles flight to hell I 'll send thee for thus tearing me , why send ye heavens such a runner , to torture me with damning thoughts ? hell blaze livelier for I must go to ye , and ligh me from this damned earth , Enter Bantio , in haste . Bantio . Bantio Ramanzo , the duke of Florence , with a sturdy lot of men , have got Lapazo in close fight , and lays them fastly , come , haste you as a leader , and head them in the fight , or we shall bid light farewell , shortly . Ramanzo . Ramanzo What care I for the fight , ' T is nought to me , the world is nothing , it hath given me nothing ; and for it I 'll not fight . What , fight for nothing ? Go make a Cesar of thyself , and fight for nothing ? he fought till he got hard death for his reward , you go do the counterpart . Bantio . Bantio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ? ( alarums . ) Hear their cries , will you come ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo Nay , as I said afore . Bantio . Bantio Have you reason , Ramanzo ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo ' T is my reason speaks , what fight to kill more men ? a surplus of that work I have had . Bantio . Bantio What damn conscience , again ? for ever at it , time tells me haste , or you would pain at this turning . Exit . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Out leporous bastard , go fight with bastards , your weapons to fight with , one another 's bones , and lights to see your work , devil 's eyes with claws ready as you fall , to hurl ye to their pit . ( to Monk . ) Old fiend , are ye here yet ? Out with thee , or I will suffice me with thy death .

Enter Duke and Soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunt at last , and in it but one companion of these robbers . Seize him . They take him . Ramanzo . Ramanzo And in him , you seize Ramanzo . Duke . Duke of Florence Thanks for thy captivity . Soldiers rejoice at it , and wind the trumpets fully . ( a flourish . ) Ramanzo at a brave man 's fall , cruelty would it be to make this sound ; but for you , you must bear it , and no mitigation . Bring forth the cords that put him into bondage . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Stay , I will , nor can not harm thee . You have me tightly great Duke . Duke . Duke of Florence Stay your cords , for a moment , I would hear him utter . Ramanzo for your life what can you say ? nought . Say for years it would end in nought , for thy time so hellish hath been passed , that all the words that earth doth use , would ne'er find for thee forgiveness . Ramanzo . Ramanzo I am so placed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or go , I am not yet cast out of the words that are heaped around those that are termed fit for pity ; but as pitable as any . Duke . Duke of Florence For thy crimes you then want pity ? Ramanzo . Ramanzo Nay , they are for damnation . Duke . Duke of Florence For your band 's brave fighting , then ? for their strokes were loyal for you ; but by our strong body we laid them . What are thy wrongs but this ? that you are now within the equal scale , to have thy crimes for weights against thee to weigh you out of life and end thy butchering Ramanzo . Ramanzo Rail on , for I must call it so , though a beast But yet , think you not , my life was always of this bent , to lead robbers on the simple , to take the unearned money with my hands by force , and scatter eruption , for know that heaven within my reach , did set a goodly tree beset with deep loved riches ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Duke of Florence And well you have turned them . Ramanzo . Ramanzo ' T is so . Duke . Duke of Florence Pity would have a strange goddess , if she reigned o'er thee .

Duke of Florence I will not stay you from it . Ramanzo . Ramanzo What , old Bantio , speak with me ? come , at me with your threat . Bantio . Bantio O , Ramanzo , we are no more now , the words were hot , I knows : but forget , I grow faint ; Ramanzo , I love thee , and wish thee a better end . I grow faint , I feel more dead  --  farewell  --  far  --  Dies .

My grief , excuse it , take me from this den , and do the laws worst . Duke . Duke of Florence Stay , Ramanzo , I have two leaders that brought me to your haunt , and see , they greet us in form . Enter Officer , with Julio and Lamato . Ramanzo . Ramanzo Whence came ye , murderers ? eagle clawed devils , I have ye now .
