txt Mv DEAR FRIEND : - You request me to communicate to you , for publication , my views upon the question of th' Annexation of Texas . I cheerfully comply with this request , although I can hardly hope that I shall be able to throw any new light upon the subject , after the long and careful discussion which it has already undergone . It is one upon which , at first blush , it would hardly he supposed that there could be two opinions ; nor would there , probably , have been much division* of sentiment about it , had it not been arbitrarily connected with party controversies growing out of other questions . The political advantages of the acquisition of this territory are , in fact , too obvious to escape the attention of any one . A vast region , including from three to four hundred thousand square miles of the most productive land in the world-enjoying a delightful climatecommunicating by a number of noble rivers and by a long line of coast with our great Western Mediterraneancontiguous to our territory-peopled in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallant Southern and Western chivalry-that such a domain , so situated , should be regarded by all as a most desirable acquisition , seems to be a matter of course . It was , in fact , so regarded by all until very recently . Even now the opponents of the annexation-with perhaps some unimportant individual or sectional exceptions-acknowledge the immense advantages that would result from this measure , and are only prevented from giving it their support by conscientious difficulties which operate upon their minds as objections . That scruples of this kind-assuming , as in courtesy and charity we are hound to do , that they are entirely sincere , should have been permitted to obstruct , perhaps defeat for ever , a " consummation so devoutly to be wished , " is an occurrence which , ua4er one of its aspects , does great honor to the national character . Individually , no one can be more strongly disposed than myself to treat the conscientious scruples of every one with the highest respect . I must say , however , that on the most careful consideration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind appear to me to be entirely superfluous . The objections which have been chiefly urged are  --  the want of constitutional power in the government to make the acquisition ; respect for the supposed rights of Mexico ; and the bearing of the measure upon the great and difficult question of slavery . I will make a few remarks upon each of these topics ; enlarging chiefly upon the last , which has perhaps been somewhat less satisfactorily treated than the others . A supposed want of constitutional power in the government is a favorite ground of opposition to almost every measure that is thought on other accounts to beobjectionable ; for the obvious reason that , if made out , it is peremptory and decisive . But I recollect no instance , in which , as it seems to me , it has been urged with less plausibility than the present one . The authority to admit new states into the Union is not a constructive or doubtful power , but is given in direct and unqualified terms by the letter of the Constitution- " New states may he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualifications are added in regard to the formation of new states out of territory already organized in this way ; but , as they have no bearing upon the general clause , they leave it , excepting in this respect , entirely unencumbered by any qualification or restriction whatever . So far as constitutional power is concerned , Congress have as perfect a right to admit Great Britain , France or China into the Union , as Wisconsin , Florida or Iowa . If it be suggested that the framers of the Constitution could not possibly have intended to confer on Congress so large a discretion , ana that it * probably their design to restrict the powers in qnestioa to states formed ou // qwq those which are imposed by considerations of mere physical convenience that it might be carried over the whole globe , if it were convenient for deputies from every part of the globe to assemble regularly at any one point for the despatch of public business . The limits assigned by physical convenience to the ultimate extent of our own confederacy seem to be those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very little doubt that it will at some future period occupy the whole territory from the Isthmus of Darien to the northern ocean . While the patriotic citizen can have no motive for wishing to precipitate this result in any of its parts , so he can have none for wishing to prevent or delay it , wherever circumstances naturally concur to bring it about , from any apprehension of danger connected with the extension of our territory . The annexation of Texas is a measure to which our country has been brought , with very little effortperhaps we may rather say , with a sort of coy reluctance on our part ,  --  by the force of causes in a great measure beyond our control . Whatever may be the ultimate fate of the treaty lately rejected by the Senate , no human power can prevent this measure from being carried into effect within a very few years . This being the ease , it must be apparent to every one that the sooner it is consummated , the better it will be for all the parties concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitution , and not inexpedient , merely as an extension of territory , it is next urged , that we can not assent to it consistently with our friendly relations to Mexico . This is the objection which has been most strongly insisted on , and which probably occasioned the rejection of the treaty by the Senate , so far as that result was founded in considerations growing directly out of the merits of the case . Whatever may be the true value of this argument , impartially viewed , it is certainly honorable to the character of the country , that so much delicacy should have been exhibited in regard to the pretensions of a foreign power , from which we have so little , under any circumstances , to apprehend . The objection presents itself under two different aspects , upon each of which I will make a few remarks . The territory of Texas , as described in the political constitution of that Repnblic , includes , we are told , an extensive region which has never been brought under the jurisdiction of the Texian government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession of Mexico . The annexation of Texas , as provided for in the Treaty , if carried into effect by force , would amount , it is said , to the seizure of whole provinces , perchance two or three states , including the city of Santa F* , which are not only claimed , but actually and rightfully held by the Mexican government . This point has been pressed very earnestly in several quarters , and particularly by Col. Benton , in his able speeches in the Senate upon the ratification of the Treaty . If it could be supposed to have been the intention of the Government of the United States , in making the Treaty , to obtain possession of any territory actually belonging to and in possession of Mexico , the objection would , no doubt , be entitled to great consideration , so far as it could be applied , which would obviously be only to the part of Texas so situated . On this supposition the true way of averting the difficulty would have been , to ratify the Treaty with an express definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory annexed should not be understood to include any region not actually in possession of Texas . A conditional ratification of this kind might , perhaps , under all the circumstances , have been preferable to an unconditional one . It is1 however , apparent , on the face of the whole question , that the Government of the United States have no intention to encroach on the actual jurisdiction of Mexico . It is expressly stated , on our side of the correspondence , that the western boundary is to be settled by an amicable arrangement with the Mexican Government , and in a spirit of the most liberal consideration for any wellfounded pretensions on her side . Considered under this aspect , the objection seems to be entirely destitute of any substantial basis . In its application to the territory actually in possession of Texas , it rests on different grounds , and may be thought , at first view , to wear a rather more serious character , but will be found , in reality , whether tested by the rules and usages constituting what is commonly called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of substantial justice , to be of very little importance . It is quite true that we have no right or pretension to interfere in the internal concerns of other independent nations-to decide , for example , in this particular case , whether Texas was right in declaring independence , or whether Mexico is right in seeking to deprive her of it ; but it is not true , that in dealing with Texas as an independent nation in any way that the law of nations may authorize , without regard to the bearing which our acts may have upon the interests of Mexico , we make any such pretension . In acknowledging the independence of Texas , we did not undertake to say which of the two parties to the previously existing war was in the right , or to interfere in any way in the internal concerns of the Mexican Republic . We considered the independence of Texas an established fact ; and , this being assumed , we knew that we were authorized by the law of natiens to deal with her , in every respect , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our intention to do so was announced to the world in the usual way , by the appointment of a diplomatic agent to reside at the seat of the Government . Then , if ever , was the time for Mexico to take exception to our policy . None was taken , nor could have been taken with a shadow of plausibility . The Mexican Government , as embodied in the person of her President , who has been substantially for many years past , like Louis the Fourteenth of France , " himself the State , " had already acknowledged the independence of Texas , tinder circumstances which rendered the acknowledgment binding , in the strictest manner , not only upon his official responsibility , but upon his personal honor as a man , and which released the United States from every appearance of obligation to respect any claims that Mexico might make upon the territory in question . But laying out of the case for the present the previous acknowledgment by Santa Ana , and looking at the question merely under its general aspect , we had announced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent nation ,  --  that we had a right , were bound in duty , and were determined , in fact , to deal with her as such . Mexico took no exception . The great powers of Europe followed our example . It may , therefore , be assumed that we were thus far in the right . Texas is7 in fact , as we have announced it to be , an independent State . What follows * Obviously , that we are authorized to deal with Texas , by word and deed , as an independent State , according to the usual rules of international intercourse7 without regard to the bearing which our proceedings may have upon the pretensions of Mexico . In acting upon this principle , we do not undertake to decide whether these pretensions were originally well or ill founded . We give no opinion upon the merits of the question once at issue between the parties . We merely act upon the privilege assumed in our previous acknowledgment of the independence of Texas , that this question has been settled ,  --  that the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn in that high court of destiny from whose decision there lies no appeal , and has there been adjudged . We give no opinion upon the justice of the sentence . We only assume that it is binding upon us and all other nations , including-whether she choose to acknowledge it or notMexico . Now the law of nations and substantial justice , as generally understood and acted on throughout the world , fully authorize any one independent nation to assume jurisdiction over any other , that may voluntarily , for reasons satisfactory to itself , desire or assent to such an arrangement . The case is a common one , and is never regarded by third parties as furnishing any ground for complaint . In ma*dng arrangements for the annexation of Texas to the United States , the two nations exercise a right indisputably belonging to them as actual and acknowledged members of the great family of Christendom . If the act interfere in any way with the pretensions of Mexico , as defined by herself , it is because she chooses to make pretensions , in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectual . We make no inquiry into the validity of these pretensions . Should she ever be able to enforce them , we shall feel ourselves bound to acknowledge the reality of the new state of facts that would then exist , but in dealing with the present as it is , ac* cording to the acknowledged principles of law and justice-principles not dis // puted by Mexico herself-we do no wrong to her , although our policy may operate unfavorably upon her ability to enforce her imaginary pretensions . Cases of a strictly parallel character are often occurring in the history of our foreign relations . Thus we are under the same obligation not to intermeddle in the controversies of foreign powers with each other against their wish , as we are not to interfere in their internal affairs . But when they make pretensions upon each other , which come into conflict with our rights as an independent state , we disregard their claims , and , if necessary , compel them by force to desist ;  --  a much stronger case than the present one . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of putting under a constructive blockade the whole coast of the continent , and prohibited all other nations from trading to it ; but we continued to exercise our right as an independent state without regard to this absurd pretension , and finally made war upon Great Britain for this and other reasons of a similar character . Mr. Van Buren remarks in his late Letter , that he " by no means contends that a formal recognition of the independence of Texas by Mexico is necessary to justify us in assenting to her annexation to the United States . " In this opinion he is probably sustained by the nearly unanimous sentiment of the country . The formal recognition of Mexico not being necessary to authorize us to deal with Texas in all respects as an independent state , what is I Evidently nothing but her really being one . The moment when Texas really became an independent state , was the one since which we and all the rest of the world have had the right to deal with her in all respects as an independent state . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been in fact independent , as was probably the case for some time previous . By announcing to her and the world that we considered her as an independent state , we publicly pledged ourselves to deal with her as such ; and we can not , without manifest inconsistency , proceed upon any other principle . To act upon the idea that the rights of Texas as an independent state , or those of the United States , to treat her as such , are in any way diminishea by the imaginary claims of Mexico , would be unjust not only to ourselves but to Texas . Such is the aspect of the question , as tested by the rules of international law . We have a perfect right to deal with Texas as an independent state ; and we have a perfect right to annex to our territory that of any independent state which is willing to agree to such annexation . If either of these propositions be doubtful , it is the former , and that will " hardly be contested by any one , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , the letter of the law , would authorize the annexation , do not the courtesy and consideration which we owe to a power connected with us by treaties of amity and commerce , and weaker than we are , require that we should abstain from exercising even acknowledged rights in a way that might appear like taking an unfair advantage of our superiority I This view of the subject has often been presented , and , I think , with some effect . It appeals to feelings which are habitually cherished in every honorable bosom , and are rarely invoked without success . In regard to this point , however , it may peihaps well be questioned whether we should show such real friendship for Mexico by encouraging her in a delusion which could have no other practical result than that of betraying her , so far as she might continue her attempts to subjugate Texas , into a useless waste of blood and treasure ; or , supposing that our rejection of the proposed treasure would be an act of real kindness to Mexico , whether Texas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a right to complain of us for showing kindness to others at her expense . But waving these points , let us see what sort of a case Mexico , on their view of the subject , is able to make out . If she or any other foreign power , comes to us with a claim founded in right , we must satisfy it , at all hazards and sacrifices , to the extent of our ability . If we are called upon to grant favors , to show kindness and courtesy , the ease is different . Before Mexico can expect us to respond to such a call , she must lay open the merits of the affair , and make it appear that her cause , as against Texas , is one with which , as men , Christians , and friends of liberty , we ought to sympa // thize . Considered under this aspect , how then dpes the case stand ? Very nearly , I believe , as follows The government of the United States of Mexico  --  a confederacy , constituted and organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigners to settle Texas , with the evident purpose of inviting emigration from the United States . A number of our citizens accepted the proposal ,  - -  made settlements upon the grants of land , that were offered them ,  --  and by their superior enterprise soon obtained the political control of the province . Texas was recognized by the existing institutions as a member of the confederacy , to which it delegated by the act of Union a portion of its sovereignty ,  --  but , in all other respects , was a free , sovereign , and independent State . Under these circumstances a military chieftain overthrows by violence the existing institutions , annuls the act of Union , abolishes the sovereignty of the States , and converts them all by a single stroke of the pen into departments . Texas , not choosing to acquiesce in this innocent little manouvre , remained , of course , what she was before , with this difference , that , as the foreign authority to which she had delegated a portion of her sovereignty , had ceased to exist , this qualification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that she was now , to all intents and purposes , an independent State . She accordingly declared her independence . This proceeding was not in her case , as it had been in ours , revolutionary in form , though founded in substantial justice . The revolution consisted in the abolition of the preceding constitution . The independence of Texas was a necessary , and , on her part , involuntary result of that revolution . She was , therefore , in form , as well as in substance , entirely in the right . She appeared as the champion of law and order against a military usurpation , and exhibited to the other States of the Union , a noble example of firmness and patriotism . Had they been capable of imitating it , the usurpation would have been crushed and the constitution restored . What right had Santa Ana , or Mexico , if an unprincipled military chief can be supposed for a moment to represent the will of a community which he retained by force under his government ,  --  what right had Mexico to invade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Mexico had over Texas was that delegated by the constitution which Mexico had herself subverted , and which had now no existence . Had General Jackson in the year 1825 , instead of acquiescing , as he did , like a prudent and patriotic citizen , in the results of the canvass for the Presidency , attempted to secure his election by force , and succeeded in establishing his power over a part of the Union , while the rest refused to acknowledge his authority , and declared itself independent , the case would have been parallel to that of Mexico and Texas . Whether General Jackson , under these circumstances , would have retained his popularity , and whether the friends of liberty and humanity throughout the world would have sympathized with him in his attempts to subjugate Virginia , Massachusetts , or whatever other States might have held out against him , are questions , which , of course , answer themselves . Thus far there seems to be very little in the case of Mexico as against Texas , which would naturally recommend it to our favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same spirit of lawless violence which he had exhibited in overthrowing the established institutions of his country , undertook to subdue and bring under his dominion by force the only State in the Union , which had had the firmness to resist his usurpation . Not only so , but in order to take what he doubtless regarded as a very rightful and proper revenge upon that State for the high crime and misdemeanor of asserting and maintaining her acknowledged sovereignty , against a military usurper , he determined to carry on the war without regard to the usages of civilized nations , and actually slaughtered his prisoners , the flower and pride of the Texian army , in cold blood . Thus perished the gallant and lamented Fanning and his comrades ,  --  names that will be registered in the memory of the friends of liberty with those of the Warrens and the Russells . The Texians proved to the invader , at San Jacinto , that they knew how to maintain , as well as declare their independence : and as if Providence had intended that he should suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point where he had most deeply // offended ,  --  they succeeded in obtaining possession of his person . What was to be done I Every principle , not merely of the military code , but of natural justice and humanity , required that he should experience in his own person the same tender mercies which he had meted out to the best and bravest of the Texians . When a military usurper , in attempting to subjugate an unoffending foreign people , happens to fall into their hands , his claim for consideration on the score of humanity , if justly viewed , must appear , under any circumstances , very small . A disabled wolf , soliciting mercy from the peaceful animals whom he has been seeking to destroy , presents a nearly parallel case . The usage of the world has , however , given even to a character of this description , supposing him to have perpetrated his deeds of carnage and plunder in the forms and according to the rules of public war , a sort of recognized existence , accompanied with conventional rights , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character sets at defiance the ordinary usages of civilized war and actually slaughters his prisoners in cold blood , he loses all title to this sort of conventional consideration , degrades himself to the level of a common pirate , and ought on every principle of humanity and justice to be treated like one . Napoleon himself , had his military career been stained , like that of Santa Ana , by a contemptuous disregard for the rules of civilized war ,  --  would have been shot by the allies , when he fell into their power : and humanity , instead of blaming , would have applauded the act . It is much to be regretted that this kind of summary justice was not administered in the case of Santa Ana . He has been throughout , and still is , the great stumbling-block in the way of a constitutional organization of the unfortunate region which he now dictatorially governs . His death , while it was most richly merited , or rather imperiously and peremptorily demanded by every consideration of humanity and justice , would have been , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his country . It is impossible , however , not to admire , though we can hardly approve , the moderation of the Texians in liberating their importalit prisoner . Their determination appears to have been taken under the mediation of General Jackson , as President of the United States , and on conditions , which if any reliance could have been placed on the personal honor of Santa Ana , might have rendered the act a politic one . Before his liberation he agreed to and signed a treaty acknowledging the independence of Texas , and binding himself to abstain from any hostile attempts against her in future . On these conditions he was permitted to return with his army in safety to Mexico . Without inquiring how far such an arrangement , if made by a captive general in the service of a regular government , would have been binding upon his superiorswithout expecting or exacting from Santa Ana , had he been so situated , the virtue of the Roman Regulus , who having deemed it his duty to his country to violate the understanding upon which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to his own honor to return to Carthage , and place himself again in their hands-in short under any point of view , without considering what might have been the force of this transaction in a different state of things , there can be no doubt that Santa Ana , having been at the time and ever since to all intents and purposes , the government , was politically and personally bound by it ; and although the intervention of General Jackson in the proceeding may have been entirely informal , the acceptance of his mediation by Santa Ana can be viewed in no other light than as a complete abandonment , so far at least as he and Mexico while under his government were concerned , of any right or claim to prevent the United States from treating Texas in all respects as an independent power . The government of the United States proceeded , accordingly , not long after this transaction , to make a public and formal acknowledgment of the independence of Texas , in which we were followed immediately by the great powers of Europe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than setting aside the treaty , to which he owed his life and liberty , with the same indifference with which he had previously nullified the constitution of his country , he resumed his pretension to overthrow by force the independence of Texas ; and although he has since made no serious attempt at invasion , and will probably be very // careful not to appear again in person upon the Texian territory , has kept up a harassing , though ineffectual border warfare against her , conducted with the same humane and beautiful regard for the usages of nations that distinguished his former invasion . Such is the charactcr of the person whom-under the name of Mexicowe are called upon to treat , not merely with justice , but with c9nsideration , favor and courtesy ; for whom we are requested to sacrifice our acknowledged rights and interests , as well as those of Texas . In recognizing as the existing de facto government of Mexico , the military system which Santa Ana has established and maintains by force upon the ruins of the preceding institutions , it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires or authorizes us to do . To expect that we should look with sympathy and favor upon the attempts of such a person to subvert by force the independence of the only State which had the firmness to resist his usurpation-that we should abstain from exercising our undoubted right to admit this gallant and generous young State into our own Union , lest we should in any way interfere with or disorganize these attempts-this , I apprehend , would be going a little too far . But Mexico , it may be said , has already announced that she will consider the annexation of Texas to our territory as a declaration of war ; and that whether she be right or wrong in this , we shall equally in either case have to encounter her hostile moveinents , in which she may be aided by powers much more formidable than herself . in answer to this objection I should say that , if Santa Ana , after making war upon a nation which gave him his justly forfeited life , and his personal liberty , upon his express engagement never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against us  --  the nation at whose friendly intercession he obtained these favors-because we do not think proper to aid and abet him in his treachery , I , for one , am quite willing to take the consequences . On the Mexican side of such a quarrel , there would be no element , as Mr. Jefferson remarked upon another occasion , " on which the Almighty can be expected to look with an eye of favor , ** VOL . XV. - NO . LXXV. or which would naturally engage the sympathy of any other power . If there be anything more than mere bravado in these threats of war by Santa Ana , they are probably uttered in the expectation that lie will receive aid from England . In this expectation , if he in fact entertain it , he will be disappointed . The settled policy of England , in regard to this country , since our war of 1812 , is permanent peace . Up to that time , she had cherished a lingering hope that sheshould be able to reduce us again to our original condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt with as as a really independent power . The war of 1812 dissipated this delusion , and she then made up her mind to be content with the advantages which she can obtain from us as her best customer , in the peaceful intercourse of a mutuallyprofitable trade . She will , in the indulgence of her habitual overbearing humor , or in order to effect any temporary purpose that she may have in view , threaten , browbeat , and plunder us as long as we choose to acquiesce ; but will never , under any circumstances , make war upon us , or permit us to make war upon her . In reality , however , these threats of war by Santa Ana are the merest vaporing , without any intention on his part to give them effect . Though not , perhaps , fairly entitled to the epithet wise , which Mr. Thompson , our late Minister to Mexico , too liberally bestowed upon him , Santa Ana is adroit and cunning . He knows that the most probable result of an attempt by him to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overthrow of his own usurped power by a domestic revolution , and the restoration of the constitutional system . He knows that should this not happen , and should he retain a sufficiently effective control over his countrymen to drag them again into an actual invasion of Texas , combined with open war against the United States , thousands-if necessary , tens of thousands-of our ardent spirits would rush from every corner of* the West to the scene of action , and bear aloft the banner of the " lone star " on a tide of martial and popular enthusiasm , until , after one or two campaigns , they should have planted it on the towers of Mexico . He knows , that , although in that event there would probably be no 18 S // disposition in the Government of the United States to take any undue advantage of circumstances , there would also be as little to give much importance to his own personal pretensions . Santa Ana will declare war against the United States when he desires to exchange the presidential chair and the quiet paradise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fame by the side of His Imperial Majesty Don Agustino I. , and not before . So much for the objections to the annexation of Texas , founded on a supposed want of constitutional power in the government , and on respect for the pretended rights of Mexico . The third , and only remaining objection , is the apprehended effect of this measure in extending the influence of slavery , and increasing the weight in the national councils of the slave-holding section of the Union . By the present Constitution of the Republic of Texas , the importation of slaves from any country other than the United States , is prohibited by law . Citizens of the United States who go to settle in Texas are permitted to bring their slaves with them . Such is , in this respect , the present state of things . Wbat will it be after the annexation of Texas to the United States I The importation of slaves from all other countries will still be prohibited , and citizens of the United States who go to settle in Texas will still be permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of things , as regulated by law , will be exactly the same as it is now . How , then , does it appear that the annexation of Texas will extend the domain of slavery , or increase the weight of the slave-holding section of the Union ! The probability is , on the contrary , that , while this state of things , as regulated by her , will remain in this respect exactly what it is now , the practical result of the measure will be rather adverse than favorable to the extension of slavery , for the three following reasons . 1 . The laws against the foreign slave S trade will be more effectually enforced under the authority of the United States than they are now , and a smaller number of slaves will , of course , be introduced in a clandestine way at the sea ports . 2 . The emigration from the United States to Texas would probably increase ; but , admitting this to be the case , it is obvious that the slaves can not be in two places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build up new slave-holding States in Texas , they can not remain in their former abodes on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean , and the banks of the Ohio . Virginia , Maryland , Kentucky and Delaware would become , almost immediately , free States . Tennessee , the Carolinas and Georgia , where the culture of cotton is much less productive than in the far South West , would soon follow their example . The weight of the slave-holding section of the Union in the national councils , instead of being augmented , would , of course , be diminished . Such would be the practical result of the measure , supposing even that Texas should be annexed as a slave-holding territory , and that she whole should afterwards be cut up into slave-holding States . But this would probably not be the case : for 3 . The territory of Texas , which reaches in a northerly direction to nearly the latitude of Boston , when cut up into States , will probably give about equal accessions of strength to the two interests . Mr. Clay supposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Others suppose that there will be two of each class . Admitting this , as the least favorable supposition , the immediate effect is still , on this view of the subject , to leave the respective forces of the two parties nearly as they were before , while , on every other view , it is positively adverse to the extension of slavery . The general result would , in fact , be , that the laws prohibiting the foreign slave trade would be better enforced in Texas , and as a compensation for the addition of two new slave-holding States to the Union , three , or at least two , new free States would be added to the Union , and the weight of at least six , perhaps eight or ten States , added in Congress to the influence of the free side . It would be easy , by enlarging on these statements , and the practical results that follow from them , to give them a high degree of probability ; hut this seems to be unnecessary , as they are admitted alike by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the only point where any // positive accession to the slave-holding interest could he apprehended-I mean the character of the new States to be formed out of Texas-Mr . Clay himself , as we have seen , believes that the advantage will be on the other side . There will be , according to him , three new free States , and only two slaveholding ones . Our late Minister to Mexico , Mr. Waddy Thompson , also a decided opponent of the annexation of Texas , agrees with Mr. Clay in this opinion ; and it is , in fact , precisely for this reason that he opposes the measure . If he believed that Texas could be admitted into the Union in the shape of four or five slave-holding States , he would " disregard all minor objections , and go for the measure . " But he is persuaded-very correctly , no doubtthat the North would never consent to this arrangement , and having the majority in Congress , would , of course , prevent it , were it even , which is not probable , desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real question , as Mr. Thompson says , is , " between Texas , divided into an equal number of slave-holding and non-slaveholding States of the Union , and Texas as it is now , an undivided slave-holding country . " Preferring the latter part of the alternative , Mr. Thompson opposes annexation : those who wish to diminish the territorial extent and political influence of slavery , ought , for the same reason , to be in favor of it . Mr. Thompson is equally decided in the opinion that the effect of annexation will be , to extinguish the remains of slavery in most of the old slave-holding States . " Slave labor , " he says , " can be employed in Texas with , at least , twice the profit which it yields in the average of the slave States of the Union . Our slaves will then be carried to Texas by the force of a law as great and certain as that by which water finds its level . The slaves will very soon disappear from Maryland , Virginia , N. Carolina , Tennessee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an operation those States will become non-slave-holding States . Whenever that is the case , they will not only no longer have a common interest with the remaining slave-holding States , but will very soon partake of that fanatical spirit of a false philanthropy which is now pervading the whole world . Thus shall we lose the most important of our allies-most important in numerical strength at the ballot-box , still more important if we should be driven to the cartouch-box as our last defence . " In general , the unfavorable effect of the annexation of Texas upon the extension , influence , and even existence of slavery , is the precise reason why Mr. Thompson , an open and avowed friend of slavery under all its aspects , opposes the measure . It is , according to him , " the most efficient plan that can be adopted for the abolition of slavery . " " If I believed , " says he , " that abolition either was or would become beneficial or necessary for the South , I should certainly be for annexation , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am firmly persuaded , that it is the certain and inevitable tendency of the annexation of Texas to promote the abolition of slavery-more so , indeed , than that of any other measure that has heretofore been proposed . " The reasoning by which Mr. Thompson supports these opinions is entirely satisfactory ; and his Letter against annexation , excepting for the few persons who believe with him that slavery is a positive good , is perhaps the strongest paper that has yet been published in favor of it . I make use of his authority , not in the way of argumentum ad hominem , for the purpose of confuting the opponents of annexation out of the mouths of their own most prominent and able champions . It is not my object to gain the advantage , fairly or unfairly , in a logical encounter of wits , but to arrive at the truth . I entirely concur in the opinions expressed by Mr. Thompson , in regard to the effect of the annexation upon the extension and influence of slavery , and I give them in his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an open and ardent opponent of the measure , than they would from any of its friends . I repeat , therefore , that the general result of this measure will he , to enforce more effectually in Texas the execution of the laws against the foreign slave trade  --  to extinguish slavery in several of the old slave-holding States , and to increase proportionally the weight of the free , as compared with that of the slave-holding States , in Congress ; - in short , to exercise a stronger influence than any other measure that has yet been suggested in favor of the gradual // restriction and final abolition of slavery , Such being the case , by the general admission of the most intelligent and zealous supporters of both sides of this question , it is really singular that any one should object to it on account of its supposed tendency to extend and increase the influence of slavery ; and yet it can not be doubted that an erroneous view of the operation of the measure in this respect is not only very honestly and seriously entertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said of the rights of Mexico , is the principal cause of the opposition made to it at the North . The great names of Channirig and J. Q. Adams had taken the public mind by surprise , and given popularity to the views alluded to , before the question had been thoroughly canvassed . When the discussion which it is now undergoing shall have had its effect , the current of opinion will , I think , take a new direction ; and I believe that the eminent and truly philanthropic men whom I have just mentioned as opponents of the measure , could they now , with minds entirely unbiassed , look at it under the new lights that have recently been thrown upon it , would be among the first to give it their hearty and deliberate sanction Having disposed of all the objections that have been urged against this measure , I might here terminate the discussion ; but there is one view of the subject , connected with the topic of slavery , which I have not yet considered , and which is , for practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it furnishes the precise reason why the annexation of Texas is not only desirable , but ought to be carried into effect without any unnecessary delay . I allude , of course , to the danger resulting to the tranquillity of the Southern States from the policy acted on and avowed by Great Britain in regard to the existence of slavery in other countries . It has been thought by some that the direct disavowal by the British Government of any sinister or selfish intentions in their dealings with Texas , ought to remove the apprehensions that we might otherwise entertain upon this subject . But considering the watchful , not to say jealous feeling with which we are accustomed to look in this country at all the proceedings of that Government , bearing upon our own interests ,  --  a feeling which a too sad experience has shown not to be unnecessary ,  --  1 must say that I can not regard these disavowals as quite satisfactory , and that I have even been surprised that they should have been so regarded by some experienced statesmen , whohave not heretofore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the policy of Great Britain . It is not very usual , in the first place , for experienced statesmen to attach any great importance to mere official disavowals , however direct and complete in form , excepting so far as they are confirmed by facts , or may coincide with the interest and habitual policy of the government making them . Governrnents which have occasion to take measures of an offensive or disagreeable character , rarely make known in advance the full extent of their projects , and often put forward a formal disavowal for the express purpose of diverting the attention of the party to be acted on , and thus accomplishing the object with greater facility . The most celebrated European statesman of the late revolutionary period is said to have laid it down as an axiom containing in itself the sum and substance of all diplomacy , that language was given to man to conceal his thoughts ; and the history of Europe at all periods proves that his theory has been too often adopted as a practical rule by the most powerful and enlightened governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family of Spain to meet him at Bayonne , he did not mention in his letter of invitation that he intended to seize their persons and carry them away captives into France . If he had , they , of course , would not have come . The state papers of the three great powers who divided among them the territory of Poland , a century ago , breathe a spirit of the purest philanthropy , and disown all other motives than a wish to promote the internaltranquillity ofthat country , and the welfare of the whole human race . Great Britain , we *tre told , is an exception to the general correctness of this remark . " She may do a wrong or an arrogant thing , " says Mr. Thompson in his late letter , " but she is incapable of deliberate falsehood . " Such implicit confidence in the good faith of others is a pleasing evidence of the integrity and sincerity // of the writer himself ; but human nature , after all , is substantially the same throughout the world . " In the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Lady Mary Wortley Montague , " I have met with only two sorts of persons , men and women . " History , in fact , does not sustain this somewhat rose-colored view of the politics of the " fast-anchored isle . " To go no farther back than our own revolutionary war , the documents issued by the British Government during the whole of that struggle disavow in the most explicit terms any intention to oppress the colonies ; but it does not appear that these disavowals were ever alluded to in our town-meetings or congresses as motives for not opposing the pretensions of the ministry . The public documents issued by the British Government during the war of 1812 contain the most explicit disavowals of any disposition to encroach on the rights of neutral nations . These were taken for gospel at the time by a portion of the people : but a large majority obstinately refused to give credit to them ; * and their views have been confirmed by the now unanimous sentiment of the country . More recently , the same Government distinctly disavowed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the territory rightfully belonging to the State of Maine . The final negotiation upon this subject was opened by Lord Ashburton with professions of fairness unprecedented on any similar occasion . Since the conclusion of the treaty , by which we ceded without equivalent a large section of that State , it has been made known by the exult* ing avowals of Sir Robert Peel in the House of Commons , that through the whole negotiation the King had in his library three maps , each marked by the royal hand of his predecessor George III . with a red line completely substantiating the claims of the United States , and invalidating those of Great Britain . It has been said , by way of apology for this proceeding , that the persons immediately employed in the negotiation , Lord Aberdeen and Lord Ashburton , were kept in ignorance by the ministerial leaders , Lord Wellington and Sir Robert Peel , of the existence of any such evidence against the British claims . This explanation , for those who are charitable enough to receive it , relieves the agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with double weight upon the principals , but has no tendency to show that the British Government is " incapable " of deliberate deception . But , waiving this point , it may be well , perhaps , before we permit our usual vigilance in regard to the proceedings of the British government to be entirely lulled to sleep by a few smooth words , to inquire a little more particularly what those very satisfactory disavowals really are . It will be found , I suspect , that Lord Aberdeen has avowed quite enough to excite apprehension in the mind of every patriotic citizen . In the letter addressed to Mr. Pakenham for the information of the government of the United States , Lord Aberdeen states , that the British government has " put itself forward in pressing that of Mexico to acknowledge Texas as independent , " but disavows any intention to interfere " unduly , " or " with any injurious assumption of authority , " with either party in order to ensure the adoption of such a course . He also disavows the intention to establish any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share her influence equally with all other nations . Her objects are purely commercial , and she has no thought or intention of seeking to act directly or indirectly on the United States through Texas . " He avows that his government " desires and is constantly exerting itself to procure the general abolition of slavery throughout the world , and particularly in Texas and the United States ; and that it will not desist from The open and honest efforts which it has hitherto made for the purpose , " but disavows any intention to endeavor to effect the object by the employment of " secret or underhand means , or any means , whether secret or open , which can tend to disturb the internal tranquillity or affect the prosperity of the American Union . " " The British government , as the United States well knows ( know l ) have never sought in any way to stir up disaffection or excitement of any kind in the slaveholding States of the American Union . Much as we should wish to see those States placed on the firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is to be attained by general freedom alone , we have never in our treatment of them made any difference between the slave-holding and free States of the Union . All are , in our eyes , entitled , as component members of the Union , to equal political respect , favor , and forbearance on our part . To that wise and just policy we shall continue to adhere : and the governments of the slave-holding States may be assured , that although we shall not desist from those open and honest efforts which we have constantly made for procuring the abolition of slavery throughout the world , we shall , neither openly nor secretly , resort to any measure , which can tend to disturb their internal tranquillity , or thereby to affect the prosperity of the American Union . " Such are the substantial parts , in his own language , of Lord Aberdeen 's note . The disavowal of any intention to establish a dominant influence either in Mexico or Texas , or to effect any other than commercial purposes , taken , as it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Agents in the most important political concerns of both those countries , and their avowed opposition to the annexation of Texas to the United States , can only be reconciled with the supposition of sincerity in the British government , by a latitude of construction which would render it practically of no value . But allowing for the present the disavowals contained in the letter to pass for what they may be thought by any one to be really worth , let us come to something more important . In this letter the British government , through its highest official agents , distinctly and repeatedly avows its intention to euddavor to bring about the general abolition of slavery in the United States and Texas . Let us see what this avowal amounts to . Slavery is an important element in the political institutions of every country in which it exists . It determines the personal relations of the parties immediately affected by it , and modifies , to a greater or less extent , the whole character of the government . It is part and parcel of the law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's note , that the British government is dissatisfied with an important feature in our political institutions , and is laboring with great assiduity to reform it . This is a pretty serious matter : nor is the gravity of it much diminished by the accompanying disavowals of any intention to employ for this purpose any means that would tend to disturb the tranquillity of the country . The reform of existing abuses , real or supposed , is a delicate operation , and one which no community , that respects itself and is really independent , will consent to entrust to any foreign government , however enlightened and honest . So objectionable , indeed , is this pretension on the part of Great Britain that the announcement of it , however cautiously worded , can not be made to wear any other than an essentially offensive and uncivil character . Although the philanthropic labors of the British government for the abolition of slavery are represented as extending over the whole globe , this country , I believe , enjoys the distinction of being the only one to which official notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Great Britain has invited most of the other Christian powers , including the United States , to concur with her in abolishing the slave-trade , and has offered them the aid of her naval armament in executing the laws which they might make to this effect : but she has not , I think , before officially informed any slave-holding power of her dissatisfaction with this feature in its political institutions , and her intention to employ all the fair and honorable means at her disposal to bring about a change . Although some exception has been taken to the reply made by Mr. Calhoun to their communication , I have great doubts whether all the other slaveholding powers would have received a similar one with equal courtesy . If the British Ambassador at St. Petersburgh should announce officially to the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs , that the Queen entirely disapproves of the extent to which personal bondage is tolerated in the Russian Empire , and is constantly laboring to reform this great mischief by all the means in her power consistent with a due regard  --  to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overture would be met either by an angry repulse , or a , cold and dignified silence . If , however , the Russian Court should prefer to recriminate , they might find in the present condition of the British Empire several points quite as much at // variance with abstract principles of right , and far more within the control of the administration than slavery , as it exists either in Russia or in the United States . If , in the case supposed , the Russian Ambassador at London should be instructed , for example ,  - -  after thanking the British government in the name of his master for their kind solicitude in regard to the internal concerns of the Russian Empire , to express to Lord Aberdeen , for the information of the Queen , the regret and dissatisfaction with which the Emperor witnesses the toleration of slavery in the British East Indian possessions ,  --  the wars of aggression and conquest that are continually carried on by the British agents in that quarter , including the late unprovoked attack on China ,  - -  the practice of providing the navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  the dreadful cruelties inflicted upon unoffending children of both sexes in the mines and manufactories ,  --  the inhuman policy of actually . starving a large portion of the people by preventing the importation of foreign corn ,  --  the refusal of the government to recognize the acknowledged rights of neutral powers in time of war , - their constant interference in the affairs of all the other nations in the world : - intimating , at the same time , His Imperial Majesty 's fixed determination to labor assiduously and earnestly for the reform of these evils , by all the means at his disposal , which may not be of a character to endanger the tranquillity and prosperity of the British empire : -I really do not see that his Lordship , consistently with his own principles and practice , would be able to make any very triumphant answer . The only proceeding of a similar character , that has actually occurred at any preceding period in the history of modern Europe , is to be found in the conduct of the early French revolutionary leaders . they publicly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the existing governments , and their determination to endeavor to reform them ,  --  beginning ( and in this they were more consistent than the British government of the present day ) with what they regarded as a thorough reform at home . Madame Roland 's celebrated letter to the Pope , w o a of the most remarkable speci incus of this kind of diplomacy , and is in no way inferior , either in beauty of style or philanthropic sentiment , to Mr. Pakenham 's communication from " the travelled Thane , Athenian Aberdeen . " Far from receiving these overtures with gratitude or even courtesy , the government so addressed resented them in the most violent manner , and commenced immediately a war of extermination upon the people in whose name they were issued . The British government itself took the lead in this anti-reform crusade , and carried it as with unheard-of effort and expense for more than twenty years . The pro .. fessed objects of the Irish revolutionists were the establishment of Liberty and Equality . They were , of course , identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The-advantages anticipated from the proposed reform were just as real as those now expected from the abolition of slavery : but it was felt by all , and by none more strongly than the rulers of England , that a public announcement by any one power of dissatisfaction with the political institutions of another is offensive , and that an expressed determination to reform them differs very little in sub- . stance from a declaration of war . It is really most extraordinary , that the British government , after having resented and resisted with so much violence the attempts made by the Irish revolutionists to propagate liberal political sentiments in foreign countries , should have become itself , in less than thirty years after the battle of Waterloo , a propagandist of the same sentiments , under the same form which they had considered most objectionable , and assailed , through the ablest pens , with a perfect storm of argument , eloquence , and ridicule . There is another point in Lord Aberdeen 's letter to Mr. Pakenham , which I have not seen noticed , hut which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allude to the closing paragraph quoted above , in which his Lordship informs Mr. P. of the intention of th' British government to observe entire impartiality in its treatment of the slave-holding and non-slave-holding States of the Union . Satisfactory as this assurance may be in substance , it is not the less certain that it is in form entirely irregular . The British gov eminent can hold no communication // whatever with the governments of the States ; it has no right or power under the constitution to treat with them at all ; and , of course , no means , if it were so disposed , to make any difference , in its treatment of them , between the free and slave-holding States of the Union . The language used implies either a want of knowledge in the British government of the restrictions imposed by the constitution upon the intercourse between the State governments and foreign powers , or that the British government might , if it were so disposed , disregard these restrictions . It amounts , in short , to an indelicate interference in the internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do . If the American government should officially notify Lord Aberdeen that the United States disapprove entirely the plan of an established church , and conscientiously believe that no portion of the Queen 's subjects ought to be subjected to political or civil disabilities or pecuniary exactions on account of their religious faith ,  --  but that the President , in his treatment of the different sects existing in the British Empire , has never made any distinction between the members of the established church and dissenters ; and that though he will never desist from the honest and open efforts which he is constantly making to abolish church establishments throughout the world , and particularly in Great Britain , the members of the established church may be assured that he will , neither openly nor secretly , resort to any means for this purpose which would endanger the tranquillity and prosperity of that country : - if , I say , the American government were to make such a communication as this to Lord Aberdeen , he would have a right to reply , and probably would reply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the information , but that as that government has neither the right nor the power to treat regularly with any of the sects , a promise to observe entire impartiality in its treatment of them , is , to say the least of it , quite superfluous . The declaration made by the British government , in the letter to Mr. Pakenham , that it is constantly exerting itself to procure the abolition of slavery in foreign countries , and will continue to employ all proper means for this purpose ,  --  however objectionable in form and substance , as an official c&amp;mmunication to the government of a foreign slave-holding state ,  --  must , of course , for practical purposes , be interpreted by the acts of the government that makes it . If unaccompanied hy any act , to which exception can justly be taken , it might be overlooked as a harmless piece of incivility . If accompanied , in our own case as those of other nations , by acts of a nature to endanger our internal tranquillity , it must be received as the expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counteract by all the fair and honorable means in our power . It is , therefore , of the highest importance to inquire what are , in fact , the means employed by Great Britain , in what Lord Aherdeen calls her " open and honest efforts to abolish slavery in foreign countries . " In making this inquiry , it is necessary to take into view the proceedings of British subjects , whether acting as individuals or associations , as well as those of the British government ; first , because they are among the most efficient forms in which Great Britain as a body politic acts upon this question ; and , secondly , because the British government makes itself indirectly responsible for these proceedings by giving them the sanction of its approbation in its official communications , and by placing the persons most active in this way in official stations of trust and confidence in slaveholding countries , as is seen in the appointment of Mr. David Turnbull to the place of British Consul and Superintendent of liberated Africans at the Havana , to which I shall have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain for the purpose in question are therefore 1 . Direct : - interference with foreign governments in the form of counsel and of action , by treaty or otherwise , so far as it can be carried with safety to herself : 2 . Indirect : - by giving a general approval and sanction to the proceedings of the Abolition Societies . It is obvious that a system of policy of which these are the two principal features , is well calculated to effect the general object of acting unfavorably upon the existence of slavery in foreign countries without committing the British government to any act which can be resented as directly hostile hy slaveholding states . Whether it is quite as // consistent with the internal tranquillity and general prosperity of such states , as Lord Aberdeen appears to consider it , may perhaps be questioned . It might appear , on the contrary , to an uncharitable observer , well calculated , and therefore probably intended , to enable the British government to take the most effectual , and at the same time the most dangerous measures for operating upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving a public and general sanction to the proceedings of the abolition societies , and by appointing their prominent members to places of trust and confidence in slave-holding states , it affords them nearly all the aid in the way of authority and respectability , which they would derive from being conducted in the name of the government ; while by throwing upon private associations the detail of the proceedings , it insures , morally speaking , the adoption of measures and the circulation of publications , of which no government could , as such , venture to assume the responsibility . A large proportion of the lectures given , and publications issued , by the abolition societies , have a direct tendency to render the slaves discontented with their condition , and to produce a state of mutual exasperation between them and their masters , which , carried to a certain extent , can only end in insurrection and blood . No Christian government would dare to sanction such proceedings directly ; but by publicly giving a general approval to the acts of these societies , the British government virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any official responsibility , is morally responsible for them , as much as if they were issued in its own name . That the governments of the slaveholding States of this country do not consider this system of policy as consistent with their tranquillity and prosperity , is apparent from the fact , that they have thought it necessary , for many years past , to prohibit the entrance into the territory within their jurisdiction of any publication in any way relating to slavery . Without questioning the entire sincerity of Lord Aberdeen in the opinion that the measures adopted and sanctioned by the British government are consistent with the tranquillity and prosperity of foreign slave-holding states , it is perhaps safe to assume that the governments of such states are better informed and more clear-sighted upon the subject than that of Great Britain . But the natural results of the system of policy pursued by Great Britain are perhaps best tested by observing its practical operation in the quarter where it has been acted on with the least restraint and for the greatest length of time . Although Lord Aberdeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slavery throughout the world , their efforts have been directed with very different degrees of intensity to the different regions in which it exists . The slavery that prevails to an immense extent in their own vast East Indian possessions engages very little of their attention . In Turkey , Persia , Egypt , and various parts of Germany , where slaves abound , and where the British government habitually exercise , through their diplomatic agents , a powerful influence , we hear of no movements upon this subject . In the vast empire of Russia where , out of the sixty million inhabitants , from forty to fifty millions are slaves , the British diplomacy is as silent in regard to emancipation as the grave . Even in soliciting the Emperor to concur with them in endeavoring to prevent the annual exportation of a few thousand negroes into America , they carefully avoid the slightest suggestion as to the expediency of doing anything to better the condition of the forty or fifty millions of white slaves under his Imperial Majesty 's own jurisdiction . The Spanish and Portuguese colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States of America , are the favorite fields for the exercise of British benevolence on this subject , and those to which it has been in practice , I believe , wholly confined . Of these the Island of Cuba is the one of which the history affords the best illustration of the subject for the present purpose . By examining the practical operation of the British system of policy in that beautiful region , we shall be able to judge with some degree of certainty , what it would be in others that are similarly situated , and how far the United States can , with safety to themselves , permit it to be carried into effect on a territory contiguous to our own , among a population so closely of kin to ours , in all respects , as that of Texas . // For the last thirty years the British system of policy in reference to the abolition of slavery in foreign countries , has been acted on almost without any check from the locaf or metropolitan governments in the island of Cuba . By her treaty with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Havana a permanent commission to superintend the execution of the treaty . At this time her efforts were directed chiefly to the abolition of the slave trade . After the emancipation of the slaves in her own West India colonies , she extended her arms somewhat farther and began to contemplate a similar emancipation in Cuba . In the year 1839 , the British anti-slavery societies sent agents to Madrid , to propose to the government a measure of this description , to be accompanied , as it was ln the British Islands , by the payment of an indemnity to the owners . About the same time Mr. David Turnbull , a writer of known ability and a decided abolitionist , was appointed consul and superintendent of liberated Africans at the Havana . This person seems to have acted ever since as the chief manager of the operations of the abolitionists , as well as of the government in this quarter . Immediately after his arrival he began a series of movements of a character so offensive and so dangerous to the tranquillity of the Island , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , obtained his recall , before his formal exequatur. had been transmitted from Madrid . He remained some time longer at the Havana , in his capacity of superintendent of liberated Africans , but was finally compelled to leave the Island , and has since resided alternately in the Bahama Islands and in Jamaica . His removal from the Island appears to have inspired him with additional zeal and energy in the prosecution of his projects . While residing in the Bahama Islands he planned an insurrection which was to commence at Santiago , a port on the south shore of Cuba , where he landed in person and began the movernent . He was arrested by the authorities and sent to Havana . The usages of nations would have freely justified the local authorities in putting him on trial for his life , but from consideration for the British government , he was again set at liberty on condition of leaving the Island . He has since re sided in Jamaica , and in return for the indulgence shown him , appears to have been prosecuting ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general insurrection . Abolition agents of a less conspicuous character have been co-operating with him . Within the last two years the result has been made known to the world , and may he regarded as a full and clear exposition of the practical operation of the British system of policy in regard to this subject . This result has been a conspiracy , including the whole colored population of the Island , and a small portion of the creoles , having for its object the emancipation of the slaves and the independence of the Island , and including among the ways and means of effecting these objects a general massacre of the whites . An explosion precisely like that of St. Domingo would have occurred , had not the plan been discovered , before it was quite ripe for execution . By the employment of the most energetic measures on the part of the local government , it has been temporarily suppressed . The confessions of the persons implicated in it designate Turnbull as the head of the insurrection , and the person who was looked to as the provisional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though the immediate danger is probably over , the elements of future trouble are still fermenting with unabated violence . Indeed the guilty infatuation of the planters , who are constantly importing fresh quantities of blacks from Africa , and the cupidity of the local government , which connives at this clandestine traffic in order to make profit by it , annually increase the mass of inflammatory materials , which , unless some very decided measures can he taken to prevent it , must finally burst out in a general conflagration* This series of events has attracted less attention in the United States than it properly deserves , because the details are in a great measure concealed from the public eye by the silence of the Havana press , which is subjected , as is well known , to the strictest preliminary censorship , and publishes scarcely anything that has the most distant bearing upon the condition of the slaves . On this occasion the government has departed in some degree from its usual reserve . The report of the court martial held upon the con* spirators appears in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most interesting , I should rather say , appalling history of the events in question : which is corrohorated by the most authentic private intelligence . This state of things in Cuba-though for the reason I have mentioned , and others that will readily occur , it attracts less attention here than it is entitled to-is a matter of the deepest interest to that country , and one that may well invite the must anxious scrutiny and the most careful deliberation of the Government and people of the United States . A moral and political volcano-*.teeming , under an outside of forced tranquillity , with a fiery ocean of insurrection and massacre-ready at any moment to spread , by explosion , its boiling lava over everything in its neighborhoodseparated from our Southern States by a channel that may be traversed in a few hours-this is an object to which statesmen , and particularly Southern statesmen , can not well be indifferent . I advert to it at present exclusively in its connection with the question of Texas . If such a state of things be fraught with alarm and danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighboring island , inhabited by men of another race , in what light should we be compelled to regard it , if it were to grow up in a territory separated from ours only by a narrow river and an imaginary line , and inhabited by colonies of our own citizens l That the agents of the British Abolition societies are already laboring in Texas with their characteristic zeal , and with the open approbation of the British Government-as given , for example , in Lord Aberdeen 's letter to Mr. Ashbel Smith-we know . What the result will be-if no decisive measures should be taken to prevent it-within some not very distant period , we may learn from what is now occurring in Cuba . It is unnecessary to enlarge upon the closing scenes of this frightful tragedy , to which I have briefly adverted , and which have been rendered in some degree familiar to the public mind by the newspapers . They exhibit , as I have said , the practical operation of the plan of abolishing slavery in foreign countries as avowed and acted on by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-slavery societies , under the public approval and with the official co-operation of that government . Within two or three years past thi ' system has been brought into action in Texas with quite as much zeal and energy as it had formerly been in Cuba . The results , unless it can be efficiently counteracted , must , of course , be the same ; their necessary and immediate effects upon the condition of the neighboring portions of our territory , are sufficiently apparent . The annexation of Texas would enable the United States to place a partial check upon an evil for which there is no real and final remedy except the return of the British Government to a more correct and humane view of this great subject , and the total abandonment by them of the policy of interfering with the domestic institutions of foreign countries . It will be perceived that the argument on this branch of the subject is not , as it has sometimes been represented , a defence of slavery . The object is simply to secure the inhabitants of a large portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst forms . To this they are exposed while Texas is left open to the labors of the British abolitionists , carried on under instructions of the British government . It is for this reason chiefly that the necessity of annexation has appeared at the south to be immediate and urgent . On other accounts the southern statesmen might have waited for it without impatience , or perhaps have opposed it ,  --  for the reasons given by Mr. Barrow , Mr. Thompson , and others ,  --  as positively injurious to their interest . I am not one of those who believe that it is any part of the policy of the British government to obtain possession of Texas as a colony , or to secure peculiar advantages in trading with her by a commercial treaty . They know that the United States would not acquiesce in the former measure , and that the advantages resulting from the latter would be too trifling to compensate for the odium which it would carry with it ,  --  supposing now , what is not very probable , that Texas could be brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclaims very distinctly , and I have no doubt very sincerely , any intention of this kind . With Texas nominally independent , Great Britain can put in operation with less responsibility and more efficiency , the means which the deems it proper to employ // for abolishing slavery in foreign countries , and which she is urging with so much effect in Cuba . She would not probably accept Texas as a colony , if it were offered her : to us it is desirable , not only as a territorial acquisition *f great value , but as an indispensable guaranty of our domestic tranquillity . The United States have been charged , in connection with this subject , with a grasping disposition , and that by the public press of a nation which , while this subject has been under discussion , has incorporated two or three additional empires into its already boundless Indian possessions ,  --  made war upon China in order to open a new market for its trade ,  --  and intermeddled , in one way or another , with the politics of every other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , on the contrary , that no question has come up in any part of Christendom , during the last half century , in regard to which any nation has given stronger proof of moderation than the United States have displayed for twenty years past on this very matter of Texas . In the original settlement of the boundary of Louisiana with Spain , Mr. Monroe relinquished this territory , when , as it appears , Spain was willing that we should have it . Mr. Adams , then Secretary of State , has publicly stated that Spain had then authorized a much larger cession of territory than she actually made , and that we had declined , in a spirit of magnanimous forbearance , to take advantage of this disposition . He has stated that , individually , he disapproved at the time the alienation of Texas ; that it was carried against him by a majority of votes in Mr. Monroe 's cabinet , and that he signed the treaty as agreed upon , merely as an organ of that majority . It is now , I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the right , and Mr. Monroe and his cabinet in the wrong ; but there is certainly no appearance in their conduct of a grasping eagerness for territorial aggrandizement at the expense of others . When the people of Texas , after declaring and establishing their independence and obtaining the acknowledgment of it from Mexico , the United States , and the principal maritime powers of Europe , spontaneously proposed to our government , through their own , to come into the Union , Mr. Van Buren , then President of the United States , would not entertain the overture for a moment . He declined to submit it to Congress , or even to reserve it for his own future consideration . In disposing in this way , upon his individual responsibility , of this great national question , he committed , in my opinion , a grave error , and even exceeded his proper constitutional powers . Congress and the people should have been consulted upon a matter of such transcendant importance . But , however he may have erred in other respects , he at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an undue zeal for the extension of our territory . Finally , when a treaty for the re-annexation of our alienated domain had been actually concluded by the executive department of the government , the Senate made haste to reject it by a large majority . In so doing , they assumed a more fearful responsibility than has been involved in any preceding act of either branch of Congress . What the ultimate opinion of the country will be upon their conduct may be conjectured from the present feeling in regard to the acquisition of Louisiana , which was opposed at that time on nearly the same grounds . But whatever else may be said with justice of the course taken by the Senate , it implied but too clearly a total abnegation of every thought of national aggrandizement . When we recollect the oceans of blood and treasure which have been poured out in all parts of the world in wars having no other ostensible ground than a difference of opinion about the right to some little strip of worthless land , it is impossible not to feel some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejection of a region not inferior in extent or richness to the kingdom of France , however baseless may have been the scruples of conscience alleged in each of these cases as the motive . When any one of the governments of Europe shall be able to produce an example from its own conduct of a single refusal of a similar kind , it may with a better grace accuse the United States of exhibiting a grasping spirit of territorial aggrandizement in regard to the acquisition of Texas . The British writers , in urging this charge upon us with so much unanimity and perseverance , display , if not much argument or eloquence , at // least a very remarkable " power of face . " Before closing this letter-already , I fear , much too protracted for your patience-I will add a few remarks upon the manner in which the discussion of this question and others of a kindred character has been conducted in the northern part of the country . The tone taken in regard to the South , not only in the violent party journals , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretensions and great personal respectability on the floor of Congress and elsewhere , is very little less bitter and offensive , than that of the British journals in regard to the country at large . The slavery of the South is represented as a wrong inflicted upon the North , not as an evil forced upon the South by our forefathers of Old and New England . The South is charged with a spirit of sectional aggrandizement at the expense of the INorth . Threats of disunion are openly made , even in the imposing form of resolutions of State Legislatures ; and societies professing a philanthropic character publicly announce , and are actually carrying into effect , the intention to agitate the country with a view to the dissolution of the Union . It is impossible , of course , to enter upon a full discussion of so fruitful a topic at the close of a letter which treats immediately of another question , but I can not let the occasion pass without entering my protest , as an individual citizen of one of the Northern States , against these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told that we are , always have been - and , until the constitution shall have been amended , always shall be-governed by a junto of slaveholders . This supposition , if admitted , would lead to conclusions not very palatable , perhaps , to those who make it . If the miracles of success and prosperity which have uniformly attended our progress , as a nation , are to be attributed to the influence of a junto of slaveholders , it will be necessary to conclude that the government of such a junto , judged by its results  --  the only sure test of the character of any political institutions-is one of the best that has ever been tried . But the supposition is itself entirely erroneous . If the South has exercised a good deal of political influence , it has not been because she held slaves  --  a circumstance which , on the contrary , has greatly diminished , and is regularly diminishing , her sectional weight in the Union  --  but because she has produced such men as Washington , Henry , Marshall , Jefferson , Madison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hardly less distinction and dignity . Most of these persons , it is true , held slaves , but they exercised influence , not as slaveholders , but as men . If these men , or some of them , have possessed more weight in the Union than others of equal merit at the North , it has been , I apprehend , not because they held slaves , but because they took views of the policy of the country more in accordance with the genius of our institutions , and which , for that reason , have ultimately obtained the almost unanimous assent of the people . It is a fact which can not be disputed , and need not be disguised , that on all the great questions that have necessarily agitated the country , the South has taken the side which has finally carried the people with it ; and , what is still more remarkable , account for it as we may , the side most favorable to liberty . I allude , of course , to dominant parties and the general tendency of opinion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of the Federal Constitution  --  and in those which succeeded , and had their origin in the revolutionary struggles of Europe-in the disputes with Great Britain respecting neutral rights-on the great financial questions of the Bank and Protection-we find the North , right or wrong , uniformly on the side of Power  --  the South on that of Liberty . Even on isolated questions , like that of the acquisition of Louisiana - which seem to have no connection with general principles  --  the South has had the fortune to espouse the opinion that has finally been sanctioned by the people . At this moment , when a region not inferior , as I have said , in extent and richness , to the kingdom of France , is thrown , as it were , into our arms , the North-for reasons which , as I think I have shown , will hardly bear examination-repels the magnificent god-send : the South is ready to receive it with eagerness and gratitude . There can hardly be a doubt which of these two sentiments in regard to this measure , will finally // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least at the North - that a community of slaveholders is naturally , as such , more favorable to liberal principles of government , than one composed entirely of freemen : but it is not very difficult to imagine that in a country like ours , where all the institutions are based on the principles of Liberty , the supporters of liberal principles should regularly maintain the ascendency . How it has happened that the slaveholding South should have uniformly raised the standard of Liberty and the free North that of Power , is a curious question , which has often been asked , but never satisfactorily answered . Perhaps the native generosity and lofty spirit of the South are better guides to the judgment than our vaunted Northern calculation . The fact is certain ; and it is in this fact , taken in connection with the power of steadiness which Southern statesmen have evinced in supporting their opinions in the national councils , that we must look for the cause of Southern preponderance . The South has exercised influence , not as a community of slaveholders , but as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights-in one word , of Liberty . Let the North adopt the same course and she will find no difficulty-with her overflowing exuberance of material and intellectual resources-in arriving at the same result : nor will the attainment of it be at all obstructed by the adoption of a kinder and more courteous tone in regard to the South , than that which prevails in the controversies of the present day . I am , with great regard , my dear friend , very truly yours@@184091404.txt THIS was the exclamation of a laboring man , who accompanIed the late Theodore Sedgwick , from his residence in Stockbridge to a steamboat-landing on the North River , as he was setting off on a voyage to Europe . They were upon a mountain summit in Berkshire , overlooking the broad valley of the Hudson . Spread out before them lay the rich pastures and fat cornfields of Columbia , Dutchess , Greene , and Ulster . Cities and villages were there , teeming with enterprise and wealth . Herds of flocks innumerable were pasturing upon the hills and grazing upon the plain* . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many a barque , borne along on wings of wind or fire , deeply laden with the harvests of every clime . From along the tributary branches of the monarch flood , ascended the smoke , and was heard the rattle , of forges and factories , ever busy in pouring in their contributions to the full tide of wealth . The scene presented a living panorama , exhibiting in one brilliant view the harmonious competition and co-operation of Agriculture , Commerce , and Art , to provide supplies for every want and desire and taste of man . Tile attendant was filled with amazement , and exclaimed ,  --  " How much land and property , and I have none ! What is the reason ? " Wealth everywhere abounds . Kind Nature , no niggard step-dame , but an all-bounteous , loving mother , exhaustlessly produces supplies for all her children . The Universal Father has written his attribute of Love over all the face of his creation , upon every manifestation of his existence ; in the beams of the morning light , the evening 's declining shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majesty of midnight ; in the sun , the stars , and the seasons in their courses ; in the untravelled solitudes of the forest , and the swelling tides of the boundless sca ; and has inscribed it in characters of clearer light upon that altar which he has erected for his worship in tile deep instincts and sentiments of man's soul . We can not then believe that He has VOL XYI-NO . LXXIX. 2 made poverty and want and servile toil the necessary lot of any human being ; that he has placed him in the midst of the lavish and superfluous riches , with which he is surrounded , only to tantalize him with the view of good which he is not to be permitted to attain . This fair earth was not made to be man 's prison-house and place of bondage , where his soul must be crushed and extinguished by material incumbrances ; but for a garden of Eden , wherein grows every plant that is pleasant to the sight and good for food , and in the midst whereof is the Tree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for the blinding , but for the healing of his eyes . Wealth everywhere abounds , and liberal provision for every human necessity , comfort , luxury . Ample means are provided , too , for the large unfolding of man 's spiritual nature . Why in so plentiful a world does poverty so much more abound ? Why is it , that so large a portion of men , born the equal heirs of nature 's abundance , are compelled to be the slaves of toil , to waste immortal energies , and lose their true life , in the wanton struggle for animal existence ? Amid so much public prosperity , why so much private wretchedness ? Why these savage hovels by the side of these vast and gorgeous palaces ? Why this squalid , ragged vagrant wandering , homeless and famishing , among these abodes of luxurious opulence ? Why this huge mass of ignorance in the midst of all these ostentatious provisions for education ? - this unshrinking vice even under the droppings of the sanctuary ? Why is the light of this young , new soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which lie upon it , and keep it from emerging ? Why , in a world so rich , are there so many millions who can say- " I have hone ? " Loud above the din of commerce , the clatter of machinery , the s1 unning roar of the univerral struggle for wealth , a million echoes are hcard repeating the question. - " Whet is the reason ? " With the convervative portion of the communitv ,  --  with those who regard the // present as the best possible social order that can be formed ont of such materials as human nature furnishes , it is usual to impute inequalities of condition and the evils resulting therefrom , to personal misconduct or misfortune though I believe that far less influence is attributed to the former than to the latter ,  --  the individual is generally more in fault than his stars . Society , it is said , has done all it could do , to prevent or compensate their inequalities . Our political institutions have guarantied equality of rights to every member of society , and opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving his lot of fortune to each ones own will . Fortune , the treasures of knowledge , the path of ambition , are open to all , and it is his own fault , whoever fails to attain them . It appears to me , that in this statement society receives far more credit than it deserves . Personal misconduct is unquestionably tae source of an immeasurable amount of evil and suffering . But it is more frequently an aggravating than an original cause ; only making more intense the disorders of the individual being , which are themselves produced in the first instance by , and are the prominent indications of , a false , unnatural , or imperfect organization of society . I know that there is prefixed to many of our books of statute law , an instrument called a constitution , which declares , in affirmance of the notable Declaration of American Independence , that all men are created equal , and endowed by their Creator with certain natural , essential , individual rights . And I rejoice that it is there ; for though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living word , that shall one day find an authentic utterance , and awaken and save the world . Tones of that utterance have been from time to time breathed forth from the deep heart of Humanity ; and louder and louder tones are laboring to find a voice , which society must prepare itself to hear ,  --  for as it hears , will they be infernal discords , or the harmonies of the universe . I said that word now seems half-dead . While it should be the vivifying spirit of all the institutions , practices , opinions , of society , a great deal of the action of society , in its legislation and social customs , is a practical denial and annulling of it . Human Rights , set forth in declarations and constitutions , are treated in practice as abstractions , whose realization is possible only under certain conditions and contingencies , which have never yet occurred , and of whose occurrence no historical analogy justifies the expectation . No higher idea has yet been generally entertained of the equality with which all men are said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the state , comprehended in the right of suffrage , of office , and other political rights . Equality in this form is nowhere fully established ; but political rights are limited by conditions of property , age , complexion , or something else ; and still more by the inequalities of culture and social condition , which result from the present arrangement ot the social state . Knowledge is power inherently , and wisdom confers a just authority . Wealth , too , is power , accidental and base , indeed , but , as things are , even more commanding than wisdom . And thus , under the most perfect forms of political equality , privileged classes will exist , and become a permanent element , as real and as oppressive as under those forms of social organization which are founded primarily and avowedly upon privilege . The true doctrine of equality , as the principle of human brotherhood , of right essential and inalienable , society has never embraced , and is apparently still very far from adopting . When thus professed in words , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible conditions of another life , a tacit protest of its inconsistency with the necessary distinctions on this side of the grave . Men revolt from it , when it requires them to give the divine grasp of brotherhood to the smutty artizan , the toil-begrimed ploughman , or that hard-fated brother on whose brow God 's sun has stamped a darker hue than theirs . The most generally received theory of the origin and functions of society is , that its leading idea is the protectina of property-meaning thereby a many s material goods-houses , lands , stocks , guineas , hank-notes ; in a word , his purse . Without inquiring now how much truth is contained in this statement , it is sufficient for the present purpose to say that society has utterly failed of fulfilling its office in this view of it . It does not protect property in // any just sense-in any but a purely arbitrary and conventional sense . It is not a protector of propcrty , but a robber and protector of the robbers of property . I am aware that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of property , counteracting tbe natural laws , and the natural rights of man , are among the foremost of the causes of the ignorance , poverty , suffering and sin , which in all ages have degraded the masses of mankind ; and which , in all ages , conservatism , with a horrible obliquity of moral vision , has urged as a conclusive reason against the reform of the very abuses which have caused them . The time has passed for standing cap in hand before haggard and hoary conventionalisms , to find soft-sounding names for the frauds and manifold oppressions of man , which the dead past has bequeathed to the living , reforming present . There is a natural right of property , as a natural right of life and liberty-equally conferred by the Creator-belonging to man as man-equally necessary to enable him to accomplish the destiny assiQned him . A more false and pernicious moral and political heresy was never broached , than that which founds the right of property on convention , and says , with Henry Clay , " that is property , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprives a man of a natural right is robbery-whoever does it is a robber ; whether you , or I , or the irresponsible representative of our thought and will , social opinion and social law ; whether it be done at the month of the pistol , or under the plausible and venerable forms of immemorial prescription . Let us be true first of all to the reality of things , wasting not overmuch thought upon words , for " words are the daughters of men , but things are the sons of God . " To begin with property in the earth . The earth was created for the subsistence of man ; by the law of nature it is the common patrimony of the race . If by virtue of his creation as a son of God , every man has a natural , essential right to life and liberty ; by virtue of the same relation , every man must have a right to an equal portion of the earth , or an equivalent , for his subsistence and use . Brotherhood , a common paternity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But society , by its laws of acquisition and inheritance , deprives a large part of mankind of this natural right . The whole face of the earth , from its pinnacles mingling with the clouds , down to its lowest valleys and dcepest mines , is covered up with society patents , and charters , and parchments , and title deeds , which secure it to some few in exclusive and indefeasible appropriation ; while the plundered heir is left without a rood ; can not set a foot upon the ground , out of the common highway , without committing a legal trespass ; and must be indebted to the public charity even for space to moulder in and return to dust . Our own constitutions , though based professedly upon the theory of natural rights , have all admitted and sanctioned the principle , transmitted from the ages when force and fraud were the only law , that an exclusive and perpetual title to the soil may be acquii ed , without limitation of quantity or time . The title once acquired is held good against all mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not extinguished while one drop of the blood of the original possessor can he traced in the veins of any human being in the remotest generations . Here is a fundamental injustice , creating original and necessary inequalities of social condition . The social destroys the asserted natural equality of rights , and makes the title to that great property , which the Creator gave for the subsistence and happiness of all the members of his human family , contingent and conventional , in the case of every individual ; depending upon the accident of his being born of this , or that father , in this , or the contiguous house . Injustice is implied in every social difference between one man and another , which is not the consequence of personal conduct . There is injustice in the arrange ments by which one is enabled to , and does inevitably , begin life with an advantage over another . Society is as unjust when it creates , or permits , hereditary distinctions of property , as when it creates hereditary distinctions of rank , or differences in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property is based upon the same foundation with every other natural right . It is personal , and not comiventional . It does not originate in , nor exist by the force of the laws of society , the will of // the legislature , but by the law of humanity , the xviii of God , and is , therefore , sacred , universal , inviolable . Passing from property in the earth , let us consider other species of property , and the solution which social institutions give of the inquiry , " Why hare I none ? " What is Property ? I have seen no definition which so well satislies the conditions of a natural right , as this : " Property is what a man acquires , without violating any on&amp;s right , and without neglecting any duty . " It is founded on the law of justice and Christian love . The right of property , then , secures to every man the just fruits of his own labor , hy a title that is good agaiust the world . It forbids every one from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole fruit of a man 's labor is his property ; no fraction of it , acquired under the above conditions , can be taken away , or withholden from him , without violating the Law of Nature . Society is unjust , if it permits him to be deprived of any portion . It does not protect him . It is a robber , and permits robbery , as truly as if it permitted him to be deprived of liberty , and made a slave . No one will think of disputing the proposition , that all the wealth of the world is the product of labor . The ground yields no spontaneous harvests . Nature 's seed times and harvests must be purchased by toil ; the sea gives up her treasures only to the h*irdy ploughman of the deep ; the earth hides her metals and precious gems in her darkest caverns , till the strong arm of labor brings them forth . The wealth of the world , then , according to the simple law of manhood and reason , belongs to the laborer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a laborer , toiling daybyday for daily bread ; while he , who has labored not , or labored no more , nor produced more , builds palaces . Throughout all the employments of society , this distribution takes place . The producer of wealth does not gather the harvest , but he who labors not , and produces nothing . This is no accidental or transient condition of things . So long as the earth may be the subject of exclusive appropriation , beyond the wants , and beyond the life of the individual generations , and the subject of inheritance , without limitations of amount or consanguinity , it is inevitable that some will come into life with no inheritance but life and muscle . Having no property of their own ,  --  or more strictly , finding their share of the common patrimony xvithholden from them by the laws of society , yet ever subject to the inexorable law of hunger and cold-they must starve , or work upon the property of others . They must become slaves , or laborers for wages . Those positions are correlative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter may be in a state of social existence more miserable and hopeless than the former . The fundamental idea of wages is , that they are but a part of the actual product of the laborer 's work ; a part being retained and appropriated by the employer , under the names of interest on capital , skill , profit , risk , or some other deception , by which the real nature of the relation of labor to its fruits is concealed . For a time , while the number of inheritors , or proprietors , is large , and that of non-proprietors , or laborers for wages , comparatively small , no very crying evil is likely to follow . It will not be very difficult for the laborer to become a proprietor . But it is obvious that the difference in the numbers of the two classes will be constantly becoming 6reater . The law is of universal force , that " to him who hath shall be given , and from him that bath not shall be taken away even that which he bath . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-proprietors growing larger , by the force of causes , which there is neither just.ice nor philosophy in asserting , imply misconduct on the one side , or merit on the other ; or which imply ' more than superior caution , or superior cunning , or the absence of those qualities  --  a greater or less degree of skill in the multiplication of chances , or simply than the different estimates which may be formed concerning the highest proper objects of human pursuit . As the number of laborers increases , the proportion of tire products of their labor returned to them in the form of wages is diminished , according to the fundamental law of demand and supply ; until , at length , wages are reduced to the standard of bare subsistence . This continues , with occasional fluctuations , alternating above and below that standard , the permanent conditiou of the laborer . Such has been the invariable doxvnward progress of the working-man for wages . // It has been retarded among us by the extent and fertility of our new territory . But enough is realized-presages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is anything in our institutions to save the laborer for wages from such a destiny . Notwithstanding these manifest propositions and experiences , conservatism appeals to an Astor and a Girard , to demolish a plausible theory by a stubborn fact  --  to demonstrate the " superiority of man over his accidents . " Those are but rare exceptions . In a society of any long duration , wages , in the averftge of all employments , can not greatly exceed the necessities of the animal life not at all , when several lives depend upon the labor of one . It is impossible for every laborer , for he tgreat majority of laborers , to become capitalists ; and it is only by becoming capitalists , and taking their turn of appropriating the labors of others , that they can materially improve their condition , and rise into that blissful region of sunshine , which conservatism assures them is within the reach of all . A Girard and Astor may occasionally dazzle the world by the splendor of success . Not as laborers for wages did they rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of society , such results as they achieved would have been impossible , as they are undesirable , and as they now are to the vast mass in the like condition . Inquire concerning the companions of their boyhood among the narrow lanes and dark alleys where their early years were nursed , and where are they ? Haudreds of them toilsomely lived , and obscurely perished , in the same dark lanes and alleys where they first saw the light ; and these two alone of them all , children of fortune , favorites of blind accident , are raised aloft as symbols of a destiny which all might have reached ! It is a social wonder that a shoemaker in a generation becomes a leader in the national councils , that a farmer 's boyis a Secretary of State , and a working blacksmith makes himself master of fifty languages . The vast host of shoemakers , farmer 's boys , and blacksmiths , whom the pressure of society kept for ever at the bench , the furrow and the forge , and prevented from being anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooked ; and society glorifies itself for the opportunities it gives for high upholdings ! Behind the path of every Franklin who has struggled successfully , and triumphed over the obstructions of his early condition , lie the broken and discomfited wrecks of the thousands who commenced the struggle with him ; and they fill nameless and unknown graves on the very spot where they began the battle , while his name alone has gained a memorial . In these contests , were the conquerors alone worthy of the victory ? Was no lofty hope , no generous love , no unselfish ambition , no infinite aspiration extinguished , when the others fought and fell ? Great and revered are the names of the conquerors . They are the heroes and prophets of the race ; tokens of the possibilities that lie unfolded in the mind of man ; signs full of promise and encouragement to humanity . But not to all is given the heroic gift . Few are they , who are called to be prophets , or apostles , or speakers with tongues . Let us not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory of the vanquished , nor in them libel our common nature . Let us not , for the sake of hiding , or of profiting by , social sins , be unjust to those who have perished , and are every day perishing , in the conflict with the world . Let us , rather , look social institutions boldly in the face , demand of them by what right they exist , what is their mission , and what share they have had in the discomfiture of our brethren , whose bleaching bones lie strewed on every side arounu us . I am desirous of illustrating more fully the subject of wages , because it is claimed , by conservative reasoners , that they are the grand balance and compensation of all social injustice . The falsity of the system of wages , the utter fallacy of the idea of compensation , will appear from a consideration of some of the laws which regulate wages , as laid down by political economy . One of them is that " the rate of wages depends upon the number of laborers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The wants of the laborer can not be regulated by any such contingencies . They are necessities of existence , independent of the transitions , depressions , and fluctuations of trade and the market . This rule violates the law of nature and justice by disregarding those necessities , and grounding itself upon those fluctuations ; compensating capital for the fall of the market by the // double injustice of a reduction of the wages of labor , which is , to the laborer , a reduction of life . Another law of wages is , that " they are regulated in a great measure by the intelligence , education , good conduct , and independent condition of the laborer . " This rule is the foundation of the difference between the wanes of learned and unlearned labor , the labor of him who works with his head and him who works with his hands-between headcrafts and handicrafts . In defence of this difference , it is said that the learned laborer is entitled to a higher compensation for his labor than the handicraftsman , because he has invested a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fit discharge of his professional functions . But their education is itself an advantage which , in most cases , they receive from the favor of society ; and one to which the unlearned laborer is equally entitled , of which he is deprived , in most cases , without his own fault . According to this rule , the one is entitled to a reward for possessing an advantage over another , who , in turn , is subjected to a disability which he has not imposed upon himself , which society has imposed upon him . In another view : education is its own reward . Intellect , as its culture is the highest glory of man , gives constant and increasing compensation for its exercise in the exercise itself . According to the law of nature , superior gifts and advantages are to be regarded chiefly as means of larger service to mankind . It is a perversion of their design to make them the grounds of larger demands upon those for whose service they were conferred . This is to make the professions and liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God into Mammon . The natural law of justice would seem to give the unlearned laborer the greater compensation for his work , as a sort of reparation for the manifold incumbrances and necessary social degradation which lie upon and overbear him . But the last condition of the rule I am considering , breathes the very spifit of feudalism- " the independent condition of the laborer . " This places the matter upon the naked ground of force , and makes the law of compensation the degree in which manhood is limited and fettered by animal necessities . Instead of ruling man by the lash applied to the back , the same end ' is substantially obtained by founding dominion upon the incessant and uncontrollable activity of the gastric juice . The subject might be further illustrated by reference to the inequality of the wages of different occupations , to the difference between productive and unproductive industry , manual toil and labor of mere oversight and inspection , between employments more or less sinecure , and those demanding constant activity ; in all of which labor is abridged of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inverse ratio to the amount and productiveness of the work done . In no occupation , in no workshop , or corn-field , or factory , is it he who is hired and receives wages , that grows rich ; but he who hires , and is paid no wages . Capital and the oversight of capital , instead of receiving only its just share , engrosses the largest part of the profits of all business ; and that capital not in the hands of him who has created it by his labor , but of him who has been able to purchase and speculate on the labor of others . The sailor exiles himself from home , wanders through all the solitudes of ocean , exposes his life to tempests and tornadoes , and all the dangers of the deep and contrasts of the seasons , that he may bring wealth from every clime to pour into the full coffers of his owners ; and of all the wealth which his labor and peril produce , he receives , perhaps , twelve dollars a month . The operative workman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receives from three to-in the very fortunate occupations-ten dollars a week . The capitalist who employs him , counts his wealth by thou .. sands , and looks down with curled lip upon the brother whose property he is appropriating to himself . The professional man , the corporation officer and manager , the counting-house proprietor , spurn with scorn that compensation for their labor which they do not blush to offer , and even higgle about with the workman , whose only wealth is in his muscles . The farmer 's son has ambitious visions of a higher destiny than his father 's ; he turns his back upon the degrading plough , and seeks it behind a counter or beneath a learned gown . If , in some of the reverses of fortune , which society boasts of as one of the compen. * sations of all injustice , the capitalist is compelled to earn an honest subsistence // in what he once deemed a menial occupation ; society deplores his sad lot , and reads edifying homilies upon the vanity of wealth ,  --  forgotten the moment after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of social equality , as expressed in the relation of labor and wages , the first answer is found to the inquiry , " Why have I none ? " Wages are undoubtedly a step in advance of the condition of enforced unpaid labor ; but only an advance-not an end . They imply substantially , only a little more decisively than servitude , a denial of manhood and its rights . They attach to the laborer , in the sentiment of society , reflected and responded to in his own heart , the same idea as servitude of inferiority and social degradation . If they were to be the ultimate condition of the laborer , it might well be inquired whether he had made a fortunate escape from serfdom , and might not find repose , and a serener lot , even in slavery . Another consideration must not be omitted . Wages are the laborer 's only resource for subsistence . his right to labor can not be denied without abridging his right of life . Yet society gives no guaranty of this . The right to labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earning wages is uncertain and contingent , depending upon the uncertainties and contingencies of trade , the state of the markets , the prosperity er failure of speculation ; - and worse , upon the arbitrary and tyrannical caprice of those who hold in their hands the laborer 's bread of life , who have the power to punish the utterance of a free opinion , an honest assertion of manhood , by withholding , or taking away from him occupation , his only resource for existence . Such is society 's protection to property . A great part of its legislation , and even the " perfection of reason , " its common law , is founded on , and aims at the security of these falsehoods . As the system originated in force and fraud , in the power of the strong and the subtleties of the cunning , so it can be maintained only by force , and by deceiving the masses as to the nature and extent of their rights . Hence , all our statute books bristle with laws recognizing property as of more worth than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a civil disqualification , and the cossess*on of it a condition of political rights ; creating wealth by special favor for a few , by modes which it is made a. crime for others to pursue ; giving to corporations and money-making associations unusual facilities for accumulating and concentrating wealth ; and in various other modes , making labor more and more dependent on capital . The circle of injustice to man , the laborer , is completed by making property , thus acquired , hereditary , placing it at the absolute disposal of its possessor after his hones have mouldered in the grave , and securing it to his heirs , if he should chance to die and make no sign . A society thus organized is , of necessity , a state of selfish competition for material interests , with little thought of generous and enlarged co-operation in the pursuit even of these . Man is not looked upon as a brother and a helper , but as a rival and an enemy in interests . Occupations and employments are hostile , circumventive , watchful for private advantage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking to profit by the ignorance and inexperience of others . The law of war , " all stratagems are just , " is the rule of business ; the legal maxim , caveat emptor , is the authentic scripture of trade . The acquisition of wealth is the chief good , and avarice the predominating passion of society . The great strife is Capital against Labor , in which the latter is , for the most part , passive , and the necessities and imperative wants and holiest affections of man are the fund upon which cupidity and cunning speculate . A show of political unity and equality may be maintained , hut social unity and equality are impossible . Society is a system of cliques , parties , professions , trades , with different and rival interests in most respects , and none united by any common bond of private interest . Industry is solitary , selfish , antagonistic . Man is placed in the isolation , without the freedom and independence , of the savage . Poverty is a necessary incident of such a social organization ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly and inevitably of the institutions of society . Poverty is the inevitable lot of multitudes ,  --  of multitudes , which the clearly induced necessity of things and constant experience testify , must be enlarging in every generation ,  --  of multitudes , who , for no fault of their own or their fathers in the third or fourth generation , have no inheritance but poverty and toil , and before whose earliest path // physical and spiritual obstructions lie yawning , like bottomless abysses , on every side . Poverty , in itself , is by no means the greatest of evils . So far as it consists in the mere deprivation of physical comforts , it is not always an evil . To the soul which has learned and feels its freedom and power , it is scarcely at all an evil ; - at the worst , of the ligbtest . The dry crust , eaten by the gushing fountain , is a full equivalent and compensation for all that luxury lavishes upon its feasts ,  --  as the leathern vesture of George Fox was , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal robes . The moment a man acquires the self-consciousness of manhood , he is the master of destiny . The environments of fortune are , in truth , mere accidents ; - with them , or without them , he is infinitely ricb , for the eternal treasures are his . But the development of this sentiment is the fruit of a culture , to which the condition of poverty presents constant and increasing obstructions . In one who is hon in destitution , and must , in the most favorable circumstan*es , waste the hopeful energies of youth , and the strength of manhood , in ceaseless toil , before he can redeem himself from the bondage of care for mere animal necessities , it will hardly be less than a miracle , if this self-consciousness should be awakened . Poverty , then , is an evil only in the consequences it brings in its train ; of which the worst and most bitter are the necessity of excessive toil , and the ignorance which that involves . Labor is a dignity and a blessing . It is an essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if from no surer premises , from the fact that he has a stomach and a pair of hands . The stomach can only be fed by the labor of the hands , and , as every man is furnished with these or*ans in both kinds , every man is created to labor . It is every man 's duty to feed his own mouth ; no man has a just claim upon another to do it for him . " If a man will not work , neither shall he eat , " is the rule in this behalf revealed by common sense , as well as by the more imposing inspiration . If any one violates this law , and eats without producing , or more than be produces , the harmony of things is disturbed , and somebody must suffer . Under the present arrangement of all societies , the snfferin* does not fall upon the transgressor . The drones are made kings , and fed with the choicest of the hive , instead of being driven off into the outer spaces . The great strife of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands . The demand for this kind of labor continually increases with the advancement of society in refinement and arts . More elegant mansions are to be built , more sumptuous furniture , finer apparel , daintier food , richer equipages , and an elaborate variety of costlier elegancies and luxuries , to be provided . All these create new demands upon labor , and at the same time extend the desire to escape from it . Those who possess these refinements , are they who , by superior intelligence or cunning , or the inheritance of . vealth from those who thus acquired it , have escaped from the common lot of labor , yet who require a vastly increased amount of the results of labor . The demands of their household and private splendor must be borne by labor  --  the labor of others , whose fruits they consume . Every luxury , possessed without having been earned , is a wrong to somebody , is enjoyed at the expense of injustice to a man-of the debasement of a man . For excessive toil debases man ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social organization which takes wealth out of the hands which create it , and gives it to those who have no share in producing it . Labor , though necessary , honorable and a blessing to the soul and body , is in its abuse a terrible punishment and curse , fulfilling literally the awful imprecation , " Cursed is the ground for thy sake . " It exhausts the body prematurely , blunts , dwarfs the intellect , makes it the mere slave of the hands , and reduces the man to only a little more intelligent machine than the plough or spinning-jenny , that is made up of wood and iron . The mind is enlarged only by exercise ; only those faculties grow which are kept active and cultivated . By the laws of the mysterious union between the material and spiritual in man , each requires , for their just and harmonious development , alternate se* sons of action and repose . If either of these is de . ied to either , it sufibrs , and its growth is stinted . Exces ive labor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a robbery of the laborer 's oppor* unities of moral and intellectual culture . The toils of the // day leave him at night weary and exhausted , incapable of anything but sleep-sleep " that is broken by no dream . " None but a heroic soul could grow but feeble , stinted , dwarfish ; nay , though the oaks bore books instead of acorns , and there were literally sermons in stones . Even the flowers in his path utter no prophecy in his ears , and he can not hear the eternal song of the stars . Resulting from the necessity of unnatural , excessive labor , and the intellectual obstructions it occasions , is the prevailing sentiment that labor in itself is disgraceful , and a curse . That sentiment is seldom expressed in words , and is avoided with very special care by popular orators , when they appeal , on the eve of an election , to the " intelligence of the hard-handed , huge-pawed yeomanry . " It is , nevertheless , the concealed spring of much of the life and activity of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the laborer is ackr*owledged to be a man , and the equal of all other men , the deathlike apathy concerning the existence of that institution of slavery which crushes the body and soul of the laborer under an iron yoke , but the secret thought of the leaders of opinion , that labor is the natural badge of slavery , that slavery and wages are but different modifications of the same natural and essential condition ? The sentiment is uttered , though unspoken , by the eager crowds everywhere found , who seek to escape from the manual occupations into the more respectable headcrafts ; in all the distinctions which are made in legislation , custom , or social opinion , between the handicraftsman and others ; in the rules of wages in all their details ; in every condition , other than that of being a man , annexed to the possession of political rights or social communion ; in the deference paid to mere wealth , to the ability to live without occupation , which is , in other words , to live without having fulfilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any honest labor can be menial in itself , or one kind of labor more honorable than another , if it is labor according to the worker 's gifts , and well and honorably done . If I accept a service from another , which I would not render him , my action affirms that I consider his office menial and disgraceful . If James gives John a *ixpence for a coat of Day &amp; Martin VOL XVI. - NO . LXXIX. 3 applied to his hoots , and will not polish John 's boots , and pocket John 's sixpence , when the fit occasion offers , James considers John 's office servile . If John , knowing that to be James 's opinion , brushes his boots , and takes his sixpence , and hesitates to require the same service for the same compensation , because James thinks it servile , John admits that James 's opinion is right ; John 's office is servile , and John , as a man , is degraded . Or , if John , possessing equal skill in his business with James in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timeexcluding the cost of materials-occupied in James 's service , and both parties are satisfied that the service is well remunerated , and James refuses to receive a sixpence as an equivalent for the same amount of time bestowed in John 's service , he looks upon that employment as dishonorable , and John , by giving mo:e as James 's right , acknowledges that it is so . The relation might be placed in various other lights . Now , essentially , no labor is menial , or dishonorable , which contributes to the rational enjoyment of man . In itself , the employment of James is no worthier than that of John , if John 's also contributes to the comfort and improvement of social existence . It is not the work a man does , but only the spirit in which he works , that makes it honorable or mean . Those reckoned the lowest offices of society , are readily performed for the relief of suffering , or at the demand of friendship , even by those who scorn them most as occupations . Love ennobles the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John the boot-black , or the poorest tinker , with his rude kit and coarse manipulations , may be greater in his work , if we consider the reality and endurance of things , than he whose voice chains senates in attention , or hushes tumultuous crowds in reverent stillness . This man 's work may perish with the dispersion of the crowd , while his is done for the eternal years , whose splendors illuminate and hallow it . In the present arrangement of the social state , scarcely a chance for this heroic work is permitted to the laborer . The dignity and respectability of the laborer are measured , almost exclusively , by the ability to pay , and the necessity of getting , the sixpence . Those employments are reckoned the most worthy of the // aspirations of young ambition , which offer it the best prospect of being able to be the giver of the coin . James is a gentleman , and John is a me ial , because the one has a sixpence , by which he can save himself from the dishonor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stomach whose evcr recurring hunger he can appease only by getting the sixpence into his hands on the required terms . Neither of them stands upon the ground of his manhood . The clear relation of brotherhood and equality is forgotten on both sides . The intrinsic di nity of labor is implicitly denied ; a dishonorable service has been demanded and rendered ; and they stand in an acknowledged relation of preeminence and inferiority . The worst effect of all this is the impairing of the sentiment of manhood in those thus condemned to hopeless toil , and re*arded as degraded by their social position ; and of the self-respect and reliance which are both the manifestation and security of that sentiment . The feeling of manhood , in its essence and highest development , approaches , if it he not identical with , religious reverence .

Whose fault is it , then , that men , thus fettered and borne down by unnatural limitations and denials , are ignorant , vicious , degraded , brutalized , slaves of sense and passion , and possessed in the depths of their souls by an indignant feelin5 of injustice , issuing in hatred and defiance of society ? Smothered , but unextin* uished , manhood thus unconsciously avenges itself upon the power that has crushed it ; and the evil seeds , which its unnatural institotion. * have sown in man 's heart , are returned to society in poisonous harvests . In vain does it build its penitentiaries and sca*. old ? . These are the crown and consummation o* all other injustice , and only aggravate the evils they proWss to remedy . Society has no right to punish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice of its organization-  --  the paternal character of its administration . Its jurisdiction is unjust and tyrannical , when not grounded on the truth of the relations it maintains with man . The evil influences of this unnatural state of things , are not confined to those who outwardly seem to suffer most . The worst effects are not physical , but moral . The other extreme has its peculiar forms of evil . The standard of virtue is not the standard of manhood . Good and evil are not reckoned from the absolute , but from the expedient . Decorums , proprieties , factitious fitnesses of position , rank , office , income , take the place of the universal law of the good and true . Man is here no more a man than in the other extreme ; but in his most favorable aspect , a wealthy man , a man of birth , an educated , official , or some other accidental man .

Contempt for the supposed inferior is a characteristic of such a society ; and in a truthful view of things , the want of reverence for humanity in any of its manifestations , is not a more venial crime , nor a less prolific seed of evil , than the loss of the sentiment of manhood itself . " Whosoever shall say to his brother , thou fool , ' shall be in danger of hell-fire . " Even the refiner cuts and elegances which indicate the distinction of the favored clasees , are a snare and a curse . Luxuries are not in themselves an evil ; they are good and desirable .

In a natural state of society , the burnished mirror of the present day would be intrinsically a better and fitter appendage of the female toilet , than the nicely scoured pewter platter , before which // the beauties of past generations adjusted their " amber-twisted ringlets . " A loftier communion than with mere dumb matter is awakened by the beautiful proportions of the Grecian Temple , or amid the solemn majesty of the Gothic Minster . These things are fitted to nourish the sentiment and the love of Beauty , one of the deepest instincts of man , in its true and natural unfolding , leading the soul to the love and worship of the true and good . But their true use is perverted by their becoming appropriated and exclusive possessions , sought for and valued chiefly as tokens of the more fortunate social conditions . They are made things of ostentation and idle vanity , pampering luxurious pride , and starving the nobler sentiments they are fitted to nourish . Their true significance is lost , and they remain only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human lot . The evils which afflict the favored classes , may be less gross in their outward exhibition ; but perhaps even more dangerous and debasing , more hopeless of reform , and make more utter wreck of manhood , for the very reason that the veil of decency and external decorum covers their grossness even from the eyes of their victims . In this exhibition of social injustice , and the oppressions of labor , it is not intended to impute any particular degree of blame to any individual , or class or party . The diffcrences of social condition are the results of maxims and laws which have been transmitted from all the past centuries , are consecrated by tradition and authority , interwoven with some of the most intimate convictions of opinion , and pleaded for , perhaps , even by the self-love of some who suffer from their operation , who endure with slight reluctance for the present , in the hope that their , or their children 's , turn may come to profit by them . They may b* defended by so many plausibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceive their radical injustice .

While these tliin*s are so , few will 1 ) 0 found who will hesitate to seize the opportunities . which the times affbrd , to mount above their fellows . Therefore , in laboring to reform social abuses , no hostility is felt towards individuals or classes , but only against the false institutions , which create classes , and make poverty an inevitable lot ,  --  which load this one with favors more than he can employ , and deprive thatother of his birthright of an equal share of hL Father 's bountiful and plenteous earth , and of the means of training himself for the holy and lofty services to which that Father has appointed him . No war is waged against the capitalist in behalf of the laborer , for the mere purpose , as a final end , of reversing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs ,  --  poverty not produced by misconduct ,  --  - it is of little consequence who are the individuals that suffer , or that enjoy ; especially since among us these distinctions are not likely to be hereditary through many generations . Social evils are not to be remedied by putting down those who thrive by abuses , and putting those who suffer , in their places . " The evil , " says La Mennais , " is in the injustice , and not that it is this one , rather than that , who profits by the injustice . Whoever is uppermost , man will still continue in a state of equal suffering , and the world remain unchanged . Good and evil will subsist in the same proportions ; they will only be differently arranged in respect to persons . One will mount , and another will descend . and that is all . " Nothing , therefore , will he gained by substituting one domination for another . The end to be aimed at , is to subvert all domination , to abolish the social institutions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus prevent any pro-eminence of one man over another , but what is derived from superior wisdom , or higher virtue . The object of the reformer should be so to re-organize society , as to make it the nurse of manhood , by removing the limitations of man 's freedom , and placing him in the most direct relations with the law of his nature , giving him full scope for the free unfolding of himself , and the clear exercise of his activity in that sphere to which his individual gifts direct him . The end is , in other words , so to arrange the conditions of society as to make it a true school for the eduoation of man . Society is now , and will he under any condition of human affairs , the school of man 's practical education .

All these are not evil . Society is not all a falsehood . Manifold are its influences , which are sanctified and holy , beneath which the strong soul , who truthfully seeks wisdom , may walk in safety , and find peace . But only the strong . For numberless are its temptations and adverse influences , which the weak find it impossible to resist . XVhat then shall be said , viewed in their relation to man 's culture , of society 's primary denials of manhood ; its falsehoods organized in institutions ; its insane rivalries and partizanships ; its fierce struggles for power ; its discordant sects and parties , with their mutual criminations ; its restraints upon free opinion and utterance ; its sordid , selfish , and solitary industry ; its isolated households ; its selfish competitions of office , trade , pleasure ; even its refinement generating on one side pride and contempt , and hatred and envy on the other ; its laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for magnificent villainy ; its administration of justice depending on prescriptive forms and subtle technicalities ; its gorgeous palaces built by withholding of his wages from the hireling on whose tattered hovel they look down in cold , glittering mockery ; its hereditary wealth won without toil , and received without deserving ; its pride , contempt , luxury , licentiousness , and multifarious vanities , contrasted with its poverty , ignorance , and broad-lying degradation ; its frequent spectacles of youth without culture and without hope , its manhood without respect , its age without reverence ; its *workhouses , prisons , and penitentiaries , where it consummates its injustice on its own victims ; its public wars and private feuds ; its merchandise of human flesh , and its shambles where man is bought and sold ; its engrossing avarice beating tumultuously through all its pulses , and filling all the currents of its life ,  - -  which measures Man , his intellect , affections , reputation , hopes , necessities , rights , good and evil , by Money , aud which dreams of heaven , not because its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its edifices are built with rubies and emeralds , and its harmonies are sung to the chords of golden harps ? " The world dishonors its workmen , stones its prophets , crucifies its saviors ; but bows down its neck to wealth however won , and shouts till the welkin rings again , Long lire violence and fraud ! " Few of the evils which men suffer are the results of an inevitable destiny . Man was made for society . Society is a law , a necessity of his being . Social existence , therefore , was not designed to be a state of antagonism , isolated interests and selfish competitmus , in which the strong and wise should override and oppress the weak and simple . Its tine mission is aid and mutual help , to protect the feeble against the powerful , and secure to every man the free equality of a common humanity . Founded in the , oneness of humanity amid the diversity of its forms and manifestations , its primary essential idea is brotherhood , and brotherly help ; not to take away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full enjoyment of the bounteous resources provided impartially in nature for human subsistence and improvement ,  --  to give to each freedom to grow , and attain to the stature of a perfect man . If such are the true functions of society , it is a mere absurdity ; yea , worse , it is to calumniate the Creator , to suppose that its conditions may not he so arranged as to fulfil them . If it do not fulfil them , its organization is false , or imperfect . Social evils are the fruits of the perversion of the natural laws of society . The existence of such evils is itself the evidence of a false and unnatural state . The only adequate remedy , then , the only true protection to labor , is a return to nature and justice . It has been seen that one of the prime sources of evil is the unjust distribution of property , which has imposed upon vast masses of mankind a life of ceaseless toil for mere animal necessities , made even their labor a sordid drudgery and dishonor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without which the individual must remain dwarfed of the just proportions of a man . That leisure is man 's right , and it is written in the book of Providence that the race shall one day attain it . Silently , through the ages of the past , where the laborer has been doomed to unrequited // toil and unpitied sufferin , the stripes of his scourging have been workil o ont and ha*tening his deliverance . The brass collar he s been tiled from the neck of " Gurth , the son of Beowulf , the horn thrall of Cedric , of Rotherwood . " But that is not the end . The silver gorget of " Wamba , the son of Witless , " still presses upon the neck of his descendants . That , too , shall he cast o * for humanity has not yet attained an ultimate state .

It may be that , from every new position he shall gain , he may have to turn hack upon his path , to build up the desolations , and repair the wastes he has made on his way thither . But thus it need not be . Thus it will not be , if they , to whom wealth and wisdom , or that which passes for wisdom , have given the direction of the world 's outward affairs , will set themselves in earnest to meet , or anticipate , with generous manliness , instead of foolishly striving to counteract , the march of events , the ordinances of Providence . Let political economy leave its poor fantastic problems of demand and supply , of furnishing employment to labor , and other speculative vanities . Let American tatesmen and politicians cease their idle babbling about the balance of trade and discriminating tariffs , and labor to carry out the authentic " American system , " by which alone the laborer can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , social equality , freedom of industry , and it needs no other protection from government , though all the world conspire against it . This is the true American **System which we are called to pursue , equally by the social principles we profess and the motives of mere selfish interest . The elevation of labor is the peculiar mission of our institutions , the basis of our history , the only hope of our public fortunes . Our national existence is the affirmation of the worth of man , as man , of the e sential equality , social and political , of all men . To the people , the laborer , the low as well as the high , are the fortunes of the nation committed . Every man is a laborer , or may become one . The capitalist of today may become the hireling of to-inorrow . It is the real interest of all to remove social abuses , since all in turn may be t . eir victims . In any event , many successive generations can not profit by them . There can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is interested in the well-being and just order of the present , in such a sense as no community of ancient or modern times has been . And for the future , love of posterity , the strong arid just motive for so much of the activity of society , would impel every man , without exception , if he viewed it wisely , to labor for a perfect social equality , as the surest provision for the welfare of his descendants . What , then , shall hinder a peaceful and perfect development of the theory of our institutions , the righting of the wrongs of man , the laborer , and the reconstruction of society , in fact as in form , upon the principles of immutable truth and justice ? History , experience , and prophecy , with voices of many tones but one accord , incite us to earnest , loving work for such a renovation , which all the past and the present are working together to consummate in the future .

Such a reorganization is practicable , without violating any of the rights acquired under the existing social arrangements ; that shall reconcile the conflicting claims of labor and capital , and secure a just distribution of wealth , without evoking any hideous agrarian spectre and chimera . It consists simply in the application of the principle of Association , which is the mainspring of so much of the activity of the present age , to the industrial affairs of society . I have no definite scheme to propose , but only offer some desultory hints . The labor andthe capital of the world are now , in a large degree , hostile , and their interests adverse . Capital is the master of labor . Labor itself is solitary , antagonistic , and inefficient . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // of labor , an incalculable amount , even in the employments most skilfully conducted , is wasted , and yields no return . In various ways , besides the appropriation , by a part , of an undue share of the products , industry is barren of results , its activity is dissipated in profitless toil , and it is made a drudgery and curse . By a judicious union and cooperation of the capital and labor of society , and an equitable distribution of the products of their united activity ; the evils which now encompass both , and weigh upon the latter with so terrible a pressure , would be avoided , and both incalculably benefited . By cedperation , a vastly increased amount of comfort for any one may be obtaincd at less expense , than is possible under the present disjointed , counteracting and hostile arrangements . It is capable of statistical demonstration , that if every one who is able , should labor only four hours a day , with the aid of the mechanical facilities already in the possession of society , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be done , and more perfectly than it now is . If this be so , what an enormous , oppressive and terrible wrong is inflicted upon the laborer who is cornpelled to labor twelve or fifteen hours a day , for little more than a bare subsistence , and to whom that is the destiny of his life ! Under a just distribution of labor and its products , the luxuries and embellishments of life would be indefinitely multiplied , and instead of being made the panders of the pride of a few , would be brought within the reach of all , and serve their true mission of refining the manners and sentiments of all . Until industry is made harmonious , helpful , brought into loving cc6peration , men will never know how rich and glorious a world they occupy ; what prodigality of wealth is laid up for them in the open storehouses of Providence ; how foolish , unnatural and insane is their unbrotherly struggle for the richest vintages and costliest bowls , while Nature has provided for every one golden cups and the waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equitable division of its fruits , would resolve and supersede most of the hitherto insoluble problems of political economy , with which Congresses are vexed , and nations disquieted . It would give to labor a substantial protection , which will be attempted for ever in vain by tariffs and discriminating duties . Production and consumption , instead of being dependent upon commerce , and * thousand unknown and incalculable contingencies , would be brought into fixed , permanent , and manifest relations . The number of consumers would be indefinitely increased , by the conversion of millions of laborers , whose demands are now restricted within the limits of the most indhpensable physical wants , into independent workmen , in whom the wants of sentiment and taste no longer clamor for supply in vain . There would be an end to the unsatisfactory inquiries concerning the causes , prevention and remedies of high and low prices , over-production and scarcity ; and the endless controversies about specie and paper currencies would vanish into thin air . Above all , and as the end of all , man will obtain leisure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ennobled and strengthened thereby to the most appropriate culture , and clearest development of his moral and intellectual powers .

It is a pious duty to rescue the fast perishing memories of the good and true men , to whose labors in all that constitutes the real glory of a State , the Republic owes so much .

The melancholy event , that has so lately bereaved the Democracy of Pennsylvania , presents an appropriate occasion for offering to the readers of this Magazine a sketch , however slight and unworthy , of some members of a family , the history of which is most intimately blended with that of the party , to whose interests these pages are devoted . Henry Melchior Muhlenberg , from whom is descended all of the name in the United States , was born at Eimbeck in Saxony , in the year 1711 . The early death of his father , who exercised some judicial functions upon which the support of his family depended , arrested the education of the boy , and at a very tender age cast him upon the resources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic adversity and affliction was formed that apostolic character of courageous energy combined with lowly humility , of patience under suffering , and of hopeful perseverance , that so greatly distinguished his after life .

Always , however , self-relying and self-sustained , he did not permit himself to cat the bread of charity , but by imparting instruction to others honorably obtained the means of instruction for himself . At G*ttingen his merits as a scholar drew the marked attention of Gesner ; whilst his active practical piety , devoting itself to the spiritual illumination of the darkest and most neglected portions of society , procured him the blessings of the poor , and the grateful notice of the authorities of the University . It was here that he originated a society among the Theological Students , for the reclamation of those wretched children , the vices and crimes of whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From Gottingen , where his reputation as a scho-. lar and his amiable and benevolent disposition had raised him powerful friends , he removed , under the auspices of the Count Reuss , whose chaplain he was , and of the Count Heukel , to Halle . There , as at Gbttingen , he was constantly engaged in the abodes of misery , in the Hospital and in the Orphan House , ministering to the souls of the sick and the afflicted , or giving instructions to the poor . The friendly and intimate relations that he formed at Halle , with some of the most eminent men of that University , with Franke , with Cellarius , and with the Inspector Fabricius , were never interrupted during their lives , but continued to cheer and encourage him in the arduous mission , to which their confidence invited and promoted him . At the earnest solicitation of those friends , he accepted9 in the year 1741 , the appointment of Missionary to the German Lutherans of Pennsylvania . What personal sacrifices he made in leaving Europe , in abandoning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him in the church and in the Universities of his fatherland , he esteemed as nothing compared with the duty of accepting this appointment . The field of his labors was then one vast wilderness , in which , rude and un // Jan. reclaimed as was the face of nature , it was not more wild and desolate than that portion of its inhabitants who constitoted his particolar charge . The emigration from Germany to the British Colonies , hut more especially to Pennsylvania , increasing annually from its beginning in the latter part of the seventeenth century , had , previous to 1741 , become very great . Many thousands of the Pennsylvania colonists , scattered sparsely over a vast extent of country , were German Lutherans . Among all this people there was not at that time one altar or one priest consecrated to the service of God . Here and there some outcast , whose life was a reproach to his profession , assumed the office of the Ministry but to bring Religion into further disrepute . A generation had grown up , native of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Religion were unknown . In fact that devotional spirit , one of the finest characteristics of the German race , was well nigh extinguished among this German people . Such was the field upon which the missionary , ardent and zealous in his calling , entered a solitary laborer . The work before him he stopped not to measure , hut began it at once . Of his toilsome progress , of his triumphs over every obstacle , this is not the place to speak . With what success he cried in the wilderness , let those venerable churches , the just pride of the Lutherans , monuments of his efficient zeal , founded by his hand , declare . And when , years after his arrival , there came to his assistance other missionaries , with what astonishment did they behold the results of his labors . The church which he planted like a mustard seed , had become a tree under whose wide spreading branches were gathered the lost and scattered sheep of his fold . At this distance of time and in the present improved condition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perils of a life passed as was that of this devoted man . The discharge of his ordinary duties among his remote congregations must have been oppresBive , but they were light compared with his duties to the church at large . From New York to Georgia , wherever there arose a difficulty , his fatherly presence and counsels were invoked , and never were withheld . No consideration of the personal inconvenience of those then dangerous and difficult journeys ever held him back . The education of Dr. Muhlenberg qualified him , in an especial manner , to he the head and founder of the American Mission . He preached in all the languages in which the doctrines of the German Reformation were taught . he New York he frequently held forth in three languages on the same Sabbath . Besides a profound acquaintance with theology , he was well versed in other departments of science . In medicine and surgery his aid was sought extensively ; indeed , he practised them for the benefit of the poor . To these were added most of those polite accomplishments which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to render him the delight and ornament of society . But great as were his qualifications in these respects , he was endowed with others of far more immediate importance to the success of his labors . To a disposition the most kind and gentle were united a firmness and integrity of purpose that could not be shaken . His knowledge of the human heart , deceitful as it is , was such that he was said " to read the character of men as in an open book ; " and to this quickness of perception , perhaps more than to any other gift , he owed his extraordinary powers as a teacher . His manner of speaking , adapting itself to the nature of his audience , was such as could equally rivet the attention of a Synod or of the rude congregations of the frontier : he could appeal with equal force and effect to the head and to the heart of man . With all these rich endowments of Nature and of Art , he was a meek , lowly and humble Christian , whose daily walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachings . To the poor , the weak , the friendless , the fatherless , he was a refuge : his charity was free as the liberal air-his good counsels open to all who sought them . For forty-five years this venerated man labored in accomplishing the purposes of his mission . 1-Je had lived to see that church which he alone planted grow into honor and usefulness : its numerous clergy distinguished for learning and piety-its laity for all the firtoes that appertain to the true Christian character , He had exhorted and encouraged the people of his charge to // stand by their country in the darkest hours of the Revolution , and had given to them , in his sons , examples of patriotism worthy of their admiration and imitation . At length , covered with years and honors , on the 7th of October , 1787 , this apostle of the Germans in America went down to the grave , mourned by his country as a patriot , by the church as its father and its founder . The three sons he left behind him were worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him the promise of blessings upon the seed of the righteous . Of these sons the eldest was Peter , who was horn on the 1st of October , 1746 , at the Trappe , in Montgomery county , Pennsylvania . When he had attained the age of sixteen , he was sent with his two younger brothers , Frederick Augustus and Henry Ernestus , to Ilalle for the purpose of education . The discipline of the school being too severe for his habits , he took occasion to run away , and , it is said , enlisted himself in some German regiment , from which he was with difficulty extricated by a British officer , who recognized the young soldier as an old American acquaintance , obtained his discharge , and brought him back to America as his secretary . IReturned home , his father directed his education , and having prepared him fo the ministry of the Swedish Lutheran church , which requires Episcopalordination , he went out to England in 1772 with the late Bishop White , then also a candidate for holy orders , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of London and Ely . Upon his return to America , after a short engagement in New Jersey , he fixed his residence in Virginia , in charge of several parishes in Dunmore county . The differences between the colonies and the mother country had already assumed a serious aspect . Men were taking sides . The lines between the friends of the country and of the crown were drawn . His clerical brethren were for the most part torieshe and a few others ardent and active whigs . The political and personal hostilities of the tories towards him but inflamed his zeal . He was sent as a delegate from his county to the 1-louse of Burgesses . The Revolution broke out . Washington , who knew his worth , urged him to take a military command , and the Eighth Virginia Regiment being tendered to him , he accepted it . Ascending his pulpit for the last time , he preached upon the duties men owe to their country : in the course of his sermon he told his hearers that " there was a time for all things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and that now was the time to fight . " After the services were concluded , he laid aside his gown in the pulpit , and appearing in full uniform , read his commission as colonel , and ordered the drummers at the door to heat up for recruits . He had no difficulty in forming his regimenthis parishioners crowded to its standard in great numbers . As soon as it was formed , he was ordered to march for the protection of Charleston . His first campaigns were served in Georgia and South Carolina . Those campaigns were severe schools of untried military merit ; but at the battle of Sullivan 's Island he justified the good opinion of Washington , and dunn0 their subsequent progress , established a high character for conduct and valor . Devoted to the comfort and welfare of his soldiers , seeking for himself no exemption from their privations , never forgetting that those whom he commanded were men and brethren , he inspired among them a deep feeling of attachment to his person , and of cheerful obedience to his commands . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love of a disciplined soldiery . Being promoted on the 21st of Feb. , 1777 , to the rank of Brigadier General , he was ordered to the North , and took an active part in the campaign of that year in Pennsylvania . At the battle of Brandywine on the 11th of September , his and Weedon 's brigade sustained the brunt of the action , after the fortune of the day had declared against our arms . On the 8th of October , at the battle of Germantown , his command , having advanced further into the town than any other part of the army , was in the hottest part of the action . Upon the retreat he covered the left wing . On this occasion he was under the necessity of shooting a British officer with his own hand . The officer had seized a musket and fired at him once , and was in the act of reloading it and giving personal directions " to pick him off , " when the General , drawing a pistol , shot him dead upon the spot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle of Mon // mouth . He commanded the reserve at the storming of Stony Point in 79 . When Leslie invaded Virginia in 1780 he was opposed to him with the chief command . Upon the after movement on the same State by Benedict Arnold and Philips , he acted under the Baron Steuben , and when Cornwallis entered Virginia he was next in command to Lafayette . During this last campaign , hy his prompt action , though without orders , at the battle of Green Spring , be rescued the Pennsylvania Line from impending destruction . Services like these , rendered over almost every part of the wide field of the Revolutionary contest , and during the whole time of its continuance , were fitly terminated at the Siege of Yorktown . In that siege he commanded the first brigade of Light Infantry , to which belongs the glory of furnishing the American division of the troops that carried the British redoubts by assault . The surrender at Yorktown virtually ended the struggle . He , however , continued in the army until it was disbanded ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Major General-an honor well earned on many a hard fought field , the highest with which his country could testify her sense of his military services . Upon his return to civic life , he took *ap his abode in Pennsylvania , and was immediately elected a member of the Supreme Executive council of that State . In 1785 , he was chosen Vice President of the Commonwealth , Dr. Franklin at the same time being chosen President . To this office he was reelected the two following years . Upon the adoption of the Federal constitution he was elected , the vote being then by general ticket , to the first Congress of the United States . Of that body he was an active and useful member , always to be found at his post , and distinguished for his resistance of every measure that in his judgment was of an anti-republican tendency . He was also a member of the third and sixth Congresses . During the period of General Muhlenberg 's congressional service , the political parties were developed , which have ever since , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day they were known as Federal and Republican , and then , perhaps more than at any subsequent time , did party spirit run highest . As a leader of the Republican party in Pennsylvania , General Muhlenberg took an early and decided stand . He was not a man to flinch from the responsibilities of his party position ; and bringing to it , as he did , great weight of character and of personal popularity , his influence in building up and sustaining the ascendency of his party was felt and freely acknowledged . In 1799 , as in 1844 , the Gubernatorial election in Pennsylvania was made the battle ground of the approaching Presidential contest . It is matter of history what means were resorted to in order to overawe the Republicans of that State upon that occasion . The part that General Mublenberg then took was admitted at the time to have mainly contributed to the success of the Republican candidate , Thomas McKean . The result in Pennsylvania saved the Republican party . In the electoral college of 97 he voted for Jefferson for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the House of Representatives , when the election of President came into that body , he voted for him on every one of the thirty-six ballotings that were held . In 1801 , he was elected to the United States Senate , his seat in which he resigned in the summer of that year . In the following winter , Jefferson appointed him Supervisor of the Revenue for the District of Pennsylvania  --  and in 1803 , Collector of the Port of Philadelphia , which office he held at the time of his death , on the 1st of October , 1807 . Gen. Muhlenberg was one of those characters which in revolutions always find their level . He was by nature a soldier . The frolic incident of his youth indicated the turn of his mind . He entered the church , doubtless with as sincere and honest purposes as any of her ministry , but the agony of his country called him from the altar with a voice that touched every chord of hi* soul . The time for fighting had come  --  the time to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country ; rebellion against tyrants was obedience to God  --  and so feeling and so thinking he went forth from the Temple to the Field . He was brave and generous to a fault  --  a proper Brigadier to Wayne and Greene , who loved him . Cool in danger , sound in judgment , indifferent to fame , zealous in duty-these were // his distinguishing traits as a soldier . His virtues in private and in political life were all cognate to these . The second son of Dr. Muhlenberg , Frederick Augustus , was horn at the Trappe on the 2d of June , 1750 . He remained at the University of Halle some years after his brother Peter had left , and acquired a very finished education . His father 's wishes and his own inclination coinciding , he followed the theological course of that celebrated school , and was ordained in the ministry of the Lutheran Church in Europe . On his return to America , he took charge of a remote country congregation , from which he was soon called to a church in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high and well merited . In him were singularly united all the qualities that adorn and dignify the clerical character-piety , education , eloquence , polished manners . His ministry , however , in the midst of its usefulness , was suddenly arrested , soon after the outbreak of the Revolution , by the taking of New York . The ardor of his Whig principles , not less than the activity of his whole family , rendered his name obnoxious to the British , and imposed upon him the necessity of seeking personal safety by flight from that city . Passing into Pennsylvania , he took up his residence near the place of his birth , and for the following two or three years was in charge of a congregation or assisted his venerable father . The progress of the great contest during this time , though it had reached its lowest depths of gloom and despondency , did not in the least dishearten him . He was full of hope and confidence in the destinies of his country , and bent every energy of his mind to the advancement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that in 1779 the Legislature of Pennsylvania , to testify their sense of his service , elected him a delegate to the Continental Congress , and in the next year renewed that honorable appointment . Having served those two terms , he became constitutionally ineligible to Congress for the ensuing three years . But the people of Philadelphia county , who had observed his work as a public man in the national councils , not willing to lose his services , immediately sent him to the Legislative body of the State , upon taking his seat in which he was chosen its Speaker . This confidence of the people , and this honor at the hands of their Representatives , he enjoyed for three successive years the jealous spirit of the constitution of 1776 allowed no more . By that constitution , which , though framed in the spirit of pure and antique Democracy , was , from its curiously complicated machinery , impracticable as a system of organic law , there was created a supervising power in the State , designated the Council of Censors . This body could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met , its authority extended over every department of government , even over the constitution itself . To this council , the only time it was ever convened , Mr. Mublenberg was elected , and was called , by its unanimous choice , to preside over its deliberations . It consisted of such men as Wayne , and St. Clair , and Bryan , and Smilie , and Finley . It was indeed a body whose members were " noted for wisdom and virtue . " The journal of its proceedings presents matter full of interest and instruction to the student of political history . In this council , Mr. Muhlenberg took the lead in favor of calling a convention to revise the constitution , and to his early exertions and ablereports the call of the convention of 1790 is largely attributable . That convention , transcending the objects of its original projectors , overthrew not merely the forms but the principles of the Revolutionary constitution . It is , however , a striking illustration of the selfpreserving tendency of Democratic institutions , that after a forty-eight years ' trial of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen back upon most of the rejected principles of the constitution of 1776 . In 1787 , he was elected a delegate to the State Convention , called to consider the Constitution of the United States , and act upon its ratification . He was chosen President of this body , and exerted his influence in favor of adopting the federal constitution . Being elected a member of the first Congress , that of l789-91-on the assembling of the House , his long and eminent parliamentary services indicated him as the proper person to be raised to the Speakership . A happier selection could not have been made . The forms of legislation , then about to be settled , required in the first Speaker , all // that experience and practical acquaintance with the details of business and the modes of conducting it , which he possessed . The journals of that Congress attest his merits in all these respects . He served in the House of Representatives during the whole of Washington 's administration , and had the honor of being called to the Speakership a second time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that period , he took a very prominent and useful part . Politically , he was a Republican , and though a party leader , yet be seems to have been above the control of mere partisan motives and influences . A striking illustration of this characteristic was aflbrded by him on the occasion when Congress was solicited to pass the laws necessary to carry Jay 's Treaty into effect . Whatever may have been the defects of that Treaty , it will not now be denied , that they were at the time grossly exaggerated and distorted , and that the refusal to pass those laws would , in all probability , have involved us in a war at that critical moment of our national existence when we most needed peace . The excitement with regard to the Treaty , within the halls of Congress , was scarcely less intense than that which was agitating the whole people without . A resolution affirming the expediency of passing those laws was before the committee of the whole House , of which Mr. Muhlenberg was Chairman . The question upon reporting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it-the vote stood even-every eye was fixed upon the Chair-every breath was suspended -- hope or fear racked every breast-he voted aye . Death to himit may be life to his country . From the effects of that vote he never recovered . It destroyed his relations with his constituency for ever . That it was given under an imperious sense of duty and from the most correct motives , was not doubted-his whole life and character forbade a doubt . Though he forfeited the popular favor , he did not lose the confidence of the eminent patriots with whom he had been so intimately associated in Pennsylvania politics . Not long after leaving Congress , he was appointed by Governor INlifilin , Register of the Land Office , in which he was continued by Governor McKean , until his decease in 1802 . The third son of Dr. Muhlenherg , Henry Ernestus , who it has been mentioned went to Europe for his education , with his elder brothers , remained at Halle until he completed his course of studies . Two years after his return , being only nineteen years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ministry . He was soon elected the third preacher of the Philadelphia congregations , in charge of which he remained up to the taking of that city by the British . The influence that he had exercised among his people in favor of the Revolution , had been too open and marked to escape the malignant observation of the Tories . The most atrocious threats had been uttered against him , and as the capture of the city placed his enemies in a position to gratify their malice , it became expedient for him to withdraw . His flight was not without dangers and adventures . For the several years ensuing , being without a ministerial charge , he devoted himself entirely to scientific pursuits , in the departments of botany and mineralogy . Though every field of nature was more or less explored by him in the course of his life , botany was ever that one in which he delighted most to labor . His extensive correspondence with the most celebrated naturalists in Europe and of America , and with the various foreign learned societies , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in itself a noble contribution to the cause of science . He published several works on botany , the principal of which are entitled Catalogus Plantarum , and Descriptio liberior Graminum , the latter especially considered an essay of great accuracy and laborious research . Besides these direct contributions , he promoted the interests of science in other efficient ways . He was ever ready with friendly counsel to instruct the youthful votary , to encourage him when his heart failed , and to the extent of his means to assist him in extremities . With the true feeling and spirit , whilst lie adored nature as a mother , he loved every one who cultivated her as a brother . In the language of the late Dr. Baldwin- " He was not only worthy of imitation for that most active zeal and industry which characterized him the Linnccus of our couetry , but also for that unbounded liberality of sentimentwhich he uniformly manifested // Biocrraphical 711emoir of the late Henry A. Mulilenberg. towards his contemporaries , and which ought ever to distinguish the genuine Christian philosopher and naturalist from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own fame even at the expense of those around him . " A man of his particular habits and caste of thought , could not he expected to take an active part in politics ; he , however , always manifested a deep interest in the progress of events . A Whig of the Revolution , a Republican of 99 , the personal friend and correspondent of Jefferson and other leading Democrats , he continued through life firm and unshaken in his attachment to the principles of the Democratic party . From 1780 to the day of his death , in May , 1815 , he was in charge of the Lutheran congregation in the city of Lancaster . As a divine he enjoyed the veneration of his people , the highest consideration of his church , the love and confidence of all Christians . Tolerant of others ' opinions , decided in his ownindulgen t of the follies , stern in his reproof of the vices , of society-inviting intimacy by the childlike simplicity of his manner , repelling rude familiarity with dignity-conversant in* all learning , yet the delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrated that old school of gentlemen and of scholars which is fast passing away . Having thus presented these faint sketches of the lives and characters of those from whom the late Henry A. Mnhlenberg derived his honored name , it remains to show how worthily he sustained and added to its reputation . In speaking of those long numbered with the dead , the mind addresses itself to the contemplation of their memories with a philosophic calmness not unfavorable to a just and perfect appreciation of their merits . Written under the influence of this state of feeling , the former part of this memoir was an easy and a grateful labor ; what follows , weighed down as the heart of the writer is by the recent loss of that dear friend , whose portraiture he is about to attempt , can be no more than a dim outline , seen through a tearful eye , drawn by a faltering hand . henry Augustus Muhlenberg , the eldest son of the venerable and learned man , to whom the last brief notice was devoted , was born at Lancaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elementaVOL. xvi. - No . Lxxix. 6 ry instruction , received immediately under the direction of his father , was of the most thorough and liberal kind . It embraced a wide range of languages and mathematics ; and as , for the greater part of its course , he enjoyed the peculiar advantage of private tuition , his progress was much in advance of his years . That he never entered a college was owing to the fact , that before the period of life at which young men ordinarily are sent to such an institution , he had completed the usual collegiate studies . Brought up in a family so essentially Republican as was his , and enjoying the unbounded affection of his uncle , General Muhlenberg , with whom his relations were like those of a son , it was natural , particularly in high party times , that he should , in early boyhood , adopt the political principles of those he loved and reverenced . Accordingly , during the extraordinary scenes that ensued on the passage of the Sedition Law , when the Germans of Pennsylvania were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardor and activity of youth , throwing himself into the contest . Even then , but sixteen years old , writing in defence of McKean and Jeflbrson , his pen gave promise of the potent influence it was in his after-life to wield over the German mind of his native State . Having attained an age when his reason could give its deliberate assent to the wishes of his father , he was sent to New York to enter upon the study of theology , under the auspices of his uncle , the Rev. Dr. Kunze , a divine eminent for his profound learning and exemplary piety . The devoted zeal which he exhibited in preparing himself for the ministry , inspired the highest expectations of his friends and of the church . These expectations were ful* ly realized in his subsequent career . In 1802 , having been licensed as a candidate of the ministerium , he accepted the charge of the congregation in Reading . The connection there formed , continued a union of uninterrupted harmony between the pastor and people for twenty-seven years . How well and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is best known to those thousands of living witnesses whose hearts he filled with the knowledge and the love of God , and whose regard for his memory is as tender as that of children for a parent . 1845. // Great as was the love of his congregation , it was equalled hy the honor and esteem in which he was held hy his clerical brethren . By these he was at different times called to fill the secretaryship and treasurer*hip of the Synod , and finally , hy their unanimous suffrage , was raised to the presidency of that highest council of the church , in which he was continued , hy successive re-elections , as long as the constitution would permit . In the councils of his church , his character for integrity and moderation gave him a just and prominent influence . With an energy equal to any emergency , still was he ever the friend of peace and conciliation , hy the exercise of whose gentle arts he well understood how to allay discord and dissension . In seasons of difficulty , the advice of no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon with greater confidence  --  a confidence often justified by salutary results . As a pulpit orator , it has been said by enlightened and competent jud es , that Mr. Muhlenherg was the subject of general and deserved admiration . Indeed the many invitations that he received from the churches of the large cities , would indicate his contemporary reputation in this respect . The favorable judgment of the people was confirmed hy the severer criticism of the ministry-his eloquence was alike acceptahle to both . A commanding presence , a deep sonorous voice , a manner earnest but graeeful , prepossessed the senses of his hearers . His mastery of all the rich resources of the German languages , his evidently intense interest in his subject , the copious learning with which he informed the mind , the glowing warmth with which he touched the heart , achieved the rest . Always instructive , he was never merely didactic . His power over the feelings was never exercised in such a way that the judgment could not sanction the emotions excited . Towards the year 1827 , the health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pursuits , he expressed a determination to withdraw from the charge of his congregation , and retire upon a farm . This resolution was no sooner made known than the attention of the Democracy of old Berks was directed to him as a man in every way qualified to represent the district in Congress . his quiet and consistent support of Democratic measures , had been observed for more than a quarter of a century , his honesty and capacity were known to all . Pressed by numerous friends , he at last yielded to the wishes of the people , and in the following year was elected a representative to the Twenty-First Congress . In June , 1829 , in a letter addressed to the Synod , every line of which shows how sadly he took the step , he resigned his ministerial office . The resolution of the Synod upon the occasion , bore ample testimony to the regard in which Mr. Muhlenberg was held by that body , and bade him an affectionate God-speed in his new career . He entered public life , perhaps , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To have toiled up through the devious and crooked paths of the lower politics would have been revolting to his manly and ingenuous nature . The petty intrigues and paltry arts , by which unworthy ambition daily rises to place and power , were abhorrent to his soul . It would have disdained an elevation purchased by selfabasement . If he could not have taken his seat in the councils of the nation , uncontaminated by the servile labors of which that exalted station is too frequently the object or the reward , he had never sat there . The Congress to which he was elected , was filled with the earnest and determined spirits whom the recent revolution in the politics of the country had called into action . The Democratic party , rent by the growth of factions , . and long sunk into inactivity by the non-resistance of its ancient enemy , required , and had found a leader , whose popularity overwhelming all rivals , would restore to the party its unity , and whose iron nerve would not shrink from drawing anew the almost forgotten lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had proved faithless to its mission . The time of its regeneration had come . The leader of the new movement was Andrew Jackson . No timid time-server , no man of doubts and fears , was in his proper sphere under such a chief , or in such a Congress . The hour was at hand which required hearts as brave , and heads as cool , as the exigencies of desperate times had ever y demanded . In that Congress , Mr. Muhlenberg was , at an early day , regarded as amongst the sternest and most // inflexible of Democrats ; a man wise in council , resolved in action . If he was inexperienced in the forms of legislation , he understood thoroughly its objects , and , as he came to act upon these , applying to them always the severest tests of principle , and throwing himself boldly upon whatever ground was that of right , regardless of expediency , he established in the first session a position in the House , and an influence in the party , which few men attain in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail of attracting the respect and confidence of General Jackson . In the arduous work before him , the President needed friends , high-souled and generous , upon whose honesty , energy , and courage he could rely in whatever extremity , and in Mr. Muhlenberg found one in whom his highest trust was never misplaced . An occasion upon which Mr. Muhlenberg signally displayed the fearless independence of his character , and his sagacity as a Internal Improvements . Opinion in Pennsylvania was at the time settled in favor of the so-called American System , of which a gigantic scheme of Canals and Roads , a High Tariff and a National Bank , constituted the parts . The delegation from Pennsylvania , with but two exceptions , voted for the appropriation : Mr. Muhlenberg and his colleague , Mr. Frey , against it . Not only did he vote aiainst it , lie stood side by side with James K. Polk , and those true-hearted men stood almost alone , in resisting the fatal measure in debate . In a speech replete with clear and sound views , he exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity for an onerous tariff , to which the appropriation asked for was but the initiatory step . The voice of warning was raised in vain . The combination of local interests , having many similar projects in reserve , triumphed . The bill passed . The Veto by which it was arrested , taking the same grounds of objection that had been urged in the House , was , after a severe struggle , sustained by Congress , and approved by the country . The fate that has since overtaken many of the States , would unquestionably , but for the defeat of this bill , have fallen upon the nation . On the Tariff question , the opinions of Mr. Muhlenberg , whilst decided , were moderate . lie considered permanency in the system as of more importance than the amount of protection . In a speech that he delivered in opposition to the Compromise Act , he advocated the adjustment of duties so as to furnish revenue for an economical administration of government , with incidental protection to such interests as are truly national . Upon this basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank of the United States arrayed itself against the administration , and produced those extraordinary convulsions in the business of the country , by which it sought to coerce Congress through the sufibrings of the people , to grant a renewal of its charter , Mr. Muhienberg stood fast and firm in his hostility tothe institution . Through allthe stages of that memorable conflict , he never for a moment wavered : others might give way to their fears , produced by the terrors around them , he was made of sterner stuff . He was , during those portentous times , in the emphatic words of a distinguished senator , a pillar of strength in support of the administration . It was he , who , on the 18th of February , 1834 , when the country had been agitated for more than two months by the daily appeals of the friends of the bank , moved the previous question , and , by its decisive operation , finished a contest , held too long in doubt. * Mr. Muhlenberg occupied his seat in Congress for nine years , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that time he maintained a character for integrity of action and purity of motive , which never was questioned .

He was not a frequent speaker ; questions only of the gravest import drew him out . When he did speak , however , he was always listened to with the most marked attention , and to whatever subject he addressed himself ; took an enlarged and comprehensive view of its more important features . His speeches were concise , forcible , and direct ; not studied and elaborated hy rules of art , but thrown off as occasion seemed to require the effort , the productions of matured reflection and earnest conviction . In truth , German had been for so many years the language of his profession , and of his social intercourse , that he felt an embarrassment in the formal use of English , of which he never could entirely divest himself , though nothing in his diction or accent implied his German origin and education . As for his public , so he was much esteemed for his private qualities . A party man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he , nevertheless , by his generosity , frankness , and kindliness of disposition , commanded the general friendship of his fellow members . It was an effort in which he never relaxed his exertions , to soften the asperities of politics by the cultivation of the refining charities and courtesies of life . In the year 1835 , Mr. Muhlenberg permitted his friends to use his name as a candidate for the governorship of Pennsylvania . The excellent man , who then filled that office , had been an incumbent of it for two terms , a period which the later practice of the Democracy , since the days of Snyder , had fixed as the limit of service , and which subsequently to 1835 has received a constitutional sanction . Much warmth and excitement were elicited during the progress of the canvass , and when at length the convention which was to make a nomination met at Harrisburg , it was soon found that the eager strife of interest and passion would Th*der its deliberations nugatory .

On the day after this dissolution , that portion of the convention which had been friendly to Governor Wolf ; nominated him , and his friends afterwards declining to take part in the election of delegates to meet at Lewistown , a full convention met at that place , and placed Mr. Muhlenberg also before the people . The candidates thus presented were in the hands of their friends . The fatal consequences of the division were apparent , and no man more sincerely wished and sought an accommodation of difficulties than did Mr. Muhlenberg . He went as far towards accomplishing that object as propriety or a due regard for the honor of his friends would permit , but without effect . Both candidates submitted their claims to the people , and the election resulted in the choice of Mr. Ritner by a plurality vote . The bad feeling engendered in this contest seemed likely to survive the election , and to produce a permanent schism in the party . With every day the hreach was widening . Violent partizans were hurling at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failing to teach them the necessity of union and harmony , filled them with bitterness and hate . In the midst of all this , the Presidential election of 1836 was coming on . One section had its electoral ticket in the field ; the other was about to form one . It was not to be hoped that either would give way to the other . Mr. Muhlenberg could not look on this state of things with indifference . He owed too much to the Democracy , and loved it too well to see it fall away into miserable factions without making an honest effort to avert the calamity . Not doubting that his friends had right and justice on their side , he addressed them with the feelings of a patriot , and entreated them to set the example of magnanimity by concurring in support of the ticket already formed . The voice of the man they honored , they cheerfully obeyed ; and in the ensuing campaign , both sections , turning their united arms against the common enemy , in the ardor of battle , soon forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Constitution was agitated , Mr. // Muhlenberg took very decided ground in favor of the mostradical amendments and that in direct opposition to the inclinations of the people of Berks county upon the subject . The German population , averse to changes , regarded with veneration a system under which they had prospered , and were willing to endure its defects rather than submit the remedy of them to the innovating temper of the times . His zealous advocacy of reform , under these circumstances , is but another illustration of the independence of his character as a public man . After the inauguration of Mr.Van Buren , in 1837 , he tendered to Mr. Muhlenberg a seat in the cabinet , as Secretary of the Navy , and subsequently the mission to Russia , both of which the state of his affairs at that time compelled him to decline . Upon the creation of the mission to Austria , in 1838 , the President selected him , as peculiarly fitted to discharge its duties ; and upon his nomination to the Senate , he received the unanimous confirmation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailed for Europe , taking with him his wife and only daughter . The opening of diplomatic relations with Austria had for its principal object the introduction of American cotton and tobacco into the dominions of that vast empire , from which they have heretofore been excluded . An insuperable difficulty in the way of any negotiation is the fact that tobacco is extensively cultivated in Hungary , and is , besides , a government monopoly . The fixed condition of things in the old , overpopulous , and indebted states of Europe , renders them slow in changing their mercantile policy or in hazarding any experiment . It may be years before our diplomatic agents in this mission succeed ; but whenever the correspondence of Mr. M. shall be published , it will be found that he laid the foundation of that success . Whilst he was abroad , he visited all the more interesting parts of Italy , Germany , and Switzerland . His descriptions of the men and manners of those countries , with which he was wont to delight and instruct his friends , evinced the closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of letters , he was constantly engaged during his travels in making additions to his fine collection of booksthe rich accumulation of the learning and taste of several generations . He remained abroad nearly three years , and was at last recalled at his own request . On his return home in December , 1840 , lie had the inex*cssible gratification to find that absence had in no wise diminished the affectionate regard in which not merely the Democracy , but the whole people , of Berks county , had been used to hold him . Au immense concourse of his fellow citizens awaited his arrival , which they greeted with every mark of lively and tumultuous joy . Freed from the cares and the distractions of public employment , revered by the people , surrounded by an amiable and accomplished family , of which he was the idolized father , his society courted by the wise and good , his house the centre of elegant and liberal hospitality , he fondly hoped that he had now reached the limit of political service , and that his declining years might claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not so to be . As the time approached for making the gubernatorial nomination of 1844 , his name largely attracted the popular consideration . The writer of this well knows with what hesitating reluctance he at last gave way to the instances of his friends , and allowed himself to be regarded as a candidate for the Democratic nomination . His own county-Berksthe well-named " tenth legion of the Democracy , " formally and by her unanimous voice presented him to the state . The public choice was most equally divided between himself and another distinguished and honored citizen . The canvass of their respective friends , though animated beyond example , was , with insignificant and unworthy exceptions , on either side , conducted in a temper of honorable rivalry . On the 6th of March , Mr. Muhlenberg received the nomination . The Democracy responded to it with an enthusiasm that demonstrated their confidence in the chosen chief , and that afforded the most unerring presage of brilliant victory . He entered upon the duties of his eminent position , devoting to them constant thought and action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make him dearer to the people-to bring him nearer to their hopes . Alas ! for the vanity of all earthly honor-all human expectation ! On the // 10th of August , Pennsylvania gazes with admiration on the erect and manly form of her favorite son-before another day has passed she stands , stupefied with grief , bowed down by sorrow , beside that form stretched on its lowly bier . Ah ! what pen shall describe the awe-struck feelings of the people as the sad tidings spread over the land , of which he was so soon to have been the ruler ? He , the just  --  the honest-the true man , fallen ! Smitten down at the very head of the host  --  the banner in his hands ! - how slowly would men believe it-how painfully did conviction force itself upon their minds Who shall describe the scenes around his lifeless body  --  the pressing throngs of weeping men-thousands who came to take a last , long , lingering look at one they loved so well ?
