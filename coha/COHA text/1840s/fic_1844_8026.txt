Mathews , Cornelius , 1817-1889 : TO A REVEREND FRIEND , DEPARTING FOR MARYLAND . from To a reverend friend ( 1844 ) Fly to the south , on smooth and gliding wing  --  Fealtied to Washington and Ravenscroft By firmer ties than bondman , lord , or king  --  In fearless talons bearing high aloft Shafts plucked in many fields of bearded truth ; But sailing onward , feel with noble ruth And kindliest hope , how sad a realm may lie Beneath a heavenward and a human eye . What though the black shot of the fowler ring , Shattering the cold and hollow air around thee ! And though the world 's vain noise would fain confound thee , Calm be thy flight !  --  Let gentlest motions bring Thy sacred feet , my Earliest Friend , to rest In lands that wait thy coming to be blest !
