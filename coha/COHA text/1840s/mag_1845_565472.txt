txt THE origin of government and the duties of its subjects are justly attracting renewed attention . For upon the theory which prevails among the citizens of this country on this subject will depend their practice . If they are taught to regard the State , in its origin , purely as a social compact , and based in the will of man , one result may be anticipated ,  --  if as a divine institution and based in the will of God , another result will be witnessed . No one who was interested in the late political struggle , has failed to notice how very unfixed are the present opinions of our people in regard to the fundamental principles of government , and consequently how great the doubt in respect to their duty as voters . Men felt that the right of suffrage was a privilege , - they knew there was a duty connected with that privilege . Yet how many there were who were harassed for months-who , on the morning of the election , were hesitatingnay , who even went to the polls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor is it to be wondered at . The community had been distracted by clashing antagonistic doctrines . Each party had its rule of action . As many theories of government were presented as there are fast days in the calendar . Each advocate of his own treated all other theories as though he were acting on the advice given to a tyro at a Tipperary row , " Wherever you see a head , hit it . " Conscience was treated as if it were caoutchouc . The press and the pulpit were taxed for the invention of forcible arguments and apt illustrations . The fast-day was made a caucus day . Ministers were charged with preaching new doctrines by means of a forced exegesis . Old doctrines were gibbeted without benefit of clergy . ' The sacredness of confidence was violated , and private letters were despatched to a partisan press , to be heralded to the world with sneers instead of argument , and ridicule instead of logic . The good ways of our fathers were forgotten . Where they saw harmony we saw discord ; where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed . And now does it not become us , as good men and true , ' to repair what it has shattered ,  --  to fertilize what it has devastated ? Ought we not to profit by our experience , and while the rack of the storm is still seen in the horizon to prepare for another ? In other words ,  --  can not some theory be proposed in respect to government and our duty as the subjects of it , which shall commend itself to the calm judgment of the goodto the earnest seekers for the truth ? The American citizen is the possessor of a choice heirship . He owes a duty to himself . So he does to those who carved out a birthright for him with their blades . He does to those who are praying for his prosperity to-day in the dungeons of Lombardy . He does to his fellow citizens who are now enjoying the blessings of our institutions  --  to the myriads whom he sees prospectively peopling this domain of liberiy . ' The mode of discharging this duty is to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffrage is his own , and it is a question of deep significancy how he can best use it . The cycle of our national election is not a long one . A struggle , similar , in many respects , to that through which we have just passed , will soon again demand our attention . Before it comes upon us we should determine our duty . When the mind is calm , when the eye is // clear , we should look at principles ; we should estimate their value . There is truth which invites our attention , which we can incorporate into our being , which will lift us above the pride and the prejudice of party , and which shall be an everliving monitor within us . We can decide what relations we sustain to gover nment ,  --  how we may best perform the duties of citizenship . There are fundamental principles on this subject which we can make our own , and which will guide us in every particular action which we shall be called to discharge . God did not leave man the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thereby he might determine his duty . It is with a view of evolving these principles that this article is written . We commence with the common question , Is civil government a divine institution ? and in its decision shall glance hastily at some of those prohlems which have agitated the public mind , and seem to call for a faithful solution . What then are we to understand by a divine institution ? I answer , any settled order of things which God has clearly willed to exist in all the appropriate circumstances of the existence of man . Any such order of things , the endurance of which we perceive to be for the best , and which we know to be universally established , we are warranted to consider of divine appointment . In every such case there is that in the nature of things which manifests its utility , and by its permanence shows its fitness for the circumstances in which it exists . Under this comprehensive definition may be included two varieties . I. The first embraces those institutions which God has expressly enjoined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , and depend not , primarily , on any perceived fitness by those to whom they are given , but on the authority of him who gave them . The reason of their observance lies in the law that prescribes them , and the force of the law centers in the superior character of the lawgiver . Of this nature was the Jewish theocracy . That divine institution , unique in its character , was one in which God became the national king , and the tutelary Deity of a people which he had chosen as the depositary of truth in the world , and thus promulged to them a law , whose observance he exacted with appropriate sanctions . Of this nature , too , were the Sabbath and the rite of circumcision under the old dispensation , and the ordinances of baptism and the Lord 's Supper under the new . 11 . The second class does not depend on external command . The institutions under it are those the reasons of which lie in , and the observance of which springs from , the very constitution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice to be universally necessary for their wellbeing ,  --  the germ of which is wrought into their very nature and developed in all the appropriate circumstances of their existence . These are just as much of divine institution as the former ; for they owe their origin to that constitution of things which God has ordered , and are its useful and necessary accompaniments . Such institutions are not the fruit of a wanton caprice , resting on the arbitrary enactments of a particular age or people . They rest upon a firmer basis and are built of a more enduring substance . They are conjoined with the essential nature of that from which they proximately spring . It is not necessary in all cases that God should positively declare his will , that it may be perceived and known . We can learn it as well , if we will , from those tacit yet forcible manifestations of it which he makes in the dispensation of his works and the ordering of his providence , as from the page of his written word . And sometimes there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our minds with a peculiar energy . It is as though a thousand voices were whispering it , whenever we attend to their utterance , in tones so true that they find a response within us . Thus is the design of God made known as plainly as if written with his own finger on tables of stone . So that wherever we find these characteristics in a settled order of things , we there find the evidence of a divine institution . It is not enough that it has the marks of utility ,  --  that it evidently enlightens and ennobles wherever its beneficial effects are experienced ,  --  that it purifies and blesses those who partake of its benefits ;  --  but it must also be universal-established in all the ap . propriate circumstances of the life of man . These two grand characteristics then belong to this class ,  - -  utility and universality . Of this nature is human Society . In this the Creator has most clearly manifested his design . The necessity of it is written as a fundamental and inviolable law in the very nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affections implanted in man , the dispositions and propensities that belong to the constitution of his body and his mind , with all their inseparable desires and infirmities , plainly demand its recognition . Without society the faculties of the mind , the gift of God , would remain undeveloped ; they would droop and die . The safety and happiness of individuals depend upon it . A state of solitude is one of gloom ; a state of society is one of pleasure . The love of offspring , the dependence of th' young arid the infirm , the noble and pure sympathies that are thereby nurtured , the thrilling attachment , the warm alliances which are produced , strong and lasting as life , all combine to prove that God constituted man for society . He implanted in his creatures that nature which unavoidably led to these genial and enduring relations . They are as universal as the race ; they are for man 's highest wellbeing . Man every where is linked to his fellow man , and he feels the permanence and binding power of that union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the enlightened , and is valued highly even where it is most ungain ly . The forms of society may be improved ; knowledge and experience , and the mild influence of religion , may have so fashioned society that it is now better adapted to develop the virtues and promote mutual happiness among mankind than in the ruder and earlier ages . Yet there the same great principle is seen struggling to expand and perfect itself . It is for these reasons that we call it a divine institution . Of this nature , too , is Marriage . Without this relation , the purposes of human society would be defeated : virtue would be disregarded , and man would live under the lawless control of his wild and wanton passions . Though enjoined by no express command , like the Sabbath , &amp;c. , it is still a divine institution . The proof that it is such , is found in the original constitution of man as existing in society-in its necessity to his wellbeing-in its tendency to promote the kindlier feelings of our nature-in its universal prevalence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the view that the Savior gave of it in his conversation with the Pharisees on the banks of the Jordan . From the beginning of the creation , he says , God made them male and female . There was that in the constitution which he gave them -- in the relation they sustained to each other-which made it proper to say that God had joined them together . And although no command had been uttered , still the desire and necessity of this union , springing from the nature of man , and its tendency to sustain and exalt the design of human society , sufficiently prove it to be according to the will of God and // an institution of his wise ordering . The Savior did not change its . character : from the first it was a divine institution , and God established it because he saw it was for man 's highest good . Civil government also belongs to this class . For it springs out of the necessities of things  --  the very constitution of man1s nature as a member of society  --  and is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inasmuch as it is wrought into the very texture of that being which God has designed for man , and must find its development under that ordering of events which God has fashioned . The good order , the interests , nay , the existence even of human society demand it . Civil government is needful to perpetuate and perfect those relations which exist between man and man  --  to control the grasping power of the profligate and impious  --  to shield the persons and property of the helpless  --  to inspire confidence and hope in the distrustful , and to give strength and continuance to existing union . It is proportionate to man 's capacity - it is level to his necessity . He feels that it is conjoined to his very condition and character-that its history is co-equal with his history that he is necessitated by his very nature to continue it . Men-all men-in all the appropriate circumstances of their being , feel that civil government is indispensable to their highest good . No matter how diverse their sentiments in other respects-in this they agree . The Jew and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Pagan , give their concurrent testimony to the utility , to the necessity of civil government . They feel that government must proclaim the sanctions of its law in their hearing-must throw up its bulwarks around them-must kindle up its watch-lights at every dangerous point - must send its influence through all the ramifications of human society . If the positive civil law were annulled , and all the forms of government abandoned  --  and if God 's revealed code was blotted out of existence-still would man feel the necessity . of civil government . The deprivation of it would rest like an incubus on his mind . He would demand its re-formation-he would make it as lasting as his existence . Now , to what are we to ascribe these facts ? What do they prove , if not that civil government is a divine institution ? God has so constituted man , and so ordered the circumstances of his being , that civil government exists wherever he exists-not as an arbitrary enactment , but the spontaneous fruit of his own being  --  the fulfillment of God 's will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution , no precept for its construction has been written in the books of the law . God has not chosen men to be the framers of civil society according to the pattern which he has showed them-he has not inspired them to teach the nations the science of government . Still it is none the less manifest what was His design in regard to its establishment . This view of civil government does not preclude the idea that it is , in some sense , a human creation . the simple fact that a civil institution is so useful and universal as to be properly said to be of divine ordination , does not take away from it its human character . The end of government , as government , is temporal . Its form comes directly or indirectly from the people . Even in an absolute monarchy it depends on their acquiescence and submission . Yet the necessity of government is not in their gift : it lies back of their action and is in no manner dependent upon it . They may adopt a particular form of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ages , and build upon its deep foundations an enduring fabric ; but even then // 529 they have only perfected the design of the Creator . And therefore we say , that while its legitimate and binding prerogative is committed to their maintenance , the reason for its formation subsisted prior to the expression of their xviii : it arose from that order of things which God had established . It would be an interesting study to trace back the present forms of government to their primitive sources , and to search out the causes which led to the adoption of each . The great and good governments which are now exerting such a benign influence have grown up from a far antiquity , or taken their present modifications from a series of individual events which conspired to that end . These facts prove that the particular form of every government comes from the people over whom it is exercised . What were the causes which led to this or that result may be more or less obscure . The " fierce democracie " of Attica did not spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek . The governments that clustered along the Archipelago were at first monarchical . But when the overbearing conduct of the petty chieftains made their sway insufferable , then *parta called upon Lycurgus for her law , and Solon gave to Athens her constitution . Then the popular governments of those illustrious states became the harbingers of better days . Then came that list of lofty names to which succeeding ages have paid their homage . The Baptist Congregational church in Virginia , near the residence of Mr. Jefferson , whose meetings he often attended , and in whose principles of church government he was strongly interested , may have been one gre at means of the establishment of a democratic government for these states . No matter how trivial , or how rirnmentous , the causes which led to the formation of any particular government . This Vol . III . 67 we may say , its adoption depended on the will of the people . But when it was duly organized , and men were invested with authority and the law had gained its binding force , then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God . It is important that these two ideas be conjoined . It is by looking at one exclusive of the other , that many mistakes have arisen , and many false theories been adopted in regard to government . Government in its outward garb is human , and its design is human . It begins with man , is employed with regard to him , and terminates in him . At the same time , it is an ordinance of God-it is a part of that system which he designed for man  --  the desire of which , and the necessity for which , he incorporated into the being of man and made as co-extensive and permanent as his very existence . The mere fact that any body of men had formed a civil government , and that great good resulted from its adoption and continuance , would not constitute it a divine institution . There are many examples that might be adduced to illustrate this . Take a plain one ,  --  our common school system . Here is an institution of wide adoption and beneficial in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of education for their children . They founded this system . Scotland followed their example . Prussia is perfecting it . Its utility is acknowledged by all who are acquainted with it . Its design is to cultivate a desire of knowledge in the young mind , to enlarge its capacities , to direct its energies . Its result is the formation of good and regular habits in the young , a restraint from idle and vicious conduct , a preparation for a virtuous and useful manhood . Yet all this does not constitute it a divine institution nor could it be called such if it should become universally prevalent . The // Human Government a Divine Institution . system did not spring unavoidably and necessarily from the nature of man . It is the fruit of an advanced and improved state of society . It is incidental even among an enlightened and intelligent people . Any such institution limited in its utility and occasional in its origin , can not be a divine institution . So is it not with government . This is an institution the utility of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization they have felt ,  --  the importance of which pressing on their minds , has led them to its universal establishment . It grew out of the nature which God gave to man , is evidently a part of the system which God designed for man , and for all these reasons united is properly termed a divine institution . And here we see the binding force of government . It does not challenge our regard and observance simply because man has modeled it and it is for the general good-but for these reasons , together with the fact that it is the product of that nature which has God for its author and man for its subject . We feel its binding force , not because it is established , but it was established because we felt its binding force . Just like the common law . That code does not become a just one because the nations have recorded it in their statute books , but they recorded it there because it was founded in eternal justice . The essence of government lies back of human enactments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it strikes a death-blow at an ordinance of God . In this view , government has a peculiar sanctity . It rises before us as a system that should be inviolate . We feel that it is the supporter of our best interests , that it is linked to our very destiny . Let us see how this view agrees with the Scriptures . In one passage we find it written that civil government is an " ordinance of God , " is ordained of God , " that rulers are " the ministers of God for good . " Again we read that government in its representatives , is " an ordinance of man , " - avO*wT*Y1i *i*re&amp; ,  --  a creation of man . God , says Paul , in the wise arrangement of His providence , has so ordered the constitution of things , that civil government is indispensable to the highest good of His creatures . They who bear the sword are properly said to be His ministers for good . There is that in the nature of man , in the appropriate circumstances of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the establishment of civil government . God then may justly be said to ordain its existence . It springs out of that relation of things which he has establishedit is their legitimate and necessary result . It is as though a decree had gone forth from His throne enjoining its institution . Peter gives us a different view . Looking upon the outward form of government as modeled by man , he calls it his creation . The different modifications of government are the result of man 's efforts . But although they are his creation , still as they become so under that wise ordination of which God was the author , they have in themselves a vitality and a binding force that commends them to our regard . It was because God had so designed the result , that man was led , by a necessity which had the force of a law , to the creation of civil government . This view of human government then , seems to accord with the representations of the Scriptures . They do not teach us that it is solely a religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence . They do not teach us that it exists by a direct creation of the Deity , - that its laws and its sanctions are immediately promulged by Him . But they do teach us what we have attempted to maintain , that it arises from the constitution of things which 530 // in His wise counsels God has established , that its formation was wrought into the very nature of man and destined to a development in all the appropriate circumstances of his existence . And it is on this ground that those oracles give to government a lofty character . They call upon man to hold in high regard its external form , even if it is the work of man 's creation . They exhort men to submit to kings and governors , because , although elevated to that rank by the attested or implied consent of the people , they are those whom God has ordained to he the ministers of good . For the " Lord 's sake ' ' and also for conscience* s sake " they tell man he must needs be subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the highest good of man ; the existence of which the universal propensities and necessities of his nature imperiously demanded . If God has thus plainly manifested his will , and man obeying the suggestions of the monitor within him , and fulfilling the designs of God , has erected the framework of civil society , then the members of it as a duty which they owe to each other and to Him , should submit to it as in harmony with His plan . Such we understand to be the teachings of the Scriptures . Such , too , would be the natural inference , if what is here maintained is true . In accordance with what has now been presented , in some measure , were the views of those who have investigated the constitution of civil society . It was Aristotle who said that the nature of man demanded political society ; r*rrsh*ij cpvai*i xo*tTIXOJ ) cXrO*w2Tog . Even those who have held that men did not at first embrace civil society as led to it by the bias of nature , " have been forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear of greater evils , " that " civil societies were absolutely necessary for their safety , " that " there was a natural obligation to enter into regular states and governments , " that " for a redress of ' those evils which otherwise arose , they had recourse to themselves as the surest defense , by joining together into one body and erecting a civil society . " * Now to what does all this amount if not to this , that the nature of man , in its appropriate circumstances , demands the establishment of ' civil government ? Of his nature in other circumstances we know nothing , nor does it concern us in respect to this subject . And if the voice of universal nature is the echo of God 's will , then is civil government an institution of his ordering . We find in one of these old writers a custom of the Persians related On the death of their king they live the five ensuing days without any law , to the end that finding by experience the miserable effects of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they may be engaged in a firmer allegiance to their sovereign . And such effects as they saw we may rationally conclude would be everywhere witnessed , were the forms of government and the sanctions of its law to be abolished , and man to be left to the unbridled indulgence of his wild and growing passions . With the view of civil government which has now been advanced , we learn what weight is to be attached to those theories of government which have divided the sentiments of writers . Granting the doctrine of 1*Ir . Locke to be true-that civil government originates in the wants and fears of individuals , who , being naturally free , equal and independent , associate together , either by express or tacit consent , for the mutual protection of ' their lives , liberties and estates , on this fundamental principle , that the whole should protect // all its parts , and that every part should pay obedience to the will of the whole-xve are still led to ask , how came they " to agree to unite into one political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government ; nay , it declares that the nature of man is such , in every condition of life , that the compact is universally necessary for his wellbeing . The compact itself is a written declaration , testifying in plain and definite terms , that God has clearly willed that government should exist in all the appropriate circumstances of man 's existence . Specious as the doctrine of the " social compact " seems to be , it disproves itself , it contains the elements of its own overthrow . Allowing its truth , the prerogative of government lies back of it . So far from being the cause of government , it is itself a mere incident in government . It becomes by its very existence an absolute proof that civil government is a divine institution . It is a doctrine possessing the show of truth without the reality , and adding a defect of facts to danger in practice. * And even Mr. Locke himself maintains that " God put man under strong obligations of necessity to drive him into society , " that " the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to extend farther than the common good ; " that " upright judges , standing laws , and the execution of them , are directed to no other end but the peace , safety , and * The doctrine of Locke , Dr. Dwight strongly opposed , both in the chair and in the pulpit . lie says , " no opinion is more groundless that this . The absurdities of this doctrine are endless . At the same time , there is no fact more clearly evinced by the history of man , than that such a compact never existed . This , even the abetturs of it are obliged to confess ; and this cuts up the doctrine by the roots . For if the social compact was not a fact , it is nothing . ( Theolo*y , Vol . III , p. 324 , passim . ) He as strongly maintained that government was founded in the wilt of God . public good of the people . " All of which goes far to strengthen the doctrine herein maintained . For surely if civil government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has placed man under strong obligations " to establish it in all the circumstances of his being , then , according to what has been heretofore proved , it is a divine institution . Again , if with Dr. Paley and others , we trace back civil government to paternal authority , and the order of domestic life , yet still it is true , as this author acknowledges , that the disposition to govern and to be governed , is incidental to the very nature and coeval with the existence of the humnan species . If in the golden age ( Saturnia regna ) the patriarch was the prince , still as soon as men had multiplied sufficiently , the need of mutual support must have led to a firmer organization . The natural course of human affairs tended directly to multiplied dangers , and as an unavoidable necessity , to the security afforded by an enlarged and strengthened state of civil society . In this view then , we are led to the natural inference that it is of divine appointment , and designed for man in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil government as founded in utility-we must mean by this , its universal nature-as everywhere required for the greatest good of the greatest number . Looking at the history of our species  --  the efforts of the former ages  --  the present condition of the nations-we are forced to admit that its formation is for the highest possible good . And it is so , because God has formed the nature of man , so that in all the conditions of life , civil society is a necessary and unavoidable accompaniment of his existence . The interests of society require it  --  the common welfare of individuals and of the race  --  the universal desires and necesstties of mankind have called for its organization-it is the perfecting of // the purposes of God in regard to man  --  a necessary part of that system which he has evidently designed for man , and therefore is a clear and forcible manifestation of the highest utility . It is on this ground that we rest our doctrine of civil government ; it is an institution of God , whose design is the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a means of their greatest happiness , to men , and demands of them that they secure by it the great ends of human society . It is a fearful and an important trust , hy reason of those momentous interests and destinies that center in it . Rightly understood and regarded it will confer untold benefits upon the nations . It will lift itself above the raging multitude and hush to repose the angry passions of men ; it will go down to the lowly home of the humblest citizen and whisper in his ear of peace ; it will stand as the palladium of society , whither men shall ever look for the preservation of their inalienable rights . Thus shall it be proved , in the language of Locke , that the end of government is the good of mankind . If the things which have now been advanced are true , it requires no deep reflection to perceive the duties of citizenship . It is an obligation that rests upon every citizen to promote the public good , and secure the manifold and momentous interests of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be attained , it will be sufficient to glance at a few . I. The support of Law . There is a tendency in these times to break down the barriers of the law , or at least to trespass as far as may be without danger within its boundaries . The memory does not go far back to recall the convulsions of one of our states , when an armed force was required to sustain the law . We have heard it declared in large assemblies of the people , that the execution of certain laws of the United States shall be resisted because they are not in harmony with the private views of individual expediency . During the last session of Congress , a bill passed the senate which was opposed by one half of the talent and learning and eloquence of that body , as an infrac ' tion of the Constitution and a violation of the national faith . In different sections of the country we hear of outrageous violence upon the persons and property of the citizens , and an open defiance of the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may appear individually , indicate a sad tone of public sentiment and point forward to thickcoming dangers . They tell us , if we will regard the voice , that as citizens of this country , which has hut just commenced an illustrious existence , in whose behalf the sympathies and prayers of so many are enlisted , we have a fearful trust committed to us , and one which demands of us an argus-eyed watchfulness . Our judiciary is viewed with a jealous eye , and contempt is cast on our system of jurisprudence . But these are our safeguards  --  the last fortresses in which retiring liberty will make a stand against the inroads of a wild and fearful anarchy . In those days of the Athenian degeneracy which marked the decline of that people 's greatness and glory , when the violence of men desolated all that was fair and conservative in their institutions , no voice was heard to defame the venerable tribunal of the Areopagus . And it will be a mournful day for us , when the decisions of the Supreme Bench and the investigations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law will then be no more " the mother of our peace and joy , " but discord and terror shall reign and riot in the chambers of justice . How far the state of things to which we allude may be owing to false views of government , it may be difficult exactly to determine ; // but that right views would result in a better tone of public sentiment , we are warranted to decide . Government must be considered as an institution of divine appointment , dernanding a faithful and cheerful obedience ; while of law we must learn to think that " her seat is the bosom of God , her voice the harmony of the world . " Men must be taught to regard the law as supreme , and a violation of it as not only treason against the state , but an act of wanton violence on the rights of every individual . It is indeed true that there are cases where revolution is justifiable , - xvhere it is not only a right but a duty for the citizen to resist " the powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever government passes beyond its rightful limits and subverts the ends for which it was designed , then it degenerates into a lawless assumption of power , and is a rank usurpation . But the evils must be immense to justify a resort to arms . The unavoidable calamities of civil feuds and a protracted struggle , with the loss of valuable lives and the corruption of the public morals , and all the tide of wasteful and saddening maladies which would inevitably flow over the nation , are sufficient to show that submission must be a duty except under rare circumstances . The natural rights of the citizen must be so infringed that submission is past endurance ; all peaceful means of redress must have been resorted to in vain ; the prospect of a successful issue must be manifest and morally certain : - there must be this unusual combination of events before the last appeal can be made . Then it may be made ; then resistance is high heroism . From this it is evident that a justifiable revolution is an exception to a general law . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of the existing laws that the greatest public good can be secured . Any other principle would be false in doctrine and fatal in practice . If by this rule it results that the rights of individuals are not respected ; that crimes go unpunished and the guilty are free ; that evils prevail of which the laws take no cognizance ,  --  then private interests must suffer , and the guilty escape merited penalty , and evils be patiently endured , until a lawful and a peaceful remedy can be applied . On this ground we take our stand , and maintain that here , and here alone , is safety and truth . Granting that in a certain case summary justice might be enforced by the despotic will of one man , or the no less despotic will of a mob of men ; yet what does all that avail , when by this very act the confidence of the community is shattered , the reign of violence introduced , the law dethroned , and all its pure and righteous sanctions cast out and forgotten ? What avails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty for his crime ; that one community has sated its burning thirst for the blood of the guilty victim , if all other men throughout the land must feel that the majesty of the law has been insulted ,  --  that the arm of justice is thereby palsied , and if in all their habitations terror must sit down by their sides , and voices of fear forever whisper of danger ? Thus would the ordinance of God be with effect resisted , and they who bear the sword would no more-be a terror to evil works , but to the good . It is also evident that government must be regarded as something more than the , instrument of man's caprice or power ; it must have the lofty character which belongs to it as an institution designed by God ; subsisting in all the conditions in which man exists ; possessing an origin as noble as his origin , and a continuance as lasting as his being . Then will the support of law be regarded in its true light , as a duty which man owes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In obedience // to it consists his true interests and glory ; for it is this which elevates him above a state of barbarism , and secures him from the wild misrule of passion and prejudice ; which enables him to attain the true end of his being , and accomplish the wise designs of God for his welfare . It is on this ground that the Scriptures place it . Submission is enjoined , because in the wise administrations of his providence God has ordained government as an institution tending to promote the highest good of man . Jesus , our Redeemer , knew no disloyalty . He , though the King of kings , was prompt to perform the exactions of the government ,  --  nay , he was ready to do more than could be justly required . " Render to C*esar the things that are Ca*sar 's , " he said to the Herodians who tempted him . " Notwithstanding , lest we should offend them , give them the tribute , " he said to Peter , as he sent him to the sea for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like his master . He was ready to lay down his life if he had done ought worthy of death . " I appeal to Cesar , " he boldly said to his bitter persecutors . " The dark , unrelenting Tiberius , the profligate and cruel Nero , the timid , inhuman Domitian , " may bear the sword , submission is still a duty . Better is it to suffer under the sway of a base , and profligate , and tyrannical administration ,  --  better endure persecution , and sorrow , and evil ,  --  than to undermine the fabric of civil society , and introduce disorder , and anarchy , and lawless violence , and the wild play of passion , and every evil work , and gloomy forebodings , and the dark uncertainty of a favorable issue . II . Another method of attaining and perfecting the ends of government , is a proper use of the right of suffrage . This is a subject interesting from its intrinsic importance , and from the peculiar position of affairs in this country at the present time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a field for this place : a few points only , which are most naturally suggested by what has already been said , will be noticed . Upon proper views of this right and corresponding action , next to the blessing of God , depends the fate of the nation . It was an era pregnant with destiny , when , in the cabin of the Mayflower , moored on the rock-bound coast of New England , those Pilgrims from a far land formed that compact which was to be their guide during days of fierce and terrible trial , and the germ of those institutions which not only grace and bless this western republic , but have attracted the notice and deep interest of the potentates of the eastern world and their groaning subjects . In the blessings of which those times were the morning and those men the heralds , it is our privilege to participate . By the good hand of their God upon them , they committed to their descendants the prerogative of self-government , so that in the hands of the citizens of this country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What shall be the nature of the laws , the tone of public sentiment , the character of the rulers , the influence of the nation ,  --  it is for them to decide by their individual suffrages . Hence it becomes a matter of no small moment and importance how they can best fulfill their trust . From what has already been advanced , a general answer is apparent ,  --  they must vote so as to promote the greatest public good . In the selection of candidates for the high offices of trust and duty , care should be taken to choose those who will aim to administer government according to its great design ; to promote the true prosperity and wellbeing of society , and disseminate among the people the principles of virtue . History // tells us how dangerous it is to trust the administration of the state to the hands of the licentious and unprincipled . The record that has come down to us from other nations , written with their own blood , should be a warning to the free citizens of this republic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office and trust . Virtue and principle in the rulers will lead to virtue and welfare among the people . There is a growing neglect on this subject in some of the commonwealths , which forebodes disaster and public evil . In the zeal and strife for success , when partisans of lofty talents are borne on by the tide of feeling , and the great assemblies of the people are excited by the voice of eloquence , there is danger that the vital principles of government will be sacrificed to the rancor and prejudice of party . It must be engrafted into the minds of the nation that government is a divine institution , whose ultimate end is the good of mankind . God intended that by it the best interests of society should be promoted ,  --  that it should send forth from its fountains streams of life and happiness through all the domain over which its influence should extend . He enjoined its constitution by no express command , but by the universal nature and necessities of the creatures whom he made . He committed to men the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar condition demanded , or their intelligence could devise ; while at the same time he wrote it as a fundamental law for their observance , that in its formation and execution it should tend to and perfect the exalted design of man 's highest good . Hence , it is plain that when the administration of the government is dependent on the suifrages of the people , those suifrages should be given in the manner that will best secure the great ends of society ,  --  the highest welfare of the subjects . Principles , not spoils , should be the price of votes . The ballots of the citizens should be the instruments of exalting the nation 's character ; of infusing the elements of virtue into all the departments of the state ; of imparting vigor and life to its moral actions ; of sending abroad to other nations the influence and the light of an exalted patriotism and a disinterested philanthropy . There are many other subjects of a practical nature to which this discussion naturally leads , and which , by reason of the importance thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting to examine . But the principles which have been laid down , if true , are sufficient to direct aright in all those particular questions which may be brought before the citizen . It becomes him , above all other things on this subject , to remember that government is a divine institution , whose end is the good of mankind , and to act for the promotion of that end.
