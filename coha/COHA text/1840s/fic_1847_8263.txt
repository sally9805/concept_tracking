TO Lucia D'Wolf Brownell , The friend to whose example and society anything good in these writings should be mainly attributed , and whose indulgence is solicited for whatever may be otherwise , this book is most respectfully inscribed by her affectionate son , THE AUTHOR . Brownell , Henry Howard , 1820-1872 : INVOCATION . from Poems ( 1847 ) Give up thy Dead , O Sea of Time ! Thy long-forgotten Dead ! The noble thoughts  --  the hopes sublime  --  The dreams of glory fled . Give back each high and holy Truth , Once all on earth above  --  Give back the beaming eye of Youth , And the sweet lips of Love . The tears , that once in sorrow stole As soft as summer rain  --  The smiles , whose sunshine o'er the soul Shall never come again . Oh God ! what long-lost treasures Could that abyss resign ! Pure thoughts , and innocent pleasures , And gentle hopes are thine . How , as they faded , one by one , Like withered leaves that fall , The quicksands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of mine  --  yet oh ! What is that little store , Loved  --  lost  --  and once lamented so , To all thou hadst before ? To all the mighty wrecks of old , O'er which thy dull , dark waves have rolled ? And wilt thou not , Insatiate Power ! Enriched with trophies vast , Withhold thy claim one little hour , Since all is thine at last ? All  --  all of nobleness and worth , That mortal mould can vaunt  --  All the fond witchery of earth Can offer to enchant . What vanished Ones of ancient might , Thy mightier arms entwine ! What Forms of loveliness and light Are now forever thine ! The charnel earth  --  the wandering air  --  The wave  --  the restless fire  --  Each element hath claimed its share Of all that could expire . Yet what are all their spoils to thee And thine , oh dark and sullen sea ! Thou sleepest  --  yet what storms have swept Across that waveless flood ! What centuries on centuries leapt In surges dyed with blood ! A thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonders unrevealed Have perished in thy waves . And there the deep Historian 's line Hath many an age been cast  --  In vain  --  to sound a depth like thine , Unfathomable Past ! A flood , whose tide forever goes O'er hill , and mound , and plain  --  All slow and sullenly it flows , But never ebbs again . Oh , silent , ever wandering stream ! Borne onward thus by thee , Like some lone mariner I seem Upon a shoreless sea . And floating o'er thy gulf illumed By dim tradition 's ray , On scenes  --  on ages long entombed Look down a little way . Like one who sails Italian seas , When setting suns reveal Old towers , and buried palaces , Far underneath his keel . There lie the glorious gems of old , Lost in thy waters wide , Whose gleam we faintly yet behold Far down amid thy tide . And darker , deeper yet below , Methinks , all dimly seen , A thousand fearful Shapes of Woe And Horror couch between . The Deeds , whose memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurk like krakens Within thy dark abyss . ' T is like that scene with terrors rife , When earth and ocean held The first chaotic throes of life  --  The hideous forms of Eld . The monsters of old time , whose bones Yet whiten o'er the plain  --  The brood , whose giant skeletons Are all that now remain  --  Behemoth and Leviathan , That roved this world of old  --  Such are the Thoughts and Deeds of Man , Which thy dark realms enfold . Oh ! when the word is spoken That Time shall be no more  --  When the last wave hath broken On thine eternal shore  --  When , fleeting as a vapor , The heavens shall pass away , And like a dying taper The worn-out sun decay  --  When the moon shall fade in her place on high , And all the Starry Host Like sparks shall fly through a stormy sky  --  And the Earth give up the ghost ! Amid that Universal Death Shalt thou , poor soul , survive ? When worlds have yielded up their breath , Canst thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars are dim  --  Though suns have quenched their fire  --  The immortal flame once lit by Him Shall never more expire . And these dark waters , tempest tost , Shall yield their treasures then , And all which thou hast loved and lost Shall be restored again . Brownell , Henry Howard , 1820-1872 : NIAGARA. from Poems ( 1847 ) Has aught like this descended , since the fountains Of the Great Deep broke up , in cataracts hurled , And climbing lofty hills , eternal mountains , Poured wave on wave above a buried world ? Yon tides are raging , as when storms have striven , And the vexed seas awaking from their sleep , Are rough with foam , and Neptune 's flocks are driven In myriads o'er the green and azure deep . Ere yet they fall , mark ( where that mighty current Comes like an army from its mountain home , ) How fiercely yon wild steeds amid the torrent , With their dark flanks , and manes and crests of foam , Speed to their doom  --  yet in the awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep , Just ere that white unfathomed gulf they enter , Rear back in horror from the headlong leap . Footnote : 1Kb Then maddening , plunge  --  a thousand more succeeding Sweep onward , troop on troop , again to urge The same fierce flight , as rapid and unheeding  --  Again to pause in terror on the verge . And near the brink , amid that ceaseless roar , An emerald islet gleams above the surf ; No bark hath landed on its sunny shore  --  No human foot hath ever pressed its turf  --  Like that sweet spot we seem so oft discerning , That haunts the voyager through Life 's desert plain , To which our souls are ever fondly turning , Forever near us  --  and forever vain . What tongue hath told  --  what page hath kept thy history , Dark flood that hurriest Ocean 's tide to meet ! What eye hath dared to penetrate the mystery That shrouds thine inaccessible retreat ? To chronicle thine age , the toil severe , The boasted scrutinies of Science fail  --  Conjecture 's busy tongue is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perchance upon this wondrous ledge Footnote : 1Kb ( benighted And wandering eastward through the forest brown , ) Behemoth paused  --  and straight drew back affrighted , Lest his vast weight should crush the rampart down . There still it stands , as in his day , save where Yon fallen fragment lies in wrecks below ; That monotone sublime yet fills the air , And still these waters roll in endless flow . Oft to an eye half closed , as if in solving Some mighty , mystic problem  --  half it seems Like some vast crystal wheel , ever revolving , Whose motion , earth 's  --  whose axle , earth 's extremes . We gaze and gaze , half lost in dreamy pleasure , On all that slow majestic wave reveals , While Fancy idly , vainly strives to measure How vast the cavern which its veil conceals . The Sea-Kings never revelled in a Hall More gorgeous  --  more magnificent than this : Earth holds the deep foundations of thy wall , And falling oceans curtain thine abyss . Beneath its vaulted roof and architrave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wandering through the sullen cave , Roam o'er thy drear and Chaos-like domain . The Sea-nymphs there might make their loneliest dwelling , Or the fierce brethren of the troubled Air , Whose blasts around thy vestibule are swelling Footnote : 1Kb  --  And the mine-haunting gnomes might revel there . All , save the Demon throned on caverned fires , In the volcano 's arched and lurid hall , Who from thee far and sullenly retires  --  Lest his bright realms to sudden ruin fall : Lest all should perish  --  even his proudest palace ' Neath red Stromboli  --  Etna 's glowing veins  --  One icy wave from thine o'erflowing chalice , And but a cold and blackened wreck remains . Whence come ye , oh wild waters ? by what scenes Of Majesty and Beauty have ye flowed , In the wide continent that intervenes , Footnote : 1Kb Ere yet ye mingle in this common road ? The Mountain King , upon his Rocky throne , Laves his broad feet amid your rushing streams , And many a vale of loveliness unknown Is softly mirrored in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand leagues away , From ancient mounds , with deserts wide between , Cliffs , whose tall summits catch the parting day , And prairies blooming in eternal green ; Yet , the bright valley , and the flower-lit meadow , And the drear waste of wilderness , all past  --  Like that strange Life , of which thou art the shadow , Must take the inevitable plunge at last . Whither we know not Footnote : 1Kb  --  but above the wave A gentle , white-robed spirit sorrowing stands , Type of the rising from that darker grave , Which waits the wanderer from Life 's weary lands . How long these wondrous forms  --  these colors splendid , Their glory o'er the wilderness have thrown ! How long that mighty anthem has ascended To him who wakened its eternal tone ! That everlasting utterance thou shalt raise , A thousand ages ended , still the same  --  When this poor heart , that fain would add its praise , Has mouldered to the nothing whence it came : When the white dwellings of man 's busy brood Now reared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished , and the ancient wood Shall echo to the eagle 's shriek again . And all the restless crowds that now rejoice , And toil , and traffic , in their eager moods , Shall pass  --  and nothing save thine awful voice Shall break the hush of these vast solitudes . June , 1842 . Brownell , Henry Howard , 1820-1872 : THE FAMINE . Footnote : 1Kb from Poems ( 1847 ) Be proud , my lord ! few men can ride upon a course like thine , Drive where thou wilt  --  to East or West  --  from London to the Tyne . Your chariot-wheels are rolling o'er famished heart and head  --  Your horses ' hoofs are trampling down a life at every tread . And proud be thou , fair Lady ! so royally arrayed In robes for which the nakedness of half a realm hath paid . Thy train hath stripped the shivering limbs of daughters and of wives  --  The jewel beaming on thy brow hath cost a hundred lives . And prouder yet , oh Holy Church ! thy favored sons may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield for thee . Still portion each fat benefice  --  still pile thee stones on stones Footnote : 1Kb  --  And rear the fane that mocks at God , o'er famine-buried bones . Let stoles be donned  --  let prayers be conned  --  let solemn anthems flow  --  And whiten each sepulchral soul with all of outward show . And proudest , happiest far of all , America , be thou ! Whose barns are filled to bursting  --  whose granaries o'erflow . Who , while the nations stand aghast , in wonder and in fear , Art fattening on the famine that brings thee gold and gear . Hurra ! their gold , like drops of blood , is coming thick and fast ! Each mite their wasted hands can earn shall be thine own at last . Ho , portly alderman ! dost think , amid thy money-bags , Of men who feed on offal ? of women clad in rags ? Ho , gentle maiden ! that in warm and lighted rooms displayst The naked arm , the naked throat , the almost naked breast ! Hast thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom this winter storm beats down more naked still ? Ho , thou that revellest at ease , on goodly sinecure ! Whose hounds are mumbling over bread snatched from the starving poor ! Canst thou remember thee of him , whose fate was fixed of old , Whose dogs did lick the beggar 's sores  --  in ancient story told ? A day shall come ye little know  --  an hour ye little heed  --  When He , whom ye forsake on earth , shall leave ye at your need . " Depart , I never knew ye ! in mine abandoned lot , Hungered , ye gave me nought to eat  --  naked , ye clothed me not . " Dost marvel at this picture ? proud citizen , ' t is thine ! And thine , oh priest ! whose pompous tone goes up before the shrine . ' T is thine , sleek man of office ! thine , lawyer rich and keen ! ' T is thine , fair dame ! ' t is thine , proud peer ! ' t is thine  --  anointed Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Name , Yet never know your suppliant Lord in anguish and in shame . Oh , thou that sittest by the hearth , thy fireside filled with light , Thy children all around thee , their faces beaming bright ! Hast thou ever thought , while gazing upon its pleasant glow , Of the naked feet  --  of the wasted forms  --  that wander in frost and snow ? And thou that in thy cheerful hall art sitting down to dine ! Thy table heaped with costly cates , and bright with sunny wine  --  Hast thou remembered thee of those , to whom the coarsest fare Were food bestowed from heaven ? if not , how canst thou dare To ask a blessing on thy board , while Famine , even now , Is gnawing at a million hearts  --  each dear to God as thou ! February 9th , 1847 . Brownell , Henry Howard , 1820-1872 : THE VILLAGE GRAVE-YARD. from Poems ( 1847 ) It is a lone and sunny hill , Where all is calm , and sweet , and still . The spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And bids the wild-grass gently wave Above each long-forgotten grave . While yon grey elms , that many a year , Have cast their evening shadows here , And murmured o'er each clay-cold head , Seem watchers of the quiet dead ; And mourn , the same as long ago , O'er these still sepulchres below . At summer noon-tide , trimly drest , On a Sunday , in their best , Oft the village maids are seen , Walking in the churchyard green  --  Or with curious vision bent O'er some mouldering monument ; Where the quaint old epitaph , By rude Time diminished half , May wean their simple thoughts away From the vanities of clay . And here , beneath a mournful shade , Two beloved forms are laid  --  Two kind hearts have ceased to beat  --  Hushed two voices , sad and sweet , " Spirits twain " from earth have flown , Such as earth has seldom known . Oft in childhood had we played ' Neath that green and quivering shade  --  Oft our feet together prest On the turf where now they rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kind of heart and free of hand , Said , while sitting at my side , In those pleasant tones and dear , ' T was his hope , whene'er he died , That he might be buried here . ' T was summer , and we decked his tomb , The next , with wild flowers in their bloom . There reared the violet , drooping low , And taught the forest moss to grow . And the same gentle task , each year , Would call our lessened number here , Until that ne'er forgotten hour , When , in her blooming pride , Our dearest and our loveliest flower Was gathered to his side . And left these hearts of sin and care , To join her brother angel there . But from that hour , the rest no more Could meet in spring-time as before . And these poor graves , for many a day , All mournfully deserted lay ; Save that , when autumn hours began , One led by saddest thought , A friendless and unhappy man These silent dwellings sought  --  And kneeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-withered leaves of fern . Many a weary hour has flown , And here at last I am , alone . The pilgrim of a distant land , Once more by these lone graves I stand . Yet not so lonely now , for there , Methinks with sculpture smooth and fair , With fresh-heaped turf and marble new , Another resting-place I view . It fades  --  ' t was nothing  --  yet its span Seemed just the measure of a man . What frame shall fill this narrow mound ? Oh ! say , ye sleeping ones around ! Ye , that in centuries past have died ! Who next shall slumber by your side ? What cherished heart ? what bosom fond ? And oh ! far more  --  what lies beyond ? They may not tell  --  in vain the prayer , That fain would seek its answer there . These mouldering tenants of the dust Are ever faithful to their trust . And they , who from that dread sojourn Have found , by miracle , return , To mortal eye have never showed The secrets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear The tale of Wonder and of Fear . But carried all the lore it gave , Down to their second , final grave . 1842 . Brownell , Henry Howard , 1820-1872 : LINES WRITTEN FOR A LITTLE GIRL . from Poems ( 1847 ) I never saw thee , little one , I have not scanned thy face  --  Yet trust thy years have well begun , In gentleness and grace . For aught I know , thine eyes are blue , Thy ringlets wildly bright  --  Perhaps they have a hazel hue  --  Perhaps are dark as night . Thy loving smile  --  thy tender voice  --  Thy footstep soft and free , That bid a mother 's heart rejoice , Are all unknown to me . I never cared for children much , Yet there are one or two I love right tenderly  --  and such , I hope , dear child , are you . Like them , be kind  --  be meek  --  be just  --  Be true to God and man  --  Be sad and mournful , when you must  --  Be cheerful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I name To one I never met ?

And hard the settler 's weary lot , When , all the livelong day , Through rugged woods and stubborn rocks The axe and spade make way . But harder is the piteous strife , The awful feud between The Elements and Human Life  --  The Man and the Machine . Poor wretch , that in some low dark room , With failing hand and sight , Through the long day at web and loom Dost work from morn till night !
