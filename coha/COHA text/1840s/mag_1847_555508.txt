txt DURING the present year , the sympathies of the people of this country have been awakened to a painful extent by the sufferings of the people of Ireland and Scotland . There is something peculiarly horrible in the idea of death by starvation ; it is the most appalling form in which the " king of terrors " can appear . All other trials , all possible phases and effects of destitution and misery , must be endured and exhausted , before this awful calamity comes to close the scene . And when we were told that in the land of our fathers there were millions who were suffering from lack of food , and thousands who were actually perishing every week from hunger , every man 's heart was thrilled within him , and a noble , a universal effort was spontaneously made throughout the land to send succour to the distressed . It is no subject of national boasting , no cause for pride , that the contribution for this purpose was so large ; amounting to at least half a million of dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour , of rescuing a hundred thousand beings from starvation until another harvest could be gatbered in , it was still inferior to our means and our duty , and was not a tithe of what was needed in order fully to stay the progress of the destroyer . In modern times , a general famine in a civilized country is a rare , if not an unprecedented event ; we had almost come to believe that the march of civilization , the extension of trade , the facilities of transport , and the consequent ease of supplying the failure of the crops in one country by the superabundance of the harvest in another , had made a recurrence of such a calamity impossible . And if 39* // we take the word famine in its original sense , meaning an absolute deficiency of food and an impossibility of obtaining it on any terms , like that which is suffered by the garrison of a besieged town or by the crew of a wrecked ship , this is true . It is not in the scheme of Providence , as hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world over at the same time , or even for the failure to be so general that the aggregate product should not suffice - perhaps with some scrimping and some hardship - for the aggregate want . A semi-barbarous nation in the far East , or the population of a little island separated in every direction by thousands of sea miles from any continent , may suffer from a famine , properly so called , before the arm of Christian Europe or America can be stretched out to the rescue . But no civilized nation , either in the Old or New World , fears lest some blight or drought should suddenly leave a great portion of the people absolutely without food ; its fields may be unfruitful for a single season , but in such case it looks with well-founded confidence to its neighbours , and even to remote parts of the earth , for a supply . How comes it , then , that one half of the whole population of Ireland , and perhaps one sixth of that of Scotland , have been suffering the cruel pangs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them during this time have actually died of starvation ? The bounty of Providence has not failed ; ship-loads of corn have been turned away from their shores for want of a market . The granaries of the two islands have been filled to overflowing , not indeed from the products of their own harvests , but from the immense supplies poured into them by our ever-teeming land . Flour and meal became a drug in the English market before a sheaf of this year 's wheat was cut , and many dealers in grain were bankrupted by the consequent sudden reduction of prices . If the stock of provisions in the British isles had been equally distributed among the people , not a man , woman , or child would have suffered from hunger for a single hour . The fate of the Irish and Scotch appears the more terrible , because they have starved in the midst of plenty . They have died , not because the fields were cursed with barrenness , but because they had not wherewithal to buy food . The price of breadstuffs did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did not rise so high by // one third as in 1800 and 1801 ; and in those years , though there was scarcity , there was no famine ; the sufferings of the poor were increased , but there was no general starvation . The present year has witnessed a frightful anomaly , which will long he remembered as a disgrace to modern civilization , - a famine of which poverty was almost the sole cause . Yet Great Britain , as a nation , is the most opulent of any on the face of the globe , and inferior to none in moral and intellectual culture , in philanthropy , in the sense of justice , in all the qualities and arts that sustain and dignify human life . Her people were not wanting in generous effort to relieve the terrible suffering of Ireland and Scotland . The contributions made by individuals were large , though not so great as in the United States , for the calamity was viewed , and justly too , as a national one , too great to be stayed by private effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted the responsibility , and made a noble grant of eight millions sterling to assist the sufferers . The question with all classes was not how much should be given , but only in what manner , so as most effectually to check the evil . The problem as thus presented was by no means a simple one , for there was great risk lest an injudicious application of bounty should only increase the calamity , or tend to make it permanent . If private dealers had been forced to suspend their business because the government gave away food without stint , the sphere of misery would only have been enlarged , or the evil rendered one of annual recurrence . There was great discussion , therefore , on this point , but no one questioned the propriety of affording instant relief in some form , and to any extent that might be needed . Few persons are hard-hearted enough to count the cost of relief , when their neighbours are actually dying of hunger . How is it , then , we ask again , that with no difficulty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nation at large , this terrible famine has happened ? The answer that must be given is a startling one , but it is so well supported by a cloud of evidence from all quarters , that it would be idle to question its accuracy . It is , that the bulk of the laboring population of Ireland , even in their best estate , - in ordinary years , when crops are abundant , and there is no pressure or distress in the commercial or manufacturing world , no stoppage of industry from any unusual // cause , - are but one degree removed from starvation . They have nothing to fall back upon ; no retrenchment is possible , no greater degree of privation can be endured . Of course , a comparatively slight cause , an insignificant diminution of one article of the harvest , a rot in the potato-fields , cuts the slender thread which is their sole support , and millions are in danger of perishing with hunger . The amount of absolute destitution thus produced is great , seemingly out of all proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed . To adopt an illustration which was used some twenty years ago , in discussing a question of political economy , * this unhappy people may be regarded figuratively as clinging to the sides of an immense precipice , with but one support , corresponding to the smallest quantity of potatoes that can maintain life , to save them from falling into the abyss of starvation which yawns beneath . Narrow the ledge on which they stand by the fraction of an inch , and they can no longer retain their foothold . And the number of those who are in this frightful position is so great , that no human power seems able to rescue them from the danger , and to give them a broader hoN upon life . Every year , every day , the weakened sinews or crumbling supports of some poor wretches give way , and they fall almost unnoticed into the gulf . Ireland is not the only sufferer ; many of the people of Scotland are no better off , and the manufacturing and agricultural poor of England are rapidly sinking to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day , not only according to the natural growth of population , but in its proportion to the aggregate of all classes . Children are born to be as miserable as their parents , and individuals are constantly falling from one degree of poverty to another , till they reach this lowest stage . Property tends faster and faster to accumulate in a few hands ; the gains that are made , and they are enormous , are for these few ; the losses , the destitution and misery , are for the million . Disposable capital and labor both increase in Great Britain much faster than is needed ; the former is sent in vast amounts to foreign countries in search of employment ; the latter is less easily exported , and an immense surplus of it remains at home . It was long ago remarked , that man is the least transportable // kind of luggage . Labor is the only article the supply of which seems to increase without any reference to the demand . Its price therefore tends constantly to fall , competition acting on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is miserably paid at the best , and much of it can find no employment whatever . It often will not command any price , and he who has nothing else to offer must consequently beg or starve . We do not by any means attribute the miseries of Ireland to the superabundance of her population . There are nearly fourteen millions of acres of cultivated land in the island , besides six millions more , which are now uncultivated , but of which more than one half might be reclaimed ; making an aggregate that , under the most skilful husbandry , would support a population at least three times as great as the present one . The population now exceeds eight millions , having doubled since 1791 , and quadrupled since 1750 ; the misery of the people is great enough , but it surely has not increased in any thing like this proportion . Probably they were almost as badly off half a century ago as they are at the present day ; the evil is greater now simply because there are more to suffer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is proportionally increased . Besides , Ireland now raises more food than is necessary for her sustenance , and exports annually vast quantities of provisions to England ; and , as if for the express purpose of confuting the Malthusians , these exports rapidly increase from year to year . The export of cereal grains , chiefly oats , and of other edible products of the soil , steadily increased from less than one million of quarters in 1817 to three millions and a half in 1838 . The exportation of beef , pork , butter , and other animal products , has also gone on increasing , though in a lower ratio . The distress , then , is not caused by the growth of the population , and emigration alone must be a very inefficient remedy . With the present tendency to increase , at least one hundred and thirty thousand souls must remove annually , in order only to keep the population stationary , and to confine suffering within its present limits . Suppose vastly more should be done , and four millions of persons should emigrate at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be carried back to the point where it was in 1791 , and if nothing else were accomplished , the remainder of the people would // be as destitute now as they were then . It is idle , therefore , to talk of emigration alone as a cure for all the ills that Ireland is heir to , or of over-population as the only source of her miseries . Still , and this is our only reason for alluding to the subject of population here , - with the increase of numbers the sphere of misery is certainly enlarged , and relief becomes more hopeless . If the population should double in the next half-century as it has done in the fifty years that are l ) ast , there will then be sixteen millions of people to care for , and from one half to three fourths of these in a state of such destitution , that a slight circumstance , a partial failure of the crops , will place them in imminent peril of starvation . The famine of this year may be repeated after a short interval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident should enhance the price of the staple article of provision , whatever it may be , which is the sole reliance of the bulk of the people ; for , we repeat it , it is not the absolute scarcity of food , but the entire want of means to purchase it , which is the evil to be dreaded . Here is the cloud which darkens all the future for Great Britain , not only fearfully large and black at the present moment , but constantly swelling and covering a still larger portion of the heavens with gloom . Already it has once broken in a tempest that has desolated Ireland and a large part of Scotland in its fury . And there is no clearing up after the storm ; the sky still lowers , the skirts of the cloud are advancing , and the thunder mutters at no great distance in the ears of England . To speak without metaphor , this " condition-of-England question , " as it is called , is the one subject which , for the people to whom it relates , transcends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , with a fearful penalty for neglect . While it remains unsettled , all signs of national prosperity are factitious and deceitful ; they no more evince the absence of danger than does the hectic glow on the cheek of a consumptive patient . They only herald approaching dissolution . Before attempting to review the causes and consequences of this national distress , it may be necessary to produce some evidence as to its nature and extent . Those who have not attended to the subject may deem the existence of such a state of things incredible , and demand to be satisfied about the facts before they enter the boundless field of speculation // respecting their character and tendency . The proofs lie before us in such abundance , in the reports of commissions of inquiry made to Parliament , in travellers ' accounts , in the works of statisticians and political economists , that the only difficulty consists in making a selection or summary which shall afford matter enough for conviction , and be brief enough for our narrow limits . Two of the writers now under review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them had a book to fill , while we have but an article . We must be satisfied , then , with giving speci-. mens rather than a summary of the evidence , and with referring our readers to Laing and Thornton for more complete , though succinct , statements . Let us look first to Ireland as affording a full picture of that extreme state of destitution and misery , that farthest limit on this side of actual starvation , to which , as we shall afterwards show , the laboring poor of Scotland and England are fast approaching . It is not necessary to harrow up the feelings of our readers with the details of the famine of the present year ; it will be enough to exhibit the state of things which caused that famine . According to the Irish census of 1841 , which was taken with extraordinary pains and minuteness , and is entirely trustworthy , the whole number of families in Ireland is 1,472,787 , of whom nearly two thirds are chiefly employed in agriculture . There are 1,126,050 males over fifteen years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forming nearly one half the whole number of males of this age on the island . Besides these , 306,915 families cultivate farms not exceeding five acres each , many of them indeed comprising but one acre , and these small farmers , as we shall see , are nearly as wretched as the ordinary day-laborers . Those who hire less than one acre are reckoned as day-laborers . It is obvious that the agricultural population is excessive , only 352,016 families being chiefly engaged in manufactures and trade . England has nearly twice as much arable land as Ireland ; in the former country , only about 760,000 families are engaged in the tillage of 25,632,000 acres , while in the latter 974,188 families cultivate 13,838,782 acres . Adding the wives and children of the day-laborers and of those who hire farms not exceeding five acres , we have not less than five millions of persons , // or nearly five eighths of the whole population , constituting the class of the agricultural poor . To these must be added at least another million of poor among the civic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture and trade . These six millions would all be considered , according to the standard of wages and living in the United States , as very poor ; but as it is estimated by the best authorities , that only one half of the Irish population subsist chiefly or entirely upon potatoes , the number of those who can not fall to a lower stage of destitution than that which they occupy at present may be safely stated at four millions . The excess of the rural population , in comparison with the civic , is one great cause of the wretchedness of the small farmers . Unable to obtain work , the laborers strive to hire land , and their competition , by extravagantly raising the rent , brings the petty farmers nearly to their own level . Rack-rent is a new word which Ireland has added to the English language , to denote the excessive rent which the land-owner wrests by torture , as it were , from the poor cultivator . Any price that is asked will be given , and to secure the payment of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the demands of the landlord are satisfied . " The rent of conacre land , " says Mr. Thornton . " ranges from ? 4 to ? 10 or from 20 to 50 dollars an acre . " This term is given to the small plots of ground which are hired by agricultural laborers to be planted with potatoes . They are commonly held under one of the larger farmers , the rent being paid sometimes in manure , and sometimes in labor . For the cabin attached a rent of seven or eight dollars a year is paid . The system of underletting is carried to a great extent in Ireland , three or four " middlemen " often intervening at successive stages between the land-owner and the actual cultivator of the soil . The failure of either one of these may cause the single pig , the last resource , of the poor tenant to be seized for rent which he had already paid to his immediate landlord . Occupants of larger farms are obliged to employ laborers at the lowest wages , and sometimes to defer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to pay them . The excessive rent which the farmer pays deprives him of the power of properly manuring his land , or observing a due rotation of crops , so that the soil is every year deteriorated , // and the fences and buildings fall into decay . Numbers of them every year fail to meet their engagements , and are consequently deprived of their holdings , and sink into the next lower class , the number in which constantly increases as they go down in the scale , till they reach that in which further degradation is impossible . About two dollars a week are considered in England as the minimum of wages that can support a laborer with his family , and even at this point the hardship which he must endure is excessive . But the Irish laborers seldom earn more than one dollar a week , and for a large portion of the year can not find employment even at that price . They flock in multitudes to the towns , or to England at harvest time , seeking a pittance that may prevent them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which alone can shield them from starvation . XVhile they are gone , their wives and children wander about the country as beggars , often relieved by those who have nothing but potatoes for themselves . The people in the north of Ireland , it is often remarked , are less miserable than those in the middle districts and the south ; but work can not be obtained even by them for many months of the year . In winter they are hardly ever employed ; but their little crop of potatoes is then just gathered in ; and they are able to subsist till spring . In the summer they are again out of work , and , their potatoes being now exhausted , they are compelled to beg or starve , unless they can go to England or the neighbouring counties during the harvest . iVtany of them pick up shell-fish or weeds for food when their potatoes fail , and thus live on , always hoping " that times may mend , and that their landlords , sooner or later , will do something for them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly out of work during the six months of summer and winter ; spring and autumn alone afford employment at miserable wages . At one place in Carlow , the Commissioners of Inquiry in 1834 were told that five hundred men were unemployed , many of whom could not obtain two days ' work in a month ; at another place , out of fifty who applied for employment , only ten succeeded in getting it . In Longford , a fourth part of the laborers had nothing to do from September to March , and again from the first of June to the middle of August . As wages at the busiest time were // not more than twenty cents a day , a laborer could lay by nothing for the months of compulsory idleness . How , then , can he live ? He has usually a bit of land , often not more than a rood , for which he pays an excessive rent , and from which he may obtain nine barrels of potatoes . On these he subsists during the winter . In summer they beg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , " there s but little chance of our paying it back " - or they gather " pressagh , " a weed resembling Scotch kale , and upon this and boiled nettles they frequently live for days together . When such food disgusts , or can not be found , they try to " kill the hunger with water , " or " stifle " it by lying abed all day . In many instances , the Commissioners were told of persons who had repeatedly gone without food for twenty-four or forty-eight hours . Some eat up their seed-potatoes , or grub up the young potatoes when they are no bigger than marbles , and as unfit to eat from 4heir quality as their size . In Munster , things are still worse ; the population is more dense , and competition is more eager both for employment and land . In two parishes , containing four hundred and ninety laborers dependent on occasional employment , it was found that the average quantity of work obtained by each sufficed only for three or four months in the year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expired , and the wearer is not only ashamed to attend chapel , but in severe weather he is sometimes obliged to leave work , because no longer able to bear the cold when half naked . Half of the cabins contain no bedstead , but their inmates lie on straw spread on the ground , without blankets or any other covering . It is in Connaught , however , that we find the most striking picture of Irish destitution and misery in the most hopeless and aggravated form . It is " the lower deep " of suffering , which can not be paralleled in any other district of this afflicted island . In the county of Mayo , out of about 46,000 farms , 44,000 are under fifteen acres , and are held by men who are obliged to do their own work , being too poor to hire laborers . Yet the county swarms with laborers who can seldom get employment one day out of four ; there are 67,000 of them in this wretched condition . iVIost of them hire a potato-patch of the small farmers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to hold // rent-free for a year or two , till they have made it worth j ) aying rent for . When they have planted their potatoes , they set off to roam the country , beginning to beg only when at a distance from home ; or if they can obtain a few shillings to pay their passage , they cross over to England in search of work . If in this way they can get money enough to pay for the seed which they obtained on credit , and for the rent of the land , they can live during the winter on the potatoes which they have raised ; otherwise , their crop is seized , and they must beg during the winter also . They plant only the " lumper " potatoes , which are raised easily and in larger quantities than the other sorts , but are soft , watery , and unwholesome , so that even pigs do not thrive on them . These are often dug while yet small , and eaten with noxious weeds and other disgusting food . In summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men may be seen lying in the ditches from weakness , or working on the bog when so enfeebled by hunger that they can hardly raise the sods . A German traveller , J. G. Kohl , gives the following account of the habitations of these poor wretches . " In the west of Ireland , there are districts where a man may imagine himself in a wilderness abandoned by mankind , where nothing is to be seen but rocks , bogs , and brushwood , and where wild beasts alone may be supposed capable of housing . All at once , however , on closer inspection , little green patches like potato.flelds are seen scattered here and there among the rocks , and a stranger is tempted to go nearer and examine them . Let him look where he is going , however , or he may make a false step ; the earth may give way under his feet , and he may fall into - what ? into an abyss , a cavern , a hog ? No , into a hut , - into a human dwelling.place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one side was level with the ground , and nearly of the same consistency . If the traveller draw hack his foot in time , and look around , he will find the place filled with a multitude of similar huts , all swarming with life . " In a parish of more than ten thousand inhabitants , there were found but four hundred beds , so that , allowing three persons on an average to each of them , about nine thousand persons must have lain on straw at the best . In a village of this parish containing forty-five families , there were but thirty-nine blankets ; and in another parish of 1,648 families , 1,011 families had but one blanket each , and 299 // had none at all . " The straw we lie on , " said one of the Mayo cottiers , " was given us by some neighbours in charity ; we do not change it , we do not part with it at all ; but as it wastes away , the neighbours give us a wisp to add to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain for years without buying an article . In one parish there were more than three thousand persons who had bought little or nothing of this sort for five years . The men strive desperately to obtain " a breeches , " and by the help of rags do contrive to screen , not to cover , their nakedness ; their wives are forced to wrap an old sheet or blanket round them , and the children are often naked . Small farmers are sometimes so destitute , that they can not go to market without borrowing a coat from one person , a waistcoat from another , and a pair of trousers from a third . As wages usually do not exceed twelve cents a day , even for the small portion of the year in which they can obtain work , it is obvious that the laborers can not afford to spend much upon clothes . The dwellers in the towns are no better off than their brethren in the country . Wages may be a trifle higher , but there is always a multitude of applicants , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small encouragement for the lower branches of manufacture and the mechanic arts , the bulk of the people being too poor to create any demand for the articles made ; hence the excess of the agricultural over the civic population goes on constantly increasing . Bantry , says Mr. Thackeray , " is a town of cabins ; the wretchedness of some of them is quite curious . An ordinary pig-sty in England is really more comfortable . Most of them were not six feet long or five feet high , built of stones huddled together , a hole being left for the people to creep in at , - a ruined thatch to keep out some little portion of the rain . A Hottentot kraal has more comforts in it . " In Limerick , families of eight or nine persons inhabit single rooms , not more than four yards square , into which the rain pours through the roof , and the wind rushes through the broken windows . In Cork , says Mr. Thackeray , " there are quarters swarming with life , but of such a frightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the odors , and rags , and darkness are so hideous , that one runs frightened away from them . In some of them , they say , not the policeman , only the // 473 priest , can penetrate . " One striking fact , ascertained at the last census , shows how universal is the poverty of the people ; above a million of families , or over two thirds of the whole nation , live either in mud huts or single rooms of larger houses . The foregoing account , which is a mere abridgment of Mr. Thornton 's , is founded chiefly on the reports of the Irish Railway and Irish Poor-Law Commissioners . We have now before us , in five immense folios , the evidence taken in every part of the island , with great care and labor , by the Commission of 1844 on the Occupation of Land in Ireland . It is enough to say of it , that it confirms in every particular the preceding statements , and adds even higher coloring to this awful picture of national wretchedness . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony given before the Commission by Daniel Griffin , a physician and surgeon of the city of Limerick , who had made it his business for years to inquire into the condition of the lower classes . During a few days preceding his examination , he collected his evidence by making minute inquiries of a few families , " taken quite indiscriminately . " The following , with some abridgment , is his account of the result - " The families were 44 in number , consisting of 245 persons . In these there were 62 persons capable of work , with 183 persons depending on them ; of these last , 45 were sick or infirm . I could ascertain with certainty the earnings of only 35 of these families , and in these there were 56 persons capable of working , each of whom on an average earned ? 5 or ? 6 within the past year , being from ? 7 to ? 8 for each family , which would he equivalent to about seven months ' employment to each working person , at 7*d. 15 cents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 11 of these families seemed to live rather comfortably in comparison with the rest , having milk usually with their potatoes , and meat occasionally ; the remaining 33 families lived upon the lowest description of food , such as white potatoes and salt or herrings , and sometimes , hut rarely , a little sour milk . Of this last number , 18 families were frequently unable to procure any food , sometimes fasting for a long period , and living for a length of time on one meal a day . One person , James Boyle , with a wife and two children , states that they lived on potatoes and salt ; the family usually go without breakfast . The next , Michael M'Namara , wife and four children , says their food 40* // consists of potatoes and salt , sometimes a herring , frequently nothing ; the family often go without a meal . Another , Daniel M'Mahon , wife and two children , - potatoes and salt , dip ( a kind of grease ) , or a herring , rarely milk ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hap'worth of milk these six weeks . Then there are several others with much the same answers as these . Thomas Malony , with a wife and four children , states that his food is potatoes when he can get them , generally with salt or a herring , and sometimes a little milk ; what his family eat for a whole day would scarcely make one meal ; and once , lately , the whole of them , six in number , were for thirty-six hours without any food but one threepenny loaf . Others , the family of a widoxv , describe the same sort of food , - dry potatoes , seldom more than once a day ; this last fortnight their family have had but one meal a day . Garret Lee states , many a day these three months he worked on a meal a day , and was glad to have it ; that dry potatoes are their food , and they very seldom have enough . ' John Donovan says , he and his family are starving ; they did not eat two full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 5 P. M. , but a few apples ; ate nothing yesterday but their supper last night , which was obtained by pledging some of their things . ' A widow states , she had no supper for her family the night her husband died ; they all went to bed supperless . John Cherry says , the people are so poor they are ready to eat one another ' ; John Fitzgerald , that there are beggars coming to their door who are better off than they are . ' " With regard to their clothing , 10 of these families were well clad , 14 indifferently , and 20 very badly off for covering . With regard to lodging , 27 occupied a house each , and 17 a room each ; the average number of rooms in each house was three , and the average rent of each house ? 3 8s. 9d. , that of each tenanted room cE 1 is. 9d. , a year . These rooms and houses were occupied at the same time by 45 other families , besides the 44 which came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses , consisting of 131 rooms . I made it my business at different times to visit the residences of these people , and found them in the most wretched condition , the staircases ruinous , the rooms ruinous , the people sleeping on straw without bedding and without bedsteads . Garret Lee says , his family did not go to bed these three nights , their last blanket being taken by the person from whom they rented the cellar for non-payment of rent . ' Of the 44 families , 6 had nothing in the pawn-office , one had nothing to put there , having lost every thing , while the remaining 37 had every article they could spare pledged to pur // chase food ; or , as they said forcibly , every thing they could spare and that they could n't , ' having themselves in many instances nothing but straw to lie on , and without any covering for their children at night . " - Part IL . pp. 744 , 745 . We gladly turn to the sister kingdom of Scotland , as the distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so universal . It exists chiefly in the large cities , the populous manufacturing districts , the northern Highlands , and the Islands . Alison , the historian , estimates that there are at least 250,000 persons in Scotland , nearly a tenth part of the population , who are in a state of almost total destitution , and are permanently retained in that state . Many of the great Highland proprietors , for reasons which we shall consider hereafter , have driven the tenantry off their estates , which they have converted into immense sheepwalks , preferring to raise brutes instead of men . The unhappy cottiers thus dispossessed have found refuge on some barren moors , but chiefly on the sea-coast , where they lived comfortably for a time by the manufacture of kelp ; but the demand for this article having greatly fallen off more than twenty years ago , they were reduced to their present state of misery , often having only shell-fish and weeds to eat , with a little water-gruel at night . The peasantry still remaining in the Highlands are mostly crofters , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which forms their sole support . The soil is so poor and rents are so exorbitant , that they live very miserably , and those who have but an acre or two of land are in constant danger of starvation . Once famous for their stalwart frames , their agility , and powers of endurance , they have now become meagre and stunted in appearance , and the faces of their famished children are as thin and pale as if they had been bred in the foul wynds and closes of Glasgow and Edinburgh . On the Hebrides islands , owing to the poverty of the soil , and the multiplication of the inhabitants , wretchedness is extreme , and the remoteness of their position places them almost beyond the reach of charity . The policy of consolidating farms and driving off the small tenantry has been pursued there to a great extent . A population of 500 souls was compelled to migrate from the isle of Rum , which is now occupied to advantage by a single tenant , whose family and servants do not number over 50 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great cities in search of employment and sustenance , swelling the mass of poverty there , and reducing wages and the standard of living for the lower classes to their own level . The influx of Irish laborers , also , particularly into the western counties , has had a great effect in lowering the condition of the Scottish peasantry . It is a law of our nature , that moral degradation must go hand in hand with physical suffering . Nowhere is this more strikingly exemplified than in those quarters of Glasgow which form the sole refuge of the miserably poor , and where alone the Highlander expelled from his croft , and the distressed islanders , can find shelter . " I have four times visited these districts , " says Mr. Symonds , in the Handloom Commissioners ' Report , " once in the morning and three times at night ; I have seen human degradation in some of its worst phases , both in England and abroad , but I can advisedly say that I did not believe , until I visited the wynds of Glasgow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , misery , and disease existed on one spot in any civilized country . " Here is collected a motley population engaged in all the lower branches of industry , and an immense number who find their only means of subsistence in plunder and prostitution . Here , " in the lower lodginghouses , ten , twelve , and sometimes twenty persons , of both sexes and all ages , sleep promiscuously on the floor in different degrees of nakedness . " Captain Miller , the Glasgow superintendent of police , in speaking of this district , says - " There is concentrated every thing that is wretched , dissolute , loathsome , and pestilential . These places are filled by a population of many thousands of miserable creatures . The houses in which they live are unfit even for sties , and every apartment is filled with a promiscuous crowd of men , women , and children , all in the most revolting state of filth and squalor . In many houses there is scarcely any ventilation ; dunghills lie in the vicinity of the dwellings ; and , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulates . In these horrid dens the most abandoned characters of the city are collected , and from thence they nightly issue to disseminate disease , and to pour upon the town every species of crime and abomination . " // 1847 . The Social Condition of England . 477 monds to be 30,000 , though Alison makes it only two thirds as great . The latter writer says that Edinburgh contains about 15,000 in a state of equal wretchedness , and that the other cities of Scotland have their full proportion of the same , according to their population . The progress of crime , it is also shown , has been " more rapid in that part of the British dominions , during the last thirty years , than in any other state in Europe . " Serious crimes , in particular , during the thirty years prior to 1840 , increased in Scotland more than thirty-fold . In Glasgow alone , during the sixteen years before 1840 , while the population advanced 70 per cent. , the progress of felonies and other serious crimes was 500 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same conclusions respecting the destitution and misery of a large portion of its inhabitants . The average rate of mortality in Great Britain is about 1 in 48 , and in London 1 in 40 ; while in Glasgow , from 1835 to 1840 , it was about 1 in 32 , and in one year it ( 1837 ) was as high as 1 in 24 ' Ireland retains its mournful preeminence in this respect also ; for among the poor in Limerick , according to Dr. Griffin , whose evidence we cited on a preceding page , the rate of mortality rises to 5 per cent. , or 1 in 20 . A general review of the condition of the poor in Scotland will surely lead one to the conclusion adopted by Mr. Laing , that " Scotch destitution has gone a step beyond English , and arrived , like that of Ireland , at a point at which all other evils are swallowed up in the urgent and ever-present danger of literal death from starvation . " If the condition of the laboring classes in England is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ireland , it is certainly bad enough to command the serious attention of the statesman and the philanthropist , and to justify the most gloomy forebodings . So much statistical and general evidence has recently been published on this subject , that we may safely decline entering into particulars , and mention a few general facts only for the purpose of comparison . According to the census of 1841 , the population of England , including Wales , was nearly sixteen millions ; the whole number of paupers who were relieved in the year ending in March , 1844 , was about 1,250,000 , being more than one thirteenth of the entire nation . And this vast amount // of pauperism exists in spite of the stringent provisions of the Poor-Law Amendment , the avowed purpose of which was by great severity to deter the indigent from applying for relief . Almshouses have been converted into prisons , married couples are separated from each other , and a rigid course of hard labor and low diet has been adopted , in the hope that the poor might find their situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than when they relied only on themselves , - that they might prefer starvation outside of the workhouse to the seventies practised within it . This rigorous system has lately been introduced , in the well-grounded fear lest the community should come to be burdened with the support of most of the laboring population who are engaged in agriculture , and who number with their families at least three and a half millions . The wages of an able-bodied adult of this class never exceed 13s. a week , and in many counties are as low as 7s. ; the average throughout the kingdom can not exceed 9s . The peasants are almost always day-laborers , hired by the week or job , possessing no property , and living in rented cottages . How they live and support a family on these wages is matter of astonishment even to their employers . Their food consists chiefly of bread and potatoes , most of them tasting meat not more than half a dozen times in the course of their lives . They pay from ? 2 lOs . to ? 4 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having but two rooms , with mud walls and a floor of stone or earth . All witnesses agree that early marriages are very common among them , and in most cottages children are more numerous than the adult inmates . " In the workhouse , " says Mr. Tuffnell , an Assistant PoorLaw Commissioner , " where strict economy is studied , and where we are constantly told that we give the inmates too little to eat , it is well known that a man , his wife , and five children can not usually be kept under ? 1 per week , and this is reckoning nothing for house-rent , and all the articles required , being purchased in large contracts , are obtained 20 per cent . under the shop prices . Taking into account these two latter considerations , it appears that such a family could not be maintained in a state of independence out of the workhouse , with the same comforts they have in it , at a less cost than 25s. a week , which is more than double the general agricultural wages in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great number of families every year are fairly starved out of the country into some large town , and go to swell the floating population who tenant there the cellars and lodging-houses , like those described in Gla*goxv , and live by the worst-paid sort of manufactures , or by thieving , prostitution , and casual employment . How far this absorption of the poor into the cities and manufacturing districts has gone appears from the fact , that in twenty-one counties , where the poor are chiefly engaged in agriculture , the rate of increase of the population , from 1831 to 1841 , was only 8 per cent. ; while in the remaining counties , which contain most of the manufacturing , mining , and trading population , the rate of increase for the same period was 17 per cent . Dividing Scotland in the same way , the corresponding ratio was 4 against 15 per cent. , showing that the increase in the agricultural counties was little more than one fourth as great as in the others . Considering that the average duration of life among agriculturists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less , and that in large cities , such as Liverpool and Bristol , and in large districts in the heart of London , such as Whitechapel , St. Martin 's in the Fields , and East and West Il*ondon , the number of deaths even exceeds the births , so that they would be depopulated , if it were not for their rural recruits , who come in so fast that the population actually increases with frightful rapidity , it is evident that the agricultural poor can not find sustenance at home and are driven by stern necessity into the cities . How they are situated when they arrive there appears from the description already given of the wynds of Glasgow , a description which will apply with little abatement to the most populous quarters of all the large cities in England . In Liverpool alone there are 8,000 inhabited cellars , one third of them either wet or damp , which contain a population of more than 35,000 souls . In Manchester , in 1838 , there were 267 lodging-houses , of which IDr . Howard says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , women , and children , the floor covered over with the filthy and ragged clothing they have just put off , and with their various bundles and packages , mark the depraved and blunted state of their feelings , and the moral and social disorder that exists . " In Birmingham , there were 374 such // lodging-houses . Two asylums were opened in London in order to afford a night 's lodging to houseless wanderers , and 9,840 persons were admitted into them in the first three months of 1843 . Near the docks at the east end , " hundreds of poor men may be seen before daybreak in the winter , waiting for the opening of the gates in the hope of obtaining a day 's work ; and when the youngest and strongest , and those best known , have been taken , hundreds still may be seen returning , sick at heart , to their destitute families . " Of the manufacturing operatives , the handloom weavers are the worst paid , the wages of a whole family among them often not exceeding 5s. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount to 8s . After what has been said respecting the necessary expenses of a family existing in the humblest manner , it is difficult to see how they subsist at all their state is certainly one of extreme destitution ; yet there are 800,000 persons entirely dependent on this employment . The bulk of the manufacturing population , it is true , are not so deeply sunk in misery as these ; but their situation is still a very precarious one , and when , as is frequently the case , the fluctuations of trade cause great numbers of them to be thrown out of work , they are in imminent peril of starvation . Thus , while the manufacturing interest was in a very depressed state in 1842 , formidable riots took place in the midland counties , which showed that the people had become desperate . In Manchester , there were 9,000 families earning on an average only one shilling a week ; in Bolton , out of 50 mills , usually employing 8,124 workmen , 30 mills with 5,061 operatives were standing idle , or working only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being one fifth of the whole population , were dependent on the poorrates . But the calamity reached its height in Stockport , where no less than 10,000 persons were thrown out of employment . Many of these returned to their native parishes , where alone they could claim relief as paupers , and others wandered far over Lancashire and Yorkshire in search of work . " Those who remained behind struggled gallantly before they applied for parochial relief ; they first exhausted the little hoard accumulated in better days , and sold or pawned their furniture , eking out the money thus obtained with the earnings of occasional jobs . " // " Nothwitbstanding this independence of spirit , and notwithstanding that a large portion of the population of Stockport consisted of strangers not entitled to parochial relief , the number of persons of every description who were able to claim and were compelled to accept that relief had increased , in December , 1841 , to nearly seven thousand , one twelfth at least of the whole population of the Union . To so large a multitude , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shilling per head weekly . The poor rates , of course , were increased in proportion ; but the poverty of the rate-payers created so large a number of defaulters , that the amount collected invariably fell far short , not exceeding two thirds at most , of the sum estimated . In fact , out of 7464 rated houses existing in the township of Stockport at the date of the Report , 1632 were empty , and for nearly 3000 more default had occurred . " The commissioners personally visited the dwellings of several poor persons . Many of them are expressly stated to have parted with clothing and bedding for food , before applying to the parish . One man had pawned his wife 's wedding-ring for eighteen-pence , and his Bible for a shilling . Some were still living by the sale of their effects , and had not yet applied for relief . John Daniels ( his name deserves to be recorded ) , a silkweaver , with a wife and five children , having been long without work , was obliged to apply to the parish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shillings a week in provisions . The whole of his incomings were then about eight shillings a week . Being asked in what manner be disposed of this pittance , he said , . We make our breakfast for seven of us of a teacupful of oatmeal made into thin porridge , together with some bread ; at dinner we have about six pounds of potatoes , with salt and bread ; the tea , or supper , as you may call it , the same as at breakfast ; in the whole about four pounds of bread daily , say eight-pence , two-pennyworth of potatoes , and two-pennyworth of oatmeal , amounting to a shilling a day for seven of us . This , and lOd. a week we have to pay for coals , make up the 8s. nearly . ' This man , on obtaining work , gave up of his own accord part of the allowance ordered for him by the guardians . Lie had received 4s. a week for three weeks , and when the fourth payment became due , he went to the relieving officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have got one warp for myself , and the prospect of another for my wife . ' " The cases personally inspected by the commissioners , being chiefly those in which relief was received from the parish , did not present the extreme of wretchedness . There were other families , in which , according to the chairman of the Board of Guar // dians , it had been ascertained that many women had no clothes but a chemise , or wretched outer garment ; no flannel petticoat , or any thing fit to keep out the pinching cold of winter . ' The want of bedding was still more general . A few flocks , or a little straw , spread in the corner of the room or cellar , ' were all that some poor creatures possessed , with no covering but a single sheet or rug . Many had to lie together , to the number of six , seven , eight , and more , of both sexes , indiscriminately huddled together in their clothes , covered by an old sack or rug . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly consisted of a little oatmeal , or a few potatoes , or perhaps a little bread . Families , ' said a provision-dealer , that used to buy flour , now purchase only oatmeal ; they come for one or two pounds of oatmeal a day , and live upon it . ' A furniture-broker , who was also examined by the commissioners , said , People now bring articles of such a mean description , as they would never have thought of bringing for sale before . They offer me knives and forks , bits of old iron , any thing which they have about them , and they tell me they want to raise money to buy a few potatoes with , just to carry them on another week . ' " Of 15,823 individuals inhabiting 2965 houses , lately visited under the direction of a committee appointed for the purpose , 1204 only are found to be fully employed , 2866 partially employed , and 4148 able to work were wholly without employment .

The particulars which we have given respecting the condition of the laboring classes in England are few and meagre ; but they are enough to confirm the following remark by Mr. Thornton - " Little more than one generation has been required to make Ireland what she is ; and as short a period might probably , in similar circumstances , suffice to convert England into an Ireland of human misery and degradation . " Very grave questions are suggested by the picture of the social condition of Great Britain and Ireland which we have here endeavoured to exhibit . We are tempted to ask , if these are the reputed blessings of the institution of property , that vast and complex machine , so carefully constructed and guarded , the boast of free and civilized man , to which he is accustomed to attribute much of the superiority that he enjoys // over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce this fearful inequality in the condition of the several classes in society , so that millions of human beings , without any fault of their own , must suffer the accumulated ills of ignorance , extreme destitution , and almost inevitable immorality , while a few thousands of their brethren , distinguished from them only by the accident of birth , monopolize all the comforts and luxuries which learning and wealth can command ? Is man able to avoid the responsibility for this fearful state of things by casting the burden of it upon Providence , and saying that these evils are necessary adjuncts of the social state , and must be endured like the " plagues and earthquakes , " which " break not Heaven 's design , " and to which the Christian submits with uncomplaining trust ? Or are they rather the consequence of vicious institutions and mistaken legislation , for which man is alone accountable , and which may be remedied without pulling down the whole fabric of society and undoing all the work of modern civilization ? We may hopefully answer this last question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the order of Providence there is a natural check or limitation to the excessive accumulation of property in the hands of a few , and to the consequen debasement and misery of the multitude ; and that this natural corrective , when not interfered with or rendered powerless by unwise laws or a bad government , does tend so rapidly and effectually towards an equalization of wealth in the community , that no considerable number of persons can possibly be brought to extreme destitution , - certainly , can not be exposed to the danger of perishing by hunger , except by their own obvious fault . Such a check , we maintain , does exist in the very circumstance or cause to which the English school of political economists are fond of attributing the whole evil , the whole distress of the laboring classes ; we refer to the natural multiplication of the human species . Property in the hands of an individual unquestionably tends to accumulate ; one who has both money and industry can make greater gains , other things being equal , than his competitor who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the shortness of human life , an individual can hold this property only for a brief period of years ; when he dies , it descends to his offspring , and by the law of nature , as they are all equally // near to him , it is equally divided among them . When this law is not abrogated by human legislation , it causes so frequent a distribution of estates as effectually to overcome the tendency of capital to accumulate , or to continue in a single line of heirs . No sooner is wealth heaped up than it is parcelled out again , and a constant movement or circulation is thus maintained , which sends the life-blood of capital into every part of the body politic . This distribution tends as powerfully to political as to social equality , as the former , indeed , depends upon and is regulated by the latter ; hence it is the safeguard of republics , and the bane of aristocratic governments . The faster the population increases , the more rapidly does this great corrective of the accumulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more minute is the division of the parent 's wealth . But this distribution of estates is hostile to the whole spirit of the institutions of Great Britain , which is essentially aristocratic ; and English law therefore seeks to obviate it by two remarkable and unnatural provisions , - the right of primogeniture and the law of entail . By the former , at the death of the parent intestate the real property descends wholly to the eldest son , to the exclusion of the daughters and younger sons ; by the latter , a landholder may " tie up " his estate , as the phrase goes , for successive generations , so that a future possessor of it can not alienate it , but must transmit it unimpaired to the person standing next to him in the line of heirs . Strictly speaking , indeed , as Alison remarks , " the English law does not recognize entails ; yet they are practically established by the tendency of public feeling , and the succession of family settlements , by which great estates are effectually secured from alienation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further manifested in a multitude of lesser enactments , all tending to the same end , the keeping up of great estates , and the removal , as far as possible , of all chances of alienation ; to specify them all would require an analysis of the whole common law respecting real property . They are all relics of the feudal system , and the establishment of most of them in England may be traced back to the time of the Norman conquest . A modern contrivance for the same purpose is the imposition of excessive taxes on the transfer of landed estates , the stamp duty on the conveyance of small parcels of land being great out of all proportion to the value of the property conveyed . // Although these regulations directly affect real property alone , it must not be supposed that they are without influence in checking the distribution of personal effects . The aristocratic spirit is perpetuated by them , and diffused throughout the community . To keep up the family by holding the property together , or in a mass , has come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than an object of ambition . The right of the eldest son to the whole real estate creates or sanctions an artificial and unreasonable distinction between him and his brothers and sisters ; and when there is no such estate to be distributed , it gives him a seeming claim for a larger share , if not the whole , of the personal property ; the law which expressly enjoins an inequality in the one case permits and virtually encourages it in the other . Of course , frequent partitions are made on more equitable principles ; our only point is , that they are much less frequent in England than in other countries , where the law favors in every case the equal division of an estate among the children . Such a country is France , where the law regulating the descent of property is even more democratic than in the United States . It prevents a man from disposing of his wealth as he sees fit , even by will ; the right of each child to a certain portion is protected by law , only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free disposal of its first owner . And the consequence is , though this law of succession has not yet been in force for half a century , that the class of landed proprietors in France is more numerous than that which subsists altogether on wages , while in England it is but one sixtieth part of their number . In the former country , the number of separate properties taxed for the imp6t foncier , in 1838 , had risen to 10,896,000 . The average size of each property was only about fourteen acres ; the number of land-owners , including their wives and children , is estimated at two thirds of the total population of the country . The peasants are proprietors of the ground they cultivate ; and though the land owned by an individual often does not exceed a kitchen garden in size , and is tilled entirely by the spade , its gross product , under his patient and economical husbandry , much exceeds that of a corresponding extent of surface in one of the model monster farms of England . Three and a half millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongs to them , and depend entirely on wages 41 * // which , in the best years , hardly supply them with the necessaries of life , and which leave them , if the crop fails , or the price of provisions rises , in imminent peril of starvation . The total annual value of the lands which they till on these hard terms is known to exceed forty millions sterling ; and this immense income is monopolized by a few hundreds of the nobility and country gentry , - monopolized by means of legislation which opposes the order of Providence , and perverts the natural course of domestic affection , by rendering division or alienation of it almost impossible . The princely domains of the Dukes of Sutherland and Buccleuch comprise whole counties respectively in the north and south of Scotland ; and the latter had the power and the audacity , a few years ago , to say to thousands of families belonging to the Free or Seceding Scottish Kirk , the most numerous denomination in the land , that they should not have a church in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to build and pay for it ; the whole country , for leagues around , was his , and he would not give , lease , or sell a foot of it at any price , if it was to be used for the erection of a house of worship . The people submitted , - for had he not a right to do as he pleased with his own - and the congregations assembled , Sabbath after Sabbath , in the open air , in the public highway , - which , happily , is not owned altogether by the Duke of Buccleuch . A nation submits to social oppression , to the tyranny of wealth , much more quietly than to political oppression ; if Parliament had prohibited an equally large portion of the people from building a single house of worship for their God , the act would have excited a civil war . The gigantic estates of many of the English nobility , such as the Dukes of Northumberland and Devonshire , the 1'Jarquess of Westminster , the Earls of Harrowby , Leicester , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford incomes which exceed those of many crowned heads in Europe ; these nobles own more rich land in the heart of England than some independent princes govern in Germany . And their vast possessions , as a general rule , go on augmenting every generation , eitlier from the union of estates by marriage , or from the annexation by purchase of smaller properties in their vicinity ; their growth is easy ; their partition or alienation is rendered by law almost impracticable . Ireland // itself , wretched , starving Ireland , is owned , as it were , in counties , by the English and Irish nobility and gentry ; it is carved out into monster estates , which are leased piecemeal to middlemen and great farmers , who again subdivide and underlet the land which they hire , till the division is brought down to the little conacre patches of the miserable peasants . Many a princely income is made up from an immense aggregation of rents not exceeding 51. or 101. each , and is thus wrung by driblets from the unhappy tenants , who live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they may be able to pay it . Throughout Great Britain and Ireland , the word farmer denotes one who hires the ground which he cultivates , while in the United States it signifies almost without exception the proprietor of the soil . In France and Switzerland , also , he who tills the land is the owner of it , and , small though his property be , its product is sufficient for his wants . Contrasting the general well-being of the farming population in these three countries with the misery of the English and Irish peasantry , and remembering also that Great Britain is vastly more opulent than either of the others , we can not avoid attributing the whole evil to that great inequality in the distribution of her wealth , and that monopoly of her soil by a few families , which have been designedly created and fostered by the aristocratic spirit of her institutions and laws . The English school of political economy , the school of the Edinburgh Review , of Malthus and Ricardo , of McCulloch and Dr. Chalmers , will not admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of a few is any evil at all . Looking only to the production of wealth , and affecting to consider its distribution as wholly unimportant , - a matter which will regulate itself , - they stoutly maintain that the division of land and capital is an evil ; that neither of these agents can produce its utmost beneficial effects unless accumulated in large masses ; that great improvements in agriculture can not be made except on immense farms by the aid of opulent landholders ; that the benefit which the coiiimunity receives from the operations of husbandry consists only in the net product , and not in the gross amount of food added to the national stock ; that the individual producer , the farmer or land-owner , is the best judge of his own interest , and what conduces most to his profits is sure to be most advantageous to the nation . Now , human labor is an item , and a very im // portant one , in the cost of raising a crop ; - economize labor , then ; substitute machines for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every article as cheap as possible ; do n't impede the operations of your great capitalists and landowners , and " leave things to take care of themselves . " Laissez faire . True , a smaller amount of food will be produced , a less number of appetites will be satisfied , and a greater crowd of laborers thrown out of employment . But the expense of the year 's operations is diminished in an equal , or even larger , proportion ; the farmer 's net gain is greater , and he is able to pay a higher rent to his princely landlord , who is in great need of an addition to his annual income , which may not yet equal a hundred thousand pounds sterling , though two or three of the English nobility count twice that sum . And this is the theory which English economists have been advocating for half a century , and which all the great capitalists , land-owners , and farmers have been vigorously reducing to practice ! Labor has been economized with a vengeance , and we have seen the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain . Wages have been reduced to the lowest point at which the laborers can buy bread and potatoes enough for a scanty subsistence , the surplus rural population has been drained off into the great cities or the workhouses , and twelve hundred thousand paupers have been thrown upon the public , without counting at least an equal number who are dependent in great part on private charity . Only 760,000 families in England are now employed on the tillage of her 25,632,000 acres of cultivated ground , which is an average of one family to 34 acres ; that is , a square mile gives employment to about 19 families . In portions of Tuscany , says M. Sismondi , from 300 to 700 individuals cultivate a square mile , and earn from it a coinfortable subsistence ; they are proverbially the happiest peasantry in Europe , excepting perhaps the Swiss , who have a still denser population , at least an equal proportion of them engaged in agriculture , and a far more minute division of land . Very unthrifty husbandry this , ' McCulloch and Chalmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proprietor in Tuscany must be quite small ; with the aid of agricultural machines and the improved modes of English husbandry , three fourths of this laboring population would be dispensed with ; and the net gain - the addition to the // national capital - would be much greater . ' Very true ; but the laborers thus dispensed with would starve , and though the national capital might be increased , what would be the effect on the national happiness ? Those who have not studied the subject will be astonished to find to what extent this policy of favoring the increase of great landed estates , of consolidating farms , and driving off the laborers and small tenants , has been carried in every part of Great Britain and Ireland . For political reasons , of late , great proprietors have become very shy of letting their lands on long leases , or , indeed , on any leases at all ; small farmers , who were sure of their little holdings for a number of years to come , were sometimes found to disregard the wishes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually more compliant . The Irish people being factious and obstinate in the matter of politics , their landlords have very generally adopted this mode of " breaking them in , " and perhaps the greater portion of their farm lands are now rented without leases . Of course , this policy was ruinous for both parties , the tenants not daring to make any improvements on the ground , being in constant danger of ejection , and exposed to fresh extortion every year in the way of rent . Accordingly , when the economists had made this great discovery of the gain to be derived from the union of farms and the banishment of the tenantry , the Irish landlords had the power all in their own hands for reducing the theory immediately to practice . How they exercised it can be fully known only by an intrepid examination of the five great folios , to which we have already alluded , containing the Report of the Commissioners on the Occupation of Land in Ireland . We can give but one specimen . Lord Kenmare is the landlord , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christopher Freeman , the Roman Catholic curate of the parish , is the witness ; his testimony , we should observe , is fully confirmed by eight other deponents , several of whom were banished tenants themselves , and is substantially corroborated by his Lordship 's own agent , who was put upon the stand for the express purpose of confuting or explaining away their statements . Mr. Freeman says - " Up to the year 1840 , the consolidation of farms , and the consequent wholesale eviction of tenants , was almost unknown in this barony . Lord Kenmare commenced in the year 1840 by // ejecting from the lands of Ahills 22 families , comprising 135 individuals . He ejected , in the years 1842 and 1843 , 16 families , comprising 97 individuals . Total evicted from the Kenmare property 38 families , comprising 232 individuals . I am vastly under the mark ; I might say a good deal more . The persons evicted paid their rent regularly ; the rents amounted from 51. lOs . to 201. each , and some of them more . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-disposed , and industrious persons ; and the object to be obtained by the consolidation of these farms , and depriving these unfortunate people of their only means of subsistence , I can not tell . " " What in general has become of them ? " - " The children of some of them have been begging ; some of them have died in the most dreadful distress ; some of them I know to he comfortable ; and some of them have had typhus fever . I attended one family of eleven immediately after being ejected . They were ill with fever , and the father was obliged to get out of bed to attend to them , and he was in the fever himself ; and I was obliged to remove one out of bed in order to hear the confession of another , - and I believe that to be solely caused by Lord Kenmare 's dispossessing the people . " Was any thing done by Lord Kenmare or his agent to assist these people ? " - " Nothing whatever . I went myself to Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mv LORD , - When the cause of the distressed or afflicted is to be advocated , I feel that it would be superfluous to make an apology for trespassing on your Lordship 's time . You are , I suppose , my Lord , aware , that many honest , industrious persons have been ejected from your estate in the parish of Bantry . It is to plead the cause of these unfortunate but honest people , and to enlist , if possible , your Lordship 's sympathy in their behalf , that I have come to Killarney . May I request , my Lord , the favor of an interview at your Lordship 's earliest convenience ? " I have the honor to be , &amp;c . ' " And this is the answer I got from his Lordship , which shows he was conversant of it : - " SIR , - In reply to your communication , I beg to say , that giving you credit for good intentions , I must yet decline granting you the interview you desire , as I can not allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my property . I am , Sir , &amp;c . KENMARE . ' " The means by which the consolidation was , and is about to be , accomplished , I am well acquainted with . In the great majority of cases , no law process was required . The population to // be evicted were told , that if they gave possession peaceably , and left Lord Kenmare 's property , they would get their potato gardens , and a certain portion of their other crops then growing on their farms . They were then told , that if they did not comply with these terms , law proceedings would be commenced , and they were then to expect nothing but the heaviest vengeance of Lord Kenmare and his agent . It is very well ascertained that it is equal to death to the poor people to be deprived of their lands ; some of them die miserably . The consequences are indeed melancholy , both as regards the persons ejected , and many of those who took the large farms at rack rents . At present , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must give up ultimately . They do not manure the land , because , they say , if they improved it , it would be doing so for other persons . " The whole estate of the Earl of Kenmare in this barony consists of 23,000 acres , on which is a population of 3,400 persons ; and the process of ejection and consolidation seems to be still going on . His Lordship has succeeded in his main purpose in making these improvements , as the testimony shows , that , in one case , lands which had been let under him by a middleman for 861. 6s. 2d. are now let by the Earl himself for 4101 . Similar changes have been effected , or are even now taking place , all over Ireland ; we could fill a large volume with a record of cases quite like the one here described . Let us now turn to Scotland , and look more particularly at the forced depopulation , to which we have already alluded , of the Highland districts and the Islands . For an account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l'l35conomie Politique of M. Sismondi , - English political economists and other writers , for obvious reasons , being very chary of allusions to the subject ; even Alison and Thornton , who deplore the issue of the experiment , as having occasioned a frightful increase of suffering and pauperism , do not enter into any particulars , and make no comment on the proceedings and motives of the chief agents in the business . But one who is not a British subject may be allowed to speak freely of the conduct even of the great Duchess of Sutherland , and her noble and wealthy fellow-proprietors and imitators . We have never met with the Account of the liiiprovements made on the Estates of the Marquess of Stafford , by James Loch , Esq. , the agent of the Duchess in this // business , who wrote and published his book as a justification of her proceedings ; but Sismondi 's account of it appears to be temperate and trustworthy . The statement which follows is a mere translation and abridgment of this French writer 's clear and eloquent review of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , the nation of the Highianders or Gauls , the descendants of the ancient Celts , now reduced to 340,000 souls , has been almost entirely expelled from its borne by the very persons whom it regarded as its chieftains , and to whom it had shown for so many centuries an enthusiastic devotion . The territory which they had cultivated from generation to generation , under a fixed rent , has been taken from them and devoted to the pasturage of flocks guarded by herdsmen who were strangers ; their houses and villages have been razed to the ground or destroyed by fire , while the unhappy people have been forced either to build cabins on the sea-shore , and endeavour to maintain their miserable existence by fishing , or to cross the ocean to seek their fortune in the back settlements of America . As this revolution took place in a distant and almost barbarous region , of which the very language was unknown in other parts of the empire , it attracted at first but little attention . But when it became known in England that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expel them from their villages , and sometimes had driven away the soldiers by a shower of stones ; that they had been heard to intreat that they might be massacred with their wives and children on the graves of their fathers , rather than be sent away , to perish , in misery and abandonment , to a world which wished not to receive them , and where no place was reserved for them , universal sympathy was excited . It was reported that the agent had been compelled to set fire to their houses , and even that an old man , or , according to other accounts , an old woman , refusing to leave her cabin to encounter misery and exile , her presence did not stop the incendiary , and the victim had perished in the flames . Then the public indignation showed itself , in a manner which could be neither mistaken nor braved . The Duchess of Sutherland thought she did not merit the severe judgment which was passed upon her conduct , and it was to justify her at the bar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has tried to prove , and he has done it successfully , that // 493 the Duchess has exercised only her acknowledged legal rights , and in so doing has had regard to the preservation of the existence of her vassals , for which she felt that she was responsible . The ancestors of this lady were proprietors of about three fourths of the county of Sutherland , in the most northern part of Scotland . Their possessions measured about one million of English acres . When the Countess of Sutherland inherited these domains , which she brought as a dowry to the Marquess of Stafford , since created Duke of Sutherland , their population did not exceed 15,000 . The revenue ? btained by the proprietor from her vassals was so small , that it might be considered rather as an acknowledgment of sovereignty , than as a rent . It appears , that as late as 1811 , each family was bound to an annual payment only of a few shillings in money , of some articles of game , and of a few days ' labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these domains was required to spare neither his blood nor his life in defending the sovereignty and honor of the family of which he considered himself as a member . . Mhoir-Fhear Chattazbh , as he was called in Gaelic , or The Great Man of Sutherland , had always found his companions in arms ready to defend him , at the peril of their lives , against every enemy , whether foreign or domestic . The population was pretty equally distributed over the whole district . Every valley had its hamlet ; the arable land was devoted to the cultivation of barley and oats , and the hills were given to the pasturage of cattle . The people were poor , as labor and pasturage were their chief resources ; the climate was severe , the winters long , and they had neither manufactnres , commerce , nor money . But they had generally enough to supply their wants ; and even when the wrath of Heaven sometimes destroyed their harvests , and decimated them and their herds by famine , they knew how to submit with resignation , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufferings . Between the years 1811 and 1820 , these 15,000 inhabitants , forming about 3,000 families , were driven away , or , to use Mr. Loch 's softened expression , removed , from the whole interior of the county . All their villages were demolished or burnt , and all their fields converted into pasture . A similar clearing was made , almost simultaneously , by the // owners of the rest of the county , and their example was soon followed by the great proprietors in Ross and Cromarty counties , and generally throughout the north of Scotland . Mr. Loch assures us that the Duchess of Sutherland has shown far more humanity than any of her neighbours ; she has interested herself in the fate of the exiles , has offered them a retreat on her own territory , and , on taking away from them 794,000 acres , of which they had been in possession from time immemorial , she has generously left them about 6,000 , or two acres to a family . The land thus granted to them , however , had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , it was not conceded to them gratuitously ; they are subject to a moderate rent of two and a half shillings an acre , and no leases are granted to them for more than seven years ; but they are assured that the leases shall be renewed for another term of seven years , if the land should be well cultivated . Mr. Loch informs us that the fate of these exiles has not been so deplorable as they foreboded . Some , it is true , were unwilling to receive any thing from her who had driven them from their homes . The clan Gunn , or the MacHamish , after leaving the mountains of Kildonan , and the valleys of Naver and Helmsdale , quitted the country entirely , and we are not told what has become of them . But with the exception of this tribe , and of 32 families from Strathbrora , who left for America in 1818 and 1819 , the clansmen , we are told , have almost all accepted the lots offered them by the Duchess . They have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in attempting to cultivate the ground which bad hitherto remained a waste . The territory of which the Duchess has thus reclaimed possession has been divided by her agent , Mr. Loch , into 29 great farms , very unequal in extent , some of them being larger than the department of the Seine in France . These farms , intended solely for the pasturage of sheep , are each inhabited by a single family , and as the kind of labor required upon them is a new thing in Scotland , only English farmservants are employed . As early as 1820 , the place of the brave men who formerly shed their blood in defence of Mhoir-Fhear Chattaibh was filled by 131,000 sheep , and their number is now doubtless much increased . No human voice is now heard within the narrow passes of those hills once // made illustrious by the combats of an ancient race ; no one any longer calls to mind their glorious recollections ; the valleys have no more any hamlets , no accent of joy or grief any longer troubles those vast solitudes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is established for the future in England , many hundreds of miles distant from the country of his maternal ancestors , can repose and enjoy himself for his ancient vassals ; in his magnificent abode at Trentham he can display a royal pomp , and encourage by his luxury the manufactures of England . There is no doubt that the experiment has been successful ; this revolution in the property , the habits , the affections , the whole existence , of a little nation has prodigiously augmented the already colossal fortune of the IDuke of Sutherland . This expulsion of the Gaelic people from their ancient firesides is considered as legal ; but will men dare to say that it is just ? Other great proprietors in the county have not been so humane even as the Duchess . " The clan of the Gruids on Lochshin , " says Mr. Loch , " was numerous ; it does not appear that any lot of land was assigned to this people , or that they have received any recompense since the time of their expulsion , which took place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Celts or Gauls , which formerly possessed not only the British isles , but France , and a part of Italy and Spain , shall it be driven , in the name of the laws , from those very rocks where it was never conquered , from those rocks where it maintained its independence , that was lost everywhere else ? Ought these last representatives of the most ancient masters of Europe to be exiled ? It is by a cruel abuse of legal forms , by a flagrant usurpation , that the Highlanders either of Sutherland county or of other parts of Scotland have been considered as having no right to the soil which they have occupied for centuries , and of which , in fact , they were co-proprietors with their chieftains . Even their name , Klaan , in Gaelic signifies children . All their usages , all their reciprocal relations , all their affections , were founded on the tradition that they were the offspring of one family ; all their rights were those of the children of a common parent to the common patrimony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dividing the land among them , and even of frequently altering this // distribution . It was a matter of public policy with the Celts , as well as with the Germans , that families should frequently , even annually , change their position in the district which belonged to them , lest they should become too much attached to the fields which they cultivated , and thus be unfitted for war , and averse to undertaking military expeditions . But though their locations were altered , the vacated places were occupied by other members of the same clan , and the chieftain could not alienate any portion of the common property . The tenure of the lands remained the same ; the assessment for the public defence , the annual contribution for the chieftain who ruled them and led them to battle , were never augmented . The vast extent of seigneurial domains is not a condition peculiar to England . In the ninth and tenth centuries , Maine , Anjou , and Poitou were , for the counts of these provinces , three great farms rather than three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland , was at the same epoch divided among a small number of great lords . If the counts of Kyburg , Lentzburg , and Hapsburg had been protected by English laws , they would now be situated just as the counts of Sutherland were thirty years ago ; perhaps they might have bad the same taste for improvements , and have depopulated their lands to give place to flocks and herds . But during the last eight centuries , the legislation of Continental Europe has constantly tended to guaranty and ameliorate the lot of the feudatory , the vassal , the serf , - to confirm the independence of the peasant , to cover him with the buckler of prescription , to shield him from the exactions of his lord , and to elevate his allotment to the rank of property . But English law has always favored the great lords ; English jurists have constantly assimilated political rights to property , and have defended them under this title . The Gaelic tenant was never conquered he did not obtain his land from the liberality of his lord , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clan . The chief whom he followed to battle regarded him at first as his friend and relation , then as his soldier , afterwards as his vassal , still later as his farmer , and finally as his hired laborer , whom he might employ for a time , but might banish from the estate when he had no further need of his services . // The first step in the usurpation was to grant the tacks , or portions of land , to the vassals for a fixed period of time . This appeared to be a concession , as formerly the occupants could be changed at will ; but in truth it was a usurpation , for now , instead of filling the vacated places with other clansmen on precisely the same conditions , the lands came to be considered as farms , and at each renewal of the lease new terms might be imposed , and a higher rent demanded . Thus the Highland lords , who were rightfully entitled only to an invariable rent levied on the property of the clan , obtained at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , they were far from believing that the time would come when they would take advantage of the renewal of the leases , not merely to raise the rent , hut to expel their vassals from the estate . Before coming to a determination so barbarous , the chieftain must have ceased to share the opinions , the sentiments , the point of honor of his countrymen ; he must have ceased to regard himself as their father or their brother , or even to remember that he was himself a Scotchman ; a base cupidity must have stifled in him that sympathy of kindred blood on which their common ancestors relied when they confided to him the fate of his people . A count has no more right to banish from their homes the inhabitants of his county , than a king has to expel from the land the inhabitants of his kingdom . Let the most despotic monarch make the trial , and he will soon learn the hazard of thus overleaping the bounds of his authority . Let the great English lords beware ! The less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them to put themselves in opposition to the nation . Let them not say , when their own interests are at stake , as the agent of the Duchess of Sutherland has said - " Why should a different rule be adopted in this case from that which has been followed in every other ? Why should the absolute right of owners to their property be abandoned or sacrificed for the public advantage , and for motives which concern the public alone ? " If they should come one day to believe that they have no need of the people , the people will begin to believe in its turn that it has no need of them . If they think that 340,000 brave mountaineers of the Gaelic race can be profitably driven off to make room for four million sheep , these mountaineers can still more easily find useful substitutes for thirty or forty , 42* // perhaps for three hundred , great lords who have ceased to be their countrymen . We have chosen to give this whole account of the depopulation of the Highlands in M. Sismondi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transposition , because we have not the book at hand from which he obtained the particulars , and because we would not be suspected of exaggeration or national prejudice in exposing the barbarity and flagrant injustice of the proceeding . The whole history shows in a striking light the tendency of lEnglish law to favor the growth and permanency of great landed estates , and the natural result of those measures which have been so strenuously advocated by the English economists , - the Chrematistic or Capitalist school , as Sismondi calls them , - who defend the aggregation of land and capital into a few hands , and leave the interests of the laboring classes of the population to take care of themselves . The introduction of the system of monster farms , and the expulsion of the rural tenantry , have been going on more slowly and quietly in England than in the two sister kingdoms , but quitq as extensively , and attended with perfectly similar results . The consequence is an enormous increase of pauperism , a reduction of wages almost to the point of starvaton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of employment , a famine during the present year , when there was no absolute lack of food , and , in short , all the terrible signs and proofs of national decay and distress . The whole evil may be described in the few words in which the philosophical Roman pointed out the cause of the ruin of Italy ; latifundia perdid*-re - Britanniam . Finding that the support of the laboring classes was a burden not to be avoided , - that if employment and wages were not given to them , they must be maintained as paupers , - that if they were driven from the country , they would take refuge in the cities and manufacturing districts , where the very air would be polluted by their misery and their crimes , the capitalists and land-owners , guided by the political economists , have at last discovered that the evil consists solely in a redundancy of population , and that the only remedies are emigration and the discouragement of marriages . The doctrine of Malthus is the last refuge of the Chrematistic school ; the New Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment , the separation of the sexes in them , and the change of public charity into a system of graduated starvation , are the results of an attempt to reduce this doctrine to practice . Population , say the Malthusians , has an inherent tendency , in all cases , to outrun the means of subsistence ; it tends constantly to increase in a geometrical progression , doubling every twenty-five or thirty years , while the supply of food , at the best , can not be increased faster than in an arithmetical ratio , equal quantities being added every twentyfive years . Put these two principles together , and it follows by mathematical demonstration that the whole world must soon be brought to the verge of actual starvation . Why the human race has so long remained far on this side of the awful precipice , why we have not , on their theory , been starved out long ago , or have not been reduced , like a wrecked crew on a raft in the midst of the ocean , to fight with each other for the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain . As the powers of a geometrical so far exceed those of an arithmetical ratio , the world ought to have been overpeopled some thousands of years ago . But it is not ; Providence has not yet sent any human beings into the world when there was no place at the table for them . Even in the extreme case of Ireland , we have shown that the extent and fruitfulness of the soil would suffice for a population thrice as large as the present one ; and the misery of the people there was nearly as excessive half a century ago as it is now , though the population then was but half as large . There is no surplus of population , but there is a frightful surplus of labor which can find no employment , and consequently can not be exchanged for the food which exists all around in abundance . A child can see that the famine of the present year was not caused by the lack either of food or of wealth ; if the national stock of both could be equally distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single pang from hunger . It is palpable that the evil does not consist in over-population , but in unequal distribution . But you say , that it is difficult to bring about a more equal division without infringing the rights of property . Granted , for the sake of argument ; but do not confound this difficulty with another of quite an opposite character ,  --  the difficulty of feeding a great multitude out of five small loaves and two fishes . There are now loaves and fishes enough for all ; but // they are all in the hands of very few persons , who claim them as their own , and the problem is , how to get them out of these few hands , and to give them to the starving people . Before you declare this problem to be insoluble , abolish your laws of primogeniture and entail , adopt the French law of succession , break up your monster farms into cottage allotments , substitute spade husbandry for agricultural machines , and educate the people . If you leave them in the condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutes . Of all the doctrines of the English political economists , that of Malthus is at once the most absurd and the most pericious . It is a futile attempt to throw off the burden of responsibility for that state of things which is plainly attributable to nothing but human selfishness and improvidence , - to consider as irremediable , and inherent in the very constitution of man , those evils which flow directly from a vicious form of social and political organization , and from unjust and unnatural laws . Its only monition is , to let things alone ; to allow privation , wretchedness , and crime to produce their appropriate results ; to abstain from aggravating the evil by any interposition of public or private charity between the stern decrees of an oYerruling necessity and its destined victims . It seeks to deprive the poor of the only solace which remains to them , the indulgence , within the limits of morality and law , of the natural appetites and affections ; it holds up " abstinence from marriage for prudential motives ' * as the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implies a degree of forethought and self-restraint which is not to be expected from them in their miserable and degraded condition . But all other expedients for alleviating their sufferings it pronounces to be futile and self-destructive . Luckily , it is unsound in theory , and is abundantly confuted by facts . Malthus begins with the assumption , that there is no check to the multiplication of the species except from the want of food . According to his doctrine , those classes of the population ought to increase most rapidly which are most abundantly supplied with the means of subsistence ; while the growth of the destitute classes should be perpetually checked by their poverty . Now the very reverse happens to be the case , and this because the rate of increase actually depends , not on the supply of food , but on sundry moral considera // tions which he leaves entirely out of view . If every man got married as soon as he was urged by natural inclination , and as soon as he saw there was no fear lest his wife and himself should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very rapidly . But no one propounds to himself the question in this shape ; the candidate for matrimony asks further , if he is likely to improve his condition in life by the measure , or if he is sure at any rate not to lose position and caste by it , not to descend in the social scale , or to forfeit those advantages and enjoyments which habit has caused him to consider as necessaries of life . If there is any risk of this sort , you may be sure that prudence or ambition will get the victory over love . Raise the standard of living , increase the number of artificial wants , multiply the chances of advancement in life , and people will become still more cautious about bringing upon themselves the impediment of a family . The middling classes of society increase in number very slowly , the upper classes do not increase at all . Marriages among them are governed entirely by prudential considerations . Who ever heard of kings marrying for love ? Among the English nobility and gentry , families frequently die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the House of Lords were not replenished by continual promotions to the peerage , it would soon become a very meagre assemblage . Younger sons prefer a life of licentious celibacy to the restraints of a family , and to the almost certain loss of caste by getting a wife without an estate . The undowried charms of the daughters are not likely to be besieged by a multitude of suitors . Thus the sole chance of continuing the family often depends on the marriage of the eldest son and heir , and this is quite likely to be deferred till he has passed the period of youthful extravagance , and purchased the discretion which comes only with maturity of years . On the other hand , the poorer classes , who have no hope of bettering their condition , and can not fall far because they are already near the bottom , marry with little consideration or foresight . And even this little fails among those who are already steeped in poverty to the lips , who are too iguorant and degraded ever to look beyond the wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fear any increase of their misery . Mr. Laing states this point strongly . " Evidence abounds of the tendency to improvident marriages // among the distressed population of the manufacturing districts generally , and also among such portions of the agricultural population as are most wretched and degraded . In fact , an accelerated rate of increase in the population is a necessary result of poverty down to the point where literal starvation arrests its progress ; and how low this point lies , the instance of Ireland sufficiently attests . While lumper-potatoes can be had for food , and a corner of a cellar with a bundle of mouldy straw for lodging , it is a demonstrated fact that population will continue to increase at a rate five times more rapid than in countries where every peasant lives under his own roof and cultivates his own estate . The reasons are obvious ; directly sic the laborer is placed in a situation where he has nothing to look forward to , - no hope of being able to better his condition by restraint , - no definite period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proprietor , to mark the prudent and customary era of marriage , - all the natural checks on the instinctive appetite are withdrawn , and he marries , as a matter of course , as soon as he feels the inclination . The great check on premature marriage in every class is the public opinion ' of that class , which requires a certain income and establishment in life before marrying , under penalty of losing caste and being looked upon as silly and imprudent . When the standard prescribed by the public opinion of the class has sunk so low that , as Mr. Fletcher say of the weaving population of Nuneaton , men commonly marry without a home to go to , ' or with a bed consisting of chaff , held together by bricks , and covered with a wrapper , ' for sole stock of furniture , it is evident that all moral check on population is at an end , and that the evil must of necessity go on propagating itself , until either typhus fever and famine make a clearance , or the moral and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without " It is not true , that if we relieve distress and diminish vice and misery , population rushes in like a spring-tide to efface the puny lines which we have traced in the sand . On the contrary , it is distinctly true , that duty and expediency , the means of raising the condition of the laboring classes , and the means of rightly proportioning their numbers to the supply of food , go hand in hand ; and that in applying ourselves zealously to the task imposed upon us by religion and humanity , of relieving immediate distress , and promoting the welfare and improvement of the poorer classes , we are at the same time adopting the only effectual means of limiting the morbid and unhealthy increase of a destitute population . " - Laing on National Distress , pp. 68- 70. // and effect . They say , that increase of population causes misery ; while the truth is , that misery causes the increase of population . Of course , we must reverse the Maithusian precepts for the management of the poor ; instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavouring to starve them into it , - instead of separating the sexes in workhouses , prohibiting out-door relief , discountenancing public and private charity , and declaring that the condition of the destitute classes is hopeless , and that interference with them will only increase their misery , - we must strive to succour and elevate them , to give them a stake in life , to surround them not only with necessaries , but with some cornforts and luxuries , the fear of losing which will inculcate prudence more strongly , will do more to deter them from forming imprudent marriages , than all the lectures of Dr. Chalmers , or all the stories and illustrations of Miss Martineau . The difficulty of accomplishing all this is unquestionably great , but any thing is better than the despondency of McCulloch , who speaks gloomily of " the irremediable helotism of the great majority " of the laboring classes , but , in conformity with the principles of the Chrematistic school , of which he is the great expounder and advocate , has no advice to offer except to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to fold our arms , and leave the de'nouement to time and Providence . " * That the view here taken of the law of population is the only correct one is shown not only by theoretical considerations , but by the incontrovertible evidence of facts . In France , where the land is minutely divided , and the peasantry are vastly better off than in England , the rate of increase of the population , for ten years , is only 5 per cent. , while in the latter country it is 15 , and in Connaught , the sink of Irish misery and degradation , from 1821 to 1831 , it was as high as 22 per cent . In the province of Ulster the rate is 14 , while in the county of Donegal it rises to 20 per cent . " And this is precisely the county which official reports represent as forming an exception to the general condition of Presbyterian Ulster , and affording an instance of poverty little less extreme than that of Connaught . In the latter province , we find // Gaiway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibiting , the one an increase of 27 , and the other of 25 per cent . In Munster , we find Clare , Kerry , and Tipperary at the head of the list . " - Laing on National Distress , p. 67 . But enough ; the subject leads on to endless disquisition and illustrations , and we have already much exceeded our limits . We have pointed out the evils in the social condition of England , and some of the causes of them , certainly with no feeling of bitterness , and in no vainglorious spirit , because the condition of our own population is so much happier , and because our political institutions exhibit tendencies the very opposite of those which have imposed this intolerable burden of poverty and wretchedness upon the necks of British subjects . I'he spectacle is too awful , the prospect is too appalling , to excite any other emotions than those of the deepest sympathy and commiseration . The causes of the evil are deeply seated ; they are inwoven with the very texture of British institutions , and can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wealth , the serfdom of the laboring classes , are so firmly anchored in the empire , that they can be shaken only by the hurricane strength of a revolution like that which prostrated the throne and the nobility of France in 1789 . The immediate cause of the wildest excesses of that epoch was a cry of the populace for bread ; and one of the great permanent effects of that memorable convulsion was the adoption of a democratic law regulating the descent of property . England is already heaving with the first throes of a similar outbreak . The frequent suspension of the Habeas Corpus act in Ireland , and the disarming of its people , the Chartist disturbances in 1838 , and the riots in the midland counties in 1842 , are signs the purport of which can not be mistaken . Even now , peace is maintained only at the point of the bayonet , by the presence of large bodies of troops , and of an armed and disciplined police . These facts are full of warning to the stoutest declaimer for the preservation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estates . Let the blessings of an hereditary aristocracy be what they may , admit all that is claimed for it by such advocates as Alison and Dr. Chalmers , it is still possible that they may be purchased at too high a price.
