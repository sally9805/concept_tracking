Dramatis Person  --  MERLIN , an Enchanter . ALPHONSO , lover of Elmira . MARCUS , his friend . ELMIRA . Sprites , Furies , &c.; Main text ACT I.  --  SCENE I.  --  An uninhabited country at the mouth of a Cave  --  Enter Merlin . Merlin From the caverns of the earth I , Merlin , have derived my birth ; All the elves that flit in air , Or skim the wave , my livery wear  --  The spirits of the misty deep , Come at my call , my mandates keep ; I can the nimble lightning bind , And chain the sharp and whistling wind : Or call from out the stormy north , The fell Borean tempests forth . To me futurity unveils , And destiny submits her scales : The gloomy caves of hell I tread , And hold dire converse with the dead ! Along the dread Erebian coasts , I 've wandered with the fleeting ghosts ; Or mounted on the winged blast , Thro ' heaven 's etherial arch I 've past . Hither , spirits , hither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface of the deep , Where the frothy waves ye sweep ; From the intermediate air , Hither at my call repair . Ye who on mankind attend , Hither your swift pinions bend , For human weal , I call you here , On the confines of this sphere . Enter Spirits . Spir . Spirit  --  We are here . 1st Spir . First Spirit  --  What to do ? Mer . Merlin  --  I call you from the regions of the air , By the soft influence of a virgin 's prayer  --  For on the flowery margent of that stream That glows and sparkles in the solar beam , A hapless maiden kneels with grief opprest , And tears her golden hair and beats her breast . As mounted on an airy courser , I Roam 'd in the precincts of the lower sky , I saw the damsel , like a lovely flower , Drooping and drown 'd beneath an April shower . All pitying I , lent a propitious ear , And so attending heard the damsel 's pray'r , And hence I learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India 's burning shores ; What dangers wait him on the watery way , Her love and fears alternately pourtray , And fill her breast with many soft alarms , Lest fate should not restore him to her arms . The young Alphonso wooed the charming fair , Whose father turned aversely from his prayer , And bids him seek for wealth in foreign lands , Where India spreads her coasts of burning sands ; But when the smiles of fortune he shall gain , The sire 's consent Alphonso shall obtain . Twelve times the moon her crescent hath display 'd And Titan 's annual cycle hath been made , Since the fond lovers parted on that spot , Where still she lingers to deplore her lot . But now returning to his native shore , Alphonso cuts the foaming brine once more . And , if no envious power forbids , twelve hours Shall land him safe on Hudson 's bank of flowers . Haste then o'er ocean , on the winged gale , Or , in a sea-shell on the surface sail ,  --  Or let the nimblest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of golden light , Seek out the object of the maiden 's prayer , And him in safety o'er the salt sea bear . 1st Spir . First Spirit  --  ' T is done . Exit . Merlin  --  You take the figure of a female friend , And on the love-lorn damsel 's steps attend : Whisper soft consolation in her ear , And bid her bosom banish every fear . Second Spirit . I 'll take the form of Clementine her friend , And on the love-lorn damsel 's steps attend . Exit . Mer . Merlin  --  Hence to your several tasks etherial band , Brought hither by the waving of this wand ! Lo , I dismiss you to the air again , Or to the bosom of the beating main ; Spread your light pinions , and with viewless flight , Swift as the arrows of the god of light . Haste to those regions subject to your sway , The purple ether ,  --  and the watery way , Till on the surface of this mundane ball , Again I summons ;  --  then obey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SCENE II .  --  The Sea-shore  --  Thunder  --  Enter three furies , Alecto , Megra , and Tisiphone  --  They perform a mystic dance . Song , by the three . Now the sea-mew spreads her wing , And from her sandy bed doth spring , Mounting in the murky air , While the vivid lightning 's glare . Now the sea-mew screaming flies , While the thunders shake the skies ; Sisters , hither have ye come , From the black Tartarean gloom , To work our spite in human woe , And bid the tears of sorrow flow  --  By the livid lightning 's flash , By the thunder 's solemn crash , By the terrors of the wave , ( Full many a human wand'rer 's grave )  --  By all the trembling ghosts that glide On Lethe 's dark and weedy side ,  --  Let the foaming billows rise , Till yonder ship in ruins lies . Alec . Alecto  --  See ,  --  she tosses on the billow , Soon to be the sailor 's pillow ! Blow ye tempests , roll thou thunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dusky air , See the lurid meteor 's glare :  --  Blacker still the clouds appear , Tremble mortals ,  --  men must fear . Meg . Megra  --  Ah , now she founders on a fatal rock , Hark !  --  all the shores resound with th ' dire shock . I hear the hapless wretches groans arise , With stifled screams , thick sobs , and bitter sighs . Sisters , well done , Alphonso sees no more , The fair Elmira , and his native shore ,  --  For in the bottom of that ship he lies , And if no power forbid , Alphonso dies . T is . Tisiphone  --  Wretched mortals , doomed to death , Ah , how fleeting is your breath , Ah , how frail is human kind , Senseless , thoughtless , weak and blind . Sisters , let us haste from hence , O'er the watery space immense , And seek again our silent caves , Beneath old ocean 's dark blue waves  --  Quickly , quickly let 's descend , Pluto 's summons to attend . Exeunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Elm . Elmira  --  Even here beneath this lofty spreading oak , Blasted and withering with the lightning 's stroke , Fit emblem of my fortunes , I will wait The final doom that shall pronounce my fate . Ye pitying heav'ns , if such a wretch as I , May call upon the mercy of the sky , O let me be by hopes no more misled , But your red lightnings give me to the dead . This is Elmira 's last and latest prayer , Robb 'd of all joy , and sentenced to despair . Enter 2d Spir. in form of Clementine . Spir . Spirit  --  Be comforted my friend , good omens bring A store of consolation on their wing . I saw two ring-doves from the green-wood fly , And Jove 's bright bow suspended in the sky . These signs to you glad tidings do portend , Then cease your tears , and bid your sorrows end ; And here I promise that another wane , Shall give Alphonso to your arms again . Elm . Elmira  --  What pity such sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will to heal . Spir . Spirit  --  Let not my good intentions fail , Elmira , And trust my prophecy shall be fulfill 'd . Before another moon fades by degrees , From midst yon concourse of attending stars , Alphonso shall return . Elmira.  --  Hope I have banished  --  Alphonso never can to me return : A cruel father 's harsh command forbids it . Sings . Ah , wretched is the maiden 's lot , Who loves a wand'rer of the sea , In foreign climes by him forgot , What shall her consolation be . Or if his love indeed be true , Alas , a thousand griefs arise , Eternal perils him pursue , And she in sadness pines and dies . Spir . Spirit  --  Elmira , I have tidings of Alphonso !  --  Elm . Elmira  --  O , Clementine , you are my friend indeed . Is he alive and well ? Spir . Spirit  --  He is , Elmira , And homeward bound , and if I judge aright , He will be with you e 're another night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supreme be mine , Come let 's away , my faithful Clementine . Exeunt . SCENE IV .  --  The Sea-shore  --  Enter Alphonso . Alp . Alphonso  --  I only ' scap 'd the perils of the wave , And cast upon a barren savage shore , Thrice happy they who find a watery grave , For they are safe , and tempest-tost no more . My brave companions rest you there in peace : Death bids your cank'ring sorrows all to cease . Me fate severe condemns to live in woe ! But hold my tongue , let silent sorrows flow . Enter Marcus at a distance . Mar . Marcus  --  The storm hath ceased , lo ! in the silv'ry clouds , The bow of Iris spreads its welcome round , Embracing the glad earth .  --  What see I here ! Another person scap 'd the wreck !  --  thank heaven It is Alphonso  --  Poor unhappy youth , Thou wilt not thank thy stars for preservation . Thou oft hast wish 'd to die , but death flies from thee , ( Like some coquette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , when he no doubt would be most welcome , When thou hast lost the all thy toil has gain 'd , Like other friends he leaves thee in thy need . Alphonso , ho !  --  Alphonso.  --  Who calls Alphonso ! Why make these rocks to echo to a name That fate but sports with ; leave me all alone . Mar . Marcus  --  How now my friend ,  --  is this a place to show Such humours to a friend so lately found ! Alp . Alphonso  --  I know no friend but death  --  Marcus .  --  And he deserts you . Alp . Alphonso  --  I will fly to him . Mar . Marcus  --  Forbear ,  --  he is a monster ,  --  A savage tyrant , whose unfathomed maw Feeds indiscriminately on friends and foes . Come , let us seek some place to find repose . Alp . Alphonso  --  Ay , in the grave ,  --  no other place is given For man to rest beneath the arch of heaven .  --  aside . My friend , I am but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we may rest ourselves , Then bring me word , and I will hence with you . Exit Mar . Now since my ticket in this lottery Of man 's existence hath come up a blank , I will expunge my number from life 's book . I will not be a minion on this earth , To curse my fate , and quarrel with my stars , But from the summit of yon promontary , That juts its brown head o'er the swelling surge , I 'll cast myself into the deep below !  --  Forgive me heaven if I act wrong in this ! I toil 'd beneath the burning influence , Of suns that shot their perpendicular ray Upon my fated head ,  --  to gain that wealth Which now the envious sea hath swallowed up ! And now Elmira never can be mine . Then welcome friendly death ;  --  to thee I fly , And beg forgiveness from the power on high . Exit . ACT II .  --  SCENE I.  --  The Coast near Merlin 's Cave . Enter Merlin . Merlin What adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark , dank caverns that extend From yonder rocky hill , to this sea-shore , I sat upon a block of polished steel , And muttered charms to sprights and bat-like elves , That flitted by me in the sullen gloom ,  --  I heard the tempest shake the cavern 'd rock , And ocean dash 'd his salt-spray to my feet  --  Yea , penetrated to that deep recess , And , but for my forbidding wand , had whelmed Me in its foaming surge .  --  I 'll see anon , Who dares to check me in my forceful spells . None but the Omnipotent alone hath power , Who rules the highest hierarchs of heaven . If all the powers of hell and earth combine , Their force united can not equal mine . I 'll call my spirits , and the cause explore , That made the winds arise , and billows roar . Hither , spirits , hither haste , O'er the wild and watery waste , Through the fields of purple air , Hither at my call repair .  --  Waves his wand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enjoin 'd ? 1st Spir . First Spirit  --  I have perform 'd it well . Second Spirit .  --  And I. Mer . Merlin  --  Mark 'd you who was the mover of this storm ? 1st Spir . First Spirit  --  I saw the triple sisters who delight On human kind to vent their bitter spite : Who bring war , tempest , pestilence and flame , And all woes else , hence furies is their name : Like winged harpies , I beheld them fly , While horrid darkness followed thro ' the sky , And lighting on the margent of the deep , They bade the winds arise and tempests sweep . While I the charge you gave me did attend , On all die ship sulphurious fires descend ;  --  Around the masts the thick'ning vapours clung , And all the shrouds in dripping tatters hung . And now the vessel mounts a dizzy height , Now in the sea-trough seems to sink outright ; At length she dashes with a shivering shock , Upon the pointed shelving of a rock  --  Alphonso scap 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them safely to the shore ;  --  The rest to death the furies have consigned , And in the deep one common cerement find . And now , obedient to your call I come .  --  Mer . Merlin  --  Well done , my spirit .  --  What success had'st thou ? Second Spirit .  --  I found the fair Elmira all in tears , And left her smiling in renovate joy . Mer . Merlin  --  Likewise well done  --  But I must hence away , To Lapland 's freezing clime , to bring a root , None but myself doth know :  --  Till I return , Which shall be e 're the evening sun descends , Each to his task .  --  Invisible remain , And guard the youth and maiden from all harm . Ex . Spirits . I must annul the fatal sisters ' charm . SCENE II .  --  Discovers Alphonso preparing to cast himself from a rock . Alp . Alphonso  --  That man alone is free who fears not death . This world is but a prison house , from which Millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captivity , and in willing bondage Spin out a life of weariness and woe , Cross 'd and defeated in his warmest hopes . The sport of fortune and the mark of fate , Whose arrows fall with far more virulence Than the Indian 's venom 'd shaft . Who would dwell Among a race that prey upon each other ? I 'd rather house me with a host of fiends  --  Demons have mercy , human kind have none But malice , envy , interest  --  blacker fiends Hell never in its utmost hate brought forth !  --  These take possession of our earthly hell , And banish pity from the human breast . O tyrant gold ,  --  the rankest curse that Jove E'er in his vengeance sent upon mankind : Parent of human ills , war , rapine , murder , Are still attendant on thee . One more sin I add to thy account ,  --  it is self-slaughter.  --  I have determined  --  O Elmira ! The strongest tie that links me to this earth , Might I but send this parting breath to thee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , It should inform thee of a mine of love ( Richer than all that wealth the sea hath swallowed , ) Which now has residence within my breast , But soon must be dislodged from thence by death . Farewell  --  I go  --  forgive me gracious Heaven !  --  Enter Marcus and seizes him , Mar . Marcus  --  What means this fury  --  wretched man forbear ! Art thou so quit with Heav'n , to draw so much Upon its mercy ,  --  See the gulf before thee , Nor trifle on the brink of an abyss , That swallows , but ne'er renders back again . Eternity !  --  say hath that word no terrors ? Rash man , wilt thou the almighty vengeance dare , And hurl defiance to the throne of God . Enter Spir. invis . Nay , struggle not ,  --  you shall not do a deed In this wild fit of momentary passion , A deed that ages never can undo . Thou'lt thank me for preventing thee hereafter . Come to the cave ,  --  be calm , your crime is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1st Spir . First Spirit  --  I 'll take a human form , and follow them . ex . SCENE III .  --  A Wood  --  Enter Furies . Alec . Alecto  --  We the human breast control , Pour dark passions in the soul , We mankind to sin incite :  --  Envy , jealousy , and spite ,  --  All the fiends that vex the race Of mortals us their rulers place . Sisters , whither shall we fly , Through the earth , or thro ' the sky , All our aim and object still , To do mankind the greatest ill . Meg . Megra  --  Alphonso hath escaped our rage , Merlin war with us doth wage  --  Merlin 's all-controlling wand , Sisters , how shall we withstand . T is . Tisiphone  --  Merlin 's wand can not disarm , This our last most potent charm , But the lovers both shall fall , Victims to our ireful gall ; Nought can save them from our wrath But a root that Lapland hath ; Buried in the earth it lies , Hidden from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , We his fury can withstand . SCENE IV .  --  Merlin 's Cave on the sea-shore . Mar . Marcus  --  Think what a precipice you have escap 'd ! Alp . Alphonso  --  Ay , as a wretch ' scapes drowning to be hung . Mar . Marcus  --  Heav'n yet hath happiness in store for you . Alp . Alphonso  --  Heav'n husbands well . No doubt I 'll die it 's debtor . Mar . Marcus  --  Think on its mercies , O Alphonso . Alp . Alphonso  --  Ay , so I did  --  I thought upon my death . Mar . Marcus  --  How could you bear the idea of self-murder ! Alp . Alphonso  --  Better than I could bear life 's burden .  --  Mar . Marcus  --  Than black ingratitude , a deadlier sin Ne'er stained the catalogues of human crime , And yours is worst ,  --  ingratitude to Heaven . Alp . Alphonso  --  Not so ,  --  I wish 'd to pay the debt I owe it , The debt of nature  --  even before ' t is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heav'n yokes thee with existence , And darest thou cast it off , and say to heaven I will not bear thy burden ? This is madness ! No more  --  here comes a person to the cave  --  He seems a laboring peasant by his dress . Enter 1st Spirit . Hail , friend , whence came you , and for what intent . Spir . Spirit  --  I chanced to see you enter in this cave , And curiosity hath brought me hither , To know what men you be ; can I do aught To give you pleasure ,  --  I am at your service . Mar . Marcus  --  We are two mariners escaped from shipwreck , And seek a shelter in this silent cave  --  Can you procure us food . Spirit .  --  I can and will .  --  But why art thou , young man , so much cast down . Hast thou lost some dear friend in this sad wreck .  --  To A. Mar . Marcus  --  Ay , he has lost his wealth . Spirit .  --  Of what description ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , In which I had deposited some stones , Gems of high value , and some precious pearls . Spir . Spirit  --  I can procure it . Alphonso.  --  Go , you mock us , ' T is buried in the bosom of the deep , Beyond all chance and hope of a recovery . Spir . Spirit  --  Stay you but here awhile , and I will bring it ; Nay , do not follow me , I must alone .  --  Mar . Marcus  --  Come back , Alphonso , better here remain ,  --  This man perhaps can bring the casket to us . Alp . Alphonso  --  Tell me  --  have you seen it  --  have some pity , And do not keep me in suspense , I pray you . Spir . Spirit  --  If you will stay I 'll bring the casket to you  --  But if you follow me , I must not get it .  --  Exit . Alp . Alphonso  --  Hope shines not here , or if it deigns to shine , ' T is like the gleamings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frozen ground . Mar . Marcus  --  I feel a goodly boding ; sure this man Will restore your casket to you  --  I perceived From the expression of his countenance He meant not to amuse him with your sorrow . Alp . Alphonso  --  I have been tutored to adversity : Misfortune still attends me from my cradle , And aught of good seems supernatural ; I ca n't give credence to it .  --  Mark you this , We shall be disappointed ,  --  I know well . Tut , think you I should meet with such good luck To find the casket , with my buried hopes ! Why all the miracles upon record ,  --  The loaves and fishes , healing blind and lame , Could never equal that . Marcus .  --  You are too desponding ; There still should be a medium , twixt despair And hopes too sanguine :  --  both alike mislead , Tho ' in a different way . Some men would seem Never to keep the true and mediate path , But wander on this side to seek for flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If hope seduces , with a harlot 's wile  --  Despair enslaves us , with an iron grasp . Then rouse and shake this bold intruder off , Nor let your manhood be ta'en prisoner By sour-eyed despondency ; let sighs and tears Be still the love-sick virgin 's last resource , But men should be above such female weakness . Re-enter Spir. with casket . Alp . Alphonso  --  Running to him.  --  It is ,  --  it is my casket ,  --  Oh God !  --  my friend ,  --  I never can repay you ; Thanks are too poor to speak my gratitude . Spir . Spirit  --  Come with me hence , I 'll lead you to a cottage That 's seated on the green declivity Of yonder hill . Marcus .  --  We will follow you .  --  Learn hence , Alphonso , never to complain Of Fortune 's gifts ,  --  and ne'er despond again . Heav'n holds the scale , and justice guides the beam . We rise and fall by turns at each extreme . ACT III .  --  SCENE I.  --  Elmira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enter Elmira , weeping . Elm . Elmira  --  Now be the sun for-evermore obscured ; And blotted from the pages of the sky ; Be all those adverse stars the characters Of my unhappy fate :  --  Thick and unwholesome mists Wrap the green earth , that nature 's self may sicken , And with one deep and mighty groan expire . Alphonso , buried in the whelming wave ! Are these the joyful tidings that portend : O Clementine thou hast deceived thy friend , With false , deceitful hopes  --  what have I now To live for ,  --  since Alphonso is no more . But I will not survive him ,  --  love forbid it  --  I will not live ,  --  my plighted faith forbid it . Alphonso ,  --  Death shall not dissolve our vows , Elmira follows thee  --  this very night !  --  Yea , ere the sun , with his descending beams Plays on the turrets of the city spires , This vial shall unite us yet once more : I 'll keep thy counsel ;  --  here comes Clementine . Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  How fares my gentle friend ?  --  Elm . Elmira  --  Why  --  so  --  I have received some tidings . Spir . Spirit  --  What are they , sweet Elmira ? Elm . Elmira  --  Have you heard nothing lately of importance That much concerns me ? Spirit .  --  Why nothing , But that Alphonso shortly will return . Elm . Elmira  --  Clementine , thou knowest How long I mourn 'd his absence ;  --  daily I To yonder tree , where often we have met And interchanged our vows of mutual love : Thither I would repair , and think on him , And thinking so , the summer 's day seem 'd short . O Clementine , I ne'er shall see him more ! Spir . Spirit  --  This is self-tormenting : Ideal fears that haunt the sick man 's breast , And rob the tender virgin of her rest . Art thou not well my friend ?  --  Elm . Elmira  --  I shall be better shortly . Spir . Spirit  --  Sweet I hope so . Elm . Elmira  --  Leave me Clementine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee with my affliction . This certainty is easier to be borne Than , that suspense with which my breast was torn . Now I 'm resolved . Exit . SCENE II .  --  A Wood  --  Ent . Furies . Alec . Alecto  --  Soon shall Titan 's car descend , To where the sky and ocean blend , And with blushing beauty greet , Each the other when they meet : I the fatal letter bore , To the fair on Hudson 's shore ,  --  With the tidings of her grief , From which in death she seeks relief . Meg . Megra  --  And now the charm is almost done , ' T is finished with the setting sun : On yon glimmering star I sate , The star that rules these lovers ' fate . And their mischief there I plann 'd Safe from force of Merlin 's wand . T is . Tisiphone  --  Who can ' scape the furies ' ire , Arm 'd with pestilence and fire , Sword , and tempest ,  --  who shall dare With the furies to wage war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye black fiends , to your infernal home In hell 's deep arches , fill 'd with damps and gloom ! Hence , know ' t is Merlin gives you this command , And dread the waving of this potent wand . Fur . Furies  --  Merlin , the sisters heed not your command , Nor dread the waving of your forceful wand . Mer . Merlin  --  By the pale spectres , and the shades below , By the thrice-triple streams that round them flow , By earth 's green bosom , and the heaving main , I charge you hence . Furies .  --  That charge is also vain . Mer . Merlin  --  By the blest mansions , and the courts above , By the almighty name of deathless Jove , Go hence !  --  Fur . Furies  --  Great Magus , we can not be driven From hence , by earth , by ocean , hell or heaven . Mer . Merlin  --  Yet mark this root of a peculiar worth , Born in the bosom of the frozen north , By this I charge you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinations vain . Furies vanish . Now will I haste these lovers to unite , Thus free 'd forever from the sisters ' spite .  --  Exit . SCENE III .  --  Elmira 's dwelling .  --  Elmira , sola . Elm . Elmira 527  --  O ever thus may joy succeed to grief , A change so sudden taxes my belief . Even in the hour I had resolved to die , Alphonso 's letter met my joyful eye . By this I learn 'd he hath escaped with life , Love saved him in the elemental strife . This night we meet on the accustomed spot Beneath the oak  --  Propitious heav'n befriend , Nor let thy boundless goodness be restrain 'd . O Time be quick  --  anoint thy chariot wheels , That they may sleekly roll away the space That separates Alphonso and Elmira . O may kind Heaven smile on our interview , And may we never , never part again .  --  Sings . In the desert of life tho ' thorny the way , In pity kind Heaven hath lent One charm to beguile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor trav'ler content . O what is that charm  --  such a path to beguile , With thorns and with thistles o'erspread , O say what can make such a desert to smile , As thro ' its dark shadows we tread ! ' T is love hath the power to soften each woe , That man in the wilderness meet , What a ray of beatitude love can bestow , The poor forlorn wand'rer to greet . Love is the sweet solace of each earthly care , By Jove in his pity ' t was given , To be our balm in adversity here , And prepare us for joys of heaven . SCENE IV .  --  Banks of the Hudson  --  Enter Alphonso . Alp . Alphonso  --  If there 's a joy that human kind can feel And angels envy ,  --  ' t is when the banish 'd wretch Returns to his own home  --  to life and love .

She comes , O Heaven !  --  this moment pays for all . They embrace . Elm . Elmira  --  Alphonso !  --  in that name there is a charm That could not be forgotten for a moment . Daily have I resorted to this spot , And wrote Alphonso in the yellow sand , Which , when the rising tide would wash away , I turn 'd to read it printed in my breast , From whence nought could it banish or expunge , But it stood firm as sculptured adamant . Alp . Alphonso  --  Dear maiden , let us bury sad remembrances Of troubles past in dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life consign , And heaven smiling on our vows shall give Long years of gladness  --  Come away with me.  --  Exe't . Enter Spirits  --  Song . Spir . Spi rit  --  While the shadows of evening Are gathering around , Still loving to linger On this holy ground , The spirits that wander O'er ocean , through air , By the soft rays of moonshine Do hither repair . United by marriage , The bridegroom and bride , Have all the enjoyment To virtue allied . And O thus forever Shall true love be blest , Then lovers be constant , And fear not the rest . Tho ' clouds of misfortune May threaten awhile , Be patient and trust that Kind Heaven will smile . Like the pale lamp of Phoebe , Your pleasures may wane , But short is the season Ere relumined again .

With charms of force , a brazen wall I 'll rear Around Cairmardin ,  --  that in future there Unharm 'd by foes , I may pursue that lore Which erst hath been the source of all my power . Those dark , mysterious volumes that contain The scrolls of fate , I will peruse again ;  --  And still to human kind a friend I 'll prove , Man the chief object of my care and love !  --  So hushed and still all nature seems to lie , We almost hear the choristers on high , The bands angelic , whose nocturnal flight , And songs seraphic sanctify the night . When morn shall call you to your tasks again , Spirits that wander o'er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  If hostile powers Oppose their charms malevolent to ours , Swiftly the tidings to my cell convey And their designs in ruin will I lay .  --  Exeunt .
