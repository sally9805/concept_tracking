Embury , Emma C. ( Emma Catherine ) , 1806-1863 : MEADOW SAFFRON  --  Colchicsum Autumnalis . " My best days are past . " from Love 's token-flowers ( 1846 ) My locks still wear their sunny brown , My cheek , unfurrowed , glows with health , And though life 's sands are running down , The miser mind still guards its wealth . Mine eye is bright , though steeped in tears , My limbs with vigor still are strung , And measuring life by strength , not years , I feel my heart , my heart is young ! Embury , Emma C. ( Emma Catherine ) , 1806-1863 : SPIDER-WORT.  --  Tradescantia . " I esteem , but do not love you . " from Love 's token-flowers ( 1846 ) Nay , leave me now , and let us part With friendship 's smiles at last ; Thou canst not win this worthless heart ; Its dreams of joy are past , And never can I bend the knee As Love 's impassioned votary . For I have loved , and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes are even now Clouded with unshed tears : Oh , why should aught so gentle be The harbinger of misery ? Alas ! to look in eyes that hold Our all of earthly light , And pray to meet a glance less cold  --  A smile less calmly bright , Yet ever meet their chilling beam , Like moonlight o'er a frozen stream : To hang upon the words that fall From lips we love , in vain Some hidden meaning to recall , Some shadowy hope to gain , To treasure every sigh and smile , Yet find fresh food for grief the while : Is not this misery ? Yet this Has worn my heart away ; Then tell not o'er thy hopes of bliss , Mine bloomed but to decay , Like wind-sown flowers in some deep cave Their gloomy birthplace was their grave . Methinks my life has been so drear , That e'en should fortune give All that would be on earth most dear , I scarce could wish to live ; My heart has been so worn with sighs , It could not breathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catherine ) , 1806-1863 : THE LILY OF THE NILE .  --  Calla thiopica . Maiden Purity . from Love 's token-flowers ( 1846 ) Be thine the emblem , sweet one  --  watch and pray , Win thy young , stainless heart from earthly things ; Oh ! wait not thou till life 's bright morning ray Only o'er blighted hopes its radiance flings , But give to Heaven thy sinless spirit now , Ere sorrow 's tradery mar thy placid brow . Sinless and pure thou art , yet is thy soul Filled with a maiden 's vague and pleasant dreams , Sweet fantasies that mock at truth 's control , Like atoms round thee float in fancy 's beams ; But trust them not , young dreamer  --  bid them flee , They have deceived all others , and will thee . Well can I read thy thoughts  --  thy gentle heart ( Already woman 's in its wish to bless ) Now longs for one to whom it may impart Its untold wealth of hidden tenderness , And yearns to know the meaning of the thrill That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love 's happiness ,  --  the deep And placid joy which poets paint so well . Alas ! our passions , even when they sleep , Like ocean waves , are heaved with secret swell , And they who hear the frequent , low-breathed sigh , Know ' t is the wailing of the storm gone by . Vain , vain are all thy visions ; couldst thou know The secrets of a woman 's weary lot , Oh ! couldst thou read upon her pride-veiled brow Her wasted tenderness , her love forgot , In humbleness of heart thou wouldst kneel down , And pray for strength to wear her martyr crown . Embury , Emma C. ( Emma Catherine ) , 1806-1863 : PURPLE LILAC .  --  Syringa . First emotions of love . from Love 's token-flowers ( 1846 ) The time has been when my young heart Was like an untried lute , Full of earth 's sweetest melodies , Yet all untouched and mute , Save when , perchance a passing breath , Like zephyr 's laden wings , Might call a broken melody Forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved one , To touch that silent heart , And teach the tones of happy love Which now it can impart ; Like Memnon 's harp it could not wake Beneath a lowlier light , But poured its full and perfect tone To greet the sunbeam bright . Embury , Emma C. ( Emma Catherine ) , 1806-1863 : SWEET-SCENTED TUSSILAGE.  --  Tussilago Fragrans . " You shall have Justice . " from Love 's token-flowers ( 1846 ) Oh ! do not call her false , nor say That , like an eastern Khan , her heart Admits new guests each coming day , And careless sees the old depart . ' T is rather like some idol-fane Whose votive garlands all may twine , And many kneel in homage vain , While only one may deck the shrine . Embury , Emma C. ( Emma Catherine ) , 1806-1863 : ORANGE FLOWERS .  --  Citrus Aurantium . A bridal Wreath . from Love 's token-flowers ( 1846 ) No voice but that of gladness Should meet thine ear to-day , Yet only in deep sadness Can I love 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy heart can tell ; Of joy I would be singing  --  I can but sigh  --  farewell . When from life 's fairy garland Has fallen a precious gem , Can I smile to see it glisten In another 's diadem ? Could I hear thy deep vow spoken , Without a thought of pain , When I felt the best link broken In friendship 's golden chain ? Yet mine is selfish sorrow , Which love should hush to rest , And my heart should solace borrow From the thought that thou art blest : Where hope once claimed dominion , Joy holds his revel bright , And thy spirit 's drooping pinion Waxes strong in love 's pure light . I know that thou art happy : Oh ! may affection 's glass With its diamond sparkles measure Life 's changes as they pass . Could friendship 's gentle magic Rule thy horoscope of doom , Not a moment e'er should meet thee In sadness or in gloom . Embury , Emma C. ( Emma Catherine ) , 1806-1863 : ASPHODEL.  --  Asphodelus Luteus . " My regrets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ token-flowers ( 1846 ) When in the shadow of the tomb This heart shall rest , Oh , lay me where spring-flowerets bloom On earth 's green breast . But ne'er in vaulted chambers lay My lifeless form ; Seek not of such poor worthless prey To cheat the worm . In some sweet city of the dead I fain would sleep , Where flowers may deck my narrow bed , And night-dews weep . And raise not the sepulchral urn To mark the spot ; Enough if but by love alone ' T is ne'er forgot . Embury , Emma C. ( Emma Catherine ) , 1806-1863 : VIOLET .  --  Viola Tricolor . Modesty . from Love 's token-flowers ( 1846 ) Dearly I love these simple flowers , Half hidden in their low green nest , Yet decked in more than regal pride , With purple robe and golden vest . Dearly I love them , for to me With cherished memories they are fraught , And , borne upon their perfumed breath , Comes many a sweet and pleasant thought Within our garden 's quiet bounds These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borders trim , As if their privilege they know . And there is one  --  a dark-eyed child , Whose heart to all things sweet is wed ; She loves to watch the purple gems , Glistening within their lowly bed . Her little hands with graceful skill A simple garland oft entwine , While she laughs out in joyous glee , To see them in her bright locks shine . At morn , when dew-drops deck the grass , At sunset 's bright and gorgeous hours , Still ' mid the violets is she seen : And so we name them " Anna 's flowers . " Oh may this be an omen true , That violet-like her life may prove , The sweetness of a gentle heart , Her unexacting claim to love . Embury , Emma C. ( Emma Catherine ) , 1806-1863 : MONEY-WORT.  --  Lysimachia Nummularia . Transient Friendship . from Love 's token-flowers ( 1846 ) We shall meet no more on the green hill-side , We shall gaze no more on the wild cascade , No more shall our feet range far and wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall roam not again by the mountain stream As it dashes down on its rocky way , Through the darksome glen , where the noontide beam Scarce touches its wave with a fleeting ray . We shall meet no more on the mountain height , Where the mouldering fort in its ruin stands , While our hearts are thrilling with proud delight As we think on the deeds of our patriot bands . We shall wander no more amid nature 's wealth , The gold-broidered field and the silver rill , We shall meet not again as we woo sweet health By the shady dell or the breezy hill . Like the passing shade on the mountain 's brow Which fleets with the cloud that gave it birth , Are the joys that our hearts are cherishing now , The fleeting friendships of changeful earth . Embury , Emma C. ( Emma Catherine ) , 1806-1863 : LEMON-SCENTED VERBENA.  --  Aloysia Citriodora . Sensibility . from Love 's token-flowers ( 1846 ) I am not cold : though ' neath the guise Of playful mirth I fain would hide The feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride . I am not cold : when thou art nigh , The gentle thoughts my heart that thrill Teach me to shrink before the eye That wins to its resistless will I am not cold : and could I fling Upon thy path a single flower , How gladly would each impulse spring To meet thee in affection 's hour . I am not cold : but I have learned My own impatient heart to fear  --  To crush those sympathies that burned In vain through many a bygone year . I am not cold : love 's living flame Still glimmers on o'er hopes entombed , And I have found , with grief and shame , That ashes may be re-illumed . Footnote : 1Kb Embury , Emma C. ( Emma Catherine ) , 1806-1863 : BEE-OPHRYS.  --  Ophrys Apifera . Error . from Love 's token-flowers ( 1846 ) Because my heart dwelt not like cloistered nun In lonely cell unquiet silence keeping , Because it went forth ' neath Hope 's blessed sun , And freely shared another 's joy and weeping ; Thou hast mistaken me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did unclose affection 's portal To thoughts of tenderness as pure , as deep , As ever proved the human soul immortal , Thou hast mistaken me . Because thy feebler spirit , lacking power , By generous thought such priceless love to measure , Awoke its base distrust in that sweet hour When my fond heart revealed its hidden treasure , Thou hast mistaken me . Embury , Emma C. ( Emma Catherine ) , 1806-1863 : MUSK-ROSE.  --  Rosa Moschata Capricious Beauty . from Love 's token-flowers ( 1846 ) Bear with me , dearest : though thou art The life of life to me , Remember ' t is a poet 's heart That gives itself to thee ; ' T is but a wayward thing at best , And , when with toil e'erworn , It comes to thee beseeching rest , It will not brook thy scorn . My spirit wearied with high thought Shrinks from its prophet task , And in thy presence I have sought To doff life 's weary mask ; I come to thee for love and peace , When my soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet caprice , Or learn each dainty whim . Oh ! had we met in life 's glad morn , When joy thrilled every vein , Such gentle bondage I had borne , And wreathed with flowers the chain ; But now I can not gather up .

Despair . from Love 's token-flowers ( 1846 ) They deck thee as a bride , They dress me for the bier , Thy bosom thrills with pride , And mine with solemn fear , For Love is at thy side , While Death to me draws near . No longer on the blast My heart 's deep wail I pour ; My life-long dream is past , And passion rules no more ; I 've loved thee to the last , But now e'en love is o'er .

I 've watched the setting sun , The last I e'er shall see , Life 's sluggish race is run , Its goal was misery , And my latest task is done When I say farewell to thee . Embury , Emma C. ( Emma Catherine ) , 1806-1863 : ASH-LEAVED TRUMPET FLOWER .  --  Bignonia . Separation . from Love 's token-flowers ( 1846 ) Farewell to thee , Love , When I meet thee again , Light hearts will be round us , And pageantries vain ; But well do I know In life 's sunniest hours Thou ' lt think of our meeting ' Mid moonlight and flowers . Farewell to thee , dearest , And oh ! in thy dreams , When fancy sheds o'er thee Her loveliest beams , Then think of our roving In summer 's fair bowers  --  And remember our meeting , ' Mid moonlight and flowers . Embury , Emma C. ( Emma Catherine ) , 1806-1863 : HOLLY .  --  Ilex Aquilegia . " Am I forgotten ? " from Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not cold , Time has not made me-scorn or doubt thee ; But , since the blissful days of old , My heart has learned to do without thee . The charm that in thy presence dwelt , The spells thy voice could weave around me , Are over now , since I have felt How fragile were the ties that bound thee . I did not woo thee , mine was not A freak of fancy or of fashion , A yearning waked to be forgot , A dream half sentiment , half passion . Something of love , but passion-free , Something of friendship but far fonder , Devotion that still turned to thee , However far thy thoughts might wander ; Such were the gifts I would have laid With deep humility before thee ; But all unmarked such offerings fade , While others , less sincere , adore thee . Now all is changed  --  I know not why  --  No word of coldness has been spoken ; And yet I feel the secret tie That bound our souls for ever broken . Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to cheer me ; Though hope can yet my bosom thrill , And friends oft tried and true are near me ;  --  Though there are joys thou couldst not blight  --  Which will not leave me lonely-hearted  --  Yet ah ! how much of pleasant light Has , with thee , from my life departed ! Farewell  --  yet no !  --  I will not say That word fraught with unmingled sadness ; We yet shall meet amid the gay , In scenes of revelry and gladness . Yet never more the whispered word , Our mystic sympathy confessing , Shall thrill the heart too wildly stirred To utter then its fervent blessing . Yes  --  we are parted : we may meet Amid the world 's enforced communion ; But gone are all the tokens sweet , That sealed our bond of spirit union . Yet better thus : my heart has turned More fondly to the true and real , Since I , in bitterness , have learned How false may be the soul 's Ideal . Embury , Emma C. ( Emma Catherine ) , 1806-1863 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Love 's token-flowers ( 1846 ) No more , no more my heart with gladness boundeth , No more my lip is wreathed with ready smiles , When thus the measured tread of time resoundeth , Like solemn music through night 's cloistered aisles . No more the echoes of the day departed Seem like the footsteps of some gentle friend Who leaves me now , but true and kindly-hearted To-morrow comes , new happiness to lend . I yield not now to fancy 's fair dissembling , Gone is the sweet credulity of youth ; For life to all presents a cup of trembling , And they who quaff learn many a solemn truth . Upon my spirit rests a cloud of sadness , My hopes no more go forth like birds in spring , Chanting a matin song of quiet gladness , And shedding sunshine from each radiant wing . Embury , Emma C. ( Emma Catherine ) , 1806-1863 : WHITE POPPY .  --  Papaver Somniferum . The Consolation of Forgetfulness. from Love 's token-flowers ( 1846 ) Oh , for one draught of Lethe now ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever of my burning brow , In dark oblivion 's icy wave ! My heart is filled with doubts and fears , Haunted by memories of the dead , And sends too oft its tide of tears To eyes that now no tears must shed . Could I but drink of Lethe 's stream , How gladly would I now forget The form of many a happy dream , Whose faded spectre haunts me yet . Hopes , budding but to be destroyed , Joys dying e'er they scarce had birth , Time wasted , talents unemployed , Love poured like water on the earth : These are the thoughts I fain would sink Beneath oblivion 's tideless sea ; How would I grasp the cup , and drink A last farewell to memory . My days are fleeting swiftly by , My heart 's glad youth e'en now is past ; Why should mere breath  --  a lengthened sigh  --  So long the life of life outlast ? Embury , Emma C.

Fraternal Love . from Love 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brother ; we miss thee at the board Where wit 's diamond sparks are flashing , while the ruby wine is poured ; We miss thy smile of quiet mirth  --  we miss the heart-beam bright , Which from thy calm and earnest eye sheds forth its genial light . Come back , come back , my brother ; we miss thee at the hour When the dew of Heaven falls silently on moonlit tree and flower , We miss thy low and gentle voice  --  we miss the converse high , That bears us , as on angel wings , to commune with the sky . Come back , come back , my brother ; till thou the Priest art come The oracles of mystic life within our souls are dumb ; We live too much ' mid outward things , the spirit 's light grows dim , And only an unsullied hand the sacred flame may trim .
