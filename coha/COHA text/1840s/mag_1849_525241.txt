txt IN the spring of 1844 Mr. Asa Whitney , a merchant of New York , embarked for China in the prosecution of an enterprise whose successful termination , as it seemed to him , would be the commencement of a new period in the history of all the nations of the globe . This enterprise was no other than a design to turn the commerce of the world from its present course about the two capes , and to lead it , by the inducements of superior ease , rapidity and cheapness of transportation , across the northern portion of the North American continent . By an observation upon the figure of the earth-our adventurous projector conceived the idea that the great highway of all the nations should be carried as near to the northern circle as the increasing cold of high latitudes would permit ; those circles of latitude which encompass the earth becoming rapidly smaller as we move northward upon its sphere . The voyage to China was undertaken by him , chiefly with a view to collect information upon the trade and resources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South Sea Islands , and other Asiatic countries ; in order to satisfy himself , and to persuade his countrymen , of the advantages of opening a free and frequent intercourse with eastern Asia . After two years had been spent in these inquiries Mr. Whitney returned to America , and commenced a long and eager investigation of the merits and advantages of the various routes across the continent . After he had communicated personally with the most experienced travellers , and collected by travels in the wilderness , by study , and by intercourse with every source of information at home , all particulars of value , he began to lay his plans before the people and before Congress . From a careful perusal of his own published account of the project , aided by the personal explanation of the author , we gather the following idea of it , which we commend to the strict attention of such of VOL . IV . NO . I. NEW SERIES . our political friends as are not already familiar with its details . Conceiving that the general government can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the western coast of the Atlantic , except at an expense too vast to be thought of with its present resources , Mr. Whitney proposes , with the aid of his own private fortune , to attempt the enterprise himself , but in such a manner , as to make the work pay for itself almost from the beginning . To rely upon individual enterprise for the accomplishment of works of internal improvements may be regarded as almost among the first principles of the creed of republicanism , nor will the spirit of our government permit it to engage in works which can as well or better be accomplished by individuals or by companies . Having selected a certain route , of which we shall take occasion before concluding this article to show the advantages , Mr. Whitney*offers the government his plan , or contract , to be passed by Congress , if it so please them , into a law . By this proposed contract , the nation , through their government , are to sell to our contractor , under certain reservations and conditions , and at a price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land sixty miles in width , extending westward , from the foot of Lake Michigan to Puget Sound , near the Columbia River , carried , of course , through one of the northern passes of the ) ocky Mountains . At ten cents the acre , a price beyond its value as estimated by committees in Congress , the land will bring by this sale , $7,795,200 into the public treasury . Tihe greater part being wilderness , and totally unsalable until the road is made , a bettor bargain for the nation could not be made .. The payments will of course be made gradually , and as the road progresses ; each provision of the contract to be en-. forced by the government . The second feature of the plan is the laying of a grand railroad upon this . 5 // strip of land ; beginning at the foot of Lake Michigan , and pushing the work gradually forward until , in a computed period of twenty-five years , it reaches the Pacific . The first eight hundred miles of the route consist of excellent cultivable lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finely timbered , and with such woods as are suitable for the foundation of a durable road . On this first three hundred miles of the route depends the entire hope of the enterprise . The expense of transporting timber over great distances would forever prevent the accomplishment of the work . The exist . ence of a great body of timber about the foot of Lake Michigan , and thence westward for three hundred miles , is an absolute guaranty of the success of the under4aking under the economical management of an individual proprietor ; and the absence of a sufficiency of timber at all other points is an equal guaranty of the failure of the enterprise on all other routes than this , even - under the wisest and most economienl management . The entire revenue of the iwtion would have to be exhausted for *everai years , in the construction of a road at a public cost across the deserts and prairies between the lower Mississippi and California . The next feature of the plan , to which we would call the attention of our readers , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty to resell or appropriate a single acre of the land sold him by the government. , until the first ten miles of the road are completed . The road moreover is to be built , by the terms of the contract , on a strip of land two hundred feet wide , appropiiated forever to that purpose , with a heavy iron rail of a prescribed weight , on a gauge of not less than six feet between the rails . The failure of any material condition of the contract will of course work a forfeiture of the land . All the regulations of tolls , &amp;c. , are to be by legal enactment in Congress , and enforeed by public authority . Having constructed the first ten miles , our grand contractor is to be at liberty to sell to emigrants and others , in portions five miles in length of the route granted him by Congress ; and with the proceeds he is to pay government for the land , and to reimburse himself the costs of the first ten miles of road , estimated at $200,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our contractor will survey and locate the route for two or three hundred miles , and as soon as ten miles have been cdmpleted , he will be permitted to sell the first five miles by sixty , or one hundred and ninety-two thousand acres . And if this does not produce means enough to pay for road and land both , then the work will be discontinued , and our contractor will have gained nothing either in land or money . But if the sale of the lands produces a sufficiency for these purposes , then the next ten miles will be completed , and another portion of five miles by sixty given up to him for sale . The reserved lands , held by the government , will furnish means for the construction of the road over the wilderness after the forest and cultivable lands shall have been passed over . Meanwhile , and until the entire work is completed , the government will hold the road and reserved lands , if any remain , as security for the payments of the original ten c*its per acre for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vest in our contractor until the whole is finished and paid for . But it will continue alwhys subject to the action and control of Congress , for the fixing of tolls and other regulations for the convenience and ease of travellers . When new States come to be created on the territories traversed by the roadand the probability is that the movement of population westward with such a means of emigration would be rapid beyond all precedent-if any jealousy arose , their inhabitants would be at fall liberty to construct rival roads parallel vith the old one . By regulations of Congress making the tolls barely sufficient to pay the costs of repairs , and an exceedingly small percentage to the proprietor , the road would be made almost a free road . A bushel of wheat could then be carried across the continent for twenty cents , a barrel of flour for one dollar , a ton of merchandise ten dollars , and a half ton of teas ( by measurement one ton ) five dollars . Corn grown in Michigan , could he landed at Chinese ports for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit to the producer . Manufactures from the South and East , and the various products of all parts of the Union would thus be easily and cheaply conveyed to Asia , and the balance of trade turned wholly in favor of America . The cod and whale fisheries of the North Pacific would send a constant stream of their indispensable products , in exchange for American mannfactures , across the continent . The Atlantic sea-ports would , of course , become the ports of deposit and exchange for the trade of all the world . The prairies of the West , and the mills of the East and South , would begin to furnish food and clothing to the famished millions of China , who would now in their turn , having a market opened for their peculiar products , have a means of procuring in abundance the necessaries of life . The islands of the South Seas would be more rapidly colonized than they are at present , by the Chinese , those Yankees of Asia , and a free and constant intercourse would inevitably be established between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , be undertaken by a stock company , under the necessity of declaring dividends , the tolls would have to be so much raised , as to exclude the transport of heavy articles , and thus none of the contemplated results would follow . Indeed , for such a road no one would subscribe with any expectation of profit ; it would probably cost *200,000 , 000 , not to yield any return in twenty-five years , and be then obliged to realize annually the sum of . 6,000,000 , to give three per cent . on the investment ! The danger of land monopoly is avoided , by providing that the reserved lands shall be sold at public auction , like other government lands ; and that no lands shall be kept for sale longer than ten years after the completion of the road through them . The bill will provide that on the failure of any important condition , Congress shall have power to resume the whole and give it to another . Power also will lie in Conto alter and amend the bill as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , to accomplish this great work , I propose to take the entire responsibility upon myself . If I fail , the government can lose nothing , because the lands still remain , and I shall have added to their value even by my failure . But if I succeed , I must , by my energies and labor , make this 77,952,000 acres of waste land produce the $68,395,200 ; and , unless I can make it produce an excess over that sum , I gain nothing for all my toil . " If the plan succeeds , it would make the whole world tributary to us . The sum which I should pay into the treasury for the lands , would exceed that which might be expended for them from any other source . The nation would have this great highway without an outlay of one dollar , with almost its free use forever after , and so much added to the actual cash capital of the nation as the road may cost , because it would be the fruits of labor upon the wilderness earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill so framed , as would enable me to carry out and accomplish this great work fir the motives as here and everywhere else by me declared , to give to my country this great thoroughfare for the nations of all the earth without the cost of one dollar ; to give employment to , and to make comfortable and happy , millions who are now starving and destitute , and to bring all the world together in free intercourse as one nation . If the bill is deficient in any point , it certainly can be made to meet the views I. express , which I feel that all who examine must be satisfied with . " It is proposed to establish an entirely new system 9f settlement , on which the hopes for success are based , and on which all depend . The settler on the line of the road would , as soon as his house or cabin were up , and a crop in , find employment to grade the road ; the next season , when his crop would have ripened , there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same situation as himself the season before ; if any surplus , he would have the road at low tolls to take it to market ; and if he had in the first instance paid for his land , the money would go back , either directly or indirectly , fur labor and materials for the work . So that in one year the settler would have his home with settlement am* civilization surrounding , a demand for his labor , a market at his door for his produce , a railroad to communicate with civilization and markets , without having cost one dollar . And the settler who might not have means in money to purchase land , his labor on the road and a first crop would give him that means , and he too would in one year have his home with the same advantages , and as equally independent . The settler who now pays for his land to the government , gets no benefit from the sum paid , beyond his title to and possession of the land . When his cabin is prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his labor , because all around are in the same condition as himself ; when his crop is grown , 1849. 69 // there is no market at his door , and if fifty miles from any direct means of transit , he can not sell at all , neither can he get it to market so as to leave anything as a reward for his toil . Thus you see him in the wilderness , remote from civilization , destitute of comforts , and nearly a demi-savage ; his labor , it is true , produces food from the earth ; hut he can not exchange with the different branches of industry , and is not a source of wealth or power to the nation . " Projects have been offered , and some are on foot , for the construction of a road at the expense of the nation . Against this plan a number of obstacles present themselves of a character too weighty and formidable to be removed or got over . Independently of economical considerations , which should always lead us to prefer individual to public enterprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid entering upon too extended a system of internal improvements ; in consideration not only of the just prejudices of a large portion of the people against a lavish expenditure of the public monies , but in view also of the great caution necessary to avoid the disgrace and odium of an augmentation of the public debt . The expenses of the war should be at least provided for , previous to any further engagements ; excepting such only as are of obvious necessity for the promotion of our grandest interests . While the absolute necessities of our internal trade demand a large appropriation for the improvement of river and harbor navigation ,  - -  while the Mexican affair continues to draw heavily upon the public purse ,  - -  while the exigencies of foreign commerce require that the navy be maintained and even increased ,  --  while the southwestern frontier requires the continual vigilance of a full military establishment ,  --  while the poverty of foreign ambassadors calls for an iflcrease of their salaries ;  --  and besides these demands , while the augmentation of our territory compels a steadily increasing expenditure for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the friends of internal improvement will pause to consider before they venture upon any new and costly proj ects . Nevertheless , it has become evident that the addition of California and New Mexico , creating a new republic , composed of a mixed population of adventurers , with foreign views and sympathies , to be bound to our mighty empire on the ' western side of the continent , has made it necessary that some means of speedy communication should be established between ourselves and the new territories . The wealth , the peace , and the unity of the entire people , are clearly the great ends for which governments were established ; and in the pursuit of those ends , every measure which wisdom and a strict economy may dictate , is to be studiously advised and put in practice ; nor can any measure be regarded as in spirit unconstitutional which is directed towards these ends . Governments , at least republican , ( and therefore just and economical , ) assume to do no more than is their duty ; and that duty being always measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in enterprises which may better be carried on by states , cities , or individuals . If a combination of private fortunes can be made , which shall carry out grand schemes of internal improvement , the government will only sanction and defend such enterprises . It will not engage in foreign or internal trade , but will only protect it and fortify it . It will not offer to educate those who have the means to educate themselves . It will not give money to corporations or to combinations of adventurers , when these adventurers are looking solely to their own profit , and can not establish their claim to assistance upon the ground that their enterprise i4 a strictly national one , and is to be of national importance , nor even then , when it is clear that everything can be accomplished under the mere protection and countenance oVthe law . The property of the citizens belongs to them and to their children ; and governments have no right to appropriate a cent of it on theoretic or speculative grounds , or for purposes not clearly national , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit . That portion , however , may be taken as an equitable tax , which they find necessary for the common good , and they are free to appropriate it as seems best . One of the last improvements of civilization is the construction of a perfect road . U.3T , // For those grand routes by which distant nations are brought together , and whose existence is absolutely necessary to the general advancement of the race , the resources of empires are required to be expended . Many of the famous naval and military expeditions of antiquity , supposed by some to have been instigated by the ambition of conquest , were undoubtedly undertaken for the extension of commerce . Such were the expeditions of Sesostris and other conquerors . By means of great roads over those chains of mountains which intersect the continent of Europe , the European kingdoms are united in a grand republic of nations . The union of the States of North America depends , far more than is imagined , upon those great roads which facilitate the free and rapid interchange of trade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great commercial routes toward the frontier . The making of a national road is an epoch in a nation 's history , equal at least in importance to that of the acquisition of a new territory . Not to dwell too long upon the generalities of the subject , we may take it for granted that our readers are well aware of the importance of an immediate establishment of a free and perfect communication between ourselves and our Pacific colonies ; so soon to become powerful states . Setting aside for the present all inquiries into the difficulties into which the gold mania and the hasty emigration which it occasions are to bring upoa us ; setting aside such considerations as savoring too much of a croaking and in auspicious disposition , we have now to consider only what can be done to keep pace with that emigration , and to convert the greatest evil of a nation , a costly colony , into a benefit and a source of wealth and power . First , then , it is conceded by all parties that a road must be established , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun without delay ; the necessities of the country and the world creating an immediate and pressing want of such a road . No one man or company of men could afford to buy from government out of their private resources a strip of land extending from Lake Michigan to the Pacific . That is quite impossible . The land for such a purpose must be either granted free of charge , or paid for out of the profits of the roads made upon it , or the lands sold near it . Nor can any combination of two or three States undertake such an enterprise . Would all the States of the North , or those of the South , or those bordering upon the Mississippi , agree to bear the burthen of a project of which every State from Maine to Florida is to reap an equal benefit ? If the enterprise is undertaken by States , it must be by all the States in Union , in other words , by the Union itself . But as no man will pretend to contest the constitutionality of a measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation  --  a measure intended to obviate the danger of a final separation between the new colonies and the mother country  --  to *ay nothing of the gradual alienation of a population composed in great part of foreigners , and whom it will be easy to alienate and separate from ourselves by neglect or bad government , or by the mere suspension or difficulty and infrequency of intercourse-in view of such necessities , the question of constitutionality may be set aside as irrelevant . The necessity for such a road is immediate . A few years ' delay may bring incalculable evils upon the colonies , and must meanwhile deprive the entire nation of those commercial and social advantages to be reaped from intercourse with them ; and through them , with the Asiatic side of the globe . End the sums of money that were expended in overrunning Mexico been laid out in the quiet purchase of California and New Mexico , and in the immediate construction of a ro*.d connecting the Pacific with the Atlantic States , the wisdom and foresight of the measure would have placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all civilized communities . As it is , we have the territories , and by a singular coincidence , we are enabled by the ingenuity and boldness of a single mind , aided by a moderate private fortune , to accomplish at least the greater part of what is demanded in this critical state of our affairs . The government , loaded with debt , can not conscientiously suggest to the people a proposition involving great expense . 1849. // The party whose voices are always loud against expenditure when they are out of office , stands ready to oppose every measure undertaken upon a general theory of internal improvement . At this crisis a citizen of New York steps forward and offers to accomplish the desires , and meet the necessities of the empire by a plan at once bold , original , and calculated upon a certainty of success . Beside these considerations lie others of at least equal importance in the view of humanity ; namely , that the undertaking of this work is the first step toward a free , social communication between the American and Asiatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steady effort on the part of the more enlightened to extend the influence of true religion and of civilization over the inhabitants of China and india ; to which are now to be added the islands of the Southem Seas . This divine enterprise has been prosecuted hitherto with but little successnot from any want of zeal or perseverance on the part of European and American Christians , but because the grand preliminary step , the establishment of a free and universal commerce between the two sides of the globe has never been realized . The crusaders attempted the conversion of Asia by force of arms , and their expeditions invariably failed , because they were contradictory to the spirit of a pure beneficence . There remains but one other method of preparing the Asiatic nations for the reception of the truth ; and that is , to raise their opinion of the Western races , and awaken kindly and respectful feelings in them toward ourselves , by a free and constant commercial intercourse . As a Christian and a republican people , we acknowledge no conquests saving those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none other , we may subdue and civilize the hordes of Asia . By establishing a free and rapid communication with the Pacific coast , we , therefore , not only promote the Union , and strengthen and confirm our own empire , but we take the initiatory step toward the accomplishment of the grand design of Christian benevolence , the civilization and instruction of Asia . It would be impossible , in the limits allowed us , to set before the reader all the consequences which must certainly follow the opening of a free communication between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts ; these advantages have been shown at large , and sufficiently dwelt upon , by others . To those of our readers who have not made * particular study of the subject , Qur author 's pamphlet will convey all the desired information. * We shall dwell no longer upon the subject than may be necessary for a comparative view of the advantages of the several routes proposed for the construction of a work admitted by all to be of absolute necessity . And , first , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contemplation , including two across the narrow interval between North and South America , and three across the main-land of the Northern Continent , were to be undertaken at the public cost , the injury done to the public and private business of the country , added to the California drain , and heavy purchases of foreign goods made necessary by the present low tariff , would bring great distress and embarrassment upon the poorer classes for the coming two or three years . Were the project of a railroad to the Pacific added to that of the River and Harbor Improvement , an*l to these the costs of the impending war of extermination which must soon be entered upon with the Southwestern Indians , such a tide of expenses would be set a-going as would take the government off its feet , and subject it to the extreme malice of the opposition . The only safe and politic course to be pursued , would seem to be , to extend merely its favor and its military protection to the economical and well-considered project of our author ; and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect this scheme makes hirn-lhe7eginning , at least , of this vast and important enterprise . When a man of first-rate ability and large fortune offers his services to the nation , to accomplish some necessary work , a thousand detracting voices are instantly raised against his motives . A member in Congress may , without scandal , propose a plan for public aggrandizement , and no man checks at him , no man cries out * Project for a Railroad to the Pacific . By Asa Whitney , of New York . New York : Printed by George W. Wood , No. 16 Spruce street . July , // against his ambition , or suspects him of wishing to forward his own interests ; but should the same project come from the same individual as a private citizen , instantly the cry is raised of avarice and interest . Let us , however , look coolly at the matter , laying all jealousies aside . The possessor of a fortune instead of sittin , quietly down to enjoy it at his ease-instead of wasting his income in expensive luxuries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace in one of our great cities , with an eagerness becoming a spirited citizen of an enterprising nation , asks of his fellowcitizens only to he permitted to throw all that he possesses into an enterprise of such dignity and importance to the nation , that he must become , by engaging in it , one of the most responsible and useful of its public servants . That the jealousy and detraction of the malicious and the ignorant should pursue such a projector , stimulated by a public spirit so congenial to our institutions , is indeed to be expected ; but it is at least proper to caution the more considerate part of the community of the existence of a spirit which their own liberality might lead them to forget , and certain arguments in that way acquire more weight with them than was just . Unless the republic willingly and gladly employs the capital and the ability of its business men , to forward enterprises of national benefit , that ability and that capital will seek selfish and private employment , or will go on , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inj urious importance . Is it not a safe and politic measure under the proper restrictions-is it not a measure congenial to the economy of our government , to make the contract offered by Mr. Whitney , for the construction of a grand railroad to the Pacific ? If it is economical it is politic ; if it is speedy and effectual it is prudent and judicious ; if it is both constitutional , effectual and economical , it is also just and necessary , and will commend itself to the judgment of all . The route chosen by Mr. Whitney as not only the best , but in fact the only feasible one , begins at the foot of Lake Michigan , at which is the natural point of concentration of all the commerce of the Eastern and Middle States . From New York , Baltimore , Philadelphia and Boston , lines of railroad are , or will soon be completed , converging upon Sandusky ; and from thence to St. Joseph 's a route is in contemplation which will be the main trunk from which all the great lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fan . From St. Joseph 's , at the foot of the lake , to Prairie du Chien , a point at which a bridge may be thrown across the Mississippi , the route lies through the forests which are to supply materials for the entire ronte . At no other point can timber be supplied for the construction of the road ; a consideration which makes it certain that this point will at all events be taken for the starting point . For the advantage of the extreme South , a railroad may easily be constructed in an almost straight line between Mobile and Prairie du Chien . With this , other southern routes will join . By the addition of only two more grand roads through the United States , with their provincial trunks , the entire commerce of the South , West and North converges with equal ease upon Prairie du Chien , where it will meet on the one side the navIg*L1on of the Mississippi , and on the other the commerce tween I*urope , America and Asia . The objections to the two other routes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other from St. Louis through Fort Leavenworth and the South Pass to San Francisco-might be stated to advantage in detail , though they may be pronounced in one word , and that is sin/ ) ossibilzty . These routes , if constructed , must be made by the government , and at four times the expense . They start from regions divested of limber ; and worst of all , they are sectional , and serve the purposes of the South to the loss and detriment of the Northern and Middle , and Western States ; of course they will be voted down by the North and West jointly . But it were a great error to admit that the route from Prairie du Chien to the mouth of the Columbia River , or , more properly , to Puget Sound , is to be of no advantage to the South . On the contrary , such are the obstacles and the disadvantages of the St. Louis and Memphis routes , ending the one in middle California , and the other at San Francisco , to attempt them would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the space of perhaps half a century . Puget Sound is the only sufficient port on the Pacific coast . At low tide the bay of San Francisco is almost a mud flat . San Diego is a point of no importance , with a diminutive bay ; and the passage from that point to Santa F6 is over gorges and torrent beds among the mountains , whereas the route to Puget Sound , througl* the North Pass , is an even track , presenting not a single obstacle of magnitude . Without quoting the entire reports of Fremont and Wilkes , in regard to these harbors , and the comparative merits of the various routes , it were impossible to do justice to the arguments presented by our author . The mouth of the Columbia , long known for the difficulties and dangers of its entrance , offers no advantage to the navigator . " The mouth of the Columbia River , " says Lieutenant Wilkes , " has been long known for its dangers , and the difficulties of entrance . These have not been exaggerated ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a port . The land near it is well marked . Cape Disappointment , the northern point , is high , with several lofty spruce and pine trees on its summit . Point Adams on the south is low and sandy . A sand-spit makes out from each cape ; that from Point Adams projects to seaward of the other , being nearly at right angles to it . The distance between them is one mile . These have been formed by the deposit of the sands brought down by the river , or washed by the abrasion of the sea from their respective capes . The bar lies outside , and on it there is no particular danger unless the sea is heavy , when breakers form on it , and a vessel would be subjected to risk in passing . The least depth of water is twenty-eight feet . The breakers on both spits are usually heavy , though at times there is little or no break on them . The south end of the north spit has to be closely approached , and is the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The principal dangers in the entrance of the Columbia are the cross tides , their velocity , and the influence of an under-current , together with the heavy swell . " * Of Puget 's Sound , on the contrary , Lieutenant Wilkes speaks in terms of un qualified approbation . It is by his account the best entrance for vessels on the Pacific coast : " Puget 's Sound may be described as a collection of inlets , covering an area of fifteen square miles , the only entrance to which is through the Narrows , which , if strongly fortified , would bid defiance to any attack , and guard its entrance against any force . " The Inlets , in the order in which they come from the entrance , have received the names of Carr 's , Case 's , Hammerslcy 's , Totten 's , Eld 's , Budd 's , and Henderson 's ; they are united by passages , which form several islands and peninsulas . All these inlets are safe , commodious , and capacious harbors , well supplied with water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the islands and peninsulas are to be found slate and sandstone , which , though soft and friable in some places where it has been exposed on the surface , will be found suitable for building purposes . " Nothing can exceed the beauty of these waters , and their safety . Not a shoal exist* within the straits of Juan de Fuca , Admiralty Inlet , Puget 's Sound , or Hood 's Canal , that can in any way interrupt their navigation by a seventy-four gun ship . " San Diego , San Francisco , and Bodega , are the three harbors of California . Of the firs* of these Lieutenant Wilkes speaks disparagingly . Its small size , and its distance south , are against it : " There are many drawbacks to this harbor ; the want of water is one of them , the river which furnishes the mission with water disappearing in the dry season before reaching the bay , and the surrounding country may be called a barren waste of sand hills . " The whole country around San Diego is composed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unfit for cultivation , and covered with Cacti , one of the many evidences of the poorness of the soil ; this leaves the port of San Diego little to recommend it but the uniform climate , good anchorage and security from all winds . " The description given by this experienced navigator of the bay of San Francisco is particularly discouraging , and deserves the grave consideration of those who are building schemes upon the hope of its becoming in future the port of entry for the trade of Asia . " The Bay of San Francisco is thirty-six miles in length by an average of six in width ; 74 July , * Western America , including California and Oregon , with Maps of those Regions , and of " the Sacramento Valley . " By Charles Wilkes , U. S. N. Philadelphia , 1849. // a large portion of its southern , eastern , and northern shores are bordered by extensive and wide mud-flats , preventing the landing , at low water , of even a boat ; so much so that the eastern shore may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and this impediment prevents it from ever becoming useful , except by the construction of extensive artificial works . On the north it is bounded by the Straits of San Pablo , which divide it from the bay of that name . " On the western side of the Bay of San Francisco , from the Straits of San Pablo , for a distance of fifteen miles , the country is broken and mountainous , and the shores rocky and indented by small bays , which are useless . " These obstructions reduce . this extensive bay very much in size , and it becomes still more so when the safety and convenience of vessels is taken into consideration ; indeed , with the deep water , cross tides , and exposed situations , there are but two safe anchorages , viz Yerba Buena and Sausalito . The former lies on the south of the entrance , between the island and town of the same name , and is of but small extent , with mud-flats , bare at low water , to the channel ; it is also very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times with great violence . It is the usual but by no means the best anchorage , and has but a scanty supply of water , not sufficient for the population of the town , or the vessels that frequent it ; this , added to the rocky point on which the town is situated , will prevent it from ever becoming the seat of trade . The population of the town exceeds five hundred inhabitants ; and , from its being nearer to the gold mines than Monterey , has become of late the most frequented . " Sausalito , or Whaler 's Harbor , is on the north side of the entrance , under Table Hill , which protects vessels from the prevailing westerly winds . This anchorage is the principal resort of whalers . Here they can obtain wood and water , and refit . The water in the summer is obtained from small springs . The extent of land around this bay is limited to a few acres , the hills rising precipitately , and the high spurs cutting off communication with the country adjoining it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a naval dep6t , or a place for our whalers to recruit at . Its possession insures us the command of the Northern Pacific , and the protection of our large and extended interests there ; but I know of no place where a natural site for a town can be found throughout the whole bay ; and it appears to me extremely difficult to select one where the locality would permit of extensive artificial improvements . " Bodega is disposed of in brief : " The port of Bodega is ninety miles north of San Francisco . It is both small and inconvenient , and can not be entered , except by vessels of a light draught of water . " The vast advantages of Puget Sound as a resort for large vessels , over all other ports of the Pacific coast , render it almost certain that it will become at last the principal entrance for the trade of Asia . The advantages of this bay are however united in a providential manner with those of the surrounding country . The climate is healthy and temperate , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular cultivation ; but above all we desire to call our reader 's attention to the singular fact , that between this sound and the highest point of the Mississippi which will admit a bridge , the route is levelled and adapted by nature for the passage of cars ; so even and unobstructed is this route , for nearly six hundred continuous miles of the middle part it will not be necessary to make a bridge . After reviewing the several routes , by the Isthmus , and by the South Pass , Lieutenant Wilkes decides in favor of that chosen by Mr. Whitney ; namely , from the foot of Lake Michigan by Prairie du Chien to Fort Wallawalla , on the Columbia , and thence to Puget'Sound . " Steam can be used only for the transportation of passengers to China by the way of Panama ; the rates for freight would preclude the transmission of merchandise . The route across the Pacific from Panama offers many difficulties to sailing vessels , in the prevailing winds , calms , &amp;c. ; Panama is , indeed , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or depart from ; the seasons there are divided into the fine and the rainy ; the former , or what is called summer , though in north latitude , is from December to May , apd only during this period is it advisable to approach this coast . In the rainy or winter season , from June to November , every part of it is liable to hard gales , tornadoes , or heavy squalls , succeeded by calms and deluges of rain , and the most dangerous lightning . Sickness begins at Panama as early as March , and continues until December ; and with the exception of the fine season , the whole coast in its vicinity may be described as dangerous , and on every account to be avoided . From December to May , the prevailing winds are from the north and northwest , the remainder of the year they blow from the northeast , southeast , and the west ; but are at all times uncertain , and calms frequently prevail ; vessels may be detained on their passage , 1849. 75 // from these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater length than t.hat now followed by the China trade . " As a means of communicating with the western coast of South America by the agency of steam , too much value can not be laid upon the proposed railroad across the Isthmus . For ten years it may he advisable to use one of these routes , or until such time as the routes through our own territory can be completed and in operation ; but it can never satisfy the wants of the nation , or preserve those advantages we should look forward to obtain . " Next in order is the southern route by railway across the country , by way of the Gila . The recognizance of the country through which this would pass has been fully made known to us by Colonel Emory , and his report shows that it would be nearly impossible for this purpose . The altitude of the mountains is in itself sufficient to decide the question ; but if we grant that this can be overcome , the sterile country through which it would run brings conviction to the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unadvisable . It can never become an inhabited country , therefore one great object in the construction of a railroad would be lost . Again , if this last fact were not the case , the proposed terminus on the Pacific at the port of San Diego would never accommodate the trade , and half or two-thirds of the ships would not be able to enter . The port is inadequate for the commerce that such an intercourse would bring about ; and the country around can never furnish the necessary supplies . The proposition for terminating it at San Francisco is equally objectionable , and amounts to an impossibility on account of the high mountain ranges which surround it . " We now come to the last or most northern route . Nature here invites the enterprise . The distance is the shortest ; it has few if any difficulties to overcome ; the lands it would pass through are some of the best in the western country ; and the greater part of the whole distance can become densely populated , and opens out an entirely new country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now wending their way in tens of thousands , seeking a quiet home from the troubles of the Old World . " The northern route contemplated has a delightful climate , suitable for the full development of the human frame , and all the accompaniments of civilization . It has been found by examination to be practicable throughout the whole distance , and at its western terminus there are excellent ports . All the great barriers on other routes are on this line either modified into gentle hills or rent asunder , and the way is thus made clear for the undertaking . The construction of this road across the headwaters of all the great rivers , touching the limits of their navigation , will at once satisfy any one of the advantages to be derived from it , adding to the inland commerce by transporting the products brought on this iron river from the remotest ports of the globe to all the cities , towns , and landings on the vast waters of the Mis*issippi and its tributaries . At the same time it would connect with all our seaports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eastern terminus , while it would also be the means of furnishing the whole extent of our Atlantic coast , including even Canada , with all they desired of the productions of the east , and carrying back in return their merchandise in exchange . It must be readily seen that all parts of our extended country would equally participate in its advantages , and none more so than the Southern and Western States , whose railroads and navigable waters would all be so many paths by which the trade that must flow through such a channel would circulate . The general government would be equally benefited , by the increased value it would give to all the public lands on either side of it . " The terminus on Lake Michigan would enable the large supplies required for the persons employed , as well as the materials , to be forwarded with great economy as well as facility of transportation , and secure the necessary timber for the constructicn of the road . The country for the first eight hundred miles is admirably adapted for the purpose , offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route will offer as to place the whole country on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains subservient to its use and support , a portion of the country , from the accounts of those who have visited it , surpassed by none in fruitfulness or climate . The passage through the mountains is known to be without difficulty , and the course to the point of its destination almost a direct line until the lower waters of the Columbia are reached , when a short divergence brings it to a terminus on the waters of Puget 's Sound-as I before remarked , one of the most noble estuaries in the world ; without a danger of any kind to impede navigation , with a surr*unding country capable of affording all kinds of supplies , harbors without obstructions at any season of the year , and a climate unsurpassed in salubrity . " Having thus ascertained which route is to be preferred , if a land route is attempted at all , it remains next to lay before tbe reader in tbe least possible compass , the arguments offered against attempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any routes across the Isthmus . A correspondent of the New York flerald has communicated to that paper 76 July , // of June 5th , 1849 , information in regard to the route by which a railroad from Memphis would be taken over the mountains to the harbor of San Diego . He tells us that Lieutenant Beau , who has travelled the several overland routes , describes the Gila River route as impracticable for a railroad ; that a railroad along the summits of the Palisades on the highlands of the Hudson , passing the inequalities by bridges , would be more feasible than a railway down the valley of the Gila . This river flows for miles through deep and narrow channels or canones . Precipitous cliffs overhang its waters , and the rocks form a chain of peaks and precipices along its entire length . We may , therefore , conclude with certainty that a road passing through Santa Fe , to the Pacific will never be attempted . Memphis will consequently be no longer thought of as a point of departure for the main trunk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the event of the completion of the main trunk from Lake Michigan , branches will be constructed to unite with it both from Memphis and from St. Louis . But of all the arguments in favor of the northern route across the continent from Michigan to Puget Sound , none are more satisfactory than those derivcd from a comparison of distances ; for if any person interested in the inquiry will take an artificial globe , and measure with a string or a pair of compasses , making short steps , the various distances from the British Channel to Canton , he will find that by the overland route from New York , or Boston , to Puget Sound across the Continent , the distance to be passed over in direct travel , is some 2000 miles less than the voyage , either by the Cape of Good Hope , the Isthmus of Panama , Cape Horn , or the Mediterranean . The calculations of Professor Wittish , of London University , which were made for a proposed canal at Nicaragua , give the distance from England to Yalparaiso , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ordinary sailing ; but the distance from England to Yalparaiso by the proposed canal at Nicaragua , would be 442 miles less , and 11 days sooner in consequence of a more favorable navigation . A route across Panama would be 300 miles nearer still ; but this difference of time and of distance would not pay the expense of the delay , the breaking up of the cargo , the land or canal carriage across the Isthmus , the employment of another set of vessels on the Pacific side , and tLe division of the profits of the voyage in consequence between carriers by land and two different carriers by water . To this , add that in consequence of a more favorable trade winds and currents , the homeward voyage by Cape Horn would be 168 miles nearer than that by the Isthmus . If these calculations are to be truste&amp; British commerce will always prefer the Cape route to Yalparaiso . Again , by the computations of Professor Wittish , the distance from Sydney in New Holland to England , via Cape Horn , with favorable sailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a canal at Nicaragua it is 15,848 miles ; time 138 days , the sailing being more favorable ; to which must be added transportation dues , the breaking up of cargoes , the employment of another set of vessels , and the consequent division of profits among several hands . Let us now examine Professor Wittish 's calculations of distance from England to Singapore in Ilindoostan , via the Cape of Good hope with favorable winds . Comparing these with the same voyage , via the canal at Nicaragua , also during favorable winds , the first is 13,350 , the second is 17,738 miles ; the time of the first is 128 , and of the second 131 days . These differences against the route by the proposed canal , with the tolls and the expenses of transshipment &amp;c. , make it almost certain that English commerce will always make the vo*nge to India by the Cape of Good *1ope . To this , add also , that the homeward voyage by the Cape of Good hope is 17 days less than the outward voyage . lATe are next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the Cape of Good Hope with favorable sailing . The voyage from China to England by the Cape of Good Hope is 13,370 miles ; favorable time 107 days . From China to England by the Isthmus canal , favorable sailing 15,557 miles ; time 129 days . A difference of 2228 miles , and 22 days against the Isthmus route , with 1849. 77 // the additional drawbacks of tolls , transshipment , &amp;c . These differences turn , and must always turn , the stream of English commerce with China upon the way of the Cape of Good hope , until some shorter and less expensive route can be found , than any of the proposed railways or canals across the narrow space between the two American continents . Another objection more fatal than any of those stated , lies in the deterioration of transported goods by the damp and hot atmosphere of the tropics . Even the tens and silks of China would be materially injured by a detention in the land carriage across the Isthmus , while for breadstuffs and other perishable commodities , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preclude all hopes of a regular commerce . The effects of climate upon commodities are a great element in all the calculations of commerce , and in the present instance they are the most important of all . Should a railroad be made across the Isthmus , it must depend for its support upon the commerce of the Pacific shores with the Atlantic shores of both the continents , and will never become the channel of the commerce of Europe with Asia . Although , therefore , it may be an enterprise of the greatest importance to the inhabitants of Chili and Peru , and in the absence of a northern route , to those of northern California and Oregon , its advanta*cs fall so far behind those which must follow the proposed route from Michigan , we do not feel obliged to dwell upon them at present . A few words in regard to the consequences to be looked for , from the opening of an easy communication with the Pacific across the northern part of the continent , and we have done . The first effects of the enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forest and prairie , stretching from the foot of Lake Michigan to the wilderness beyoud the Mississippi , into a populous and cultivated region , held by tillers of the soil . And in this connection , we may add , that the terms of the contract for the road may be so ordered in favor of the actual settler as to defend him against speculators and monopolists , and , if that is deemed best , to protect him against the ultimate seventies of the law . The new settlements will be in constant communication with all parts of the Union , by the grand routes of railroads diverging toward every part , and by the steam navigation of the lakes . Every particle of corn , or other products , not required for consumption on the spot , can be instantly exchanged for eastern manufactures , or for southern products , by the way , either of the lakes , or the Mississippi . By a direct communication with coal-bearing regions , supplies of coal can be furnished for the fuel of the inhabitants of the prairies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A rapid advance of population will soon carry the road over the prairies , and the consequent advances in the price of lands along the route will furnish abundant means for bridging the Columbia at Wallawalla , and thence by easy grades completing the connection with Puget Sound and the Pacific . The instant of the completion of the road would be the epochal moment of a grand movement in the commerce of the world . A fleet of merchant vessels would be found assembled at the terminus , and a transfer , or perhaps a barter would commence at that point , in which every species of commodity of Europe , Asia and America , would find its equivalent in some other . The gold of California , the manufactures of New England , and the finer and more costly products of France and Great Britain ; the sugars and other products of the South , the corn of Wisconsin , Canada , and all the lake countries , the iron of Pennsylvania , the furs of the Rocky Mountains , the teas and silks , and all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminus of the world 's road . Here the various Asiatic commodities would be placed in cars which would convey them to every point of the Atlantic coast . Here too , cargoes would be assorted for South Sea and South American commerce . At this point , which would become the caravanserai of the continent , the half-way house between Asia and America , a grand commercial city would soon arise , the capital of the Pacific States and the civilizer and merchant of the East . But in dwelling upon the disadvantages of other routes , sufficient , indeed , without 78 July , // further inquiry to put them out of competition with the present one , we had nearly forgotten to mention the great saving of distance and time , by the route advocated by Mr. Whitney . The distance from the foot of Lake Michigan to Puget Sound , with all the windings of the emigrant route , is about 2,195 miles . From Puget Sound to Japan , is 4000 miles . Shangai ( China , ) 5400 Australia , 6000 Singapore ( India , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the railroad would cross the Mississippi , 1,141 miles , and from New-York to Liverpool 3,000 miles , and we have a distance , by the contemplated grand northern route , of 9,541 miles only from Shangai , in China , the route by the Cape of Good Hope being 13,330 miles ; a difference of 3/789 miles in favor of the transcontinental route to China ; a difference which , combined with cheapness and rapidity of transportation , and the advantages of a temperate climate , would turn the entire streaiA of Asio-European commerce across the continent of North America . Packages for China , made up for the convenience of railroad transportation , would be carried across the continent in 5 days ; and to China by steam , in 25 days , which , with 14 days transport from England to America , makes 47 days from England to China with merchandise ; whereas , at present , a favorable voyage requires 107 days . Saving more than half the time , sending his goods through a temperate climate , and escaping the dangers of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hesitate in his choice between the two routes . To this country would accrue the double profit of merchandise conveyed to and brought from China . It is unnecessary to dwell longer upon the plan of Mr. Whitney ; its boldness , feasibility , simplicity , and econoaw , must commend it to universal favor.
