txt THE discourses which we have taken as the basis of our article , while severally of much significance , derive an additional interest from their relation to one another ; a relation which we will at once proceed to explain . The first is an ordination sermon by the Rev. H. Bellows , pastor of the church of the Divine Unity in the city of New York . It is chiefly remarkable for a very earnest , and very orthodox , exhibition of the object and efforts of the Christian minister . It commences with a notice of the charge made against Calvin and his school , of an inordinate * 1 . Reletion of Gkristienity to Human Nature-A Sermon preached at the ordination of ' Mr. Frederick Knapp as colleague Pastor of the First Congregational Church in Brookline , Mass. , on Wednesday , OCt. 6,1847 .

Doctrine of the *tonement. - The Christian Inquirer . New York . attachment to the epistolary and doctrinal portions of the New Testament . Against this charge Mr. Bellows offers a vindication , which , though by no means complete , indicates so just and candid a view of the subject , that we accept it with very sincere gratitude . He passes to a censure , equally just , in our opinion , of the somewhat vague and unsettled views of those who make this objection , and specifies their want of a Christian theology , " as a serious deficiency . Entering thus upon his subject , he proceeds to consider the nature of the minister 's efforts , with reference to " the end , the obstacles , and the instrumentality . " So entirely is the sermon conformed to the views frequently cherished among ourselves , so exact is its coincidence of statement with a certain kind of evangelical preaching , that we despair of conveying any just view of it without larger extracts than our limits will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " a fixed and attainable change . It is a new heart that he is to create . His object is not so much to form the Christian // character as to beget the Christian nature . His aim is the regeneration of man , not his development , " &amp;c . The grand obstacle to the sovereignty of God in the soul , he maintains to be a natural and hereditary depravity ; a something lying back of human character , and for which , though not the result of any activity of ours , we are consciously and justly responsible . His statements under this head are somewhat remarkable , and fall short of the highest orthodoxy only in failing to affirm that man 's depravity is total . He says , ( p. 20 , ) " I fear not to recognize an alienation of the natural man from God . I fear not to see a native proclivity to evil in man . I hesitate not to acknowledge the influence of hereditary depravity . Man is not only imperfect , prone to evil , certain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution of his original nature as Adam fell , but he is far more exposed by his constitutional relations to sinful progenitors , and his ordinary exposure to sinful parental and social influences anterior to his moral agency . Nay , further , I scruple not to acknowledge his accountableness for sin which he can not hut commit , " &amp;c . This is certainly a very near approach to standard orthodoxy . We hesitate not to pronounce it after a highly approved pattern of sound undiscriminating and resolute orthodox assertion . These facts justify , in Mr. B. 's opinion , no objection to the purity or justice of God , unless we could " first establish the point that there are no provisions for strengthening this moral feebleness , and mending this siniid bias , and even turning them to the account of man 's moral dignity and God 's glory . " Admitting himself an extended scheme of such * provisions , " he maintains that moral and physical evil sustain precisely the same relation to the divine government , are means alike of moral discipline to man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no evil . " The instrumentality by which man 's recovery is to be accomplished , is in earnest and extended phrase declared to be " Christianity , " as the result of an indispensable divine interposition , " applied to human nature . " rphe discourse of Dr. Skinner , which we have placed secoud in order , was prepared and published by request of the Synod , to which it was preached . Our design does not permit us to examine it particularly ; though we can not pass it by without some expression of our pleasure in the perusal of it . It is chaste , yet forcible in style , artistic and scholarlike in arrangement , and exceedingly just and vigorous in its reasonings . The view maintained in it exhibits the atonement , not as a satisfaction to any vindicatory impulse of the divine nature , but as a measure rendered indispensable by the perfection of the divine character and government . The divine character being the grand security of the universe , requires the fullest manifestation . Where transgression has occurred , penalty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty be systematically forborne , some measure which may equally illustrate the emotions and purposes of God towards sin , becomes of the highest necessity . It ought perhaps to be observed , however , that the operation of a retributive sentiment in the infliction of literal punishment , the discourse nowhere denies ; it is only in reference to a substituted sufferer that Dr. S. questions its influence . With this limitation , we deem his argument upon the subject altogether correct . The discourse , after presenting this view in a most distinct and discriminating manner , discusses briefly , but decisively , the whole body of the current objections to the doctrine , and concludes with an emphatic rebuke // of the sin which either despises or denies it . On the whole , we know not where to find in the same brief compass , an account of the philosophical grounds on which the revealed fact of the atonement rests , which is at the same time so elegant and so conclusive as this . No. 3 , is an unfinished series of essays on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a Unitarian paper in the city of New York , ) from the pen of Rev. Mr. Bellows , its editor . In connection with a review of the sermon last mentioned , Mr. B. here unfolds his conception of the divine government , and of the relations which sin sustains to it ; and it is to the system of thought here developed , that we wish more particularly to call atte n t ion - These articles , five in number , are somewhat diffuse , and the several topics of thought and argument are not formally and prominently indicated . We are obliged , therefore , to select for ourselves from the body of each article , such statements as seem to us of the most significance ; a circumstance which must be our excuse , should Mr. B. think that we fail to give a just exhibition of his views . In the first number he develops the Unitarian theory of the atonement , ( disclaiming that name , however , ) that man is reconciled to God by the influence of the life , love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he attributes to the evangelical view of the atonement an influence of a highly salutary kind in the past history of the church ; but thinks that he can accept " all that is permanent and evangelical in the doctrine , " while he " rejects the theological theory which has handed it down to us . " In the third , he enters upon an examination of Dr. S. 's sermon , and freely admits that the doctrine , as here presented , " is free from many or most of the objections commonly urged against it . " It gives us pleasure to record these frank and conciliating statements , and to express our appreciation of the manliness and courtesy in which Mr. B. has taken as the basis of his remarks , a form of the doctrine which we deem so elevated and onexceptional ) le . Nor are we without hope that the doctrine may yet come to stand above the only objection which he distinctly presents , viz. , that the divine nature is incapable of suffering . This assumption , we can not but consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the divine benevolence forbids the final misery of the wicked . For , such misery can cause no pain to a being who is not susceptible of pain ; and if infinite benevolence would not be pained by it , it is difficult to see on what grounds exception can be taken to the infliction . Any repognance of our sympathies must , in that case , be referred to the fact that our capacities are finite , and will , of course , diminish in proportion as we expand into the likeness of the ever blessed God . The two princil ) les can not by any ingenuity be woven into the same scheme . If God is not susceptible of suffering , all objection to everlasting punish . ment , which is derived from the divine benevolence , faIls to the ground ; if He is , the only objection which Mr. B. deems it worth while to urge against oui- views of the atonement , is swept away . In the remaining articles of the series , Mr. B. exhibits at large his conception of the divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical and just in itself , shall dispense with all necessity of an atonement . The foundation of the system is laid in the universality of the divine purposes . " We conceive , " he says , " that the creation , history and destiny of the race of man , is a whole ; having no accidents , exigencies , or unfoi'eseen , or unprovided for , circumstances belonging // to it . " " Taking this view of the matter we have rio objection to the doctrine of Adam 's fall , nor to the supposition of the fall of the race in Adam , because it connects itself , in our view , directly with the rise of the race in Christ , as in Adam all die , &amp;c . Nor do we see any philosophical or moral difficulty in the representative character Adam is made to assume . * His acts may be considered fitly as the acts of the race , that is , in his place any other member of the race would have acted as he did . * * He illustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the order of God 's providence the race was to win its way to glory arid happiness through the woful experience of transgression ; the fact that sin was to become a great agency in the moral development of the human race . " Sin is abundantly declared to have entered into the divine plan , riot as an undesirable element , but as the indispensable means of our moral culture . Of course the idea of any proper abhorrence and punishment of it , on the part of the Creator , is out of the question and the divirie government , becomes simply a scheme of moral development and education . Thus , Mr. B. maintains that " in the fall , " our first parents " entered upon that experience which is strictly human and upon which our nature was originally framed to depend for its culture and true progress . " " Christ came , * * not to enable God to do what his attributes would riot allow him to do before ; hut to become the instrument through which the Almighty might carry on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual education , always in his purpose and always in process . " He maintains that " theologians have too generally proceeded on the supposition that the irioral government of God was characteristically a penal government ; " arid proceeds to show that the value of any government must depend on its efficacy as a means of moral illumination ; and its strength , upon the hold it gains on the affections of its subjects by its inculcations of truth , and manifestations of goodness toward them . So high is his estimate of the illuminating influence of moral law , that even where it demands action which surpasses all our capacity of obedience , its imposition is riot unjust ; " its unequalness in respect of human power being balanced by its blessedness in respect of human education . " Man being thus naturally unable to obey , the law could not have been designed to secure his obedience , but only his education ; and consequently disobedience can riot in justice be made the ground of any very serious procedures- " If we any where fonnd , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denth , was allowed to terminate in death or that man 's exposure to ruin was permitted to be realized ; if man proving in all cases incapable of keeping the law , and therefore falling under the shadow of its penalties , was left to fall under the actual substance of them -- then would be the time to complain . " Before proceeding to any argument upon the views thus presented , we would call the attention of our readers to the grand features oh ' the system . Moral development , " the moral dignity of man arid the glory of God , " the comprehensive object of the divine administration ; of this , SIN the indispensable means ; sin , therefore , no real evil ; and consequently , no need of any atonemerit for it , and no justice in die everlasting punishment of it . Then too , the race in Adam ; sharing his fall , and becoming responsible for " dispositions opposed to goodness which we may have inherited , and can not wholly , and at all times , resist , " moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a mere apparatus of " illu // mination ; " in which " all the experiences of the race are absolutely essential to the end ever kept in view ; " and hence , the fall and its consequences , as Mr. B. distinctly announces , not to be " deplored ! " We ask our readers , here particularly to mark the orthodox principIes of theology on which these wide and terrible departures from evangelical truth are justifying themselves . We beg them to consider , whether those principles do not logically necessitate the melancholy and dangerous issues they have ieached ; and whether it is not time for all , who love the truth as it is in Jesus , to make up their minds to an earnest , and if possible discriminating , repudiation of principles , liable to such pernicious abuse . To us , it is no small satisfaction , that it is not our view of the government of God , which furnishes to Unitarian error the foundation which it deems more sure than any it can itself originate ; and for which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our first inquiry , in reference to this attempt to harmonize the existence of evil with the character of God , respects the extent to which this vindication of evil may with propriety , and must with consistency be carried . If Adam 's sin is , after all , not to be deplored , we would ask whether it stands distinguished in this respect , from other acts of disobedience , or whether Adam 's subsequent transgressions , and those of his posterity , all fall within the same category with the firsL For ourselves , we discern no reason why they may not , and must not , be viewed alike . Supposing the moral consequences of the fall to be really evil , we can not see that the immensity of this evil at all ballows or sanctifies the act of the apostasy . Supposing them not to be really evil , we can not see why those consequences , or any one of them , should be deplored , or regretted . The ar guments adduced in support of Mr. Bellows 's theory , seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the thct , that God from the beginning foresaw and foreordained the sin of Adam , lends any palliation to that act , it does so equally to the sin of David-of Peter-of Judas-in short to all sin . For all sin is foreseen and foreordained by the Divine Mind as truly as was that of Eden . If Adam 's sin has been made the occasion of valuable discipline to himself and his posterity , so has that of David . So has all our experience of moral evil . Who does not hold that all sin is made in some way , and in some degree , to promote the glory of God , and the moral development of man ? Plainly in these respects all sin stands upon the same ground ; it enters into the same plan , and for the same reasons , with the sin of Adam ; and if that sin affords no occasion of regret , the result in respect to all sin , is very obvious and very significant . How far Mr. B. would be disposed to acquiesce in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical r*sults , we are unable to say . It is but due to him to state , that he speaks in his sermon of the " heinousness " - and the " desolation " of siii ; exhibits its character as evil in the most emphatic terms-sl ) eaks of the natural mind as " above all , a mind to which sin is not the deadliest and most dreaded of evils , " - terms actual alienation from God " a dreadful thing , " &amp;c. &amp;c . Indeed the strength of his expressions on this point , it would be difficult for the most orthodox believer in the evangelical scheme to surpass . But then we find it quite as expressly laid down that in this universe where sin has so wide a sway , " there is no evil " in the sight of God . " It is equally true that to him TIIERL IS XO EVIL . * * * And who does not see that to our judgment the Almighty is always justified by his purpose ? This is our only means of reconci // ling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God . But what reason have we for making an exception as it respects moral evil ? Why may not human nature and human character fall under the law to which all the other creations and purposes of God are held-the law by which the imperfect precedes the perfect ; the worse the better ? " That these two classes of passages are totally irreconcilable with one another , our readers will scarce need to be told . Indeed if it had been the object of Mr. B. to frame statements which should be so , he could scarcely have done it more effectually . While he maintains , doubtless in all sincerity , that " sin is the deadliest and most dreaded of evils , " he tells us that to God " there is no evil " in it . XVhile he pro . r*ounces " actual alienation from God a dreadful thing wholly independent of the causes of it , " ( Sermon , p. 16 , ) he also says , ( Essay , No . Ill , ) " Adam 's fall-or , what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sin ; the uniform exposure of the race to suffering ; the uniform alienation of the race from God ; the uniform need of repentance and forgiveness , is a part of God 's moral government of which we recognize the fitness , beauty and necessity , " &amp;c. &amp;c . How alienation from God can be a dreadful thing , while it has yet " fitness and beauty and necessity " as a part of God 's government ; - how sin can be the deadliest of evils while yet to God " there is no evil , " passes all understanding . It is perfectly evident however that Mr. B. is not aware of any inconsistency between these two classes of statements . We think therefore that we can hardly be in error in supposing , that the subject of the atonement in its relations to the government of God , is a new one to him ; and that he has thrown out these expressions , without observing whither they tend . We would be far therefore from im puting to him any of the consequences which seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles he here upholds . If the sin of Adam is not to be deplored ; - if sin is really a means of moral discipline , which occupies the same relation to the divine character and purposes as physical pain ; - if the alienation of a soul from God has in it a fitness and beauty as a necessary part of its moral development ;  --  the conclusion follows irresistibly , that there is no such thing as guilt or blameworthiness possible among men . Who can assign or discern any reason for avoiding sin , any ground to regret or " deplore " sin , any obligation to repent of sin , or indeed any possibility of repentance , when once it is fully admitted that sin is a great agency in our moral development , in which omniscience perceives no evil ? These expressions go evidently to such an extreme length , that we are unwilling to suppose that Mr. Bellows really adopts or understands the conclusions which his language necessarily implies . And yet it is not his language nlone that suggests them ; the whole scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irresistibly leads to the same issues . The dogma that sin , when vie*ved by a mind competent to discern all its relations and results in the present scheme , is no real evil , this seems the foundation of his philosophy . This is with him the reason why the sin of Adam is not to be deplored ; to us it is , if true , a reason why it was on the whole better that sin should occur than not . Evidently it is a reason which , could Adam but have known the whole truth , would have justified his transgression ; and which we most seriously believe would justify all transgression . Indeed Mr. B. seems very distinctly to place Adam 's sin and its consequences on the same ground ; - " If we be asked , do we not deplore Adam 's fall and the // consequences of*t , we are compelled to say in the distinctest manner , No ! We conceive it to have been as necessary and indispensable a part of the history of the race , and the moral development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the mission of Christ . " This unguarded language we will not hold up to any reproach , for we are persuaded that Mr. B. would not deliberately maintain it in the face of the consequences which we here charge upon it . The subject is to him evidently a novel one , and looking at it from only a single point of view , he has thrown out expressions which deprive sin of all its heinousness , and do all that philosophical principles can , to reconcile conscience to the depravity which exists within us . The reason for God 's permission and foreordination of evil , has been , to every earnest student of His moral government , a theme of anxious inquiry . As a tOl ) ic which stands related to every great truth , and every great error , in the philosophy of religion , it has been discussed by the leading ( livines of the Calvinistic body with an earnestness proportioned to its importance : and never more earnestly , never more ably , never we believe with happier results , than in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England . Ihe theory that sin is the necessary means of the greatest good , ' after having been warmly and ably defended , has at length been formally abandoned by all parties among us . No one now proposes to defend or professes to hold it . This theory it seems the design of Mr. Bellows to bring forward once more . His view of it differs only in a single unessential particular , from that of the champions of this past form of Calvinism . They deemed the greatest good to consist , in the fullest exhibition of the divine perfections ; he places it in the fullest development of man 's capacities . Neither of these objects is held , in either scheme , in total exclusion of the other ; but the one gives prominence to the manifestation of God , the other to the development of man . They supposed that sin furnished an indispensable occasion for the display of punitive justice and forgiving mercy ; he deems it an indispensable element of the moral development of man . With this difference in respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral evil is vindicated , on both schemes of thought , on grounds absolutely identical ; it is iridispensable to the perfection of God 's administration- " the necessary means of the greatest good , " in each. # The theory will be therefore to most of our Calvinistic readers , an entirely familiar one . It has been with us a theme of earnest inquiry and dehate ; and we have learned to regard it , even when presented in connection with our own scheme of doctrine , as one fraught with conclusions of the most pernicious and repulsive kind . At the same time , it stands , in the orthodox system , in relations which go far to counteract its demoralizing tendencies . Viewed in the light which the atonement on the one hand , and the doctrine of everlasting punishment on the other , cast upon it , there seems such a terrible earnestness in the divine prohibitions of sin , as tends power- * Should any of our readers be under the impression that the phrase which thus describes sin , is of recent origin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , they will perhaps be grateful to us for a reference which will enable them to correct the error . From Dr. Stephen West 's Essay on Moral Agency , ( p. 178 , ) we copy the following expressions : " These things being considered , it may perhaps appear that the existence of moral evil is a necessary means of the greatest good ; " * * * " it most certainly follows that moral evil was a necessary means of the greatest good . " See Part 11 , sec. i , for numerous expressions of the same kind , in every variety of phraseology. // fully to restrain the mind from venturing any thing upon a theory which pronounces it , in His sight no evil . But upon a scheme which denies both those truths , the dogma must sweep to its conclusions , with a force which bodes little of good to any interest of piety or truth or morality among men . XVe will not therefore enter upon any extended argument against this thcory , till xve know whether our author is disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences . The fact that he nowhere notices , or promises to notice , the grave objection we urge , confirms us in the impression that he has uttered these sentiments in haste and inadvertence . He will perhaps allow . us to inquire , how far he would acquiesce in the extension which we have felt constrained to give to the reasonings by which he vindicates the apostasy ; and whether he is prepared to take issue with " those of his orthodox brethren for whose opinions he has the most respect , " on the question of the indispensableness of sin to the perfection of the divine government . For purposes of controversy merely , nothing could be more favorable to our cause , than that Unitarianism should place itself before the public on ground which we have explored so thoroughly , and the disadvantages of which we understand so well but loving victory less than truth , we should sincerely regret to find our opponents borrowing from Calvinism only its errors and its reproach . In the high appreciation which Mr. Bellows entertains of the educational influences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cordial agreement . We can not think however that his analysis of them is a very correct one ; or that he places any just estimate upon the relative power of the several elements . He says that " it is not intended to deny all moral effi cacy or illuminatioti to penal law . We see that the announcement of a penalty is the passing of a moral judgment on the offense , and that thus l ) enal law has an educating influence upon a community . " ( No . V. ) Now we can not think that this scanty concession does any justice to the vast educating influence of simple law . Mr. B. treats the question as though penal law depended for its power , upon the appeal it makes to fear : as though it were a question of the relative influence of love and fear . lie speaks of " degrading fear , selfish hope , and servile submission , " as though these were the great sentiments which law addresses , though he would not " deny all " illuminating power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its influence . While we can not admit that either the fear of God , or the hope of heaven , is altogether a base , or altogether an insignificant thing , there are so many other active impulses of nature to which the law of heaven makes its appeal , ( and which Mr. B. seems almost entirely to have overlooked , ) that the question might be argued upon these alone . 1 . First ; apart from all consideration of the relative power of different impulses when called into action , there is in the instinct of selfpreservation a tendency to act which belongs to no other . Other impulses , such as love , and gratitude , whatever their power when excited , require a far greater amount of thought and reflection to stimulate them to action than this ; inattention , therefore , is fatal to any thing which depends upon their influence . So it would be in this case , but the same inattention to our own wants as to those of others , is not possible . A man suffers his benefactor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger than gratitude , but from mere thoughtlessness of the other 's necessities . A man who would really sacrifice much for his // friend neglects an opportunity which may never return , of rendering him most essential service , simply from inattention ; but he is never so inattentive to his own interests . There is no question in these cases of the relative strength of the impulses concerned ; but every one sees that the one acts only upon reflection and the other instinctively . The certainty and rapidity , therefore , with which the one comes into action give it an advantage of a peculiar kind , quite apart from its relative strength . While our moral vision is so feeble , the tendencies of our acts so obscure , and their consequences so remote , not to say uncertain , who does not see the ad vantage of a law ; which makes its distinct and impressive appeal to an impulse so sure and prompt as this ? 2 . Secondly ; it is no question of the relative power of love and fear , which our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity of penal inflictions for the support of authority when sin has occurred , we conceive of no authority as worthy of one moment 's respect , which has riot its foundation in the purest and most benevolent affection . Why may not God , while he proclaims the dread penalty of his law , and feels himself shut up to the necessity of its infliction , first , place the creatures whom he assumes to govern , in a scene where each object of nature , and each hour of life , shall speak of his boundless goodness ? Why may not beings , over whose heads this mighty institute extends in all its solemnity , find each necessity of their natures kindly cared foreach sense an inlet of calm enjoyment-each several faculty a separate world of blessing-till each circumstance of their existence shall become a radiant testimony of their Creator 's love ? What hinders that the ministry of angels should attend upon , and instruct them ? that God himself should visit and commune with them ; and folding each soul thus placed on its probation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deepest affection ? Nay , what is all this but a faint picture of what actually took place in Eden ? Our scheme is compatible , therefore , with every influence both of kindness , and of instruction , which could be devised to bless men while innocent , in any other ; and to say that guilt constitutes no obstacle to the manifestation of love , is to assume that sin is no real evil  --  a principle which would deprave both the universe and its ruler , precisely in proportion to the earnestness with which they act upon it . Mr. B. speaks of " love and love 's efforts to instruct and enlighten , " &amp;c . What love , and what instruction , are there within the compass of thought , like those which grow out of the dread necessity which we acknowledge ?  --  the love to which we owe " the unspeakable gift , " and the instruction which radiates from the cross of Christ ? 3 . But one of the grandest influences of legal penalty lies in the powerful stimulus which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far surpasses every other conceivable . The stern threatening ofan overwhelming infliction , as the inevitable consequence of transgression , appeals not first , nor principally to the sentiment of fear . Its first effect is to awaken wonder and surprise . The impressive denunciation of sin as the supreme evil , rouses each faculty of reason and reflection to discover those relations and consequences of sin which render it , to infinite wisdom and love , the object of such intense displeasure . How dire its influ*nce on the soul itself ; how dread its devastations in the divine government , to call for a counteraction so vigorous and extreme ! **25;143;TOOLONG indications which the law holds forth , the mind goes forward into the interminable future -- upward // to the far throne of the Most Highdown into the deep recesses of its own nature-abroad into each unexplored field of thought , grasping with each movemcnt , more and more of the vastness of the relations which unite it to God and his kingdom . The evil  --  the real evil-of sin  --  the excellence of the law-the value of obedience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar thought , till they stand disclosed in all their glory to its view . And now , what educating process is there , we would ask , to be named in comparison with that which yields this mighty stimulus to our intellectual nature . Love calls forth simply love in return ; mercy awakens only the emotion of gratitude . What sentiment of those on which Mr. B. relies , awakens curiosity-stimulates i magination -- absorbs attention-constrains thought - like this high institute of law ? 4 . Nor is this all . It is only upon the scheme we advocate , that the influence even of instruction assumes at all a commanding character . For what more can instruction do in its highest forms , than disclose those tendencies by which sin and holiness degrade or exalt the soul ? What more can it do in respect to sin than to show that it tends to prevent all the beautiful development of our nature-enslave us to base impulses-fill us with shame and remorse  --  and work thus our utter ruin ? Will it be said that all this , fully disclosed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : but observe the defect of the teaching . While we see these to be the tendencies of sin , we see also many an instance of sin in which they do not actually or perceptibly follow . Sin tends to overwhelm the soul with remorse ; but the man whose hands are red with murder , lies down and his sleep is sweet . " Human nature and human circumstances , " says Mr. B. , " are all contrived to throw honor and peace upon moral worth , and final contempt and wretchedness upon unworthiness . " It is most true but what certainty is there that they will actually accomplish the work they were " contrived " to do ? How much honor and peace did they throw round the life of Paul , or of his master ? Liow often does crime walk unblushing through the land , and make its way to the high places of influence and honor ! We admit the tendency and this , instruction may develop ; but why may not skill , and resolution , and daring , set tendencies at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beholders into sympathy and admiration ? Nothing , evidently , save that pledge of the Infinite Ruler , which constitutes the threatening of penalty , can relieve them of their aspect of doubtfulness , and give them place and influence among the realities of our future existence . On these grounds , then , apart from all consideration of the relative influence of love and fear , we base our argument , and maintain that in the active nature of the sentiments to which it appeals , in its compatibility with every other influence of wisdom and of ' love , in the intellectual stimulus it furnishes , and in the certainty with which it invests the general tendencies of things , the institute of penal law finds a power which surpasses immeasurably that of any other scheme ; one which stamps it , beyond mistake , chief among all the ways of God in his moral intercourse with men . On the other hand , against Mr. Bellows 's scheme , lie several conclusive objections . First , it is not a government at all . Government holds an influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a scheme of instruction . It is a mere educational institute in the form of a government . The parent who guides the hand of his infant to a physical object , and instructs it thus in the nature and qualities of this object , // when he would not yet venture to give a command , recognizes the wide distinction between the influences of authority and instruction . This system is one of illumination simply and purely . Its law was framed with reference to our capacities of education , not of obedience . It is promulgated with a real design and preference of transgression , for the sake of the invaluable discipline of which sin is to be the means . Its penalty is threatened with no intention of inflicting it ; and if it were inflicted would give occasion to " complain . " He who falls under its condemnation , falls under what Mr. B. most appropriately terms " a shadow . " Who can fail to see that this professed government is an unreal thing in every particular ; a mere illuminating apparatus , borrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next ; not being a government in fact , it fails entirely to secure the educational influences of one . What influences of this kind it formally repudiates , we have already seen . For the rest , its law has not even the power of " a moral judgment " upon transgression , because it is not a transcript of the real will of the lawgiver , who originally designed its violation . Its influence , too , of kindr*ss and love , what obstacle can these throw in the way of sin , when once it is understood that the lawgiver originally framed our nature to depend upon sin for its " culture and true progress , ' * and of course that he really prefers it ? It is not , therefore , a government operating by the influence of authority , nor yet a government operating by the influence of instruction and kindness ; fur the reason that it is not a government at all . It is a mere institute of education . Its value for purposes of this nature , must depend on the simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , we ask , is the comprehensive lesson which the system itself and the experience of all its subjects is ever exemplifying ? Why plainly , that in the view of Omniscience " there is no evil " in sin , and that God 's law was not designed to prevent , but rather to secure it as " a grand agency in the moral development of our race . " What an invaluable education the divine government will have furnished , and on what a hopeful career it will be entering , when each of its subjects having become sufficiently " ilILiminated , " shall begin to act on the sublime principles on which the government itself proceeds , that as a really comprehensive view of the matter , there is no evil in sin By a misapprehension , which seems to us somewhat extraordinary , Mr. B. supposes that upon our theory , " human history , and all that we now view as human life , a scene of probation , of temptation , or trial , is a grand perversion of the divine plan ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one originally designed for man during his abode on earth . All ideas of this kind , however , we entirely disclaim . The only question between us at this point is , not whether a moral being requires a process of discipline in order to the development and confirmation of his character ; but whether sin is an indispensable element in such a process . lere is the whole difference . Mai 's residence on earth was designed for trial , but not for sin . Let us suppose , then , ( to exhibit our own view of the subject , ) that in the simple trial to which his piety was first subjected , Adam had held fast his integrity ; and that when this obedience had become habitual , the sphere of his moral resporisibility had been enlarged by other prohibitions . Let us suppose a series of such stages , each broader than the preceding , successfully Iraversed , till the moral affections , at first almost powerless to resist temptation , had grown into impulses of // such promptness and vigor as made them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time his posterity would have come into being under influences far transcending any that our world now knows . The serene piety of a parent in habitual intercourse with the spiritual woi - in daily communion with a visible divinity , would have been from the first stamping its celestial image upon the immortal nature yielded to its affection , and entrusted to its care . The infant piety of beings upon whom neither the fall nor the curse had wrought its deadly work , would have begun soon to emulate parental devotion . As the race multiplied , social duties had tried obedience , and social intercourse had given culture to affection . A piety lovelier and stronger than any the earth has seen , had been developed and tested under nobler institutes . Plans to prolong this reign of righteousness through all the ages-efforts to bind the present and the future yet closer to heaven , had given scope to the highest faculties , and tested man 's faithfulness to his mighty charge . Thus had man lived in dignity and simplicity , striven in hope and devotion for posterity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation , the hour when his sanctified character should gain such maturity in holiness as earth could give . And then how had the chariot of Israel , and the horsemen thereof , borne him away , not through the gloom and decay at which nature now shudders , but through the blue heaven above us to scenes where yet more of God should be disclosed to his adoring view ! But it may be asked , if such results of beauty and glory were foreseen as consequent upon Adam 's obedience , why did not a benevolent Creator interpose to secure it ? Why not sustain this frail and unstable virtue till the tremendous cri sis should be past ? Because , we reply , it is entirely possible that such interposition would have defeated its own end , and deprived the being to whom it was vouchsafed of all the benefit of the trial . It is entirely possible that these momentous results might d *pend upon Adam 's spontaneous obedience . If so , the idea of divine interposition is precluded by the very supposition ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument against the theory that obedience on his part would have op , ned to our world such a career of moral beauty and blessedness as we have aimed to describe . Will it be said that the earth was not adapted , even before the fall , to be the theater of such events ? The objection lacks proof ; but if it did not , the answer is easy ; the earth was formed in foresight of the fall , and adapted substantially to the state of things arising from it . Is it deemed fanciful to lodge a capacity of such mighty results in the individual bosom in which the race took its origin ? Nay , it is not fanciful . What else is all human history than the record of men who have thus molded posterity into their own image . What else than this , in a somewhat humbler degree , was the life of Abrajtam ? of Moses ? of Paul ? of Bunyan ? of Wesley ? And if here , and now , the generation wait to receive religious character at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of God , why should it be deemed " puerile " to attribute even these results to holiness such as we have described , enthroned , like theangel standing in the sun , in that bosom from which our nature took its origin and its type . Least of all can such an objection be urged by those with whom we hold this argument . They deem it not visionary to attribute all the efficient moral influences which now adorn and bless our being , to an // 261 origin precisely similar . To what but the sanctifying influences which grow out of the single life of Jesus , do they attribute all that has elevated our nature in the past ? all that promises farther elevation in the future ? And if the obedience of one man , amid all human corruption , holds so efficient a recuperative influence over the race forever , why need we shrink from attributing a similar efficiency of preservation to the obedience of our first ancestor ? Surely they who find such reclaiming efficacy in the life of the second Adam , . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first would have wrought those immeasurable results of blessing which the evangelical faith ascribes to it . The principle on which these discussions of Mr. Bellows proceed , seems evidently to be , that the experienc.e of sin affords to a moral being an element of useful culture . We have heard the idea from other sources . For ourselves , we discern not the smallest argument to relieve it of the repulsive aspect in which it must present itself to a mind of any religious sensibility . On the contrary , it seems at utter variance with much of our most familiar experience . What valuable discipline have we ever derived from this unclean source ? What benefit accrues to our voluntary faculty from having learned to act in defiance of all truth and all authority ? What improvement do the fine sensibilities of our nature derive from having been accustomed to pass by all that is grand and ennobling , and fasten on despicable and impure things ? What conceivable addition is made to our intellectual wealth . or our intellectual power , by acts the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom P The whole tendency is plainly in the opposite direction , to stultify and debase the mind . So far is this idea from the truth , that in fact we have no reason to conclude that even the glorious influences of this redemptive system can ever entirely counteract the pernicious effects ofsin . Who shall say that a soul long subjected to a process which tends powerfully to enfeeble it in all those elements of its nature which must constitute the strength of holy principle , will ever secure the harmonious and vigorous development of a perfectly sinless being . Who shall say that this protracted and extreme conflict with evil will not leave scars to mar the beauty , and wounds to impair the efficiency , even of those who are victorious in it ; as the ordeal by fire , of old , left its ineffaceable marks in the scathed and callous flesh of those who successfully endured it . Still farther ; it may be alledged as a decisive fact of consciousness , that all the discipline we are conscious of having received , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in actual and vigorous opposition to all that would lead to it . It is in resisting temptation , not in yielding to it , that the soul confirms itself in good . It is the great law of our natu re that affections and impulses of whatever kind grow by acting , not by being trampled on . Benevolence strengthens with each act it is allowed to dictate , and diminishes in power on each occasion that it is overruled and suppressed by selfish or covetous passion . Ambition towers higher and stands stronger with each victory that it gains over the love of justice or the sense of duty . It is not therefore by sinning that the soul ever gains the least of the valuable discipline which this probationary scene furnishes . Transgression tends only to future weakness and blindness : leaves only a mist before the eye and a palsy upon the arm of him who ventures beyond the sphere which wisdom and love assign as ours . All the development which the present system affords , is due to // trial , not to sin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin have destroyed the beneficent results of a trial like that of Abraham ; and become an occasion of everlasting regret ! But it is the life of Christ which lends the highest confirmation to the view we advocate . On the theory of those with whom we argue , here was the passage of a purely human being through this world utterly unstained with sin . And who will stand up to maintain that his affectionate and ingenuous childhood ,  - -  his thoughtful and auspicious youth , - his lovely and most perfect manhood , had been improved in aught that lends beauty or dignity to human character by the smallest experience of moral evil ? It were ignominious to say it . Yet he shared each simple impulse of our common nature , and " was tempted in all points ljke as we are ; " that he who would hold up before his mind the highest ideal of moral discipline and its benign results , might see that in all that process of culture which thus sanctifies and adorns our nature , sin has literally no part . Who that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , with the character of Christ , can fail to see that , precious as are the spiritual economies which surround us in this system of fall and redemption , they fail utterly to elevate human character to any thing like that eminence of glory , to which it might have attained ? Who can fail to see in the light of such an example , that sin only deforms our nature , only obstructs its fair and fine development , and catses the education which abounding grace yet achieves , to advance to*vard per . fection with a slow and halting movement , and reach it at last on a far lower level , than that on which unfallen nature might have sped its rapid and graceful course to the same bright goal . Indeed there are to us few aspects of the incarnation so interesting , as that which exhibits Deity assuming our nature , and guarding it from all corrupting contact with the evil which is in the world , for the purpose of showing to the race and the universe , a speciinen of what human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus , of manifesting the value of the original law of holiness , the earnestness with which that law was given , and the odiousness in every aspect of the sin which has caused actual human natute , even in the glory of its redeemed state , to fall so far below the divine ideal of it . That system of influences then , under which our nature recetves its development , owes no part of the benign culture it confers , no one of its glorious fruits , to the moral evil which it contains . Admitting all that can justly be claimed for it on the score of its tendency to illuminate and establish the soul , we contend that precisely in proportion to the prevalence of sin in it , is the system deteriorated . The present has then simply taken the place of a more perfect and beautiful scheme , that would have conducted the race , through processes of trial pursued under better auspices , to happier results . Even as now each earnest and devout co-worker with God , introduces into the system , influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we believe that Adam , had he but stood in his uprightness , might have made it one of unfailing power to develop the soul throttgh scenes of more than Eden 's loveliness , to a piety nobler , and more beautiful , than ever can bless it now . We do not indeed attribute any such results to a single act in its isolation ; but we believe that the act in which he fell might have become the turning point of his character , and bound him to holiness as it really did to sin : that his character , once confirmed , might have become then as now , the model of character in his immediate offspring , and through // 263 them have been perpetuated to unknown generations . All this is certainly possible ; and though we may not affirm that precisely these results would have taken place , it is not to be questioned that some approximation to them would have been actually realized . In the assured conviction that obedience would have brought to him , as to us , strength and blessedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sin had enslaved the world , would have been far more full than now of auspicious and delightful results , we contemplate the introduction of evil with unmingled pain . XVe think that no act which history records , is to be " deplored " like that which dropped this deadly drug into the very fountain of our being . With no wish , and no willingness , to denounce the errors of one whose candor both ancient and modern sys tems seem to have conspired to mislead , we should not do justice to our most deliberate and cherished conviclions , did we not declare that , both in judgment , and in feeling , we stand at the widest remove from the views which he has felt at liberty to promulgate . But our remarks have extended far beyond our design , and we must bring them to a conclusion . We have sought to show , because we sincerely believe , that from investigations pursued in the direction of those which have furnished us our subjects of remark , little good result is to he looked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ect that our reasonings should beget any such conviction in Mr. Bellows himself ; and we have only to say therefore , that we shall await with interest and examine with respect the f*rrher development which he promises.
