txt MIRACLES have ever been considered a fundamental proof of divine revelation . Those who claim to have been inspired , appeal to miracles as infallible testimonials of their divine commission . Thus Moses , when he demanded of Pharaoh the emancipation of the Israelites from bondage , appealed to the miracles which he wrought , as evidence that he was sent by God . Thus , also , Elijah , in the controversy between him and the prophets of Bnal , called upon the God of Abraham , Isaac and Jacob , in the presence of the people , to let it be known that he was his servant , by miraculously consuming the sacrifice prepared . ile thus put the reality of his mission to the test . If the miracle had failed , he would by his own implied acknowledgment , have been deservedly considered a vile impostor . Christ and his apostles also appealed to miracles , in proof of their divine commission . When John sent two of his disciples to Christ , to inquire whether he were indeed the Messiah , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his works , as the most conclusive and satisfactory evidence of his Messiahship , which could possibly be given them . " In that same hour , " the evangelist informs us , " he cured many of their infirmities , and plagues , and evil spirits , and unto many that were blind , he gave sight . " Arid he said to the messengers of John , " Go your way , and tell John what things ye have seen and heard ; how the blind see , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised , and unto the poor the gospel is preached . " On another occasion , when the Jews accused him of blasphemy , for claiming to be the Son of God ; he said , " If I do not the works of my Father , believe me not ; but if I do , though ye believe not me , yet believe the works . " Again he said , " Believe me that I am in the Father , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very works ' sake . " Other instances might be mentioned , in which he appealed to his miracles , as decisive proof of his Messiahship . Peter and John also appealed to the miracle wrought by them on the impotent man at the gate of the temple , as evidence of their commission from the Lord Jesus . " Peter filled with // the Holy Ghost , said unto them , if we be examined this day , of the good deed done to the impotent man , by what means he is made whole , be it known unto you all , and to all the people of Israel , that by the name of Jesus of Nazareth , whom ye crucified , whom God raised from the dead , even by him , doth this man stand before you whole . " Paul also , appealed to the miracles wrought by him , as decisive evidence of his apostleship . To the Romans he said , " I will not dare to speak of those things which Christ bath not wrought by me to make the gentiles obedient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonders , by the power of the Spirit of God . " And to the Corinthians he said , " For in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles , though I am nothing . Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you , in all patience , in signs , and wonders , and mighty deeds . " We see , therefore , that those who profess to have been inspired , did appeal to the miracles which they wrought , or rather which God wrought by them , as infallible proof of their divine commission . It will be the object of this article , to examine this source of evidence . Assuming for the present , the genuineness and authenticity of the books of the Old and New Testaments , we propose I. To inquire , what is a miracle ? II . To show that miracles are possible . IlL To show that if God gave a revelation to man , it is probable he would attest it by miracles . IV . To show that whenever miracles are wrought , they are conclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish the truth of the claims which they are wrought to attest . Our first inquiry is , What is a miracle ? There have been many definitions of this term ; but no one , perhaps , comes nearer to the truth , than the following . A miracle is an effect which is produced , or an event which takes place , contrary to the laws of nature . By the laws of nature are meant those stated rules of operation , according to which God governs the world . That there are such laws , agreeably to which , all ordinary events take place , will not be denied ; as for instance , that all bodies gravitate towards the center of the earth-that matter will continue in a state of rest , or uniform motion , unless compelled to change that state by sonic foreign force-that fire will consume combustible substances , when it conies in contact with them-that the sun which seems to rise in the morning , will appear to continue its course through the heavens , till it sets at night-that human bodies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but remain senscless till they moulder into dust ; are uniform facts , which indicate an established course of proceeding in the government of the world . Effects which are produced according to this established course , are called natural ; those which are contrary to it , are styled supernatural , or miraculous . For examl ) le , if a bush should be on fire , and not be consumed-if the sun should appear to stand still , or to move backward in its diurnal course  --  or if a dead person should be restored to life-these things would be miracles ; because they are directly contrary to the established course of God 's providence . Another characteristic of mrades , by which they are distinguished from all other events , is , that they are effects of immediate divine agency , and can not be traced to the operation of any natural or secondary causes . We know that God , in the government of the world , does make use of secondary causes . Both in the natural and moral world , he employs the instrumentality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ends . But none of those events which can be traced // to natural causes , however strange , or unusual , are to be considered miraculous . Nor , indeed , is it certain that all events are miraculous , which we can not trace to natural causes ; because from the limited faculties of our minds , we can have but an imperfect knowledge of the laws of nature . Events which are natural , may take place , the causes of which lie beyond our observation . But here the question arises , how then shall we know whether any event is miraculous , or whether there has ever been such a thing as a miracle ? How can we know that all those wonders which have been supposed to be miracles , were not brought about by some natural causes which lie beyond our view , and were conformable to some law of nature with which we are un-acquainted ? To this we reply , It is undoubtedly true , that there might be instances in which we should be unable to determine whether a miracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case in all those instances in which the event was of such a kind , that we were ignorant of all the laws and operations of nature which have any reference to it . Thus , for example , a person unacquainted with astronomy , on beholding for the first time an eclipse of the sun , must be unable to determine whether it is a miracle or not . It is an event for which he is unable to account . Yet it does not contravene any known law of nature , and it must be impossible for him to know that it is not a natural event , and perfectly consistent with those fixed laws which regulate the motions of the heavenly bodies . In like manner , a person who had been brought up under the torrid zone , the first time he should see water congealed into ice , would be unable to account for the fact , and would be in doubt whether it was a miracle or not . But there are instances when we may know for certainty whether a miracle is wrought ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is such that we know the laws of nature to which it stands related . Although our knowledge of nature is very limited , yet some of its laws we do know . We know , for instance , that all bodies gravitate towards the center of the earth , with as much certainty as we know that there is such a thing as matter . The same is true of many other laws of nature . We may also lay it down as a maxim , that all the laws of nature are consistent with each other . To suppose that God has established laws which conflict one with another , and mutually subvert each other , is both irrational and impious . It hence follows , that if any event takes place which we know to be contrary to any of the laws of nature , we may know it to be miraculous . Now in regard to the miracles recorded in the Scriptures , there can be no doubt . If the accounts are true , miracles were wrought beyond all question . The facts are of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any other light . To heal instantly incurable diseases  --  to restore sight to those who were born blind  --  and to raise the dead to life , are certainly miraculous works , if any works can be supposed to be such . We proceed to show , II . That miracles are possible . If miracles are not possible , it is idle to pretend that any have been wrought , or to argue from them in support of Divine revelation . One would hardly suppose , that any person who professed to believe in the existence of a God , would deny his power to work miracles . Such however , is the fact . Some of those who deny the inspiration of the Scriptures , have strenuously maintained that miracles are impossible . But , " is any thing too hard for the Lord ? " If God is almighty , he is able to do any thing which does // riot imply a contradiction . And does it imply a contradiction , to suppose him able to suspend or counteract the laws of nature ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed into a serpent , that a blind man instantly received his sight , or that a dead person was restored to life ? To say that the same substance was at the same time , both a rod and a serpent , or that a person was at the same time , both dead and alive , would indeed be a contradiction . But to say that a substance was instantly changed , and that life was communicated to the dead , does no more imply a contradiction , than to say , that God formed man , at first , of the dust of the earth , and breathed into him the breath of life . Has not he who with a word created all substances , power to change and modify them as he pleases ? Has not he who is the author of life , power to restore it when taken . has the artist who constructed the watch , power to vary its operations , to quicken or retard its motions , to take it to pieces , and alter it as he pleases ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the twinkling of an eye , all the wheels of his providence ; to counteract , or suspend the operation of those laws which he has established , according to his pleasure ? But , perhaps , it may be said , that although it should be admitted , that God has power to work a miracle , yet it is impossible , because it is inconsistent with his other perfections , particularly his immutability and wisdom . It may be supposed by some , that if God has established certain laws for the government of the world , he can not suspend them , or act contrary to them , without changing his mind , and acting differently from what he intended when he planned his system of operations . But this by no means necessarily follows . God might have foreseen , when he established the laws of nature , that on certain occasions , and for certain reasons , it would be wise to suspend or counteract them ; and he may have determined to do it . Every miraculous event , therefore , may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel , as much as the most ordinary events which occur . Nor do such miraculous interpositions , argue any imperfection in the system of divine government , or any want of wisdom in planning it . If there are wise and important reasons why miracles should be wrought , then , they must have a place in a perfect system ; and if God is a being of infinite wisdom , he has so planned the system as to give them a place , and the very place , which it is desirable that they should occupy , that they may answer the end for which they were designed . We proposed to show , III . That if God gave a revelation to man , it is probable that he would attest it by miracles . We can not suppose that God would give a revelation to mankind which was to be the rule of their conduct , and by which they must be judged at the final day , without , at the same time , giving abundant evidence of its divine original . But in what way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could any man prove that he was divinely inspired , and commissioned to deliver messages from heaven , without miraculous attestations ? Prophecy , which by the way , is of the nature of a miracle , is indeed a sure evidence of inspiration , when fulfilled ; but it is not an immediate evidence , and could not , therefore , be any attestation to a revealed truth , when first published . The nature of the doctrines and precepts contained in the revelation , would it is true , afford strong evidence of their divine original ; yet , by degenerate minds , who are blind to the beauties of holiness , this evidence would not be duly appreciated . Some other // attestation , therefore , seems to be requisite-sonething to which the messenger of God could appeal as decisive , when his claims to inspiration should be called in question . And we can conceive of nothing which would answer this purpose , but some miraculous attestation . If , then , a revelation is desirable , which none can deny ; and if we might presume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave mankind without that supernatural instruction which they so much need ; there is no antecedent improbability against miracles , but a strong probability in their favor . There is just as much probability that God would work miracles , as that he would give a revelation to man . We see , therefore , with how little reason it has been asserted , that a miracle is so improbable in its nature , that no testimony is sufficient to render it credible . Mr. Hume went so far as to say , that we may establish it as a maxim , that no human testimony can have such force as to prove a miracle , and to make it a just foundation for any system of religion : " - and again , that " a miracle , supported by any human testimony , is more properly a subject of derision , than of argument . " These assertions , if true , strike at the root of all belief in divine revelation , and tend to the conclusion that a revelation can not be given to man , which shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which Mr. Hume attempts to establish his position , is this-that miracles are contrary to experience , and that it is not contrary to experience that testimony should be false . Now , what does he mean by experience ? This word is used in two senses , which are distinguished by the terms personal and derived . Personal experience , is the experience of one individual , and relates to what has fallen under his own observations . Derived experience , is founded on testimony , and relates to what has fallen under the observation of others , and been communicated to us . In which of these senses is the term used , when it is said that miracles . are contrary to experience ? If in the first sense , the argument proves too much ; for if we are to disbelieve that miracles were wrought , barely because we never witnessed them , we must also disbelieve every other fact that has not come under our own observation . This sets aside human testimony altogether , and sweeps away at a stroke , all historical knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our own personal experience , it leads very nearly to absolute and universal skepticism . But if the word experience be used in the latter sense ; that is , if it be said that miracles are contrary to the experience of all mankind , this is taking for granted the very thing to be proved . The question is , whether miracles are contrary to the experience of those who lived at the different periods when they are supposed to have been wrought . We see , therefore , that this reasoning is utterly fallacious ; and that there is no such improbability attending miracles , as to render them incapable of being substantiated by testimony . That those which are recorded in the Scriptures , have been substantiated by the most unexceptionable testimony , has often been most conclusively shown . This is now taken for granted ; it being no part of the object of this article to enter on the discussion of this point . We proceed to show , as was proposed , IV . That whenever miracles are wrought , they are conclusive evtdence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth of the claims which they are wrought to attest . That men , of themselves , are // competent to work miracles , no one will 1 ) retend . But it is supposed by some , that there are created beings superior to man who possess this power . In reference to this opinion we would remark , that the nature of every created being is necessarily limited , and dependent . All the power which he possesses , he derives from his Maker . If then created beings possess the power to work miracles , God has endued them with that power . But can we suppose that God has endued creatures with the power of controlling the laws of nature ? The idea is preposterous . The laws of nature are the rules which he has prescribed to himself in governing the world ; and they can not be suspended , or counteracted , except in such instances as he himself has determined . To suppose a creature to possess the power of suspending these laws , is to suppose him to possess the power of thwarting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we consider a moment , the tendency of the doctrine which supposes that created beings may work miracles , we shall see clearly that it can not be true . 1 . It tends to subvert the very foundation of religion . In effect , it denies the idea of a Providence , and robs God of his glory as governor of the world . If created beings may control the laws of nature , in one instance , independently of God ; they may , for aught we can see , in as many instances as they please ; and thus defeat all the purposes of Jehovah . how can it be said that God governs the world , if the scepter may at any moment be wrested from his hands by created beings . And what foundation can there be for confidence in God , if his plans are liable to be thwarted ? How can we know that his promises will be fulfilled , if that chain of events on which their fulfillment must depend , is liable to be broken by the interposition of creatures ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of working miracles only by divine permission ; this is giving up the point that they have in themselves the power of working miracles , and virtually admitting that every miracle implies a divine interposition . It is saying that a miracle is never wrought , except when God chooses it should be wrought , which is the very point for which we are contending . 2 . The doctrine which ascribes to created spirits the power of working miracles , leads to polytheism . The only way in which we can discover by the light of nature , the existence and attributes of God , is by reasoning from his works . But miracles are works of such a character as almost inevitably to impress the mind with the conviction , that they are the works of God . If , therefore , other beings as well as God , be supposed to possess the power of working miracles , it will be natural for mankind , by degrees , to consider them entitled to divine honors . The gross polytheism of the ancients , may perhaps be traced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the spirits of departed men , as possessing power to favor or injure them in a supernatural way ; and hence they were led to regard them as proper objects of worship . It seems to be a natural impression , that a miracle is an effect which nothing short of divine power can produce . Accordingly , the Lycaonians concluded from the miracle wrought by Paul and Barnabas , that the gods had come down to them in the likeness of men , and they began to make preparation to pay them divine honors . The doctrine , therefore , which ascribes to created beings the power of working miracles , leads directly to polytheism. // miraculous works , mankind must necessarily be exposed to great delusion . It is natural , as we have seen , for men to consider miracles as infallible proof of a divine commission , and those by whom they are wrought , as divinely commissioned , and worthy of unlimited confidence . But if miracles may be wrought by evil beings in attestation of falsehood , how can mankind know what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must examine the doctrine taught , and determine from its nature and tendency , whether it is true or false . But the reason of man is imperfect and fallible , to say nothing of his naturally vitiated taste ; and most men probably would be more ready to distrust the dictates of their reason , than to question the divine original of those doctrines which should be attested by miracles . Besides , if miracles may be performed by created beings , and by evil beings as well as good , they can not answer any valuable purpose . The only valuable purpose which we can conceive of their answering , is , to establish the credit of the persons by whom they are wrought , and to attest the truth of the messages which they deliver . But this end they can not answer , if we are to suppose they may be wrought in support of falsehood as well as truth . Suppose two directly opposite systems of religion , both attested by miracles-how could we know which to believe ? Surely that evidence which tends equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no evidence at all . On the supposition , therefore , which we are considering , miracles can be no attestation to the truth of any message , and of course , can answer no valuable purpose whatever . These considerations are deemed sufficient to show that whenever miracles are wrought , they are decisive evidence of divine interposition . That miracles have been wrought , is proved by the most unexceptionable testimony . Those by whom they were wrought , professed to communicate a revelation from heaven . They appealed to the miracles in support of their claims , and the miracles were the broad seal of heaven stamped upon their commission . They were attestations given by God himself , to the truth of the religion which they taught . The miracles of Moses and the prophets , prove the divine origin of the religion of the Old Testament . The miracles of Christ and the apostles , establish the divine authority of the New Testament . We may rest , therefore , with the fullest confidence in the conclusion , that all Scripture is given by inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken of this subject , there are some objections which it may be important to notice . It is said , that there are facts which contradict our conclusion that miracles have been wrought by created beings , and for the support of falsehood as well as truth . This assertion , although it has been repeatedly made , has never been satisfactorily proved , in regard to those miracles which have been supposed to be wrought by evil beings , it has been truly said , " that such of them as are best supported , have been severally weighed in the balance of reason and found wanting . It has been shown that they are destitute of every essential character of truth , and bear all the distinguishing features of human impostures ; that they are trilling , ludicrous , and absurd in their own nature , or destitute of all rational intention , and manifestly calculated to answer sonic low and worldly purpose ; that they are related by incompetent witnesses , against whose skill and integrity there are the strongest exceptions ; and that they never gained credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // 215 stition exposed them to the grossest delusions . " Most of the accounts of pagan and popish miracles , were published long after the facts are said to have taken . place ; and many of them were published in distant countries . They are not the accounts of eyewitnesses , published on the spot , hut the bare records of rumors or reports . This is particularly true of the miracles said to have been wrought by the Emperor Vespasian . The account was published by Tacitus at Rome , of what took place thirty years before at Alexandria , in Egypt . He gives it only as a report , without seeming to credit it himself . Yet Mr. Hume admits , that these are the best attested miracles in all profane history . In regard to pagan and popish miracles , they were not of such a nature , that they might be subjected to rigid scrutiny . " They were not wrought openly before the world , in the presence of enemies as well as friends . They were wrought mostly in the secret recesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness them , but such as were interested in having them believed . They were none of them wrought for the establishment of a new religion  --  a religion opposed to the passions and prejudices of the people ; but they were wrought for the support of the established religion , and were all engrafted upon the superstitious notions and prejudices of the vulgar , who were therefore disposed to receive them . " The evidence in support of pagan and popish miracles , will bear no comparison with the evidence which we have in support of those recorded in the Scriptures . What one of these pretended miracles was ever attested by eye-witnesses , who adhered to their testimony in the face of persecution , and finally sealed it with their blood ? No such instances can be adduced . The best attested pagan and popish miracles , and those which have been selected by the enemies of Christianity to confront the miracles recorded in the Scriptures , are , the cure of a blind , and of a lame man , at Alexandria , by Vespasian , to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendant in a Spanish church , by the Cardinal De Retz  --  and the cures said to be performed at the tomb of the Abbe de Paris . But these , both Dr. Campbell and Dr. Paley , have shown to be destitute of all substantial evidence in their favor , and to bear no comparison with the miracles wrought by Christ and the apostles . But it is said , that the Scriptures themselves represent created beings as possessing and exercising the power of performing miracles ; and that by controverting this doctrine , we are invalidating their authority . This point demands some consideration . We are persuaded that upon careful examination , we shall find , that the Scriptures instead of favoring the doctrine in question , furnish the fullest evidence that none but God , can be the author of miracles . The only rational beings mentioned in the Scriptures , besides the Supreme Being , are men , holy angels , apostate angels , and the spirits of departed men . That angels have not power to work miracles , is evident from their name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , implies a state of dependence . They possess no independent power , but act only by commission from the Supreme Being , whose servants they are . They are ministering spirits , sent forth to do the will , and execute the commands of Jehovah . So far from possessing power to interfere in the government of the world , and to control the laws of nature , they are dependent on God in all their conduct . If then miraculous works are at any time performed by them , they indicate a divine interposition , // 216 Miracles . no less than when they are performed by men . In regard to evil spirits , or apostate angels , if when they were holy , they had not the power of working miracles , can we suppose that they possess this power since they have become sinful . Has their rebellion increased their power ? Or has God in consequence of their apostasy , enlarged their capacities , and given them the power to ohstruct the operations of his government , and to defeat his purposes ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angels which kept not their first estate , hut left their own habitation , he bath reserved in everlasting chains , under darkness , to the judgment of the great day . " Is this consistent with the idea that evil spirits have power to work miracles , at their pleasure ? They are here represented as prisoners in chains ; which clearly implies that they are entirely under the divine control , and can do nothing , any further than they are permitted to do it . Nor do the Scriptures any where contradict this representation . It is no where said in the Bible , that evil spirits have power to foretell future events , or to work miracles . That they have in some way , access to men , and are permitted , hy temptations , to exert an extensive influence over the human race , we are explicitly taught . But still they are prisoners in chains , and can go no further than they are permitted to go . It is certain , therefore , that they can not work miracles , without a divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , it will not he maintained that they possess more power than angels and devils . As to the imaginary gods which are worshiped by the heathen , the Scriptures , instead of allowing them the power of working miracles , uniformly denounce them as vanities and lies . " All the gods of the nations are idols . " " And we know , " says the Apostle , " that an idol is nothing in the world . " And this he says , not only in reference to the mere images of their gods , for the heathen did not regard those images , in themselves , as real gods . They believed them to he representatives , or receptacles of their gods . It was in this view , that they spake of them as gods , and objects of worship ; and it is in reference to the divine powers supposed to reside in the images , that the Scriptures speak of them , and affirm that they are nothing . " Their idols are silver and gold , the work of men 's hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes have they , but they see not ; noses have they , hut they smell not ; they have hands , but they handle not ; feet have they , hut they walk not ; neither speak they through their throat ; they that make them , are like unto them , and so is every one that trusteth in them . " Those who worship them , are represented as altogether brutish and foolish ; as paying their devotions to gods which are totally unable to aid or to bless them . The gods of the heathen are frequently challenged by the prophets of Jehovah , to give evidence of divinity , by revealing secrets , foretelling future events , or performing some miraculous work . " Produce your cause , saith the Lord . Let them show the former things what they be , that we may consider them , and know the latter end of them . Show us the things that are to come hereafter , that we may know that ye are gods ; yea , do good , or do evil , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the prophets of Baal , the controversy was to be decided by a miracle . Baal was challenged to perform a miracle , and by this challenge , God , by his prophet , plainly testified , that a miracle was a sure token of divine power , and that had one been wrought in this case , the divinity of Baal would have been established beyond dispute , and his worshipers justified // in adhering to his service . And when all attempts on the part of Baal 's worshipers to produce a miracle failed , Elijah said , " Lord God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Israel , let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel , and that I am thy servant , and that I have done all these things at thy word . Then the fire of the Lord fell , and consumed the burnt sacrifice , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and licked up the water that was in the trench . And when all the people saw it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord , he is the Godthe Lord , he is the God . " Here the question to be decided was , whether Jehovah or Baal was God . It was to be decided by a miracle , and the performance of a miracle , was deemed conclusive . The magicians , diviners , and sorcerers among the heathen , are uniformly branded , in the Scriptures , as impostors , who were utterly unable to perform any thing supernatural . The prophet Isaiah , after predicting the destruction of Babylon , which was famous for its arts of divination , says , " Stand now with thine enchantments , and with the multitude of thy sorecries , wherein thou hast labored from thy youth ; if so be thou shalt be able to profit ; if so be thou shalt prevail . Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels . Let now the astrologers , the star-gazers , the monthly prognosticators , stand up and save thee from those things that shall come upon thee . " Again , " They prophesy unto thee a false vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their heart . " And again , " ilearkcn not ye to your false prophets , nor to your diviners , nor to your dreamer3 , nor to your enchanters , nor to your sorcerers , for they prophesy a lie unto you . " The magicians are spoken of in the Scriptures as liars , and their arts are styled lying vanities . But several passages of Scripture Xol . II . 28 are adduced to prove , that created beings may work miracles . Of these , the following is one . Deut. 13,1-3 , " If there arise among you a prophet , or a dreamer of dreams , and giveth thee a sign or a wonder , and the sign or wonder come to pass , whereof he spake unto thee , saying , let us go after other gods , which thou hast not known , and let us serve them ; thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet , or that dreamer of dreams ; for the Lord your God proveth you , to know whether ye love the Lord your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul . And that prophet , or that dreamer of dreams , shall be put to death ; because he bath spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt , and redeemed you out of the house of bondage , to thrust thee out of the way which the Lord thy God commanded thee to walk in . " The following words of Christ have also been adduced . Matt. 24 , 24 . " There shall arise false Christs and false prophets , and shall show great signs and wonders , insomuch that if it were possible , they should deceive the very elect . " There is no satisfactory reason to believe that Moses or Christ in these passages , intended to teach that the false prophets and false Christs of whom they spake , would perform real miracles . The object of these warnings , was , to guard those to whom they were addressed , against delusion from impostors , and false pretenders . The meaning of the words of Moses , is happily expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a pagan prophet or diviner should propose some prodigy , or extraordinary appearance* as proof of the interl ) osition of a false god , and an indication of futurity , and that the event should correspond to the prophecy ; do not on this account , hastily conclude that there is any thing supernatural or miraculous in the case , nei // ther expect that the true God should interfere in an extraordinary roanner , at every turn , to prevent such occurrences as these , which he will permit for the trial and discovery of your temper . If doubtful appearances , and lucky conjectures , serve you as a reason to desert his worship , this xviii be a full proof of your being previously disaffected to him ; for ye know how amply he has demonstrated his own divinity and sole dominion over nature , ( so utterly subversive of all the groundless claims of the heathen gods , ) and laid you under the most powerful obligations to his worship and service , by those stupendous and undeniable miracles which accomplished your deliverance from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage is correct , the object of Moses was not to guard the Israelites against putting confidence in the works of magicians and diviners , considered as real miracles ; but to xvarn them against being deceived , and considering those as real miracles , which were only false pretensions . The reason which he assigne ( l , why the Israelites ought to be suspicious of all such pretended miracles , was , that Jehovah had given the fullest evidence that he was God , by the miracles wrought for their deliverance from Egypt , which could not be gainsayed ; and that consequently all pretensions to miraculous powers in support of pagan xvorship , must be false . This passage , therefore , so far from favoring the opinion that real miracles were wrought by the ancient magicians , clearly establishes the doctrine that none but God can work a miracle . With what consistency couid Moses appeal to the miracles which God wrought in delivering the Israelites from bondage , as a reason why they should not go after other gods , if he admitted that miracles were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of his reasoning was this . These diviners and dreamers of dreams will indeed work miracles , as a proof that the deities which they worship , are real gods . But you must not hearken unto them . Why ? because Jchovah hath also wrought miracles , and therefore he is God . This , it xviii be perceived , is placing Jehovah and the gods of the heathen on a level . In regard to the words of Christ which have been quoted , we would observes that he is evidently speaking of impostors , who should make false pretensions to miraculous powers . They would appeal to great signs and wonders , and so great would be their craft and subtilly in carrying on their impostures , that they would deceive many ; and those who should be deceived by them , would he deceived on this ground . They would mistake the tricks of jugglers for real miracles . The prophecy of Paul respecting the man of sin , has also been adduced . 2 Thess. 2 , 9 . " Whose coming is after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lying wonders . " The following also has been considered very decisive . Rev. 13 , 13-14 . " And he doeth great wonders , so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men , and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth , by means of those miracles ( signs , as it might be rendered , ) which he has power to do in the sight of the beast. * , if we are here taught , that the man of sin was to perform real miracles , what are we to understand by the phrase lying wonders ? Does not this language most clearly denote impostures-pretended miracles ? But does riot the apostle John say in the Revelation , that he maketh fire to come down from heaven , and can this imply any thing less than miraculous power ? We reply , the language of the Revelation is much of it symbolical , and is not to be taken literally . What the precisc meaning of this passage is , we // may not , perhaps , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not without reason , that it refers to the anathemas and excomrnunications of the Romish church , styled the thunders of the Vatican , which were shoching imprecations of fire from heaven , and which were thought to expose men to its hottest vengeance ; and which have actually set whole kingdoms in flames . Whether this he the true meaning of the passage or not , it is very certain that it is not to he understood literally . But after all , we are told , that there are instances recorded in the Scriptures , of real miracles , which could not have been wrought by God . The cases particularly insisted on , are the works of the magicians in Egypt , and of the witch of Endor . In regard to the magicians , we would remark , 1 . Magic was an art , studied and practiced , particularly in Egypt and Babylon , as much as the practice of the healing art , or any other profession . By their superior knowledge of the powers of nature , and a peculiar dexterity acquired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , to the common people , were wonderful and unaccountable . Yet they were always conscious of doing nothing supernatural ; and the perfection of their art consisted in being able to deceive with adroitness , and to make appearances pass for realities . In the practice of their profession , they performed all their mysterious works by slight of hand , or by the use of powerful drugs . They are sometimes called magicians , and sometimes sorcerers . The word sorcerers , signifies those who make use of artifice to delude the sight with false appearances ; or it signifies such as practice fascination or charms . Now we have already seen that the Scriptures uniformly speak of all such persons as liars and impostors ; and represent them as being unable to perform any miraculous works ; and they represent their works as frauds , delusions and lying vanities. 2 . In regard to the magicians of Egypt , it is evident from the narrative of Moses , that neither Pharaoh nor the magicians themselves , supposed that any real miracles were wrought . What was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to ascertain whether the gods of the Egyptians were as powerful as the God of the Hebrews ? This does not appear to have been his object . The question with him , was , whether Moses was , as he pretended to be , really commissioned by God to demand the emancipation of the Israelites . He told Moses that he knew not the Lord ; and he probably thought that Moses pretended to act under a divine commission , as an artifice , thinking thereby to persuade him to let the people go . There is no reason to believe that Pharaoh supposed Moses to have any communication with any superior being . He probably regarded what he said , as utterly false . To prove the truth of his pretensions , Moses wrought a miracle . He cast down his rod and it became a serpent . This , however , did not satisfy Pharaoh . He knew that magic was studied as an art in Egypt , and he probably thought that Moses was a magician , and that he was attempting to impose on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real miracle . With these impressions on his mind , he sent for the magicians , wise men and sorcerers , to see whether they could not , in the exercise of their profession , do things similar to what Moses had done . Now it does not appear that Pharaoh expected the magicians to work miracles , or that he requested it of them . The question which he wished to decide , was , whether Mosos had wrought a real miracle or not . He called his magicians to ascertain whether what Moses had done , lay within the compass of their // art . And there is no reason to suppose that the magicians thcmselves , did , in this case , attempt to work a miracle . Their aim , was , to destroy the pretensions of Moses to a divine commission , by showing what they could do . This idea is confirmed by their confession when they found themselves baffled in their attempt to imitate the fourth miracle of Moses . They said , " This is the finger of God ; " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly beyond the power of magic . It is what no being bat God can perform . This confession clearly shows that they did not lay claim to miraculous powers . 3 . There is a marked distinction , in the narrative , between the works of Moses , and those of the magicians . While the former are ascribed to the mighty power of God , the latter are ascribed to enchantments ; that is , to juggling , or secret slight of hand . This is as much as to say , they were not real miracles , but the result of human artifice and imposture . Let it be remembered also , that there is no intimation that evil spirits , or any beings superior to man , had any concern in these events . All that is said , is , that the magicians did so with their encliantments. 4 . The things which the magicians did , were no greater than those which other impostors have done . As to the first , the apparent turning of their rods into serpents , which had the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is said , there are jugglers in China who perform the same , by very artfully substituting serpents in the room of rods . This , probably , is what the magicians did . In regard to the second attempt , it is not at all difficult to account for all which we have any reason to suppose they performed . The quantity of water which they pretended to change into blood , was undoubtedly small , for there was none to be obtained but by digging into the earth . Now there is noth ing incredible in supposing that they might dextrously infuse some drug into a small quantity of water , which would give it the appearance of blood . Nor is this any more than jugglers have repeatedly performed . Their last performance also , in which they attempted to imitate Moses in the prodtiction of frogs , was doubtless effected by slight-ofhand . We are not told how many frogs they produced . The number doubtless was smalL These might have been concealed , and brought into sight in such a manner that the mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magicians did not perform real miracles , is evident from their failure in the fourth attempt . On the supposition that they really possessed miraculous powers , it is impossible to account for this failure . But on the supposition that what they did was all a deception , it is easy to account for it , by supposing that through a closer scrutiny of the spectators , or more carelessness in themselves , their mode of operation was discovered and the fraud detected . These observations are deemed sufficient to show , in what point of light we are to regard those works of the magicians , which have been so often adduced as an absolute refutation of the doctrine which it has been the object of this article to establish . It may perhaps be thought , that what has been said is suited to destroy all belief in miracles , and to give occasion to the infidel to say , that the miracles of Moses , of Christ , and of his apostles , were nothing but the effects of magic . But no candid man can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they can be thus accounted for . Magic never opened a passage through the sea for a host to pass over on dry ground-magic never fed five thousand people on a very small quantity of provisions // - magic never opened the eyes of the blind , unstopped the ears of the deaf , and raised the dead to life . There is another ease much insisted on by those who deny that miracles are decisive proof of divine interposition . It is said that a miracle was wrougbt by the witch of Endor , in calling up Samuel from the dead . The account is given in the twenty eighth chapter of the first book of Samuel . Saul having met with grievous disappointments , was brought into circumstances of great perplexity and distress . In this situation , being rejected by God , and unable to procure from his prophets any knowledge of his own destiny , he had recourse to a woman who had a familiar spirit . This woman was probably a ventriloquist . She professed to be able to call persons from the dead , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the power which it is well known all ventriloquists possess . Such was the person to whom Saul had recourse at Endor . He requested her to bring up Samuel from the dead . Samuel , we are informed , actually appeared , and addressed Saul for a considerable time , in a very serious and solemn manner . XVe shall not undertake to prove that all this was the effect of human artifice . There was undoubtedly a real miracle wrought in this case , but it was not wrought by the woman , or by any evil spirit through her instrumentality ; for it appears from the narrative , that what took place was totally unexpected by the woman , and that she was exceedingly terrified when Samuel appeared . The truth is , that God , for the purpose of reproving Saul for his xvickedness and predicting his speedy death , did perform a real miracle , by causing Samuel to appear and address him . This rniradc , therefore , was as decisive proof of divine interposition , as any miracle whatever . In addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit , we might adduce many passages of Scripture which exhibit the Supreme Being as the sole governor of the world , and which appropriate to him all miraculous works , and urge them as demonstrations of his divinity and sole dominion over nature . But it is time to bring this article to a close . If we mistake not , the objections which have been urged against the doctrine stated in our fourth proposition , have been shown to be without foundation . We may , therefore , consider that doctrine as resting on an immovable basis . The miracles which have been wrought are infallible proof of divine interposition ; and as God would not work a miracle in attestation of falsehood , they conclusively prove that those by whom they have been wrought , were divinely inspired , and that the Bible is the word of God.
