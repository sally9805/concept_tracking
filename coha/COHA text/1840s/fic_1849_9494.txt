Something farther  --  She does not scruple to avow her passion For my most worthy cousin , Norman Maurice . Mrs. J. Mrs. J. She shall repent it  --  she shall disavow it , Or she shall know !  --  I 'll teach her !  --  Warren . Warren . She 's a pupil With will enough of her own to vex a master ! Mrs. J. Mrs. J. I have a will too , which shall master her ! Is she not mine ?  --  my sister 's child ?  --  a beggar , That breathes but by my charity ! I 'll teach her , And she shall learn the lesson set for her , Or I will turn her naked into the streets , As pennyless as she came . But , wait and see ,  --  You shall behold  --  Warren . Warren . Nay , wait till I am gone , Then use your best severity . She needs it  --  Has no sufficient notion of her duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Warren . Warren . But you must make her wiser . Mrs. J. Mrs. J. I will ! I 've treated her too tenderly ! Warren . Warren . But show her Some little glimpse of the danger in her path ,  --  Shame and starvation  --  Mrs. J. Mrs. J. She deserves them both . Warren . Warren . And keep my worthy cousin from her presence . Mrs. J. Mrs. J. He darks these doors no more ! The girl , already , Has orders to deny him . Warren . Warren . You 've done wisely . A little time ,  --  but keep them separate ,  --  And we shall conquer her ;  --  ay , conquer him too , For I 've a little snare within whose meshes His feet are sure to fall . Mrs. J. Mrs. J. What snare ? Warren . Warren . No matter ! Be ignorant of the mischief till it 's over , And we enjoy its fruits ! Meanwhile , be busy ,  --  Pursue the plan you purpose , and to-morrow , We shall know farther . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , in labors which must profit , Or fortune grows perverse . See you to her , While I take care of him . Mrs. J. Mrs. J. Oh , never fear me  --  I 'll summon her the moment you are gone , And she shall know  --  Warren . Warren . That you may summon her  --  For we must lose no time  --  I take my leave . Ex . Warren . Mrs. J. Mrs. J. The pert and insolent baggage ! But I 'll teach her ! I 'll let her know from whose benevolent hand She eats the bread of charity  --  whose mercy It is , that clothes her nakedness with warmth . Rings . Enter Biddy . Go , Biddy !  --  send my niece to me . Ex . Biddy . A beggar , That fain would be a chooser !  --  So , Miss ! Enter Clarice . Clarice . Clarice . Dear Aunt ! Mrs. J. Mrs. J. Ay , you would dare me in another fashion , But you have met your match ; and now I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle  --  Clarice . Clarice . What have I done ? Mrs. J. Mrs. J. Oh ! you are ignorant , And innocent seeming as the babe unborn , If tongue and face could speak for secret conscience , That harbors what it should not . So , you dare Avow a passion for that beggarly Maurice , Whom I 've forbid the house ! Clarice . Clarice . Forbidden Maurice ! Mrs. J. Mrs. J. Ay , indeed ! forbid ! Clarice . Clarice . In what has he offended ? Mrs. J. Mrs. J. His poverty offends me  --  his presumption . Clarice . Clarice . Presumption ! Mrs. J. Mrs. J. He has the audacity to think of you In marriage  --  he would heir my property ;  --  The miserable beggar ! who , but lately  --  Clarice . Clarice . And , if the humble Clarice might presume , There were no fitter husband ! From the Fates I do entreat no happier destiny Than but to share , o'er all that wealth may proffer , The beggary that he brings ! Mrs. J. Mrs. J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the place of mother , And I will turn you naked from these doors If you but dare  --  Clarice . Clarice . Ah ! that were guardianship , Becoming the dear sister of a mother , Who , when she left her hapless child to earth , Ne'er dream 'd of such remembrance , in the future , Of what beseem 'd the past . I 've anger 'd you , But can not chide myself , because my nature Does not revolt at homage of a being In whom no virtue starves . Suppose him poor ! Wealth makes no certain happiness to hope , Nor poverty its loss . In Norman Maurice I see a nobleness that still atones for The lowly fortunes that offend your pride . None richer lives in rarest qualities ,  --  More precious to the soul that feeds on worth , Than all your city glitter . Do you think To win me from a feast of such delights , To the poor fare on common things that make The wealth of Robert Warren ? Madam  --  my aunt ,  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had been precious o'er most earthly things , But that it hath its price , at perilous cost To things more precious still . Your charity , That found a shelter for this humble person , Were all too costly , if it claims in turn This poor heart 's sacrifice . I can not make it ! I will not wed this Warren ,  --  for I know him  --  And , if it be that I shall ever wed , Will wed with Norman Maurice  --  as a man , Whom most it glads me that I also know . Mrs. J. Mrs. J. Never shall you wed with him while I have power To keep you from such folly . You 're an infant , That knows not what is needful for your safety , Or precious for your heart . Be ruled by me , Or forth you pack . I cut you off forever , From fortune as from favor . Clarice . Clarice . Welcome death , Sooner than bonds like these ! Mrs. J. Mrs. J. Ungrateful girl ! And this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve your own destruction , If I can help it . This Maurice never darkens My dwelling with his shadow . He hath made you Perverse and disobedient  --  but he shall not Thrive by your ruin . See that you prepare To marry Robert Warren . Clarice . Clarice . With the grave first !  --  Its cold and silence , and its crawling things , Loathsome , that make us shudder but to think on , Sooner than he !  --  a base , unworthy creature , Who steals between his kinsman and the friend , That gave him highest trust and held him faithful , To rob him of the treasure he most values . The reptile that keeps empire in the grave Sooner than he , shall glide into this bosom , And make it all his own . Mrs. J. Mrs. J. Silence , I say !  --  Before I madden with your insolence , And lose the memory of that sainted sister That left you in my trust . Clarice . Clarice . My poor , dear mother ! She never dream 'd of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ! Mrs. J. Mrs. J. I 'm in her place , To sway your foolish fancies with a prudence You will not know yourself . Once more I tell you , You wed with Warren  --  Robert Warren , only ! This Maurice  --  noise without Ha ! That noise ?  --  Maurice . Maurice . I must , my girl ! Clarice . Clarice . ' T is Maurice now . Mrs. J. Mrs. J. The insolent ! will he dare ! Biddy . Biddy. entering . Mrs. Jervas says , sir  --  Maurice . Maurice . Ay ! ay ! she says !  --  But when a lady means civilities , ' T is still my custom to do justice to her , By seeking them in person . There , my girl , You 've done your duty as you should . Now , please you , I will do mine . Entering the room . Madam  --  Mrs. J. Mrs. J. Was ever insolence  --  Biddy . Biddy. entering . Mr. Maurice would , ma'am . Mrs. J. Mrs. J. This conduct , sir  --  Maurice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons ,  --  And he whose purpose was a morning visit , The simply social object of the idler , Who finds in his own time and company The very worst offence , could offer nothing , To plead for his intrusion on that presence , Which , so politely , shuts the door against him . Mrs. J. Mrs. J. Well , sir ? Maurice . Maurice . But I am none of these . Mrs. J. Mrs. J. What plea , sir ?  --  Maurice . Maurice . Some natures have their privilege  --  some passions Demand a hearing . There are rights of feeling , That art can never stifle  --  griefs , affections , That never hear the civil " Not at home ! " When home itself is perill 'd by submission . He 's but a haggard that obeys the check , When all that 's precious to his stake of life Is fasten 'd on the string . Necessity Makes bold to ope the door which fashion 's portress Would bolt and bar against him . ' T is my fate , That prompts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have shrunk from . But that I have rights Which move me to defiance of all custom , I had not vex 'd your presence . Mrs. J. Mrs. J. Rights , sir  --  rights ? Maurice . Maurice . Ay , madam , the most precious to the mortal ! Rights of the heart , which make the heart immortal In those affections which still show to earth , The only glimpses we have left of Eden . Behold in her , pointing to Clarice , my best apology  --  One , whom to gaze on silences complaint , And justifies the audacity that proves Its manhood in its error . Clarice , my love , Is there from any corner of your heart An echo to the will that says to Maurice , Your presence here is hateful ? Takes her hand . Clarice . Clarice . Can you ask ? Maurice . Maurice . Enough !  --  Mrs. J. Mrs. J. Too much , I say . Let go her hand , And leave this dwelling , sir ! I 'm mistress here ; And shall take measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Awhile ! awhile ! You are the mistress here ;  --  I will obey you ;  --  Will leave your presence , madam , never more To trouble you with mine . You now deny me The privilege , that never act of mine Hath properly made forfeit . You behold me The suitor to your niece . You hear her language ,  --  How different from your own  --  that , with its bounty Makes rich my heart with all the gifts in hers ! Sternly , you wrest authority from judgment , To exercise a will that puts to scorn Her hopes no less than mine ! I would have pleaded Your calm return to judgment ;  --  would entreat you To thoughts of better favor , that might sanction , With the sweet blessing of maternal love , The mutual passion living in our hearts ; But that I know how profitless the pleading , Which , in the ear of prejudice , would soften The incorrigible wax that deafens pride . I plead not for indulgence  --  will not argue The cruelty that finds in charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break the orphan 's heart Because it finds her bread . Clarice , Clarice , eagerly . Spare her , Norman . Maurice , Maurice , without . Oh ! will I not ! Yet wherefore need I spare , When , if the Holy Law be not a mock , The justice which must break this heart of stone , Will send her howling through eternity . ' T were mercy , which in season speaks the truth , That , in the foretaste of sure penalties , May terrify the offender from his path , And send him to his knees . Clarice , Clarice , eagerly . For my sake , Norman . Maurice , Maurice , without . Yet , madam , in this freest use of power , Which drives me hence , be merciful awhile , And , if this heart , so dearly link 'd with mine , Through love and faith unperishing , must turn Its fountains from that precious overflow That kept my flowers in bloom  --  yet , ere the word , That leaves me sterile ever thence , be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parting ! Words of such import still ask fewest ears , And words of grief and hopelessness like ours , Must needs have utterance in such lowly tones , As best declare the condition of the heart , That 's muffled for despair . But a few moments We 'll walk apart together . Mrs. J. Mrs. J. It is useless ! What needs  --  Maurice . Maurice . What need of sorrow ever ! Could earth speak , Prescribing laws to that Divinity , That still smites rock to water , we should hear , The universal voice of that one plea , That claims for man immunity from troubles Which make proud eyes o'erflow . Who should persuade His fellow to opinion of the uses That follow from his tears ? What school , or teacher , Would seek to show that chemistry had art , To fix and harden the dilating drops To brilliants as they fall ,  --  such as no crown In Europe might affect ? One finds no succor , Sovereign to break the chain about his wrist , From all the fountains that o'ersluice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He who stands , Waiting upon the scaffold for the signal , That flings him down the abyss , still hoards each minute That niggard fate allows . That single minute Still shrines a hope ;  --  if not a hope , a feeling , That finds a something precious even in pain , And will not lose the anxiety that racks him , Lest he make forfeit of a something better Which yet he can not name . And , at the last , I , whom you doom to loss of more than life , May well implore the respite of a moment , If but to suffer me to count once more , The treasure that I lose . A moment , madam ? Mrs. J. Mrs. J. A single moment , then . Maurice . Maurice . Oh ! you are gracious ! A single moment is a boundless blessing To him you rob of time ! Clarice , my love . Clarice . Clarice . My Norman ! Maurice . Maurice . Oh ! is it thus , my Clarice  --  is it thus ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in our dreams We are the sport of fate ! Maurice . Maurice . And shall be ever , If that there be no courage in our hearts To shape the fates to favor by our will . Clarice . Clarice . What mean you , Norman Maurice . Maurice . What should Norman mean , But , if he can , to grapple with his fortune , And , like a sturdy wrestler in the ring , Throw heart and hope into the perilous struggle ? What should I mean but happiness for thee ,  --  Thou willing , as myself ? Who strives with fate , Must still , like him , the mighty Macedonian , Seize the coy priestess by the wrist , and lead her Where yet she would not go ! Suppose me faithful To the sweet passion I have tender 'd you , And what remains in this necessity , But that , made resolute by grim denial , I challenge from your love sufficient courage , To take the risks of mine ! Clarice . Clarice . Within your eye A meaning more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremble . That I love you , You doubt not , Norman ! That my heart hath courage To match the love it feels for you  --  Maurice . Maurice . It hath  --  it hath ! If that the love be there , as I believe it , That love will bring , to nourish needful strength , A virtue that makes love a thing of soul , And arms its will with wings . Oh ! read you not , My meaning  --  Mrs. J. Mrs. J. Your moment is a long one , sir . Maurice . Maurice . Ah , madam ! Who chides the executioner when he suffers The victim his last words  --  though still he lingers Ere he would reach the last ? But a few moments , And I have spoken all that my full heart Might not contain with safety . Mrs. J. Mrs. J. Be it so , sir . Maurice . Maurice . You hear , my Clarice . We 've another moment : But one , it seems , unless your resolution Takes its complexion from the fate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in truth , You love me  --  Clarice . Clarice . Oh ! look not thus ! Maurice . Maurice . I doubt not ;  --  And yet , dear Clarice , if indeed you love me , The single moment that this woman gives us , Becomes a life ;  --  to me , of happiness ,  --  To thee , as full of happiness as thou Might hope to gain from me . She would deny us ,  --  Would wed thee to that subtle Robert Warren  --  Clarice . Clarice . I 'll perish first ! Maurice . Maurice . No need of perishing When I can bring thee to security . I knew thy straits  --  the tyranny which thou suffer'st Because of thy dependence ; and my struggle , Since this conviction reached me  --  day and night  --  Was , that I might from this condition snatch thee , And , in thy happier fortunes , find mine own ! I have prepared for this . Clarice . Clarice . What would'st thou , Norman ! Mrs. J. Mrs. J. Your moments fly . Maurice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Mrs. J. The sooner , sir , the better . Maurice . Maurice . She would spare me , The argument which shows thee what is needful . Clarice . Clarice . Speak ! I have courage equal to my love ! Maurice . Maurice . I try thee though I doubt not ! If thou lov'st me Thou'lt yield , without a question , to my purpose , And give me all thy trust . Clarice . Clarice . Will I not , Norman ? Maurice . Maurice . Then , with the night , I make thee mine , Clarice ! Steal forth at evening . There shall be a carriage , And my good hostess , whom thou know'st , in waiting . Our future home is ready . Clarice . Clarice . Let me think , Norman . Maurice . Maurice . That 's as your excellent aunt , who now approaches May please :  --  but , surely , when to my fond pleading You sweetly vow 'd yourself as mine alone , The proper thought that sanctions my entreaty Was all complete and perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How should I , in your poverty , encumber Your cares with a new burden ? Maurice . Maurice . There is no poverty , Which the true courage , and the bold endeavor , The honest purpose , the enduring heart , Crowned with a love that blesses while it burdens , May not defy in such a land as ours ! We 'll have but few wants having one another !  --  And for these wants , some dawning smiles of fortune Already have prepared me . Trust me , Clarice , I will not take thee to a worse condition , In one whose charities shall never peril The affections they should foster . Mrs. J. Mrs. J. Sir ,  --  again ! Maurice . Maurice . Yes , yes  --  most excellent madam  --  yes  --  again ! There 's but a single syllable between us , Your niece hath left unspoken .  --  My Clarice ! Clarice . Clarice . I 'm thine ! Maurice . Maurice . ' T is spoken ! And now I live again ! Mrs. J. Mrs. J. Well , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Done ! Ay , madam  --  done ! You 've held me narrowly to a strict account  --  And yet , I thank you . You 've been merciful After a fashion which invokes no justice , And yet may find it , madam . Yet  --  I thank you ! The word is said that 's needful to our parting ; And that I do not in despair depart , Is due to these last moments . Fare you well ! Be you as safe , henceforth , from all intrusion , As you shall be from mine . Clarice  --  farewell ! Clarice . Clarice . Norman . Maurice . Maurice . But one embrace ! Mrs. J. Mrs. J. Away , sir . Maurice . Maurice . In earnest of those pleasant bonds hereafter , That none shall dare gainsay . Clarice  --  Remember ! Exit Maurice . Clarice . Clarice . Go , Norman , and believe me . Mrs. J. Mrs. J. Get you in ! Exeunt . SCENE II . A Lawyer 's office in Philadelphia . Richard Osborne at a desk writing . Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hast drawn the paper , Osborne ? Osborne . Osborne . It is here . Warren . Warren . The copy this ?  --  Osborne . Osborne . And this the original . Warren , Warren , within the wood . ' T is very like ! You 've done it famously : One knows not which is which ; and Norman Maurice , Himself , would struggle vainly to discover The difference ' twixt the words himself hath written , And these your skill hath copied to a hair . We shall deceive him . Osborne . Osborne . Why would you deceive him ? Warren . Warren . Eh ! Why ? It is my instinct ! Are you answer 'd ? I hate him ! Would you have a better answer ? Osborne . Osborne . Why hate him when his kindness still have served you ? This very obligation which hath bound him , And given us cruel power o'er his fortunes ,  --  His purse  --  perhaps his honor  --  Warren . Warren . Why , perhaps ? Is it doubtful , think you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgrace him ? Osborne . Osborne . An error only ,  --  The thoughtless sport of boyhood  --  wholly guiltless Of all dishonest purpose . We have used it ,  --  You rather  --  and the profit has been ours !  --  Why , if he pays the money as he proffers , Why treasure still this paper ? More  --  why hate him ? Warren . Warren . Let it suffice you that I have my reasons !  --  And let me tell you , Osborne , that I love not This sympathy which you show for Norman Maurice . Beware ! who goes not with me is against me ! Osborne . Osborne . I 'm in your power , I know  --  Warren . Warren . Then let your wisdom Abate its fond pretension as my teacher ! I 'm better pleased with service than tuition ; Will hold you as my ally , not my master ! I have remarked , of late , that you discover Rare virtues in my cousin ! He hath fee 'd you ; Employed you as attorney in his cases  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warren . Warren . No matter ! It is enough that you are mine ! Osborne . Osborne . This jealousy  --  Warren . Warren . Is only vigilance ! Each look of favor , Bestow 'd on him I loathe , is disaffection In him that 's bound to me . Osborne . Osborne . This document ?  --  Warren . Warren . The real one ,  --  the original  --  is mine ; The copy you will yield him when he pays you ;  --  That he will do so , now , I make no question , Though where his money comes from is my wonder . Osborne . Osborne . The case of Jones &; Peters , just determined , Brings him large fees . Another action , The insurance case of Ferguson &; Brooks , Secures him handsome profits . Other cases , Have lately brought him , with new reputation , Liberal returns of money . Warren . Warren . We 'll have all ! See that you pile the costs  --  crowd interest  --  Expense of service ; tax to the uttermost The value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done without full charges , While , what has been forborne , more highly rated , Shall sweep the remaining eagles from his purse . Osborne . Osborne . What bitterness is yours ! Warren . Warren . Oh ! quite ungracious , Contrasted with the sweetness of your moods ! Once more , beware ! Do as I bid you , Osborne , Or you shall feel me . Yield him up this copy , Which we shall see him , with delirious rapture , Thrust in the blazing furnace ,  --  little dreaming , That still the damning scrawl that blasts his honor , Lies here , in the possession of his foe ! Osborne . Osborne . Will nothing move you , Warren ? Warren . Warren . His funeral only ,  --  To follow  --  while above his burial place , I show this fatal paper ,  --  still lamenting That one with so much talent should have falter 'd , When virtue cried " Be firm ! "  --  Oh ! I will sorrow , So deeply o'er his sad infirmity , That they who come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in scorn . But , get you ready ;  --  You 'll sup with me ; and afterwards we 'll seek him . We must look smiling then as summer flowers , Nor show the serpent crouching in the leaves . Exeunt . SCENE III . Evening : Chestnut-street . Enter Maurice with Clarice . Maurice . Maurice . Thou'rt mine , my Clarice . Clarice . Clarice . Wholly thine , my husband . Maurice . Maurice . Now let the furies clamor as they may , That the capricious fortune which had mock 'd Our blessings with denial , has been baffled By the true nobleness of that human will , Which , when the grim necessity looks worst , Can fearlessly resolve to brave its fate . Thou'rt mine , and all grows suppliant in my path That lately looked defiance . We are one !  --  This is our dwelling , Clarice :  --  let us in . They enter the house of Maurice . SCENE IV .

' T is certainly a change From his old lodging-house in Cedar-street . Warren . Warren . His run of luck hath crazed him , and he fancies The world is in his string . Osborne . Osborne . He 's not far wrong ! His arguments have made a great impression ; Their subtlety and closeness , and the power Of clear and forcible development , Which seems most native to his faculty ! He was born an orator ! With such a person  --  A voice to glide from thunder into music , A form and face so full of majesty , Yet , with such frankness and simplicity ,  --  So much to please , and so commanding  --  Warren . Warren . Pshaw !  --  You prate as do the newspapers , with a jargon Of wretched common-place , bestuffed with phrases , That , weighed against the ballad of an idiot , Would show less burden and significance . We 'll spoil his fortune  --  Osborne . Osborne . Hark ! He comes . Warren . Warren . Be firm now ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Osborne . Osborne . You still persist , then ? Warren . Warren . Ay ! when I have him here . touching his breast . Enter Norman Maurice . Maurice . Maurice . Be seated , sirs . You bring with you the paper ? To Osborne . Osborne . Osborne . It is here , sir . Giving copy of document . And here the separate claim  --  the costs and charges . Maurice . Maurice . ' T is well ! This first !  --  I pay this money , sir , In liquidation of this wretched paper , To which my hand appears , and , for which writing , The world , unconscious of the facts , might hold me A most unhappy criminal . Your knowledge Includes this person 's agency  --  my cousin  --  As still , in moments of insidious fondness , It is his wont to call me . Warren . Warren . Norman , nay ! Maurice , Maurice , without . Awhile , awhile , sir ! we shall deal directly !  --  I said to Osborne , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Warren , Which does not here appear . He made that guilty Which in itself was innocent . These moneys , Procured by him upon this document , Were all by him consumed . You were his agent , Perhaps as ignorant of his vicious deed , As I , who am its victim . Was it so , sir ? Osborne . Osborne . I sold for him the bill , sir , knowing nothing , And still believed it genuine . Maurice . Maurice . He will tell you , That , what I utter of his agency , In this insane and inconsiderate act , Is true as Holy Writ ! Speak , Robert Warren ! Warren . Warren . I have admitted it already , Norman . Maurice . Maurice . Be you the witness of his words hereafter . Here is your money ,  --  and I take this paper , The proof of boyish error and misfortune , But not of crime , in me . Thus , let it perish , With that confiding and believing nature , Which gave me to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , and placing his foot on it while it burns . Warren . Warren . Norman ! Cousin ! Maurice . Maurice . You cozen me no more ! And if your agent has the wit to gather A lesson from your faithlessness to me , You will not cozen him . Take counsel , sir , And never trust this man ! To Osborne . Warren . Warren . Norman Maurice ! Maurice . Maurice . Our business ends ! Will it please you , leave us now ! Exit Osborne : Warren is about to follow when Maurice lays his hand on his shoulder . Maurice . Maurice . Stay you ! There must be other words before we part , Not many , but most needful . Warren . Warren . Let me pray you , To fashion them in less offensive spirit . Maurice . Maurice . Why , so I should , could I suppose one virtue , A life to leaven a dense mass of vices , Remain 'd within your bosom . You shall listen Though every syllable should be a sting ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , If , as I brand thy baseness on thy forehead , Thy heart , with courage born of just resentment , Should move thee to defiance ! It would glad me , In sudden strife , to put a proper finish To thy deep , secret , foul , hostility . Warren . Warren . You have no reason for this cruel language . Maurice . Maurice . Look on me as thou say'st the monstrous falsehood ; But lift thine eye to mine  --  and , if thy glance Can brazen out the loathing in mine own , I will forgive thee all ! Thou dar'st not do it ! No reason , say'st thou ?  --  Thou , whose arrant cunning , Hath taken the profits of three toilsome years To pay thy wage of sin ,  --  and smutch 'd my garments , That else had known no stain ! Warren . Warren . Have I not Confess 'd that wrong and folly ?  --  Maurice . Maurice . Wert repentant , When making thy confession  --  Warren . Warren . So I am ! Maurice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confession But followed on detection ! While thou mad'st it , The busy devil , dwelling in thy heart , Was framing other schemes of crime and hatred , Outbraving all the past . Ev'n while my pity Was taking thee to mercy , thou wast planning New evil to my fortunes ! Warren . Warren . Never , Norman ! By heaven ! you do me wrong . Maurice . Maurice . Pure Innocent , The very angels look on thee with sorrow , To see such virtue suffer such injustice !  --  But hearken , while I paint another picture : The fiends exulting in thy ready service , A voluntary minister of evil , As , with a spirit born of hell and hatred , Thou pluck'st the flower of hope from happiness , To plant the thorn instead . Warren . Warren . What crime is this ? Maurice . Maurice . I heard thy plea for mercy ! I believed thee , And , as thou wert the child of that dear woman Who called my mother , sister , I forgave thee , Most glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad error . So , I took thee , Once more , to confidence  --  my bosom open 'd , And show 'd thee , shrined within its holiest chamber , The image of the being that I loved !  --  I led thee to her  --  taught her to behold thee , My friend and kinsman ; and , misdoubting never , Still saw thee bend thy footsteps to her dwelling , Nor dream 'd that to the flowers that made my Eden , Myself had brought the serpent ! Warren . Warren . What means this ? Maurice . Maurice . What ! Thou know'st nothing ? Thou hast no conjecture Of what the serpent sought within the garden ! Why , man , he whispered in Eve 's innocent ears , The oiliest nothings ,  --  mingled with such slander Of him who sought to make himself her Adam , That  --  Warren . Warren . ' T is false !  --  I swear ! I never did this mischief ! Maurice . Maurice . Liar ! The oath thou tak'st is thy perdition ! Behold the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and truth ! Clarice ! Come forth ! My wife , sir ! Enter Clarice from within . Warren . Warren . Damnation ! Warren rushes out . Maurice . Maurice . Thus fled the fiend , touch 'd by Ithuriel 's spear , Even from the reptile rising to the fiend , And speeding from the Eden that his presence Shall never trouble more . Henceforth , dear wife , Our paradise shall still be free from taint ; A realm of sweetness unobscured by shadow , And freshening still with flow'rs that take their beauty , As favor 'd still by thine . From this blest moment , Our peace shall be secure ! Clarice . Clarice . And yet I fear , This bold , bad man . Maurice . Maurice . Bad , but not bold ! Fear nothing ! I 've pluck 'd his sting ! Thou know'st the cruel story ; I told thee all ,  --  suppressed no syllable  --  Of his perversion of a simple paper , Wherein , in vain display of penmanship , I gave him power for practice which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embers , The fatal proof lies buried .

Here , it may be , That , after weary toil , and matchless struggle , When strength subsides in age , they will acknowledge , That I am worthy of my bread ,  --  may bid me , Look up and be an alderman or mayor !  --  And this were of their favor .

Maurice . Maurice . Means ! I have manhood ! Youth , strength , and men say , intellect  --  Clarice . Clarice . You have ! You have ! Maurice . Maurice . A heart at ease , secure in its affections And still the soul to seek each manly struggle ! Wide is the world before me  --  a great people , Spread o'er a realm , along whose verdant meadows The sun can never set . I know this people  --  Love them  --  would make them mine !

They lack all faith In him who scorns to flatter their delusions , And lie them to self-worship . In the West , There is a simpler and a hardier nature , That proves men 's values , not by wealth and title , But mind and manhood . There , no ancient stocks , Claim power from precedence .

Ambition slumbers Nor makes me once forgetful of the rapture , That follows your embrace . Knock without . Clarice . Clarice . The widow Pressley . Maurice . Maurice .

Need not be powerful here . Widow . Widow . You know it not ;  --  His wealth , his violence  --  Maurice . Maurice . Will scarce prevail . Widow . Widow . He buys or bullies justice at his pleasure ; No lawyer here would undertake my case Lest he should lose a friend or make a foe ; And thus , for fifteen years  --  Maurice . Maurice . He buys not me , And scarce will profit by an insolence , That hopes to bully here . Widow . Widow . Oh ! sir , I tremble , And can not help but doubt .

The widow and the orphan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfish man ; And this success you promise  --  Maurice . Maurice . None may take The sovereign accent from the lip of Fate And say  --  this thing is written certainly  --  But , if I err not , madam , better promise , Of the clear dawn and the unclouded sunshine , Ne'er waited on the night . I trust the Jury . They have no fears to nurse , and seek no favors , As do that class of men , the mean ambitious , Who , for the lowly greed of appetite , Or hungering for a state they never merit , Cringe with a servile zeal to wealth and numbers , And nothing show but baseness when they rise . My faith is in the people . Widow . Widow . Mine in you , sir . Maurice . Maurice . I will deserve your confidence . This person , Who robb 'd you of your fortune , would but vainly Attempt to bully me . I am no bully , But something have I in my soul which strengthens Its courage , when the insolent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard . Be hopeful , madam .

Maurice . Your name is Kate , they tell me  --  a sweet name ! You 'll pray for us to-night , Kate . With the morrow , If my heart 's hope do not deceive my heart , Your prayers shall all be answer'd.  --  I 'll think of her , And of her sweet and innocent face to-morrow , When striving with her enemy .

Exeunt widow and child . We must gain it . The proofs are clear  --  I can not doubt the issue ,  --  And still a prescient something at my heart , Awakes its triumph with assuring accents That never spoke in vain . But , who are these ? Enter Col. Mercer and Brooks . Welcome , gentlemen . Mercer . Mercer . We trust , sir , that you see in us your friends . Maurice . Maurice . Such , since our brief acquaintance , you have seemed , sir , And mine 's a heart preferring to confide ; That still would rather suffer wrong of faith , Than not believe in man . Mercer . Mercer .

Maurice . Maurice . Peril , sir ? Brooks . Brooks . You have brought action for the widow Pressley , For the recovery of a large possession , Withheld by Colonel Blasinghame  --  Maurice . Maurice . ' T is true , sir , Mercer . Mercer . You do not know this man . Maurice . Maurice . I 've heard of him . Mercer . Mercer . But not that he is one whom men find prudent To pass with civil aspect , nor confront With wrath or opposition . He has power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Has wealth in great abundance  --  is a person , Most fearless and most desperate in battle , Who better loves the conflict with his fellow Than any gifts that peaceful life can bring ; Endow 'd with giant strength and resolution , And such a shot , from five to fifteen paces , As still to shatter , wavering in the wind , The slenderest wand of willow . Maurice . Maurice . Famous shooting ! Brooks . Brooks . It were not wise to wake his enmity ! We look to you to serve our cause in Congress  --  Make him your foe , and he opposes you ; His wealth  --  his popularity  --  the terrors , His very name provokes ,  --  all leagued against you  --  You still a stranger .

No man shall drive me from society !  --  I take the laws I find of force , and use them , For my protection and defence , as others Employ them for assault . Mercer . Mercer . You 've practised then ? Maurice . Maurice . Never shot pistol . Brooks . Brooks . Nor rifle ? Maurice . Maurice . Scarcely ! Mercer . Mercer . You are very rash , sir ! Maurice . Maurice . Ay ! but rashness , sir , Becomes a virtue in a case like this ; And the brave heart , untaught in human practice , Finds good assurance from another source That prompts its action right .

Warren . We 're on the track at last , Look at that letter ; It comes from our old comrade , Harry Matthews , And tells us miracles of Norman Maurice !  --  Our worthy cousin has the run of fortune ;  --  She seems to crown him with her richest favors , As some old bawd , grown hackney 'd in the market , Adopts a virgin passion in her dotage , And yields to her late folly , all the profits That follow 'd the old vice . He 's growing finely ; But I shall dock his feathers . Osborne . Osborne . In Missouri . Warren . Warren . Ay , in St. Louis , that great western city , Our worthy cousin , Norman , has grown famous ! You read what Matthews writes . In one short twelvemonth He springs above all shoulders . Osborne .

You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will I not then ? If ever useful , now 's the right time for it ! See you not that he rises like an eagle , Already is in practice with the ablest , Wins popular favor without working for it , And stands i ' the way of better politicians ? They fit his name to music for bad singers , To whom none listen save at suffrage time .  --  We 'll spoil the song for him . Osborne . Osborne . What would you do ? Warren . Warren . You are dull , Dick Osborne ! Have I yet to tell you That , over all , conspicuous in my hate , This minion of Fortune stands . His better luck Hath robb 'd me of the prize which most I treasured  --  His better genius trampled mine to dust ,  --  Humbled my pride when at its height , and crush 'd me , Until I learn 'd to loathe myself , as being So feeble in his grasp .

You 'll make him desperate ! Warren . Warren . I hope so ! Osborne . Osborne . It brings its perils with it ! Norman Maurice Will rend his hunter !  --  Warren . Warren . If he be not wary ! But , fear you nothing . You shall go with me , And see how deftly , with what happy art , I shall prepare the meshes for my captive . Osborne . Osborne . Me ! go with you ?  --  and wherefore ?

You love me , Osborne ,  --  Will do the thing that I regard as needful , The more especially as you have secrets , No less than Norman Maurice . We shall go , Together , as I fancy , to St. Louis ! Osborne . Osborne . This is mere tyranny , Warren . Warren . Warren . Very like it ! Guilt ever finds its tyrant in its secret , And , twinn 'd with every crime , the accuser stands , Its own grim shadow , with the scourge and torture . Osborne . Osborne .

Get you ready , And hush all vain excuses . If my sway Be somewhat tyrannous , still it hath its profits :  --  Be you but true , and from the Egyptian spoil , There shall be still sufficient for your toil . Exit Warren . Osborne . Osborne .

You will go ,  --  Her only kinswoman  --  to seek her out . You have but her in the world ! Say you have err 'd ; It was because you loved her that you strove , ' Gainst one , who , whatsoe'er his worth and talent , Was not o'erbless 'd by Fortune !

Should you discover That he who , in their presence , stands before you , Is other than he seems , you will know nothing ; Since that may spoil your game as well as mine . Mrs. J. Mrs. J. You are a deep one ! Warren . Warren . When I have your counsel ! This Maurice thought but humbly of your judgment . He knew you not as I do . He was blinded By his own proud conceit and arrogance , And held himself an oracle . ' T were wise If still you suffer 'd him to fancy thus  --  Check 'd him in nothing  --  never counsell 'd him  --  For still I know he holds your wisdom cheaply , And scorns the experience which might rise against His own assured opinion . Such a person Needs but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it ! Warren . Warren . I 'll seek your counsel soon , and you shall teach me What is our proper action .

No mortal foe has ever from my lips , Sleeping or waking , forced acknowledgment , That humbles me like this  --  Clarice . Clarice . What dost thou mean ? What fear ? Maurice . Maurice . What answer shall I make to thee ?  --  How tell thee , my Clarice , ' t was a mere dream , That filled me with that agonizing fear , Whose shriek thou heard'st . Yet , such a dream , my wife , As still pursues me with its hideous forms , And shakes me yet with terror . That a man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should , in a mere disorder of his blood , In midnight sleep , feel all his soul unsinew 'd , And sink into the coward ! Clarice . Clarice . Thou art none ! Maurice .

Clarice . There is nothing , husband  --  The hearth holds only the small jar of flowers . Maurice . Maurice . The reptile ever seeks such crouching place , And garbs his spotty hide with heedless blossoms , That know not what they harbor . Fling it hence ! ' T was on the hearth it crouch 'd . But , hear me , wife ; That dream ! ' T was of a serpent on our hearth , Thou heedless , with thy hand upon the flowers , Disposing them for show .

Heedless of every sting , I trampled it ; But , even as it writhed beneath my heel , Methought , it lifted up a human face That look 'd like Robert Warren ! Clarice . Clarice . What a dream ! Maurice . Maurice . I can not shake it off . Did'st hear a sound Most like a hiss ? Clarice . Clarice . Nay , nay ! ' t was but a dream ! Come  --  come to bed . Maurice . Maurice . Why should I dream of him ? Clarice . Clarice . You think of him , perchance . Maurice . Maurice . And , as a reptile !

I have thee at my lips , I strain thee to my bosom with a joy That leaves no rapture wanting  --  yet , methinks , I hear a sound of hissing , and still see Glimpses of folding serpents that , behind , Crawl after us  --  Clarice . Clarice . My Norman ! Maurice . Maurice . I grieve thee ! I will forget this vision in the blessing This grasp makes real to rapture . Let us in .

A goodly cottage  --  he 's a man of taste , Not yet too old for sentiment , it seems ; Loves flowers and shade trees , and around his porches I fancy that we see some gadding tendrils , That wanton , with full censers , in his homage ! He should be happy there ! Matthews . Matthews . Why , so he is . Warren . Warren . You think so ? Matthews . Matthews . There 's every thing to make him so . He 's young  --  Is on the road to fortune and to fame , And has a handsome wife . Warren . Warren . The landscape 's fair ,  --  Looks bright beneath the sunshine and exhales A thousand delicate odors rich in life ; But , sometimes , there 's a tempest in the night , And where 's your landscape then ? Matthews . Matthews . Be this his case , It shall not cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coil it makes . This man 's our foe ,  --  Goes with our enemies in politics , And will , though now he knows it not himself , Be run , against our crack man , for the Senate . Warren . Warren . Who 's he ? Matthews . Matthews . Ben Ferguson . Warren . Warren . Plain Ben ? Matthews . Matthews . Colonel Ben ! ' T is only when the man 's a favorite , We take the formal handle from his name And sing it short for sweetness . Warren . Warren . Is he able ? Matthews . Matthews . We thought him so till this your Maurice came ;  --  Since then our favorite loses in the race . Ben is a lawyer in first practice here And had the field to himself since I have known him , Till now  --  Osborne . Osborne . Maurice and he have grappled then ? Matthews . Matthews .

At public meetings They were in opposite ranks , and , with each issue , Maurice hath risen still in popular favor , While Ferguson declines . It will rejoice us , If , as you say , you have some history To floor this powerful foe ! Warren . Warren . You need not doubt it . But who are friends to Maurice , here ,  --  the people ? Matthews . Matthews . Were it the people only , it were nothing . They have not yet arisen to self-esteem , And , kept full fed on vanity , are heedless , Hugging their shadows , how they lose the substance . Here , all their sympathies are held by others ; Men of much wealth and some ability , Who , gladly , in this Maurice find an ally , And join with him to use him . There 's a party Who long have lacked a leader . Norman Maurice Brings them the head they seek . He guides their councils , And , with such prudent skill and policy , That still they fancy he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath of life to them . I know that they will run him for the Senate . Warren . Warren . Can they elect him ? Matthews . Matthews . It is somewhat doubtful . They never yet succeeded with their man , Not having had the man to make success . What they can do for him is not the question , So much as what he may achieve for them . I tell you , though not fearful for the issue , It makes us something anxious . Now ,  --  this secret  --  If it be true , indeed , that ,  --  Warren . Warren . Be you ready ;  --  I 'll see your friends to-morrow . We 'll sleep on it . To-night , I 'll fathom Maurice if I can , And see how he enjoys his Western life . Enough ! I have him in my power ! To-morrow !  --  Matthews . Matthews . But what 's the secret ? Warren . Warren . It will keep till then . Be sure , that when your game is to be play 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Waits but the will to rise up Senator  --  A single word shall damn him down to ruin , And stifle every voice that shouts his name . Osborne . Osborne . Yet , once more , Warren , ere it be too late , Let me entreat and counsel  --  Warren . Warren . You are doting ! Go you with Matthews , and , should I be missing , You both can tell whither my steps were bent , And what my power upon him . Osborne . Osborne . Why incur This danger ,  --  for you too must see the danger ,  --  To feed this foolish malice ? Warren . Warren . Is it foolish ?  --  Not when the profit 's yours , the pleasure mine ;  --  And I , if fortune mocks me not with fancies , Shall find a pleasure in the game I play at , That you may never dream of ! Be you easy  --  There 's little danger ! I 've securities ' Gainst him in you , and in his secret fears , Not less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does it not disguise me ? Osborne . Osborne .

Beware !  --  His genius  --  you yourself confess it , Warren  --  Hath always , when the final issue came , Soar 'd over you triumphant ! Warren . Warren . Oh ! Good night . We 'll meet again to-morrow ! Exit Warren . Osborne . Osborne . He 'll pay for it ! He runs on ruin ! Matthews . Matthews . Not his own , methinks ! Osborne . Osborne . His own , though now it seems not . I 've an instinct That tells me Maurice can not be o'erthrown . Baffled he may be ;  --  you may torture him  --  Deny him his just place and high position , One or more seasons ; but he 'll rise at last , So firmly , that the very hands that struggle To tear him from his throne , will help to build it . There are some men to whom the fates decree Performance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his prospect when I knew him first ? He had no friends ,  --  he had no fellowships , No heedful care of parents  --  no tuition ;  --  He stood alone i ' the world  --  unknown , unhonor 'd  --  Nay , something hated , as I hap to know , For that he had some innate qualities , Of pride , of strength , of soul and character , That would not let him stoop ! In spite of all , He hath struggled through the strife and the obstruction ; Won friends ; won homage ; high position won ; And still hath grown , the more erect and noble , At each assault upon his pride and fortune ! I feel that he must triumph ! Matthews . Matthews . You speak well , The promise of our enemy ! You differ , Somewhat , from Robert Warren ; yet , you know This secret . Osborne . Osborne . Ay  --  as Warren 's ; and I know , The rise of Maurice is his overthrow ! Exeunt . SCENE VI . The interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if supper were just concluded . Maurice and Clarice discovered seated . Maurice balances a spoon upon the cup . Clarice watches him . Clarice . Clarice . You muse , my husband . Maurice , Maurice , without . ' T is with happiness ! Know you , Clarice , that fifteen months have pass 'd Since we were married ? Clarice . Clarice . Is it possible ! I had not thought it ! Maurice . Maurice . Time is wing 'd with pleasure , When that the heart , reposing where it loves , Finds strength for fresher love in faith secure ! The world would seem to smile on me at last ! ' Till we were wedded , such had been my fortune , I question 'd still the sunshine when it came ; And , in its sudden and capricious beauty , Still dreaded something sinister and hostile . But now I feel secure ! With you beside me , A fair , free world before me , and employment , Grateful at once to intellect and feeling , Affording thought due exercise for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , That she foregoes at last her ancient grudges ; And , it may be , despising our ambition , Thus easily satisfied with love and quiet , Turns her sharp arrows on some nobler victim , Whose young audacity offends her pride ! Sure , Clarice , this is happiness . Clarice . Clarice . It is more ! Such happiness as well might task the fancy , To wing with words of sweetest poesy . Maurice . Maurice . Then sing for me . I 'm in the mood for music ; My heart is glad ; my thoughts would wander freely ; Commercing with the indistinct , but sweet . Clarice . Clarice . Nay , Norman , nay : I 'm selfish in my gladness ; You sing not ; but a something more than music Swells in the verse that gathers on your lips ;  --  And this reminds me of the little ballad You promised me ,  --  once half recited me , And fain would have me think your heart conceived it When first it grew to mine ! Maurice . Maurice . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fancy  --  Thoughts born of warmest tastes and pure affections , Which yet had found no name ! I had strange visions Of grace and feminine beauty , such as never The world had shown me living . Then I met thee , And , on the instant , did they take thy image ;  --  And thus I first knew how , and whom , to love ! These fancies did I body forth in verses , As one records a vision of the midnight , That fills his soul with marvels ; and the hour , That brought me first acquainted with thy beauties , Taught me what name to write above my record , Which , until then , had none . Clarice . Clarice . Norman  --  was it mine ? Maurice . Maurice . Thine , only , my beloved one ! Clarice . Clarice . Now , the verses , In thy best manner , Norman . Maurice . Maurice . What ! repeat them ?  --  Wouldst ruin me , Clarice , in public favor ; Sap my distinction , lose me my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And make grave senators and learned statesmen Shake reverend brows in sorrow at my folly ? Clarice . Clarice . Nay , you mock me now ? Maurice . Maurice . Wouldst have a lawyer ,  --  Subtle , and stern , and disputatious , still ,  --  Full of retorts and strange philosophies ; Whose dreams by night are of the close encounter With rival wits and wary adversaries ,  --  Whose thoughts by day are still upon indictments , Flaws , fees , exceptions , old authorities , And worldly arguments , and stubborn juries ,  --  And all the thousand small details that gather , Like strings about the giant Gulliver , Dragging and fettering down to lowly earth The upsoaring mind that else might scale the heavens !  --  Wouldst have him in the vagrancy of fancy , Possess his soul with spells of poesy ; Having no fear that , lurking at his threshold , His neighbor Jones or Jenkins , Smith or Thompson , Some round and fat , but most suspicious client , Bringing great fees ,  --  his heart upon his action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Stands , rooted , with strange horror , as he listens To most ridiculous rhymes , and talk of flowers , Moonbeams , and zephyrs  --  all that staple sweetness , That makes the fancies of young thoughtless bosoms ;  --  When most he hoped to hear of Chose in action , Trespass , assumpsit , action on the case , And other phrases , silly as the rhymester 's ,  --  But that they sound in money , not in music ! No ! No !  --  no poesy ! ' T were loss of client ! Clarice . Clarice . Nay , Norman , but you jest now ! Speak the verses , If need be , in low accents . Maurice . Maurice . Lest Jones or Jenkins Should turn about , possess 'd with holy horror , And seek some other lawyer ! You shall have them ! They are yours , Clarice , for , truly , they embody What still meseem 'd the virtues of your nature ;  --  Tastes , sweet and delicate as evening glories That tend upon the passage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through the twilight , Betoken , as it were , the unknown beauties , That make a happier future in the far . Clarice . Clarice . You describe the verses ! Maurice . Maurice . It needs I should ! They take a mystic tone and character , And ask the key-note . You will hardly like them : Thoughtful , not lyrical , nor passionate , They need that you should pause upon each accent , Or they will lose their due significance ! But , next to the grave folly of such doing , Is the grave preface that still pleads for it . You lead me erring , Clarice , to these trifles  --  You , and the exulting feeling at my heart , That deems this happiness sure !  --  Ha ! That knock ! Knock at the door  --  he starts . Methinks it hath a meaning ! A sharp instinct Tells me that evil at our threshold lurks . Whispers . Clarice . Clarice . Evil , my husband ! Let me open it ! Goes toward the door .

Why , when his hand was fix 'd upon your throat , Did you forbear the weapon ? Warren . Warren . Ask me rather , Why one is still superior to his fellow ; Why one is brave , another impotent ; Why I am feeble just where he is strong ;  --  And why , with will to compass his destruction , My heart still fails me in the final effort !

Peace ! with these passions ! Osborne . Osborne . They will wreck your own ! A something tells me such must be the issue , In any strife with Maurice . Warren . Warren .

Why , that 's well said !  --  Enough for you I must pursue my victims , While hate conceives a hell for him , or passion Dreams still of heaven from her !

It is very likely , I shall not call on you till the last hour , When all is ready for his overthrow !

I will not tell it now ; but wait the moment , When , over all , conspicuous most , he stands , With triumph in his prospect , and his spirit , Exulting in the state he deems secure !

Before we part , ' T is understood we put our troops in motion ; The strife will be a close one ! Blasinghame Hath truly spoken of this new assembly ; It puzzles me to fathom it . This Maurice , Is , questionless , a man of wondrous power ; And , though I much prefer that we should beat him , In a fair wrestle , with the usual agents , Yet this is not so certainly our prospect , As that we should forego this fatal secret , That makes our game secure .

With goods so precious , Should I still venture in the common market , Where Malice stands , with gibe of cruel slander , And Envy lurks in readiness to steal ?  --  When the still shelter of the wilderness , The depth of shadow , the great solitudes , Beckon the heart with promise of their own , Still singing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the serpent could not find the garden ; As if the malicious Hate , by hell engendered , Had not an equal instinct , how to fathom The secret haunt where rapture hopes to hide !

That answer did not please him , Blasinghame . Maurice . Maurice . I 'm sorry for it , sir ; but you 'll believe me , When I assure you , that , in penning it , I never once conceived it necessary To ask what were his tastes . Savage . Savage . Eh , sir : you did not ! Well , let me tell you , those who know him better , Are something curious never to offend him .

You are , sir ! He 's a rough colt , Blasinghame . Maurice . Maurice . Kicks , does he ? Savage . Savage . Kicks , sir ! Why do you say kicks ? Maurice . Maurice . Surely , no act more proper to a colt . Savage . Savage . You are something literal , sir . I 'm glad of it , Since ' twill be easier to be understood ! Well , sir , I come to you from Blasinghame .

Now , as you something seem to know already Of my friend 's mode of managing his case , I need not dwell upon the policy Of stopping all proceedings ere the trial ;  --  In which event I 'm authorized to tell you That Blasinghame forgives your insolent letter , And spares you as a stranger . Maurice . Maurice . Merciful , As he is powerful ! But what if  --  having No such afflicting terror of this person , So terrible to his neighbors , in mine eyes  --  I do reject this liberal grant of mercy . Savage . Savage .

This cold , coarse , selfish , this dishonest woman , Who strove to keep us separate  --  Clarice . Clarice .

If we be welcome , Your lady need not leave us . Brooks . Brooks . That which brings us , Is business of your own , no less than ours ,  --  A grateful business still , we trust , to you  --  Which , doing honor to your worth and virtue , It may be grateful to your wife to hear . Clarice . Clarice . If such its burden , I were glad to linger . Maurice . Maurice . Do so , Clarice !  --  we , gentlemen , are one !

Our friends , sir , conscious of your great endowment , Assured of your just principles and conduct , Your sense of public trust and public duty , Have , with unanimous voice , in a full caucus , Deputed us to bear you their request , That you will be our candidate for Senator , In the next Congress . Brooks . Brooks . And we now entreat you , Suffer this nomination . Maurice . Maurice .

But , though ' t would give me pride to serve our people , In any station where their rights are vested , I have some scruples  --  Mercer . Mercer . Pray deliver them . Maurice . Maurice . To be a candidate in common usage , To take the field and canvass with the voter , To use or sanction fraud  --  to buy with money , Or other bribe , the suffrage of the people  --  Is to dishonor them  --  degrade myself ! Brooks . Brooks . We ask not this . Mercer . Mercer . It needs not . Maurice . Maurice . Hear me , sirs . Our liberties are in the popular vote , Their best security , the popular heart , Their noblest triumph in the popular will ,  --  And this can never be expressed with safety , Until the unbias 'd voice of public judgment , Flinging aside each intermediate agent , Rises , with proper knowledge of its person , And cries  --  " Behold our man ! " Mercer . Mercer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is spoken loudly By thousands in Missouri . Maurice . Maurice . I 'll not deny it  --  If I had one ambition o'er another , One passion , prompting still a search for power , ' T was for a station such as this you show me , Where , standing on the platform of the nation , I might stand up for man ! And so , my studies , The books I read , the maxims I examined ,  --  The laws I conn 'd  --  the models set before me ,  --  All had some eminence like this in view , That , with my training , should the occasion offer , I might be ready still ! But , in my progress ,  --  The better knowledge I have learn 'd from men  --  My doubts increase  --  my scruples grow  --  and now , A sense of duty prompts me to declare , Though each fond idol of the ambitious nature , Be , from its pedestal , forever thrown , I will not seek for office on conditions Adverse to right and manhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Never use wealth or fraud to rise to power ,  --  Never use power itself to keep in power , Nor see in him who favor 'd my ascent , A virtue not his own ! Nor can I offer One tribute to the vulgar vanity ! I will not bow , nor smile , nor deference yield , Where justice still withholds acknowledgment . Mercer . Mercer . We feel the justice of your sentiments . Brooks . Brooks . They 're needful to us now , when all 's corruption . Oh ! could we but inform the popular mind . Maurice . Maurice . This can be done where virtue is the teacher , No students learn so quickly as the people . They have no cliques to foster  --  no professions , Whose narrow boundaries , and scholastic rules , Frown on each novel truth and principle , And , where they can , still hunt them down to ruin . They take a truth in secret to their hearts , And nurse it , till it rises to a law , Thenceforth to live forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people must be taught  --  what should we teach them ? Maurice . Maurice . In politics , to know the proper value Of the high trusts , the sacred privileges , They do confide their statesmen . Show to them , On these depend their liberties and lives , The safety of their children , and the future ! To yield such trusts to smiling sycophants , Who flatter still the voter 's vanity , At the expense of his most precious fortunes , Is to betray the land 's security ; To sell the wealth most precious in our keeping , And , for the thing most worthless , yield to fortune , What fortune can not purchase ! We must teach , That he who cringes meanly for the station , Will meanly hold him in the nation 's eye ; That he who buys the vote will sell his own ;  --  That he , alone , is worthy of the trust , Who , with the faculty to use it nobly , Will never sacrifice his manhood for it . If , with these principles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Our people , through their representatives , Demand my poor abilities ,  --  ' twill glad me , To yield me at their summons . This implies not One effort of my own . You , sirs , may make me A Senator , but not a Candidate . Mercer . Mercer . This suits us well . On your own terms we take you ; We feel with you , a stern necessity To check the abuse of the elective franchise ! Brooks . Brooks . But should we call a meeting to enlighten The people , in respect to public measures You 'll not refuse to meet them ? Maurice . Maurice . No , sir , surely ! I still have done so , upon all occasions , Whene'er a novel principle demanded Discussion . Mercer . Mercer . Thanks , sir ! There will be to-morrow A general meeting at the Capitol , Without respect to party . Maurice . Maurice . I will be there ! Brooks . Brooks . Our quest is satisfied to our desire . Mercer . Mercer . We will no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We shall meet again at court . Exeunt Mercer and Brooks . Clarice , Clarice , eagerly . Husband , you triumph ! There should be no care Upon your forehead now ! Last night , you slept not . Maurice . Maurice . And now , you dream ! But clouds will come , Clarice , Still , with the morrow ! Care that flies the forehead , Still finds a secret shelter in the heart !  --  That timid knock ! Knock without . Clarice . Clarice . It is the widow Pressley . Maurice , Maurice , without . Come in , madam ! Enter Widow Pressley and Kate . Widow . Widow . Oh ! sir , the day has come ! Maurice . Maurice . That brings you back your property , I trust . Widow . Widow . Alas ! sir !

That looks as if he felt some cause of fear ! Widow . Widow . Do not make light of it , I do entreat you ! He 's a most desperate ruffian when he 's thwarted , And has the blood of many on his hands ! ' T was said he left the army for his murders , And in his duels  --  Maurice . Maurice .

What ! your dagger , my Clarice , This pretty Turkish trifle from your bodice , The blade mosaic  --  handle wrought in pearl  --  The sheath of exquisite morocco , dropp 'd In gold and green ! This ornament for masking , Were a frail weapon for a man 's defence ! Nay , keep your dagger , child , I shall not need it . Clarice . Clarice . Be not so confident . Maurice . Maurice .

But this you must do ! Your security Lies in his household only ! He might promise you Your lodging in St. Louis ,  --  board and clothing  --  Ample provision for your state in future  --  But once you free his household of your presence , He whistles you down the wind . No obligation Would bind him to the care of you hereafter ! Mrs. J. Mrs. J. What then ? He 's very stubborn in his spirit ! Warren . Warren . Why , to be sure !

Methinks you need no counsel , madam . Mrs. J. Mrs. J. I see ! ' Twill do ! Warren . Warren . ' T is excellent ! So , Maurice Accepts the Senatorial nomination , Though still his pride revolts at working for it . Well ! He 's not Senator yet .

Now all my sorrows sink into the sea , Since Norman rises to such noble height , The first in his desert and his desire ! Methinks , till now , I doubted of his fortune , Nor ever felt secure from sad mischance ; The gibe of envious tongues , the jeer of malice , The snares of bitter foes , and those dark meshes , That still the treacherous hands of Warren spread ! These do not fright me now , and , though his presence , So apt with coming hither of my aunt , Would seem to shadow forth some evil purpose , Yet can I not esteem it cause of fear , Since it were vain for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband .

If but to teach thee in philosophy !  --  A pebble in the hand of shepherd slinger , Smote , so we learn from Sacred History , The proudest giant in Philistia 's ranks . Clarice . Clarice .

Was it not enough That thou shouldst fail ? Why now  --  Warren . Warren . Enough ! Was every passion to be wreck 'd forever , In that which had denial in thy scorn ? With love denied , was vengeance  --  Clarice . Clarice . Vengeance ! Ha ! Is it his life thou aim'st at now , or mine ? Warren . Warren . Neither ! Clarice . Clarice . What then ?

You know me well  --  enough of me to know , Whate'er my vices or deficiencies , I am no simpleton , but have a cunning That scarce would keep me profitlessly working , Still drawing fruitless waters in a sieve ! That I should press upon your husband 's footsteps , Would prove I still had hope of my revenge ! That I should seek thee in thy secret bower , Would show me still not hopeless of thy love ! Clarice . Clarice . Oh ! vain and insolent man ! Warren . Warren . Hold , a little ! If hopeful still of you , ' t is through the prospect Of vengeance on your husband . Clarice . Clarice .

Catesby , Catesby , interposing . You 've won the Savage heart . It seems that Blasinghame misdoubts your courage , And , as you gave no reference on his challenge , Inclines to violence ; and has bid his lambs Gather about him to behold the sport . Maurice . Maurice . Ah , sport ! Catesby . Catesby . And this in utter scorn of Savage , Who counsell 'd patience till the time is over , Fix 'd by you for your answer . Blasinghame Growls sullen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself advised that you be watchful . Maurice . Maurice . I thank him , and feel grateful to the Savage .

Would you have me swear ? Have I been wrong 'd , and do I hate this Maurice ? Will hate forego the prospect of revenge ? Revenge reject the draught that quenches thirst , And he who long has dream 'd of hidden treasure , Turn from the golden prize , at last his own ?

Ferguson . Good ! Exit Ferguson within . Warren . Warren . Ay , good ! It could not well be better for our purpose .

He will forgive  --  will bless ;  --  and if he does not !  --  Should he recoil from my embrace , and show me The crimson proof of shame upon my garments , And cry , " thy hands , that once were white and spotless , Are red with guilt : "  --  but no  --  I dare not think it .

And when he did discourse of Blasinghame ,  --  His first wrong to the widow  --  his denial Of the poor orphan 's right  --  his violence To those who strove to serve her interests  --  The picture that he painted was so monstrous , That every heart grew cold . 3d Lawyer . 3d Lawyer .

I saw him clutching The panel that he lean 'd on , as for help , While , beaded on his forehead , the big sweat Still gather 'd as it fell ; and , on his lips The stain of red that mingled with the foam , Show 'd how he had even bitten through his lips , In his great agony , and knew it not . 1st Lawyer . 1st Lawyer .

The insuppressible groan , That broke from every breast  --  the gaze of fury That blazed in every eye , when , pointing slowly , And shaking with such dire significance , The hand of Maurice fix 'd on Blasinghame , As still , with holy horror in his accents , He spoke his wonder , that , with guilt so hideous , He still could brave the gaze of man and justice !  --  That groan and glance declared the popular judgment , And such will be the verdict . 2d Lawyer . 2d Lawyer .

This gives us Advantages , which we should rightly use , ' Gainst one so old in practice . Maurice . Maurice . We shall use them :  --  The weapon for example . Mine 's the small sword . Catesby . Catesby . The small sword ! Blasinghame expects the pistol . Maurice . Maurice . We have the right in this and other matters ;  --  I waive the rest ; but this we must insist on . ' T was still my fancy , upward from my boyhood , That , next to lance and spear , the proper weapon For honorable combat is the sword ;  --  Admitting grace of movement and decision , Allowing still discretion to the champion ,  --  Obeying all the changes of his temper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him power to spare or slay at pleasure , Or simply to draw blood and to disarm . Catesby . Catesby . You 've learn 'd to use the weapon ! Maurice . Maurice . But a little ! Some confidence , at least , in eye and motion , Grew from my youthful practice ; and a passage , With the bright rapiers flashing in the sunlight , Was ever such a pleasure to my spirit , That I am half content to risk the duel , For the excitement of the keen dispute ! ' T is long since I have exercised , but nature Hath so endow 'd me , that a play acquired , I never yet have lost . ' T is fortunate , That I have made provision for this practice , And have with me two reeds of Milan steel , In all respects so equal , that a swordsman Would linger long to choose .  --  But here comes Savage ! Enter Savage . Savage . Savage . Save you , gentlemen . Maurice . Maurice . Your hand , sir . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Catesby , Who will discuss with you the needful matters . Catesby .

You can not have it Too soon for Blasinghame . You know the man ! Well ! what the weapon ? Catesby . Catesby . We shall choose the small sword . Savage . Savage . The small sword ! Why  --  ' t is not the usual weapon . Maurice . Maurice . As much as any other . France and Poland  --  Indeed , most countries of the continent , Where'er society allows the duel ,  --  Employ it  --  Catesby . Catesby . And , you know , in Louisiana ?  --  Savage . Savage . The pistol 's the more equal . Catesby . Catesby . Were Blasinghame , Or Maurice , feeble , and the other strong , That were , perhaps , an argument , but  --  Maurice . Maurice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , As I am told your friend is pleased to make it , Somewhat at my expense , then , let me tell you , Cold steel will better try the manly bosom , Than any decent distance with the pop-gun . If I remember , Colonel Blasinghame Hath served in the army , worn the soldier 's weapon , And will not scruple at its use in season . Savage . Savage . Your words decide it : You have the right  --  the small sword be it then . Maurice , Maurice , without . Here are two noble weapons  --  better never Play 'd in the spiral and conflicting circle , Above the head whose life was made the forfeit In the delirious conflict . Take them with you ; Your friend can choose from them , or note the measure Of that which I employ . Savage . Savage . At sunset , then . Catesby . Catesby . The place ?  --  Maurice . Maurice . If you will suffer me  --  there is , By Baynton 's meadow , a sweet bit of copse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ :  --  It leads us to a patch of open lawn , Level , and smooth , and grassy  --  a fit place For one to fight , or sleep on !

You are the coolest person  --  for a person That never was in combat . You will kill him ! Maurice . Maurice . Not if I 'm cool enough ! I fain would spare him , Now , that I see him not . But when before me , And I behold in him the insulting tyrant , That robs the feeble and defies the strong I feel a passionate anger in my heart , That makes me long to trample him to dust !

Forgive me , Heaven , in pity to the weakness That knows not how to ' scape . If it be crime ,  --  The deed , which I have brooded o'er , until My shuddering fancy almost deems it done  --  By which I do avoid the loathlier crime ; Let not the guilt lie heavy on my soul , As solemnly I do profess myself , Most free from evil purpose , and most hating That which meseems the dread necessity That shadows all my fortune ! God have pity , And show the way , that still unseen before me , Lies open for my rescue ! Ha , ' t is he ! Warren , Warren , within the wood . Methinks , Clarice , you come reluctantly .

Wouldst thou the naked heaven behold our pleasures ? Clarice . Clarice . Oh , Heaven ! sustain me !

Retires from sight , beckoning with the papers . Clarice . Clarice . Thither , then ; I follow thee ! Thou dost implore thy fate !

I would have it A ligament of fix 'd , unchanging value , Maintain 'd by strict construction ,  --  neither warp 'd , Nor stretch 'd , nor lopt of its now fair proportions , By the ambitious demagogue or statesman , Who , with the baits of station in their eyes , Still sacrifice the State ! Our policy , Should hold ours as a linkd realm of nations Where each one sits secure , however feeble , And , pointing to the sacred written record , Finds in it her Palladium .

Our industry at liberty for venture , Neither abridged , nor pamper 'd ; and no calling Preferr 'd before another , to the ruin , Or wrong of either . These , sir , are my doctrines ! They are the only doctrines which shall keep us From anarchy , and that worst peril yet , That threatens to dissever , in the tempest , That married harmony of hope with power , Which keeps our starry Union o'er the storm , And , in the sacred bond that links our fortunes , Makes us defy its thunders !  --  Thus , in one ,  --  The foreign despot threatens us in vain . Guizot and Palmerston may fret to see us Grasping the empires which they vainly covet , And stretching forth our trident o'er the seas , In rivalry with Britain .
