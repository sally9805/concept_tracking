Whittier , John Greenleaf , 1807-1892 : TO THE MEMORY OF J. G. C. BRAINARD. from To the Memory of J. G. C. Brainard ( 1849 ) Gone to the land of silence ,  --  to the shadows of the dead ,  --  With the green turf on thy bosom , and the gray stone at thy head ! Hath thy spirit too departed ? Doth it never linger here , When the dew upon the bending flower is falling like a tear ? When the sunshine lights the green earth like the perfect smile of God , Or when the moonlight gladdens , or the pale stars look abroad ? Hast thou lost thy pleasant fellowship with the beautiful of earth , With the green trees , and the quiet streams around thy place of birth ? The wave that wanders seaward ,  --  the tall gray hills , whereon Lingers , as if for sacrifice , the last light of the sun ;  --  The fair of form ,  --  the pure of soul ,  --  the eyes that shone when thou Wast answering to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? Thou art sleeping calmly , Brainard ,  --  but the fame denied thee when Thy way was with the multitude ,  --  the living tide of men , Is burning o'er thy sepulchre ,  --  a holy light and strong , And gifted ones are kneeling there , to breathe thy words of song ,  --  The beautiful and pure of soul ,  --  the lights of Earth 's cold bowers , Are twining on thy funeral stone a coronal of flowers ! Ay , freely hath the tear been given ,  --  and freely hath gone forth The sigh of grief , that one like thee should pass away from Earth ,  --  Yet those who mourn thee , mourn thee not like those to whom is given No soothing hope , no blissful thought , of parted friends in Heaven ,  --  They feel that thou wast summoned to the Christian 's high reward , The everlasting joy of those whose trust is in the Lord .
