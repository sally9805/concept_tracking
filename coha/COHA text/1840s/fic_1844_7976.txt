Hale , Sarah Josepha Buell , 1788-1879 : THE DREAM OF THE CONSUMPTIVE. from The dream of the consumptive ( 1844 ) " They tell me spring is coming , That buds begin to swell ; They bid me trust the warm bright days Will cheer and make me well ; I smile and answer playfully ,  --  I would not crush their hope , But I feel the serpent at my heart Which drinks its life-stream up . " I heard a bird this morning , Its song so blithe and wild , It lulled me in the sweetest dream ,  --  I was again a child ; I bounded o'er the hill-side , Like swallow on the air , While earth seemed bright with new-wrought light From beauty every where . " The trees , like incense bearers , Showered blossoms on my head , And flowers , as sweet as angel 's smiles , Bloomed up on every tread ; The little webs that veiled the grass , Were gemm 'd with diamond dew , And o'er each rough unsightly thing Green life its lustre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merry mountain stream Came singing on  --  I heard my name , And started from my dream ! Oh ! ' t was as though night 's pall should sweep Athwart the morning sky ; As though heaven 's crystal gates should close Before hope 's lifted eye ! " And yet , why should I sorrow ? Though life seems glad and fair , The brightest rose that blooms on earth Conceals some thorns of care ; My foot hath only stirred the flowers , But after years might show A gloomy path and baffled hopes , And pain , and sin , and woe . " My dream was kindly given  --  The spirit 's parting sign , One glimpse of earth in beauty bright , Ere breaks the morn divine . Ah ! see the skies are parting now , A holier light is shed  --  I come , I come ! "  --  and that fair girl Was gathered to the dead !
