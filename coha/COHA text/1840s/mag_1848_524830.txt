txt OUR object in this article will be to present to the American people-at least as widely as our humble labors may reachthe great Practical Issue , as it now stands , in regard to the further prosecution of the Mexican War . We laid the foundation for this , in our article in the last number of the Review , on " the President 's Message , and the War , " and to which we would invite our readers to recur . We think we can not be mistaken in supposing that a crisis has come in our Mexican relations , which , of necessity , must force political men and political parties into an open and undisguised attitude on the one side or the other of the great issue whlch has now arisen in those relations . According to our conception of the clear facts of the case , the President now offers to Congress and the country the project of a war to be prosecuted and maintained , from this time forward , for the following specific object-namely : To COMPEL MExIco TO SUBMIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAUSE , AND WITHOUT AN EQUIVALENT , ( IF THERE COULD BE AN EQUIVALENT POR A FORCED DISMEMBERMENT , ) CERTAIN LARGE DISTRICTS OF COUNTRY BELONGING TO THAT NATION , ALREADY CONQUERED BY OUR ARMS , AND HELD UNDER MILITARY OCCUPATION , AND WHICH ARE ACCURATELY DEFINED AND DESCRIBED FOR OUR BETTER UNDERSTAIjDING OF THE ENTERPRISE TO WHICH WE ARE INVITED . It must be understood that the territory which he now proposes to take or secure , is more extensive than that which he demanded , as his ultimatum , in the conferences of Mr. Trist with the Mexican Commissioners in September last . In those conferences , the President informs us in his late Annual Message , " the boundary of the Rio Grande , and the cession to the United States of New Mexico and Upper California , constituted an ultimatum which our Commissioner was , under no circumstancer , to yield . " The demand now embraces both the Californias . " Early after the commencement of the war , " says the Message , " New Mexico and the Califor VOL.1 . NO . II . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " These provinces are now in our undisputed possession , and have been for many months . " " I am satisfied that they should never be surrendered to Mexico . " The present ultimatum of the President , then , embraces Lower as *well as Upper California . And the whole territory , taken together , comprising parts of three Mexican States , the province of New Mexico and the two Californias , has an area of nearly 700,000 square miles . The whole area of the Mexican empire , since she has lost Texas , is , we believe , less than 1,500,000 square miles ; so that the President proposes to take for the United States a little less than one half of the dominions remaining to that empire . We desire to be understood as taking the ground distinctly , that from the period of the conferences with the Mexican Commissioners , we have , in effect , so far as Congress , *r the country , is called on to become a party to it , a x*w WAR . It wants the formalities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nothing else . To every moral intent , so far as Congress or the country is concerned , it is a new war  --  the monstrous birth of that to which it has succeeded . The war which was carried on up to the period referred to , though the real designs of its author were 4lndoubtedly veiled from the public eye , had certain professed objects in view , upon which all appeals to the country for its sanction and support were constantly based . Mexico had injured our citizens , and had not made reparation , as she was bound to do . " In vindicating our national honor , " says the President , " we seek to obtain redress for the wrongs she has done us , and indemnity for our just demands against her . " It was supposed , of course , that our national honor would be sufficiently vindicated , our wrongs redressed , and the whole end of the war obtained , when we had beaten her forces , with immense odds against us , in every field and fight through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which she was reduced , to give up her pretensions and complaints on account of the annexation of Texas to the United States , to propose a just and proper boundary between our State of Texas and her dominions , and to tender to our acceptance ample indemnity for our claims . All this she did in the conferences with Mr. Trist . We take the President at his word , in what he has so often said , with the most solemn asseverations , up to that period , that the war was not waged for conquest , but for the redress of injuries , and for indemnity for our claims . And when concessions were offered by Mexico which fully met those objects of the war , the war of course ceased to be prosecuted for those objects . The goal was reached , and the enterprise could not be pushed an inch further in that direction . It is true , the submission of Mexico was not accepted ; not because of any defect or deficiency in the concessions and indemnity offered , nor , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of any inadmissible claims on her part by which they were accompanied ; but because , and only because , her submission did not go far enough to satisfy the secret purpose of the President in the war . But as a national war , the country had nothing to do with any secret purpose of the President in prosecuting it . So far as the nation was concerned , it was a war for such objects only as had been avowed , and were understood by the nation . The submission of Mexico fully met and covered these objects , or would have done so if it had been accepted . And when that submission was rejected because it stopped short of that extreme humiliation and sacrifice to which it had been the private purpose of the President to reduce that unhappy country , and when the war , after the conferences , was resumed , and pTosecuted for the single purpose of bringing down Mexico to the point of that extreme humiliation and sacrifice , we say it was , in effect , a new war ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet committed themselves , and a war to which it remains to be seen whether they will ever commit themselves . We must recur to what took place at the conferences in September , referring the reader for further particulars and proofs , to our former article on this subject . Our arnfy had fought its way up to the gates of the capital of Mexico . Here a parley was sounded ; there was a pause in the war ; and Commissioners of Peace came together to tender and receive terms of accommodation . The first thing to be 106 Feb. , // done was to hear the demands of the conquering party . The Project of a Treaty was presented . After consideration , a Counter-Project of a Treaty was offered on the part of Mexico . Then came the Ultimatum of the President ; and upon this , the conferences were broken off  --  the Mexican Commissioners finding this ultimatum inadmissible . It is important that we understand perfectly the substance and effect of this transaction . The first demands of the conqueror , according to the habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than was to be insisted on . The Project presented by Mr. Trist , proposed a line of boundary between the two countries , giving to the United States , besides Texas proper , 1st , the country between the Nueces and the Rio Grande ; 2d , the whole of New Mexico ; 3d , the whole of the two Californias . It asked also for certain privileges of transportation and transit across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec . And , in considei*ation of these demands , if conceded , it proposed three things on the part of the United States : 1st , to renounce all claims for the exp*ises of the war ; 2d , to assume and pay the claims of our own citizens on Mexico ; 3d , to pay to Mexico such additional pecuniary compen2ation for the new territory acquired , as it might be worth , over and above the amount of the claims : The sum offered by Mr. Trist is stated to have been " from fifteen to twenty millions of dollars "  --  the demands of the Commissioner having been first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excluded from his demands Lower California , and the right of way across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec . In tl*ese conferences , then , the final and ultimate demand of the President was that Mexico , besides giving up Texas proper , should cede to the United States , 1st , the country on the left bank of the lower Rio Grande ; 2d , New Mexico ; and 3d , Upper California . And for this he would make the stipulations and payments just mentioned . Now , before this ultimatum was announced , the Mexican Commissioners had presented their Counter-Project of a Treaty ; and it is important that we understand precisely how far Mexico was willing , and offered , to go , in making conces sions to the demands of the President . Their plan of a Treaty proposed a boundary which yielded Texas proper to the Unitcd States ; stipulated to maintain the desert country between the Nueces and the Rio Grande in its uninhabited state , as a national frontier , equally secure and beneficial to both countries ; and ceded to the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of San Francisco . Upon this extension of our limits by the grant of Mexico-far the new territory acquired in California alone would have an area equal to that of four States like New York-it was required that the United States should assume and pay the claims of our citizens on Mexico , and should pay such- further sum of money to Mexico , as the value of our acquisitions should render just . The country on the left bank of the lower Rio Grande and the territory of New Mexico , with the whole of Lower and a part of Upper California , the Commissioners refused to yield . The preservation of their country on the Rio Grande , and of New Mexico , with their loyal inhabitants , and the possessions and property belonging to them , to the Mexican nation , and under its jurisdiction , they declared to be a condition sine qua non of peace . " Mexico , " it was declared , " would not sell her citizens as a herd of catle ! " " Mexico would not put a price on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth ! " Of course , the preservation of these countries to Mexico , was inconsistent with the ultimatum of the President . The conferences , therefore , were broken off , and the war was resumed . It is essential , here , that we do not commit the error of supposing that the negotiations for peace failed on any other ground than that just stated . Nothing else had any influence or tendency towards this result . The President would not permit his Commissioner to make terms of peace with Mexico , because she would not yield so far at least to his demands , as to give Texas a boundary on the Rio Grande , and cede New Mexico to the United States , in addition to the cession of half of Upper California , which she offered to make . This was the sole cause why the conferences were broken off , and the war re , newed . We have not forgotten , that t** 1848. 107 // or three inadmissible propositions of minor importance were inserted in the CounterProject of the Mexican Commissioners ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arresting the negotiations for peace . We appeal to the record in the case . We can not be mistaken . In the last instructions given by the Mexican Government to the Commissioners of that power , dated the day before the CounterProject was presented to Mr. Trist , it was solemnly declared : " In New Mexico , and the few leagues which intervene between the right bank of the Nueces and the left bank of the Bravo , lies the question of peace or war . " Mexico presented no other ultimatum-no other condition sine qua non of peace , butthis . She presented some claims-she offered some propositions-for the consideration and acceptance of the American Commissioner ; but they were not to be insisted on . In reference to these , the Mexican Commissioners , after stating the point on which the conferences were broken off , expressly declare : " The other points touched upon in the Project appeared to us easily settled : such at least was the opinion we formed during the conferences . " It is absurd to suppose that Mexico would have allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her citizens to be sacrificed , her whole army to be cut up and dissipated , and her proud capital to be taken , merely on the claim which she set up to impose import duties over again on foreign goods . which had once paid such duties to the " conqueror , " or on that other claim of damages done to . her citizens by the necessary progress of our arms in the war . The matter on which the parties separated -  --  and the whole matter -- was the ultimatum of the President , demanding the dismemberment of Mexico far beyond what the Government of that country would consent to . There are one or two other points in this connection , about which it is essential we should not fall into error . One of them is this : that the United States had no claim of right-except only what might arise from conquest in war  --  to any part or portion of the territory which the President thus resolved to force from the unwilling hands of its proprietor and sovereign . And this remark is as true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left bank of the Bravo , as it is of New Mexico , on both sides of that river , or of California . We are bold to say , that no man who has given himself the trouble to understand the facts , and who has any just perception of the difference between meum and tuu , n , and between right and wrong , can doubt the truth of this position . We know the contrary has been asserted in high places-even by the President of the United States , over and over again , in the most solemn form-as well as by partisans and politick*ns of high and low degree , all over the land . Nevertheless , the truth is as we have stated itresting on the plainest facts , open and read of all men , and which can not be argued off from imperishable records . The question of title does not rest on argument . There is nothing in the case to argue about . Unless a man may give himself a valid title to his neighbor 's property , by making a deed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States had the slightest claim of title , antecedent to this war , to the country on the left bank of the Rio Grande . The reader who has done us the honor to look into our previous articles in this Journal , in relation to the Mexican war , will not expect , or need , that we should say more on this matter , in this place . Another point to be noticed here , and firmly fixed in our minds , is this : that the terms of peace offered by Mexico in the conferences with Mr. Trist , having *reference to the original subjects of difference or quarrel between the two countries , did not leave an inch of just ground , so far as those subjects of dispute were concerned , for the United States to stand on in renewing and further prosecuting the war . The points of dispute were , 1st . The annexation of Texas to the United States , giving high offence to Mexico , and causing her to put herself in a threatening and war-like attitude . 2d . The question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Congress , by the Act of Annexation , expressly reserved to be settled by negotiation . 3d . The pecuniary claims of our citizens , which the President has constantly insisted on as the cause for prosecuting the war on our part . Now the terms of peace offered by Mexico , em-108 Feb. , // braced each of these points . In regard to the measure of annexation-so wounding to the pride of the Mexican nation , the source of her irritation and anger , and the primal cause , the causa causans , of the war - she proposed a line of demarkation between the two countries , which would have cut ; her off forever from the proper territory of Texas , with its boundary on the Nueces , and thus removed completely this matter as a subject of difference or dispute between the two powers . The course proposed to be taken was particularly judicious , inasmuch as it would have left the United States at liberty to look always to the Congressional Act of Annexation , with the assent of the Republic of Texas , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , Mexico might console her wounded pride with the belief , if she chose , that , at last , we were only quieted in our possession of that country by the generous cession Which she consented to make . In regard to the question of boundary-which we must look at , all the while , as totally distinct from that of annexation-Mexico made an offer which , in its substance and effect , can not fail to be regarded , by all just minds , as fairly meeting this question with a view to its proper adjustment . She did not propose to cede the country between the Na*ces and the Bravo , but she offered to make the desert the actual boundary . What she insisted on was , that she would not abandon her citizens , having their property and rightful residence on the left bank of the latter river , in the State of Tamaulipas ; and that a desert a hundred and twenty miles wide , was a safer and better frontier for both countries , than a narrow stream like the Rio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the unimportant territory on the right bank of the Nueces , and between that river and the desert , where Texas had some small settlements . A line of demarkation in the middle of the desert would , no doubt , have been perfectly acceptable to her . The offer she tendered made such a line in effect the boundary . Finally , in regard to the pecuniary claims of our citizens , Mexico offered the most ample indemnity , by tendering the cession of one half of Upper California , including the best bay and harbor she had on the Pacific . In reference , then , to the original subjects of dispute or quarrel between the two coui : ies , we repeat that the terms of peace offered by Mexico in September last , did not leave an inch of just ground for the United States to stand on in renewing and prosecuting the war . These terms were tendered , as we have every reason to say , in perfect good faith , and with an anxious desire to close the war and restore the relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Instructions from the Minister , Pacheco , to the Mexican Commissioners , or that of the Commissioners to Mr. Trist , accompanying their Counter-Project of a Treaty , without being struck with the marked change of tone , so strikingly different from that which has always , heretofore , characterized the diplomatic correspondence of the Mexican authorities . There is an earnestness , a directness , a manifest sincerity , a nobleness of sentiment , and even a pathos , in the communications we refer'to , which , especially if we take into the account the unhappy and distressing circumstances under which they were written , we venture to say , can not be read by any just-minded person , enemy though he be , without exciting within him a ' strong feeling of sympathy , and a senti- ' ment of disgust towards that cold-blooded , calculating policy of the President , which could spurn the submission Mexico offered to make , and turning haughtily away , deliberately proceed with his measures of blood and devastation to complete her degradation , and reduce her to the last stage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctly observed , that when the war was renewed , after the conferences in September , Mexico had tendered her submission to every just demand which the United States had to make upon her , in reference to every original ground of difference between the two countries ; and from that time , this nation can not justly consider the war as prosecuted for any of those objects which , before that period , were regarded as lending a sufficient sanction to its operations . As a national war , as a war waged for national objects , it had already met its complete accomplishment , only that the President refused to make peace on the terms of submission to which the enemy had been brought . We say , with1848. 109 // out a doubt , that as between us and Mexico , the sense of national justice and honor would have been satisfied , when , Mexico had submitted to our annexation of Texas , had offered us the desert this side the Rio Grande as a frontier , and had tendered us ample indemnity for our pecuniary claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted were altogether his own , in which he has never yet received , as we trust he never will receive , the countenance of Congress or the nation . The war having been begun , Congress made , and hitherto has continued to make , the necessary appropriations for carrying it on . It did not prescribe and limit its operationsor its objects ; but everything was done under the repeated and solemn pledges made by the President , that peace should be made as soon as terms could be obtained to satisfy the honor and justice of the country-pledges constantly- accompanied with the most explicit disclaimers of any purpose to turn the war into one of conquest and dismemberment . We say , with perfect confidence in the indisputable truth of what we assert , that neither Congress nor the country entered into this war with any purpose of conquest and dismemberment . Conquest has not been the object , nor one of the objects , which Congress  --  the only war-making power in this countryZ***has hadin view . It never has been its purpose to demand , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mexico should cede to the United States the Californias , or New Mexico , or even the belt of country on the left bank of the Rio Grande , or any other territories whatever , properly belonging to her , unless it might be , at her own option , such moderate portion , convenient both to her and to us , as might suffice for indemnity for her indebtedness to our citizens . Congress has been a party to the war only to obtain a peace on just terms , having special reference to the particular m*itters in dispute between the two powers . It was no party to a war for the conquest and dismemberment of Mexico , such as the war became , expressly and exclusively , after the conferences in September , and which has made it , as we insist , virtually a new war , of which the President is the sole author , and thus far the sole prosecutor . The President was the sole suthor of the war in the beginning ; but Congress became a party to it by a formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry it on . Still , however , there was a virtual limitation and restriction , in the employment of the means placed in the hands of the Executive by Congress for the war , in regard to the objects for which it should be prosecuted . And the Presidei*t had no more right to undertake , after these objects had been attained , or were within his reach , to employ the means in his hands , and prosecute the war against Mexico , for other objects , not within the well understood designs of Congress , than he had to turn the arms of the United States entirely in some new direction , and find or make some new enemy to conquer , in some other quarter of the world . He knew that Congress had never authorized a war of conquest and di*nemberment to be carried on against Mexico ; and when he contrived and undertook to carry on such a war , he set himself above his office , and above the Constitution , and trampled every moral and every political obligation belonging to his station , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the very time when he was giving Congress and the country to understand , by his repeated disclaimers , that he had no purpose of conquest in the conduct of the war , was all the while nourishing this design ; and he gave his Commissioner , Mr. Trist , positive instructions not to make peace with Mexico , unless she would consent to dismemberment , exactly on his own terms . His ultimatum embraced territory , having an aggregate area of more than 625,000 square miles . For this territory he was willing to pay twenty millions of dollars , besides the amount of the indebtedness of Mexico to our citizens , which , by an exaggerated estimate , might be five millions . By his own computation , then , one fifth part of the territory he demanded as his ultimatum , or 125,000 square miles , was enough for indemnity  --  and much more than this was offered to him by Mexico for the sake of peace  --  and the residue , 500 ,  - -  000 square miles of Mexican territory , more than equal to ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded to be delivered up to the United States , on a forced sale , without any the remotest 110 Feb. , // reference to indemnity , or to anything else that had ever been set up or suggested as a cause or pretence for the war . And it was upon this precise demand of dismemberment , and because it was not submitted to by Mexico , that the war was resumed . But there is a wide difference to be taken notice of here , between the terms of peace offered to Mexico by the President at the conferences in September , and the objects he proposes now to accomplish by the war , as explained in his late annual Message , since those terms were rejected . The contumacy of Mexico on that occasion effectually closed the door 4o the grace and clemency of the President . He has now greatly advanced his demands , which , *n truth , partake very little of the moderation which characterized his ultimatum at the conferences . Then , with a boundary on the Rio Grande , and the territory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California . Now , he must have Lower California also . Then , if Mexico had agreed with her adversary while she was in the way with him , he was content to bear his own expenses of the war , and pay her besides twenty millions of dollars for the territory he demanded , as the value of the cession , over and above indemnity . Now , he will have more territory still , and he will take possession avowedly as C oxQUEROR , and there is no longer any talk or pretence of purchase and payment . On the 6th of September , 125,000 square miles of territory might have been enough to take in the name of indemnity for the claims of our citizens , if only Mexico had consented to sell us at the same time 500,000 square miles more , for twenty millions of dollars . But things have changed since that day ; and now the President demands something less than 700,000 square miles of territory , wholly in the name of indemnity . In September , the United States would have paid their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay them by indemnity in territory . See with what a just sense of truth , innocence and injury , and with what firmness of purpose and conscious dignity , this change in the policy and demands of the President is announce d !  - -  we quote from the late Message ? * Since the liberal proposition of the United States was authorized to be made in April last , large expenditures have been incurred , and the precious blood of many of our patriotic citizens has been shed in the prosecution of the war . This consideration , and the obstinate perseverance of Mexico in protracting the war , must influence the terms of peace which it may be deemed proper hereafter to accept . Our arms having been everywhere victorious , having subjected to our military occupation a large portion of the enemy 's country , including his capital , and negotiations for peace having failed , the important questions arise-in what manner the war ought to be prosecuted ? and what should be our future policy ? I can not doubt that we should secure and render available , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with this view , we should ho*d and occupy by our naval and military forces , all the ports , towns , cities and provinces now in our occupation , or which may hereafter fall into our possession. * ' * * * * " Had the government of Mexico acceded to the equitable and libei:al terms proposed , that mode of adjustment would have been preferred . Mexico having declined to do this , and failed to offer any other terms which could be accepted by the United States , the national honor , no less than the pubtic interests , requires that the war should be prosecuted with increased energy and power , until a just and satisfactory peace can be obtained . In the mean time , as Mexico refuses all indemnity ! ! we should adopt measures to indemnify ourselves , by appropriuting permanently a portion of her territory . Early after the commencement of the war , New Mexico and the Californias were taken possession of by our forces . * * * * These provinces are now in our undisputed occupation , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am satisfied that they should never be surrendered to Mexico . Should Congress concur with me in this opinion , and that they should be retained by the United States as indemnity ! I can perceive no gcod reason why the civil jurisdiction and laws of the United States should not at once be extended over them . To wait for a trea* of peace , such as we are willing to make , by so ich our relations towards them would not be chcnged , can not be good policy . * * * * Should Congress , therefore , determine to hold these provinces permanently , and that they shall hereafter be considered as constituent parts of our Own country , the early establishment of territorial governments over them , will be important . * * * And I recommend that such territorial governments be established . " So much of the Message of the President as we have just quoted , may be read as setting forth the avowed and ostensible object of the war , since the conferences in September . We shall see , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1848 111 // and atrocious as it is , is by no means comprehensive enough to embrace the whole designs of the President . At least he entertains certain speculative purposes , which , if they should ever be realized , would make the design he has deigned to disclose appear tame indeed . But first let us endeavor to settle exactly in our minds the avowed object for which the war is now to be prosecuted , since the failure of the negotiations in September , and the terms upon which alone peace is to be made with Mexico-provided the President shall find himself sustained by Congress , as well in the object avowed by ' him as in the mode of conducting operations and the means of carrying them on . The plain proposition presented by the President to Congress is this : That we now proceed at once to appropriate permanently to the United States , in full property and sovereignty. , and never to be surrendered , the province of New Mexico and both the Californias , holding , besides , the country on the left bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican States of Tamaulipas , Coahuila and Chihuahua , for our State of Texas . This is the proposal . New Mexico and the Californias are the countries he refers to , as " the cONQUEsTs which we have already made , " and which . we are now to " secure and render available . " By a rule of the Law of Nations , perfectly well settled , the title which a conqueror acquires in war to real property , or territory , amounts to no more than a mere temporary right of possession , until confirmed by a treaty of peace . The title may be confirmed in either of two ways in a treaty : by an actual cession to the conqueror , or by the silence of the treaty in regard to the property or territory , the conqueror at the time holding the possession . This last is the rule of uti possidetis , and gives as valid and complete a title as actual cession . In one of these two modes every title to real or fixed property , begun in conquest , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere usufruct ; the conqueror can not sell and give an absolute title ; for , if it should happen , after all , in the chances of war , that peace shpuld come-as come it must , some time or other-without bringing to the conqueror confirmation of his title , the right of the original proprietor and sovereign , which is called his right or benefit of postliminy , becomes paramount , and the purchaser loses his title . When , therefore , the President proposes to Congress that the United States should proceed at once to appropriate to themselves , permanently , the provinces already conquered in war , in full property and sovereignty , and to establish provincial or territorial governments over them , he means to , and he does , in fact , lay down this fundamental position , as the unalterable basis on which our national policy in regard to this war shall rest , now and forever hereafter That peace shall never be made with Mexico until she shall consent to give up all claim or pretension to these conquered countries . le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into that full and complete proprietorship and sovereignty , which we &amp;n only have in reality , by the law of nations , under a treaty of peace . " To wait for a treaty of peace , " he says , " such as we are willing to make , by which our relatjons towards them these territories would not be changed , can not be good policy . " lie proposes an ultimatum , a condition sine qua non of peace , not resting in the mere will of the President , or of the treaty-making power  --  the President and Senate-which possibly , some day or other , might be yielded , but resting in the solemn action of the whole government , and in the recorded will of the nation , and placed beyond the possibility of recall . He proposes to hazard everything , and dare everything , for this object of the war . In his desperation , on account of the mazes of perplexity into which this war of his own seeking and making has brought the country , he proposes to plunge headlong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , or the end of which , neither his own nor any mortal eye may discover . The first conqueror of Mexico chose to cut off all possibility of retreat for his companions in arms , by destroying the ships which had brought them to its shores . The second conqueror of Mexico , more than three centuries in advance of the other in point of time-how much in advance of the other in point of civilization and Christian principle let history answer-proposes to imitate this example 112 Feb. , // and adopt a measure which shall cut off this country from the possibility of retreat from this war , till Mexico shall submit to dismemberment to the extent of only a little less than one half of her empire . When the war would end , after such a measure should once be adopted , it is not within any man 's wisdom to tell ; it would end only , we believe , with the utter extinction of her national existence  --  or of ours . Of all the races of men on this globe , not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to fight for country and nationality ; not one has shown a will so utterly incapable of being broken and subdued , by whatever ca'lamity and oppression however long continued , and brought under the yoke or rule of a conqueror , as this same GothoSpanish race with which we are dealing in Mexico . That the President does not dare to hope for any ready submission of Mexico to his present ult*atum , though seeking to put it out of the power of this country to retreat from this position , is quite apparent from other parts of the Message . How he contemplates dealing with the case in such an event , is not left without some intelligent indication , which shows to our own mind , clearly enough , the desperate infatuation and madness of folly in which he is indulging . The proposition of the President to Congress speaks , as we have said , of New Mexico and the Californias as " the CONQUESTS which we have already made ; " and he asks Congress to proceed at once to render these conquests secure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it impossible for us ever to surrender them , except in the way in which we have acquired them-namely , as conquests , to some superior power . To this complexion , then , in the face of all the solemn disclaimers of the President , has this war come at last . It turns out to be a war of conquest . It was called a war for the vindication of our honor , and the redress of grievances . Mexico had failed to pay some three or five millions of dollars which she owed our citizens , and the war has been prosecuted to compel her to make payment . Under two allegations , both grossly and notoriously false in fact : first , that Mexico could never pay this debt in money , and , therefore , must give us territory ; and next , that she had refused to give us any indemnity whatever for the debt ; the President now declares that we must regard certain vast territories of that power , already overrun by our arms , as cONQUEsTs , and proceed to render them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already conquered , and subdued by our arms , and are now held in our military occupation , and the object of the war henceforward must be , to secure these conquests , and render them permanent and available . At the conferences in September , an effort was made to turn this conquest into an apparent purchase . It failed , and now the transaction is acknowledged as a conquest . It was a conquest all the while , but it was intended to soften its features , by forcing Mexico to yield it in the way of a sale and for a consideration in money . The trick failed , and nothing was left but to call it by its right name . It is true , the President still manifests his inveterate disposition to put a disguise on the transaction . In the same paper , and almost in the same breath , in which he refers to the territories taken and occupied by our forces as " conquests , " and calls upon Congress to secure and make them permanent us suck , he ventures to quote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the war has not been waged with a view to conquest , " but " with a view to obtain an honorable peace , and thereby secure ample indemnity for the expenses of the war , as well as to our much injured citizens who hold large pecuniary demands against Mexico . " And to this he now adds : " Such , in my judgment , continues to be the true policy , indeed , the only policy which will probably secure a permanent peace . " The juggle of indemnity is still kept up . The . war has been waged for indemnity , and not for conquest ; and in order to give the case some faint plausibility , he continues to intimate-in the face of demonstrable facts - that the war has been prosecuted to obtain indemnity " for the expenses of the war , " as well as for the claims of our citizens . He would have the country believe that the expenses of the war have constituted one of his demands against Mexico ; that instead of claiming only a debt of three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a hundred millions more as due from Mexico on account of the cost of the war . But not one word of this is true . lie made no demand through Mr. Trist for these expenses . Mr. Trist expressly renounced any such claim or pretension in the Project of a Treaty he presented . The President was ready to stipulate for the payment of our citizens by our own government , and for the payment to Mexico of twenty millions more , if Mexico would sanction and confirm our conquest of New Mexico and Upper California , by a cession and a treaty of peace , and the country should pay its own expenses of the war . It is not true , then , that the war was waged to obtain indemnity for these expenses , and the President 's own Project of a treaty tendered to Mexico , is proof positiv* to the contrary . There stands the luminous record of that transaction -- the conferences in September  --  and there it will stand forever , to confound all attempts that have been made , or shall be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . The only indemnity for which the war could be said , with any semblance of truth , to h ye been waged , was indemnity for a debt of three or five millions of dollars . No other indemnity was asked or sought for by the President ; and even this indemnity was tendered by A'Iexico , and was rijected by the President - affording a clear demonstration that it was not indemnity , at all , in any shape , not even indemnity for our just claims , which constituted the real object of the war from the beginning . The real object was the acquisition of territory . Hence , the expeditions so promptly set on foot , after the war broke out , to Santa F* and to California , with orders which clearly indicated , from the very first , the settled purpose of the President , not merely that those provinces should be conquered and held by military occupation , as a means of indueing Mexico to come to just terms of accommodation with us , but that , being conquered , " they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design from the beginning , often boldly denied , all along attempted , awkwardly enough , to be disguised , and finally admitted and avowed . Up to the time of the conferences in September , the President flattered himself that Mexico , in her extremity and distress , or somebody or other in Mexico , by a liberal appliance of the money of this nation , would be brought to act as a party to a compact , by which the acquisition of territory he had resolved to make , instead of standing before the country and the world as a naked conquest , should put on the semblance of a free bargain of sale and purchase . In this he was disappointed , because the government of that country would not consent " to sell Mexican citizens as a herd of cattle , " or " put a price on the attachment of men to the land that gave them birth . " And this has brought him to his confession and his final resolution . He now recommends to Congress to consider and adopt New Mexico and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrendered , but forthwith secured and rendered permanent by complete and unequivocal acts of proprietorship and sqvereignty . Since Mexico refused to give us " indemnity , " by selling us a portion of these countries for twenty millions of dollars , we must now " adopt measures to indemnify ourselves " by a permanent appropriation of the whole to our own use , without money and without price ! In other words , and in more truthful language , he proposes that Congress shall adopt the war , as it presents itself to the country since his rejection of the overtures of peace by Mexico , and her offers of ample indemnity for our pecuniary claims , with the unalterable resolution to hold New Mexico and both the Californins - besides the country on the left bank of the lower Rio Grande-as conquered territory , and " constituent parts of our own country , " in defiance of Mexico , and without any compensation to her therefor , but in the abused name of indemnity , and never to make peace with her until she consents to this humiliation and dismemberment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Congress and the country . We regard it as a new issue , on which Congress must be deemed free to act , notwithstanding its committal to the support of the war previous to the presenting of this issue . We have said that the war , from the period of its renewal after the conferences in September , was in effect a new war : Not because there was not all the while a wicked purpose of conquest and 114 Feb. , // dismemberment towards Mexico on the part of the President , but because Congress was in no way to be deemed to have been committed to such a purpose . The war which Congress bad recognized and adopted , and for the support of which it had voted supplies of men and money , was not , so far as Congress was a party to it , a war for conquest in any sense , but is to be deemed to have been prosecuted solely for the purpose of compelling Mexico to come to just terms of accommodation with us ; to cease her hostility to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a just and proper boundary between Texas and her dominions ; and to pay or secure to us , or give us full indemnity for , the demands of our citizens on her justice . It was a war , so far as Congress or the country was a party to it , which should have ceased from the hour that Mexico was brought to propose , or accede to , these terms of accommodation . That point was carried-that object of the war was fully gained , as we think we have demonstrated in our former article on the Message . Mexico was ready to give up Texas ; to make the desert between the Nueces and the Rio Grande the boundary ; and to give us one half of Upper California and the port of San Francisco , for indemnity for our claims . With this the war which Congress was waging against Mexico should have ceased . It was the fault of the President , and not of Mexico , that it did not cease . He set up new claims and pretensions , to which Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismemberment of that country-an object of the war to which Congress had given no sanction-which Mexico could not be purchased with money to submit to  --  and for which , on his own responsibility , he caused the war to be renewed and prosecuted . And this war it is-a war having now for its precise object the consummation of the President 's avowed purpose of conquering and dismembering Mexico-in support of which the President invites and demands the co-operation of Congress . What will Congress do on this momentous Issue ? How will Whig Senators and a Whig House of Representatives answer the call and demand which the President now makes upon them ? Will they recognize and adopt this war for the conquest and dismemberment of Mexico ? The Issue becomes a practical one , since the question must be met by official action . One way or the other it must be decided , and the decision must stand out before the country in official conduct . The object of the war is clearly set forth in the President 's Message-to secure a boundary on the Rio Grande @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that river , and the two Californias , by conquest ; and , in general terms , the mode or plan of military operations , by which these conquests are to be secured , is set forth* " I can not doubt , " says the President , " that we should secure and render available the conquests which we have already made ; and that , with this view , we should hold and occupy , by our naval and military forces , all the ports , towns , cities and provinces now in our occupation , or which may hereafter fall into our possession . *** Besides New Mexico and the Californias , there are other Mexican provinces which have been reduced to our possession by conquest . *** They should continue to be held as a means of coercing Mexico to ac - cede to just terms of peace . *** What final disposition it may be proper to make of them must depend on the future progress of the war , and the course which Mexico may think proper hereafter to pursue . " The plan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President assures us , as an end , but as a means . " It has never been contemplated by me , as an object of the war , to make a permanent conquest of the Republic of Mexico , or to annihilate her separate existence a an independent nation . " Still he recommends : 1st . That Congress shall permanently appropriate to the United States forthwith , and never to be surrendered , the provinces of New Mexico and the Californias-nearly one-half of the country within the territorial limits of the Mexican empire . 2d . That we should hold on to all the other provinces , ports , cities and places already in our occupation . 3d . That we should prosecute the war " with increased energy and power in the vital parts of the enemy 's country , " ... - of course , to conquer as far as possible the remaining portions of that country , to be held as the rest , " as a means of coercing Mexico to 1848. 115 // accede to just terms of peace . " What he means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundantly in the Message . If ever Mexico makes peace with us , it must be by consenting to dismemberment , at least to the extent of losing New Mexico and the two Californias . " What final disposition it may be proper to make of the rest of our conquests must depend on the future progress of the war , and the course which Mexico may think proper to pursue ! " The meaning of all this , we say , is plain enough . The President proposes , as the immediate and first object of the war , recommenced by his orders after the conferences in September , to secure to the United States the permanent conquest and possession of New Mexico and the Californias ; and he proposes as a means thereto , so far as may be found practicable , the entire conquest and complete subjugation of the whole Mexican country  --  to be surrendered : or held , in whole or in part , hereafter , according as " the future progress of the war , and the course which Mexico may think proper to pursue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The recommendations of the Secretary of War and of the President , and the measures instituted thereupon in the Senate , by the friends of the Executive , for raising thirty new re , iments of men-te*i regiments of regulars , and twenty regiments of volunteers-in addition to the large force already in the field , and the further force which may be brought into the field under existing laws  --  and all this for the avowed purpose of widening and extending our military operations and conquests in Mexico-show demonstrably that we are not mistaken when we say , that the grand design of the President is , whether as a means or an end , or let it lead to what it may , to subjugate all Mexico by the power of our arms , as far as it may be found practicable to do so . A few days ago , in debate in the Senate on this subject , General Cass , Chairman of the War Committee , presented a very meagre extract from a letter which he said the Government had received from General Scott , containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to carry into effect the plan of operations which is recommended by the Secretary of War . " This extract not only furnishes the estimate spo ken of , but sh6ws plainly enough what the Secretary 's " plan of operations " is designed to accomplish in the subjugation of all Mexico " Augment this army to fifty thousand men , to enable them to occupy , at the same time , nearly all the State Capitals and other principal cities ; to drive guerrilla and other robbing parties from the great highways of trade ; to seize into our hands all the ordinary revenues of the country , internal as well as external , for the support of the occupation , and to keep the Central Government in constant motion and alarm , until constrained to sue for peace . " Never was there in so few words , a more complete picture of a subjugated country than that presented in this brief extract , as what should be accomplished and witnessed in Mexico , if General Scott should be furnished with the requisite army , and instructed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the President is now demanding of Congress is , that it shall adopt and sanction this plan of operations , and give him the means of carrying it into immediate execution . What shall happen when Mexico shall thus be subjugated ; when we have permanently appropriated to ourselves New Mexico and the Californins , to secure which is the first avowed object of this complete subjugation ; and when " nenrly all the State Capitals and other principal cities " shall be conquered and held under our military occupation and authority ; in short , when Mexico , as a country , shall be conquered and subjugated , all her revenues , internal and external , seized into our hands , her Central Government dissolved , or finding no resting place , and the whole empire , indeed , brought under the rule of the military power of this Government-what shalV happen then , the President professes not to be able to tell . After helping himself to those countries which are his present ultimatum , it will depend on " the future progress of the war , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " what disposition shall be made of the residue of . the empire . Verily , it was no abstraction this time , with which Mr. Calhoun was dealing , when , recently , he submitted certain Resolutions in the Senate , and sounded an alarm to the country , lest we should shortly find ourselves , with or without any 116 Feb. , // such purpose , with the Mexican empire on our hands , and the awful question of its disposal-how to hold it , or how to get rid of it  --  to be met and settled . It was no abstraction which declared , in the language of his second resolution , " That no line of policy in the further prosecution of this war should be adopted , which may lead to consequences so disastrous " There are now in Mexico , and on their way there , according to official returns , of land forces , about 45,700 men . To these are to be added , * , OO0 seamen and marines , employed in the same service . In addition to this force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise a further force of 7,000 enlisted soldiers , and l2 , *00 volunteers for the war . Here is an aggregate force of 70,000 men either in the field , or authorized to be called there immediately . And now the President is asking for authority to raise an additional force of 30,000 men ! What part of the motive for this extraordinary demand is to be set down to a desire and determination to make the patronage of the war power in his hands , support the war as long as he chooses to carry it on , and for whatever objects of conquest and robbery , we can not tell , nor shall we now stop to inquire . We look at this demand as it bears directly on the great question , now brought home to the conscience of every member of the American Congress : Shall this war of the President 's , renewed under his orders after just and honorable terms of peace had been tendered by Mexico  --  a war , having for its avowed object the conquest and dismemberment of Mexico , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has nothing to do with it , by a plan of military operations which contemplates the complete subjugation of that empire-shall this war of the President 's be adopted and sanctioned by Congress , which is the sole war-making power of this Government ? For ourselves we shall wait , with confidence , yet not without deep solicitude , for the result of the deliberations of Congress on this momentous question . We can not but flatter ourselves that the President is now to be arrested in his mad career ; that Congress , under the lead of wise and patriotic counsels , will now take its stand on those high duties imposed on it by the Constitution , and save the country from the degradation and ruin which the President and his infatuated party are certainly preparing for it . When the House of Representatives shall be called on for supplies of men and money for this war , we look for an answer from the majority of that body worthy of their noble principles , and of the high trust committed to them . It is not for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this regard . They will find a way of doing all their duty  --  to our gallant army in Mexico  --  to the country engaged in war with a foreign power-until a peace , really just and honorable to both parties , shall be effected ; they will find a way of doing this , without making themselves , or allowing Congress to make itself , a party to a flagrant war of conquest and robbery , waged upon a weak and almost defenceless power . They will take a fit occasion to announce , by some authoritative action , on the part of that body with whom all supplies must originate , for what objects of the war they will , and for what objects they will not , give the President the means of carrying it on . We can not entertain a doubt that we speak the common sentiment of the Whig party in Congress and throughout the country , when we say , that in the offers made by the Mexican Commissioners to Mr. Trist in September last , a basis was proposed for a peace between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have resulted in a treaty of peace , and which would have resulted in such a treaty , free from every exceptionable condition or demand on the part of Mexico , and entirely acceptable to the people of the United States , if the President had not set up an impertinent and unjustifiable demand , as an ultimatum , for the further dismemberment of Mexico , after she had tendered a cession of territory far exceeding in value the demands he made upon her for indemnity . Such , - as we believe , being the settled and abiding sentiment of the Whigs in Congress , they will support the war just so far as it may be necessary to bring Mexico to make a peace with us on terms like these , or on terms equally moderate and just ; but they will support no war for the conquest and subjugation of the Mexican nation , or for the destruction , dismemberment or robbery of the Mexican empire .
